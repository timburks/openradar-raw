    description: "When editing a contenteditable HTML element in WKWebView with a moderate amount of content, adding emoji symbols from the keyboard causes a lot of input lag and the whole UI thread starts to lock up and input lags becomes very intense rendering the input useless. The input lags seems to increase with the size of the content of the contenteditable element.\r\n\r\nVideo of bug in question: https://twitter.com/joshyhargreaves/status/875821102567706624\r\nGithub repo with sample project: https://github.com/joshyhargreaves/wkwebview-slow-emoji"
