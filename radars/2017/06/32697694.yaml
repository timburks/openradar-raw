    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\r\n\r\nThe following description will be best understood if viewed in a monospaced font and with line wrapping.\r\n\r\nimport Cocoa\r\n\r\nclass MyView: NSView {\r\n\r\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\r\n        super.init(coder: coder)\r\n        /*                â†‘\r\n         I should be able to refactor/rename this variable. I'm talking about the identifier `coder` *after* the colon.\r\n\r\n         The refactorizer doesn't let me rename it. I assume it recognizes that this is name is also used as the argument label, and that the argument label is inherited from NSView's declaration of this method. The argument label cannot be changed, because then this method would no longer override its superclass's method.\r\n\r\n         The refactorifier should therefore rewrite the method declaration to include my desired parameter name separately.\r\n\r\n         So, for example, if I ask to rename the variable to `decoder`, the refactorator should change the method declaration to:\r\n\r\n             required init?(coder decoder: NSCoder)\r\n\r\n         I also believe NSView's declaration of this method should just specify a parameter name of `decoder` in the first place. I will file a separate report for that. My request here is much more general, so please don't just punt this report over to AppKit.\r\n         */\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h) / 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
