    description: "Summary:\r\nFile coordination appears to fail silently without any warning (or assertions) when passing it an URL that is not a file URL (ifFileURL == NO). This can happen if the URL is say mistakenly initialized using [NSURL URLWithString:documentPath] instead of using [NSURL fileURLWithPath:documentPath]. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the provided example and follow the on screen instructions to reproduce the issue. See the commented section in ViewController.m to change the behavior of the example. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSFileCoordinator and NSFilePresenter would warn by logging in the console (or even assert?) is they receive URLs that they do not support. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSFileCoordinator and NSFilePresenter fail silently. Not file coordination is apparently performed (there is a noticeable thread race in the example) and no file coordination update cals are invoked. At the same the file operations can succeed normally (the example uses NSFileHandle to write data).  \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10, 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nURLWithString:\n\n(lldb) p documentURL\n(NSURL *) $1 = 0x0000600000091300 @\"/Users/matej/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/C50BB0A5-06ED-4802-950F-F3457ED7579D/data/Containers/Data/Application/B68CE42E-618F-48B5-94C1-C18549901518/Documents/file.txt\"\n\nfileURLWithPath:\n\n(lldb) p documentURL\n(NSURL *) $0 = 0x00006000000b3e00 @\"file:///Users/matej/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/C50BB0A5-06ED-4802-950F-F3457ED7579D/data/Containers/Data/Application/E46DDF1F-E1D2-4690-87AD-5AE55D51DE96/Documents/file.txt\""
