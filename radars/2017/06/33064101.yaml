    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading two files to a bug report as two separate comments, the bug list progress bar will flicker between the two upload percentages. See the attached screen recording.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new bug report.\r\n2. Submit it.\r\n3. Add a comment and select a large file, like a sysdiagnose. Submit it so the upload starts.\r\n4. Add another comment to the same bug report. Submit it as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the bug listing on the left, the combined, computed total upload progress % should show.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIn the bug listing on the left, both individual file uploads show up and flicker alternatingly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI had to add a second comment to a bug report in order to have my second sysdiagnose uploaded, since 1 of the 2 files in my original comment had failed 'Upload Error', but the other one resumed, as you can see in the screencast attached."
