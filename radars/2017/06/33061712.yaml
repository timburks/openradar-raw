    description: "Area:\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAttached:\r\n1. a project that can reproduce the issue, though it takes a few tries.\r\n2. sysdiagnose logs taken within a minute of the bug happening\r\n\r\nIn the following setup, seekToPosition occasionally jumps to the wrong place and plays silent audio until it catches up to where it should have been.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- This is reproducible even with the toleranceAfter:toleranceBefore: version of the method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Play an MP3 in AVQueuePlayer.\r\n- Set the time domain algorithm at a speed > 1.0x\r\n- With an audio tap applied, but it doesn't have to do anything but return the same samples it's given.\r\n- On device, with wired headphones connected.\r\n- Listen to the audio on the headphones.\r\n\r\nYou may need to try these steps a few times for the repro.. I'm usually able to see one reproduction of the bug for every 5→10 minutes of testing. If it's not happening, try restarting the app.\r\n1. Play the audio for a few minutes\r\n2. Skip back 30s.\r\n3. Repeat\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio should play continuously and skip back 30s action should skip back ~30s\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAudio occasionally jumps back 15-30s further than it should and plays silence until it catches up to the correct skip position.\r\n\r\nLogs from attached example project when the bug happens, with notes in brackets\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1413.004114134   <Playing normally>\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1414.007139195\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1415.004220812\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1416.004286289\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1417.004487639\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1418.004845334\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1419.004279152\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1420.004413974\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1421.026221867\r\n\U0001F64B‍ Jump To Position: 1391.504362935   <Seek requested>\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1421.512801041\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1391.504362935   <Momentarily plays at the correct position>\r\n\U0001F3C0 Jumped To 1391.504362935\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1374.64510314    <Now it has snapped back an additional 17s>\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1374.646273389   <Silence playing>\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1375.004520828\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1376.00353113\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1377.004114683\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1378.004356974\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1379.004073539\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1380.003804354\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1381.003753629\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1382.003896308\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1383.004547355\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1384.004591256\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1385.003892891\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1386.004328898\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1387.004366748\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1388.003907351\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1389.004090953\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1390.004319441\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1391.003856582   \r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1392.004097223  <Audio kicks in again as we reach the point we were supposed to be at>\r\n\U0001F550 Current Position: 1393.004452206\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe first noticed this bug after adding an audioTap to our app.\r\n\r\nNote that all the steps above matter, including wired headphones — we weren't able to recreate it over other audio routes."
