    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nContrary to what its prototype and documentation state, +[NSHTTPURLResponse localizedStringForStatusCode:] only returns messages in English. All localized messages exist in the CFNetwork bundle, which suggests the implementation is incorrect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall for example [NSHTTPURLResponse localizedStringForStatusCode:502] on a device whose language has been set to French.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe returned value is \"passerelle incorrecte\".\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe returned value is \"bad gateway\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iOS 9.3 and above, iOS 11 beta 1 included.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll strings have been already properly localized and are available from the CFNetwork bundle, though. Currently, we can therefore fix the implementation by using the value in English returned by +localizedStringForStatusCode: as localization key to retrieve the properly localized variant:\r\n\r\n+ (NSString *)workaround_localizedStringForStatusCode:(NSInteger)statusCode\r\n{\r\n    NSString *localizationKey = [NSHTTPURLResponse localizedStringForStatusCode:statusCode];\r\n    NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:@\"com.apple.CFNetwork\"];\r\n    return [bundle localizedStringForKey:localizationKey value:localizationKey table:nil];\r\n}"
