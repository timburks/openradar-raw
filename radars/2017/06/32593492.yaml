    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new \"Actions\" popover that appears after cmd+clicking a symbol in Swift, Objective-C, C or C++ source file is superb. However, some programmers like me prefer to work only with keyboard (less jumping between keyboard and mouse saves time, thus making us more productive).\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm asking to bind a simple keyboard shortcut to trigger the same \"Actions\" popover, as cmd+clicking would do. Many other code editors and IDEs support such feature, and the most popular keyboard shortcut they use is alt+enter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlace the caret on a symbol that you want to refactor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a keyboard shortcut (e.g. alt+enter) that brings up \"Actions\" popover.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is no such shortcut.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe alt+enter keyboard shortcut is supported in the following code editors and IDEs:\r\n\r\n- JetBrains AppCode (https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/)\r\n- Visual Studio for Mac (https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)\r\n- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n--- June 16 2017, 7:40 PM / ADR\r\n\r\nThis issue behaves as intended based on the following:  Already works. Cmd-Shift-A.  We are now closing this bug report.  If you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.  Please be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
