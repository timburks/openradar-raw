    description: "Area:\r\nMDM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI run a 1:1 iPad school and we have an established system of app deployment that uses device assignment to push apps to devices without an Apple ID.\r\n\r\nUnder iOS 11, whenever I push an app to a device, the device is prompting the user to sign in to iTunes. This is different behaviour to iOS 10 and quite problematic as most of our users do not have an Apple ID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enrol an iOS 11 device in MDM\r\n2. Set up device without an Apple ID on the device\r\n3. Configure MDM to install apps using device assignment\r\n4. Push commands to install apps\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe behaviour we get under iOS 10 is that the apps are silently installed with no user interaction.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOn iOS 11, the device prompts for an iTunes login for every attempted app install. If the user cancels, the app is not installed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0/15A5278f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am using the same MDM configuration, enrolment and app deployment that we use with our iOS 10 clients today and we see this different behaviour.\r\n\r\nDevice-assignment is obviously a fundamental technique in K-12 deployment so it's quite important that this gets fixed.\r\n\r\nI have tried to gather a sysdiagnose but no logs are being generated for this problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMDM: JAMF Pro JSS 9.99.0-t1494340586\r\niPad: iPad mini 4, 64GB"
