    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently as of b1 the “Local Files” folder in Files app is hardcoded to show the Documents folder for apps. This will not work for many apps that already migrated to shared app containers. Reasons are many, e.g. you want to allow iMessage Extensions access - or any other extensions, or really have more apps and allow code sharing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a UIDocumentBrowserViewController to an app which stores its file in the \"Documents\" subfolder of an app group container.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app group container documents folder should be shown in the \"On my iPad\"/\"On my iPhone\" section of the document browser. Ideally this is controllable in the Info.plist of the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the standard documents folder is shown in the \"On my iPad\"/\"On my iPhone\" section of the document browser.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo sample required - Files.app is installed on iOS 11. Test with “PDF Viewer” for Documents view and compare with https://www.textasticapp.com/ which uses app containers, which doesn’t show up."
