    description: "WWDC 2012 videos can be accessed in WWDC app before(IIRC they are there before WWDC 2017) but now they are gone.\r\n\r\nI know they can still be found here: https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2012/.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means the watched and favorite states are lost. These are precious histories, memories and logs. I still want to catch up some unwatched videos that are still relevant today and rewatch my favorite videos occasionally.\r\n\r\nPlease make them and their watched and favorite states back in WWDC app.\r\n\r\nIf possible also make WWDC 2010 & 2011 video accessible in WWDC app. That'll be even better. I know I know, I'm oldâ€¦"
