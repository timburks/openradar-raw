    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached image.\r\n\r\nNSData's quick look shows a hex/ascii view, which is nice.  Unfortunately the number of bytes across is random - usually it's prime or some odd number.  When data, addresses, and generally thinking about bytes at that level, power-of-twos are very useful, especially when thinking \"here's a landmark, and I know that the part interesting to me is 32  bytes from here\".  With a consistent 8 or 16 byte stride, that's a trivial mental operation.  When it's 9 (in the attached screen shot) or 11, or 13, that's pretty hard to do\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
