    description: "Summary:\r\nI’d like to request support for a more generic booking type for SiriKit. My use case is that I work for a company that sells transient-rate parking spaces, and I would *love* to be able to allow the user to say something like: \n\n“Hey Siri, Book me a parking spot near Wrigley Field from 7-10pm” \n\nand use that to query my backend for spots near that area in that time, then present the user with their options\n\nThings I’d want in a more generic API for this: \n- Ability to register for specific keywords (ex: “parking” “a spot” “a parking spot” “a space”) to be triggered, then used in the response (ex “I found you parking” “I found some spots near that location”)\n- Ability to let the user specify which app they wish to use (“with SpotHero” or “with GeneriCoApp”)\n- Ability to detect get start and end times and dates from the intent\n- Ability to detect a desired location from the intent\n- Ability to present the user options for places they can go (Ideally with map, but a list would definitely be better than nothing), and allow them to select one\n- Ability to allow the user to pay with ApplePay for whatever they’ve booked (Ideally also with a stored payment method, but our user base seems to use ApplePay pretty heavily, so particularly to start with that would work for us). \n\nA few other potential uses I can think of off the top of my head for a more generic booking API besides booking parking spaces: \n- Booking a hotel room\n- Booking time at a co-working space\n- Booking short-term rental of equipment \n- Booking a car through a car-sharing app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Want to use Siri to support users saying “Hey Siri, book me a parking spot near wrigley field from 7-10”\n2. Realize there is no way to do that\n3. Realize none of the presently available APIs allow you to specify an end time or an end date for any reservation or event or task you are scheduling\n4. Have sad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to do what I want :)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSad had :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI spoke with some of the team at the labs about this and gave like ten of them my card. Would love to be of any help with figuring this out from a developer perspective if I can. d"
