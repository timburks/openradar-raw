    description: "For years we have been able to record the screens of iOS devices through QuickTime on the Mac using the Movie Recording option. That option seems to be gone in beta 1 of iOS 11, as the iPhone/iPad no longer appear as input devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug in iOS device to Mac via Lightning cable\r\n2. Open QuickTime\r\n3. File > New Movie Recording\r\n4. Use the carrot icon next to the record button to open a menu\r\n5. Select iPhone/iPad from the list of input video devices\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe connected iOS device will appear on this dropdown menu as an option.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is no iOS device on this list.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 developer beta 1 connected to macOS 10.12.5"
