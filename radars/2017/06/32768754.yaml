    description: "Summary:\r\nWith using more __auto_type or auto in C++/Objective-C always showing the type in the tooltip would be really really useful. (See https://cl.ly/1c3f13410H2y) Right now it’s shown sometimes, but not for all types - and only while debugging, not when I type the code. This should work both when the app is running and when it’s NOT running (Swift can do option-click to infer a type)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite some code with auto or __auto_type and run it + hover.\nObserve tooltips of mixed quality in debug mode\nObserve no tooltops when app is not running.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImproved tooltip for debugging and adding tooltip for editing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee that one: https://cl.ly/453d3Q0A1y38 - is it a URL? A String? \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is probably something that should be internally handled as two radas, one to improve debug experience and one for adding type infer for the edit experience.\n\nSee https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/even-swiftier-objective-c/ for our var/let macros."
