    description: "Summary:\r\nI launched FCP X using Command-Option-Down to close the Applications window behind me, and got the following rather terrifying dialog:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDo you want to delete the preferences?\r\n\r\nDeleting the preferences will reset all application settings to their defaults.  Libraries/Documents will not be affected.\r\n\r\n(Continue) ((Delete Preferences))\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThere are four things glaringly wrong with this dialog:\r\n\r\n1.  It shouldn't even exist.  The odds of deleting a prefs file actually fixing a real problem with an app are so vanishingly close to zero that I advise against it when people ask.  At best, it might appear to make a problem go away, only to have it resurface when the user figures out that some setting is wrong and fixes it.  At worst, it just annoys the heck out of the user and changes nothing.\r\n\r\n2.  Both buttons, at least judging by the name, appear to do the same thing—delete the preferences.  There is no \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n3.  The Delete Preferences button—the dangerous choice—is the *default*, which is an egregious violation of the HIG, which says that the safe option MUST be the default.\r\n\r\n4.  The dialog appears to be generated by some helper process and doesn't go away even if you force-quit FCP X.\r\n\r\nAn image of the dialog is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Choose FCP X in the Applications folder.\r\n2.  Hit Command-Option-Down Arrow.\r\n3.  Keep the modifier keys down a little too long.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected no dialog, but I'd settle for a HIG-compliant, force-quittable dialog that doesn't make me seriously consider rebooting just to get rid of it.  :-)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSee attached image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X v.10.11.6\r\nFCP X v.10.3.4"
