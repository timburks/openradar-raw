    description: "Summary:\r\nFile coordination appears to fail silently without any warning (or assertions) when passing it an URL that is not a file URL (ifFileURL == NO). This can happen if the URL is say mistakenly initialized using [NSURL URLWithString:documentPath] instead of using [NSURL fileURLWithPath:documentPath].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the provided example and follow the on screen instructions to reproduce the issue. See the commented section in ViewController.m to change the behavior of the example.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSFileCoordinator and NSFilePresenter would warn by logging in the console (or even assert?) is they receive URLs that they do not support.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSFileCoordinator and NSFilePresenter fail silently. Not file coordination is apparently performed (there is a noticeable thread race in the example) and no file coordination update cals are invoked. At the same the file operations can succeed normally (the example uses NSFileHandle to write data).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10, 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nURLWithString:\n\n(lldb) p documentURL\n(NSURL *) $1 = 0x0000600000091300 @\"/Users/matej/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/C50BB0A5-06ED-4802-950F-F3457ED7579D/data/Containers/Data/Application/B68CE42E-618F-48B5-94C1-C18549901518/Documents/file.txt\"\n\nfileURLWithPath:\n\n(lldb) p documentURL\n(NSURL *) $0 = 0x00006000000b3e00 @\"file:///Users/matej/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/C50BB0A5-06ED-4802-950F-F3457ED7579D/data/Containers/Data/Application/E46DDF1F-E1D2-4690-87AD-5AE55D51DE96/Documents/file.txt\""
