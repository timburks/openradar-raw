    description: "iOS 11 allows all passwords to become visible without needing to authenticate. This is very insecure, and would prevent me from storing my passwords in iCloud Keychain, knowing that I can be compelled to open them either by force, law enforcement, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nGo to Settings > Accounts & Passwords > App & Website Passwords.\r\nYou will be prompted for TouchID, without any way to use an alternate mechanism for authentication.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be prompted for another master password, which would prevent anyone from seeing passwords with just access to me and my phone.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAll passwords were displayed in plain text for anyone to see."
