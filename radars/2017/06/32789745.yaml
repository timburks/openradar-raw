    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nWhenever I type anything in the new improved Xcode9 editor, if I have the Quick Help inspector up, it flashes visibly one every keystroke.  I don't know if this is a seizure risk for those with epilepsy. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Quick Help Inspector gets shown by default whenever I go from a storyboard to a swift file, so I have to do the shortcut to close it all the time.  This can be dozens, if not hundreds of times a day.\r\n\r\nPlease see attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType a single character\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Quick Help inspector remains stable if there's nothing to update.\r\nIf there is something to update, it just updates it without flashing an intermediate state\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe Quick Help inspector redraws itself in a distracting manner.\r\nIt updates itself with an intermedite \"NO SELECTION\" indication, then redraws whatever it had before.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happened in Xcode8 too.  Happens in new projects and old.\r\nComments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflashy-flashy.mp4\r\n4.7 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the actual flash slowed down by a factor of 10 or so. Notice the \"No Selection\" that comes up and then goes away.\r\n\r\nslow-flash.mp4\r\n344.3 KB"
