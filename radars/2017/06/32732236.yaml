    description: "Summary:\r\nPreviously in Xcode when 3rd party frameworks needed to be added, but not moved or copied into the project directory (using Carthage for example), a dialogue box would pop up and we could uncheck the 'Copy Files' option.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue no longer shows for framework bundles, however, when the project adds it the red highlight occurs as it references the original location of the framework bundle and not the new destination.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen an Xcode project.\r\nDrag a .framework file from Finder or Desktop into the project structure\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dialogue to show up offering the choice to copy the files to the destination if required.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- The framework is moved from it's original destination to the new destination based on where you drop it on the project.\r\n- The project references the original location of the framework.\r\n- The left side project heirachy highlights the added framework/s as red due to referencing the original location but moving the framework to the new location.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo work around I go to finder and move the frameworks back to their original location. This makes the red highlight go back to normal as the reference exists once moved back."
