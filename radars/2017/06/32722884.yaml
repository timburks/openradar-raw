    description: "Summary:\r\nCommit and push sheets, as they are in beta 1, are blocking and prevent working while they finish. \nApps like github desktop, tower etc. allow one to essentially view the changes as they occur and commit/push without blocking the IDE itself.\nSimilarly, if one can open a tab that shows and updates changed files in a commit-view while working on the project in other tabs, it will be a substantially better experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make changes to a version controlled project\n2. Commit\t\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUI is not blocking\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUI is \tblocking\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n/"
