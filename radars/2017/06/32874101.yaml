    description: "Area:\r\nHealth App\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPer rdar://29144768, third party apps should be able to add workouts to Health.app to populate the activity rings. Full note from radar:\r\n\r\n> Summary values are computed from other values that third party apps can get write access to. You donâ€™t write appleExerciseTime, you write a workout or other activity and the summary query takes those into account automatically. Activity Summaries should never get write or share access.\r\n\r\nWhen an Apple Watch is available, workouts added to the health store from today or yesterday will populate exercise minutes (see rdar://32739919), but if no Apple Watch is available, no exercise minutes will be populated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (\"Radar13Jun2017.zip\").\r\n2. Build and run in the simulator. Note: Do not pair an Apple Watch with the simulator. If an Apple Watch is already paired, unpair it.\r\n3. Allow access to writing workout data.\r\n4. Tap \"Continue\" after you have provided access.\r\n5. Wait until the alert has appeared that says \"Workout has been saved.\"\r\n6. Open Health.app.\r\n7. Tap \"Activity\".\r\n8. Note that a 1 hour workout has been logged in the workout section (see attachment \"A.png\").\r\n9. Now tap on \"Exercise Minutes\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn hour of exercise minutes is shown to have been logged for the day.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo exercise minutes are visible. (see attachment \"B.png\")\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
