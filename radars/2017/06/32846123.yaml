    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController allows to add custom UIDocumentBrowserActions with the availability .navigationBar, that show up in select-mode. However, if you have a single of these actions with a descriptive text instead of an icon (e.g. \"Browse Versions\"), the navigationBar is already too crowded on the iPhone in Portrait and some standard controls are cut off. We need a way to show custom actions somewhere where there's more space, e.g. in a UIToolbar at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app on an iPhone\n2. Go to \"Browse\" Tab and tap on \"Select\"\n3. Observe the crowded NavigationBar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything looks neat and tidy and there's enough room for system-provided controls and custom controls\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is basically no space for custom controls\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
