    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter using an iOS device for a while (particularly iPad) webviews can go black and not function until rebooted. Rarely will it recover without a reboot. After this any Safari instance or WebView will be black. Mail contents included.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use iOS device for weeks\r\n2. Be sure to regularly use webview driven apps, in my case: Tweetbot, Mail, Mr Reader, Safari, Facebook\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWebviews continue to render visibly.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWebviews go black, nothing is readable. Reloading doesn't change anything.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 (14F89)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nGenerally was only happening on my iPad Pro 9\" but it gets used for web type content more than my iPhone 7+ does. 7+ also has had it happen."
