    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController shows an inline cell to create a new document. The only way to customize this cell is by specifying a custom tint color, which it picks up. There is however no other way to customize this cell, making it potentially look out-of-place for certain apps. For example if all document previews in an app are landscape, as in our app or e.g. Keynote, the \"create new document\" cell is still shown in portrait orientation, making it look out of place. Additionally there is no way to customize the icon and/or title of the cell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Files app on a device that has Keynote installed\n2. go into the Keynote Folder\n3. Observe that all document previews are landscape, while the \"Create New Document\" cell is portrait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Create new document\" cell blends in with the rest of the UI and is customizable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Create new document\" cell has a fixed appearance, except for the tint color\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo need for a sample app as it can be reproduced with the built-in Files app"
