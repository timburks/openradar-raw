    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode’s new build system is awesome! There’s still a bug somewhere. Our large project compiles for Run with both systems, but tests currently fail to link on the new build system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee logs for differences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOutput should be the same for both modes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLinker errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooks like some dependencies are not correctly copied into the folder and then can’t be found at link time. I can provide additional log entries if the attached ones are not sufficient (I use Xcode Save… feature after setting all filters to NO on a clean build)"
