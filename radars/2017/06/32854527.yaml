    description: "Summary:\r\nBecause UITableViewDropDelegate does not allow moving multiple items within the same table view (see rdar:///32854195), we need to remove the system’s UIDragInteraction from a UITableView and install our own. Currently we just iteration all the interactions installed on the table view and remove any UIDragInteractions. We do this at viewDidLoad time before installing our own drag interaction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile and run the attached project on an 12.9” iPad \n2. Note that it is possible to drag multiple items in the sidebar to rearrange.\n3. Look in ViewController.swift for the viewDidLoad() method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis method would be able to request that the table view remove its own drop interaction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe just iteration all the interactions installed on the table view and remove any UIDragInteractions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur workaround seems fine for now, but if the system ever installs multiple drop interactions that will be a breaking change. It seems like we’re relying too much on implementation details with our workaround."
