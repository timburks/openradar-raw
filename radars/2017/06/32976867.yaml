    description: "When editing long lines in Xcode 9 the cursor can move out of the visible area. I have to scroll manually (using the mouse) to see what I'm typing.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when the \"Wrap Lines\" option is disabled. Vertical Scrolling works as expected. This was introduced with Xcode 9 (beta).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a code file in Xcode 9\r\n- Deselect \"Wrap Lines\" in the File Inspector\r\n- Edit a long line that does not fit into the window.\r\n- Or, just start typing until the cursor moves out of the visible area.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- visible area follows cursor.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- visible area does not follow the cursor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 1\r\nXcode 9 beta 2"
