    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIssue initially found in the editor on squarespace.com, which appears to use a derivative of CKEditor. CKEditor is a rich text control that uses the HTML contenteditable on large DOM trees - not necessarily textareas - to provide a web-app WYSIWYG experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit ckeditor.com\r\n2. Enter editor on main page\r\n3. Open Notes in Slide-Over and/or Split View.\r\n4. Select text in the editor\r\n5. Attempt to enter a drag with the content\r\n6. Select text in Notes\r\n7. Engage a drag and attempt to drop on editor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can drag text in and out of web-based editors.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n#4: Engaging a drag simply moves the carat, deselecting text.\r\n#7: If the editor instance is configured to accept file uploads, the drop content is attempted to be uploaded. It looks like it picks the first(?) content form, as an image uploaded successfully. If the editor isn't configured to do this, Safari treats it like any other drop; for instance, a dropped URL will change the page - which is bad!!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
