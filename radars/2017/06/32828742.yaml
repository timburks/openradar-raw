    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of Xcode, Find > Find and Replace In Project (or using the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘F) will do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show Find Navigator (if it is not already showing)\r\n2. Make the search field first responder (if it is not already showing)\r\n3. Select all text in the search field\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 9, the Find > Find and Replace In Project will only perform step 1 if Find Navigator is not already shown. A second Find > Find and Replace In Project is needed to perform step 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nSee attached video on the different behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Show Project Navigator (or any navigator besides the Find Navigator) ⌘1\r\n2. Find > Find and Replace In Project ⇧⌘F\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Find Navigator is shown\r\n2.
