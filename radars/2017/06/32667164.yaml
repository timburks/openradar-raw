    description: "Summary:\r\nSome settings, such as \"Show all issues\", are currently per-user workspace settings. Settings like this would be nice to share between all developers on a project. It would be great if you could use those settings as per user, or per workspace settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to enable \"Show all issues\" for an entire project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis can be checked in to the `xcshareddata`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt cannot be shared, and if it is manually added to that file, it is ignored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
