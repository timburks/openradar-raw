    description: "Xcode 9 introduces main thread sanitizer detecting calls to App/UIKit not from main thread.\r\nIt would be great to be able to mark my API as bound to be called from the main thread.\r\nFor example if I'm building custom UI controls and distributing as prebuilt binary, I'd love for consumers to see the same warning when they use my components."
