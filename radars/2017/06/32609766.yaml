    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt appears that installing High Sierra changed some settings. In particular, I found that the following were changed:\r\n\r\n1. Login items were cleared.\r\n2. Password delay on sleep was changed from immediate to 5 minutes.\r\n3. The Finder sidebar's order was completely changedâ€“it doesn't look like any specific sorting, either.\r\n\r\nThere might be other things, which I'll add as I continue using macOS. Also attached is a sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install macOS High Sierra, with an APFS conversion.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo changes except for High Sierra.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSome settings are changed as well.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will add as I find more stuff.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)"
