    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the flashlight on the iPhone the raise to wake feature should be disabled. It's fair to assume that the user are in dark environments during flashlight operation, and probably holding the phone up to shine the light around. At which point it is undesirable to have the screen light up to blind you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTurn on flashlight, walk around with phone upright, shining the light around.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen should not light up when raising the phone if the flashlight is on.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nScreen lights up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 (14F89)"
