    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI do completion-on-demand with the escape key.  If I don't filter the completions (say just want to scroll through them), the completion window is unscrollable, arrow navigation is nearly invisible, and clicking the scroll thumb dismisses the pop-over.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see movie at [bad-completion,mp4] [dropbox url redacted] (I can't upload because radarweb is unreliable with uploads > 5meg. c.f. rdar://30364703\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart a completion, such as  `someObject. [escape]`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompletion window pops up\r\nI can scroll the completion window\r\nI can easily arrow in the completion window, scrolling if I go off the bottom\r\nI can click and drag the scroll thumb in the completion window\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCompletion window pops up\r\nThe window doesn't scroll\r\nArrowing around selects the items in the visible region, but with such a washed-out color I couldn't tell what was going on\r\nClicking the scroll thumb dismisses the window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I restrict the completion by typing some stuff, I get two overlapping completion windows - one with a little bit of stuff, one with everything behind the one with stuff, and the everything-behind is scrollable.\r\n\r\nThe video has text annotations of all of these observed cases.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks fine in Xcode 8, same exact project.\r\nComments"
