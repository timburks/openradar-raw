    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are video previews on App information views in the new App Store which autoplay and can be switched to full screen playback just by tapping the video preview. The full screen mode can be left by simply interactively swiping the video to any side. That is great and expected behaviour, since so many photo related apps and most social network apps do this.\n\nHowever, on the same view right next to the video previews are the screenshots. They can be tapped, too. But they will stay full screen, and can’t be swiped away. Instead, there is a Done button in the upper right corner to close the screenshot full screen view.\n\nThis is a mess.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap video preview to go full screen.\n2. Close full screen by swiping the video to any side.\n3. Tap screenshot to go full screen.\n4. Try closing it the same way as the video preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to swipe away the full screen screenshot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI’m currently stuck tapping a button in the top right corner on a mostly white screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know, that it should also be possible to swipe left/right to go to the next/previous screenshot. But, please, just look at Photos.app–where I can swipe away a photo or video by pulling it downwards–and tell me, it’s not possible to integrate the same behaviour into the App Store?…"
