    description: "Summary:\r\nUnlike all others major browsers, Safari does not display the websites' favicon on open tabs. While I appreciate the cleanliness of the UI, I also think having a colored a visual clue as to which website is open in which tab (and not having to read the tab title) is a important productivity improvement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open multiple tabs in Safari\r\n2. Look at the tabs :)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA favicon is displayed next to the tab's title.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nText. Only text :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 10.1.1 (12603.2.4)\r\nmacOS Version 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you think this would be problem for most users, maybe make this an opt-in options ?\r\nEven having to enable this options via `defaults write` would be great !\r\n\r\nAttached is a mockup to help understand my suggestion (in case it wasn't clear :)).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nComments"
