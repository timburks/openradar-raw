    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the Console.app's \"search\" functionality is a constant pain for me, as I'm often trying to fin the origin and context of a report that was forwarded to me by a  user or colleague.\r\n\r\nInstead of searching and highlighting occurrences for a given term, the app filters the content of the logs and ONLY shows the lines corresponding to that error. This makes it actually harder to find context of certain logs, which basically makes TextEdit more apt for searching through logs to me than Console.app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a .log file on Console.app\r\n2. Search for a term\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search term is searched for and the occurrences are highlighted within the log area.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe logs are filtered by the given search term.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.5"
