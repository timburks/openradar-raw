Open a folder and add some documents\n3. Switch between list and grid view several times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"New Document\" cell is always reloaded/displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the cell gets stuck and isn't reloaded correctly, which leads to a weird-looking cell.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
