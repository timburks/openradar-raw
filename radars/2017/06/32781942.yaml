    description: "Summary:\r\niOS should support remapping of modifier keys (Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command) for all types of hardware keyboards.\r\n\r\nThis is an important addition to iOS, for ergonomic reasons, as well as accessibility more generally, among other benefits.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings app.\r\n2. Navigate to General > Accessibility > Keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user can remap hardware keyboard modifier keys. \r\n\r\nAny hardware keyboard, such as the Smart Keyboard for iPad Pro, but also keyboards connected via Bluetooth, should support the ability to remap modifier keys.\r\n\r\nNote that there are already a small number of settings for hardware keyboards, such as Key Repeat, Sticky Keys, and Slow Keys on the General > Accessibility > Keyboard settings screen. This is a natural location to add remapping of modifier keys.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it should be possible to remap any of the following keys:\r\n\r\n- Caps Lock\r\n- Control\r\n- Option\r\n- Command\r\n\r\nTo any of the following values:\r\n\r\n- Caps Lock\r\n- Control\r\n- Option\r\n- Command\r\n- Escape\r\n- Or, alternatively, to no action at all (\"No Action\").\r\n\r\nThis mirrors the behaviour of macOS (Accessible via: System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe user is unable to remap modifier keys.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta (15A5278f)"
