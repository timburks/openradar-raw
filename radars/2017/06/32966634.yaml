    description: "In iOS 10, Springboard had a 3D touch enabled left edge, in which one could apply pressure to the left edge of the screen to either enter multitasking, or if done with the right amount of pressure, enter the previously used app.\r\n\r\nThis great feature was removed in iOS 11, betas one and two.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unlock a 3D Touch-enabled iPhone\r\n2. Apply pressure to the left side of the screen\r\n3. Multitasking is not presented, as the feature was removed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Unlock a 3D Touch-enabled iPhone\r\n2. Apply pressure to the left side of the screen\r\n3. The Multitasking UI gets presented with enough force, and with less the previously opened app could be opened.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo 3D touch implementation exists for this Springboard feature in iOS 11.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 [15A5304i]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
