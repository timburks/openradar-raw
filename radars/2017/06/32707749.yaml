    description: "In my application, I have functionality where I detect when a user takes a screenshot, then I present this screenshot for annotation and markup.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the instant markup popover confuses the user and reduces UX quality in my app for this feature, as the user might not know which screenshot to annotate. Also the popover will cover a part of the screenshot that is supposed to be annotated.\r\n\r\nI tried to go through the documentation of new/existing iOS APIs to figure out where this happens and how to deal with it the way I described, but with no luck.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs I said, it's not a bug but it greatly interferes with my app's UX.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect when I take the screenshot, to be able to dismiss the instant markup screenshot represented by the system immediately.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe instant markup screenshot covers an essential part of my app's window and greatly confuses the user."
