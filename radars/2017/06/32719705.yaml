    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9's source control commands do not appear to be accessible from the menu bar in 9.0 beta (9M136h). Their existence in the menu bar is important as it allows setting custom keybindings as well as searching thru all the menu items using Cmd+Shift+?. Their absence is a significant impediment to power-user workflows, which a lot of developers happen to be.\n\nCommands that do not appear:\n1. New branch from {current branch name }\n2. Tag\n3. Merge\n4. View branch/tag/commit on Github\n5. Delete branch/tag\n6. Checkout branch/commit/tag\n7. Copy commit identifier\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\n2. Navigate to the source control navigator in the left pane\n3. Select a branch/tag and click \"Source Control\" menu item\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the commands relevant to the selected source control entity appear in the Source Control drop down.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot all the commands relevant to the selected source control entity appear in the Source Control drop down.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n/"
