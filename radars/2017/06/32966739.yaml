    description: "Area:\r\nHome Screen \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen all apps are closed in Multitasking on iOS 11 on the iPhone, there is a situation where all a user can see is a blurred version of their Springboard. No other UI is on screen, indicating what's going on or what to do next. On iOS 10, the Home Screen was a card in the Multitasking pane, so it logically was the last card you could not swipe away, and tapping on it made sense as it was a smaller window in the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Double press the Home Button to open Multitasking\r\n2. Close all open apps\r\n3. Notice that there is no UI to indicate what to do next, or the current state of one's device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Double press the Home Button to open Multitasking\r\n2. Close all open apps\r\n3. Some UI should be present to indicate that all apps are closed, and to return to the home screen, OR - when all apps are closed iOS closes multitasking so this problem could be avoided altogether.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo indicative UI is present telling the user what the current state of their device is, or what to do next.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 [15A5304i]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screenshot of my multitasking UI with all apps closed, indicating the state of UI I am referring to in this radar.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
