    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen any app uses SFSafariViewController to handle links, Universal Linking behavior is not triggered. Instead, the URL is opened as a website.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose any app that implements SFSafariViewController.\r\n2. Use that app to open a URL that is enabled for Universal Links.\r\n3. Corresponding app will not launch. Instead, the link will always open as a web page regardless of whether the app is installed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen clicking a Universal Link inside an app that implements SFSafariViewController, the app corresponding to the link should open if it installed. This is the actual behavior if the app instead uses the main Safari app to handle links, so SFSafariViewController should act the same way.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen clicking a Universal Link inside an app that implements SFSafariViewController, the web fallback location is always loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll since iOS 9.0"
