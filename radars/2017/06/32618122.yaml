    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the new large text titles in a navigation bar you currently can not set the text color for these large titles, making it unusable for apps that need to have a custom text color because they are already using a custom navigation bar. For me there seem to be two options here:\n- Make titleTextAttribute be used by the large title as well (which would interfere with certain type of attributes like the font size)\n- Add a largeTitleTextAttribute to be available\n\nIdeally I would love to have the second option but as a `null_resettable` item, so that when you set that to `nil`, it would use the `titleTextAttribute` (specifying an empty dictionary would make it to use no attributes) so that for apps where you only change things like the font color, you donâ€™t need to change them in two places.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
