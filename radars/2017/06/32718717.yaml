    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!  Looks like Xcode9b1 took out (or hasn't added back in) command-control-M, which toggles the visiblity of warnings and errors, as well as row colorization.\r\n\r\ncommand-control-M is my favorite Xcode 8 keyboard shortcut because I find the in-your-face errors to be distracting (and also an accessibility issue - saturated colors like the red backgrounds and icons interact badly with the chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Have some errors (maybe a metric freakload due to a big refactor)\r\n* see the errors in your editor\r\n* Make them go away, say with Xcode 8's command-control-M keystroke\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe errors are hidden and I can edit without a headache\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBeep\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn general, sufficiently advanced developers don't need a huge amount of hand-holding. It'd be nice to be able to turn highly-visibile hand-holding off somehow.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks great in Xcode 8.x and all prior version.  Doesn't work with Xcode 9"
