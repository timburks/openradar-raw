    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a page with a fixed position header that contains interactive elements like buttons or links when shown in a WKWebView with rubberbanding disabled, it is possible for the logical interaction position of the element to get out of sync with the visual position of the element.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new bug (happening since iOS 9), but it is still broken in iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis happens when you do a scroll action that would normally trigger the rubberbanding effect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe logical and visual positions of UI elements are consistent.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt has the effect of moving the logical position of the element further down the page as if rubberbanding has occurred, but the visual position is correct.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari on iOS 11 beta 1 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158325\r\nDuplicate of rdar://problem/26652772"
