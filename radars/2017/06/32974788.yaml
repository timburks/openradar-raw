    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn every iOS version predating the current iOS 11 beta, 3-D touching the left edge would bring up the app switcher, allowing for quickly switching between apps in one fluid gesture, without using the home button.\r\nIn the current version of iOS 11, this does not work, causing a serious impact to productivity when using the device.\r\nI sincerely hope this is a bug, because it is something (and many others I know) use tens (if not hundreds) of times every day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnlock the phone\r\n3D touch on left edge of screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app switcher opens\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app switcher does not open, and there is no other gesture that replaces this`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iPhones with 3D touch."
