    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Xcode 9 release notes say:\r\n> When text is selected, typing a opening delimiter adds a matching closing delimiter at the end of the selection. Auto-matched delimiters include \" \", ( ), [ ], { }. (29164633)\r\n\r\nThat's a nice feature.  But, it also happens when pasting one of those opening delimiters, which I don't expect nor want.  Pasting should be literal, and always replace the selected text, no matter what the pasted content is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI often do editing operations for multiple find/replaces (but, where I want to be more manual than the \"Find and Replace\" tool in the editor):\r\n\r\n1) Copy the replacement text to my pasteboard.  For this issue, let's say that is a single opening delimiter (e.g. `[`)\r\n\r\n2) Select the text I want to replace, and press cmd-e\r\n\r\n3) Quickly and repeatedly press cmd-g, then cmd-v to find the next occurrence, briefly visually inspect that it's what I want to replace, and then paste the replacement.\r\n\r\nBut, if the text I want to paste (copied in step 1) is an opening delimiter, then each paste in step 3 doesn't replace what I want, but instead it surrounds the selected text with those delimiters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the selected text to always be replaced by what I am pasting, no matter what the content is that I am pasting.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe selected text remains, and is surrounded by the delimiters.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)"
