    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen going to /Applications  and invoking command-i on a version of Xcode, the size in the top right bit of the info window seems to correlate properly with how many bytes are in the application as reported by the Size line in the General section, but the parenthetical size next to that byte size is off by anywhere from a fraction of a meg to multiple gigs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Finder to navigate to /Applications\r\n2. Select a version of Xcode (it is one of the worst offenders)\r\n3. Invoke command-I to show the info window\r\n4. Wonder why the bit in the top right corner is more consistent with the size in bytes than the number next to the size in bytes \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp size should be displayed consistently within the Info window, and should be directly related to the size of the bytes of the application. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee screenshots in “lol_wat.zip” [OR note: These screenshots: https://twitter.com/designatednerd/status/871861438062542848] for an example. I will note that this is not consistently this bad - some apps are off by about half a meg, some are off by multiple gigs. Seems like Xcode is the worst offender. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don’t remember seeing this before today, but I’m not sure when the last time I saw expected behavior was. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegular Xcode in the example screenshot installed via the Mac App Store, Xcode-beta installed directly via downloaded .xip. I have not restarted my laptop since installing the downloaded .xip."
