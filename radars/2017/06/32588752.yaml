    description: "Because the record button is in Control Centre, it seems like every video we shoot will begin with the user closing control centre or we will have to edit out the first few seconds of every single video we record.\r\n\r\nI can think of two ways out of this: \r\n\r\n- A 3-2-1 countdown before recording starts or\r\n- Recording doesn't start until you close control centre.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Control Centre and start a recording.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI had hoped there would be a way to avoid recording the act of starting the recording.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nEvery video starts with the user closing the control centre.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11/15A5278f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 9.7\""
