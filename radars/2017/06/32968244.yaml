    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nMuch to my chagrin I have an objc source file that is 10K LoC.  Jumping to a symbol definition can take 2-5 seconds.  Xcode8 is near instantaneous.\r\n\r\nHere's a video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/slow-symbol-in-pathological-file.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nRestarting Xcode (after a round-trip through Xcode8 to see if it had similar problems) made it fast again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a file that is (as the younguns say) totes-redonk large\r\nHave Xcode been running for awhile\r\ncommand-control click to jump to a symbol (in this case a method implementation)  The source is about line 5723, and destination at line 5867.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJumps to the location instantaneously\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt takes a noticable amount of time 3-5 seconds\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode 8 was instantaneous.  Returning to Xcode9 it's fast again.  So I guess there's might be some \"Xcode's been in use for a while and stuff is building up somewhere\".\r\n\r\nI did not try it with a smaller file when misbehaving, to see if it was the large-file aspect, or just something else being pokey.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
