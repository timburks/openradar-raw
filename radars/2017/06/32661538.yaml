    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Fix of the new \"This function declaration is not a prototype\" warning in Xcode 9 Inserts 'void' into empty function parameter list. But for delegate methods offered by the system SDK the compiler then reports another warning of \"Conflicting parameter types\" because the method declarations in protocol don't have 'void' and the compiler doesn't think foo() and foo(void) are the same thing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile sample app.\r\n2. Following the Fix.\r\n3. See the new warning.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/c3duAbKKb90"
