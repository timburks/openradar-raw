    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8 with the iOS 10 SDK, if you attempt to animate a NSLayoutConstraint constant change (by calling `layoutIfNeeded`) alongside a `UIView` keyframe animation both from a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` with a spring timing curve, your app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` with spring timing parameters\r\n2. Create a view with a constraint to be animated\r\n3. Change the constant of the constraint, add an animation block to the animator calling `layoutIfNeeded` on the appropriate view\r\n4. Add another animation block to the animator where you attempt to use a keyframe animation\r\n5. Start and pause the animator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animation is started and paused, and can happily be resumed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes with `-[CAKeyframeAnimation setFromValue:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Run the attached project to see the issue and a few workarounds\r\n- This seems to be fixed in Xcode 9 beta 1 with the iOS 11 SDK\r\n- You can work around this by:\r\n  1. Not using a spring for the timing parameters\r\n  2. Putting the `layoutIfNeeded` call in the keyframe animation as well\r\n  3. Add an extension on `CAKeyframeAnimation` where you define a `fromValue` and ignore it being set"
