    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://28633131\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs it stands today, Configuration Profiles, which are the primary means by which MDMs manage clients, do not cover enough settings for many large organizations (Facebook, Google, etc)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to manage SSH settings\r\n2. Can't be done with profiles.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll major services on macOS should be manageable via Profiles or some other means.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot manage a large number of settings.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere are a list of settings that cannot be managed fully/at all using Configuration Profiles today:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Manage common settings via MDM\r\n  - ntpd (“Set date and time automatically”)\r\n    - Allowing multiple time servers to be set for shops where there’s a requirement to use an internal NTP server which isn’t accessible outside the network.\r\n  - Enforce SSHD enabled/disabled (called “Remote login” in System Preferences)\r\n  - SSH configuration (e.g. disable password auth / enforce key based auth)\r\n  - Associating SSH keys with users (for password-less SSH) (see also:  Kerberos auth to SSH hosts)\r\n  - Forwarding logs to one or more central syslog servers\r\n  - sudoers (lol)\r\n  - /etc/hosts\r\n  - pathsd\r\n  - Non-plist configuration files (e.g. conf files) Examples: Cisco AnyConnect, git, hg, arc, java ruleset, Splunk, Firefox, etc.\r\n  - PAM modules\r\n  - Security Certificate preferences\r\n  - Identity Preferences\r\n  - User Accounts (local users/passwords)\r\n  - pf/firewall\r\n  - pf logging\r\n  - file sharing, both Server.app & regular in sys prefs (AFP / SMB / FTP)\r\n  - Bluetooth settings\r\n  - Network locations, and all network settings (not just 802.1x / wifi payloads…)\r\n  - System certificates (adding via profile already work) - removal / revocation, CRL / OCSP, changing root CA trusts\r\n  - Printers - adding works via profile (barely), but doesn’t remove when profile is removed; lpoptions aren’t enforced (either permanently or set-once)\r\n    - Printer presets - particularly when critical information like network accounting is stored within the preset prefs data\r\n  - Default audio input/output interface selection for classroom/auditorium/kiosk use\r\n  - CUPS in general\r\n  - Location Services (on / off / privacy controls)\r\n  - TCC db (on / off / who gets what, access…)\r\n  - pmset / power management / scheduled reboots, authrestarts, etc.\r\n  - spotlight - adding / removing privacy entries, configuring / enabling\r\n  - User account creation? CreateUserPkg?\r\n  - Secure update process for passwords of specified local account(s).\r\n  - Hostnames / ComputerName / LocalHostName? (scutil?)\r\n  - SAML/SSO integration with DEP boot/MDM enrollment\r\n  - Maximum screensaver idle time (i.e., “No more than 15 minutes”, and not “exactly 5” or exactly “10”)\r\n  - Anything Apple hasn’t thought of yet that we can currently handle with the tools we have available today"
