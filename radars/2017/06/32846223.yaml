    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UI that is used to move a document to a different folder shows all possible folders in a long scrollable list. This has several drawbacks.\n 1. The user has to potentially scroll a lot to find the folder he is looking for\n 2. There is no search/filter function to speed this up\n 3. There is no way to collapse certain folders, only storage providers itself\n 4. The visual indentation for every new folder level is very wide, resulting in cut-off folder names very quickly\n\nIn addition to that, there's a bug that the title of the moved document is not centered (or the image preview doesn't show up, if it should be there as well).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. Tap on \"Select\"\n3. Select a document and tap on \"Move\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA practical UI is presented, that allows to quickly move a document to a certain folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Move UI has several drawbacks outlined above\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
