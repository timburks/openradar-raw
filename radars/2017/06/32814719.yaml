    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI had to restore my iPad 10.5” after using Drag and Drop to reorder apps. I was in the “wiggle mode“ to delete some apps. It was in a invalid state where reordering wouldn’t work anymore (just wouldn’t let me drag the icons), deleting didn’t work anymore and drag and drop without wiggling icons wasn’t available.\r\n\r\nIf I was in an app and returned to the home screen it would start the wiggle mode again so I decided to restart my iPad and it got stuck on the Apple logo in the boot process forcing me to restore it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag some apps into folders\r\n2. Start wiggle mode to delete apps\r\n3. Stop wiggle mode by hitting the home button\r\n4. Use an app\r\n5. Wiggle mode starts again (on its own)\r\n6. Reboot device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt reboots and lets me use the device again.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt is a really nice looking aluminium brick.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (beta 1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome other users reported the same thing:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/NachoSoto/status/875065148230258690\r\nhttps://twitter.com/timonus/status/875065450228588546\r\nhttps://twitter.com/electrobarn/status/875065604620906496\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
