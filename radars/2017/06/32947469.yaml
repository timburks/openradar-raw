    description: "Summary:\r\nTestFlight allows installing previous versions of an application which is very useful. Unfortunately, those builds do expire after 90 days.\n\nIt would be better if at least internal testers have access to previous builds after that expiration date. It is helpful to be able to go back few builds ago to track down a bug or an issue with your application. Of course, you can always try to build that application from your source code but sometimes it can be a lot of hustle to be able to do that. You have to have access to your computer, you or some of the external libraries that you use might have migrated to the newer version of Swift, which would require downloading the previous version of Xcode etc. And that all assumes that you're a developer with access to all those sources and tools, not a tester which found a possible regression.\n\nIt would be much nicer to be able to do this with just TestFlight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to TestFlight app on the device\n2. Choose an application\n3. Choose Previous Builds\n4. Choose the oldest build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should never say that the build will expire in X days.\nIt should always allow to Install that build, unless it wouldnâ€™t normally work on selected device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt says Expires in X days\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
