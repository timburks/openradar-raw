    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have come into a situation where we are limited by MDM on MacOS not allowing us to remove VPP software from client machines. I know that this feature is supported on iOS, but is specifically not supported on MacOS as stated in MDM Protocol Reference > MDM Protocol > Requests Types > Managed Applications > paragraph 6\r\n\r\n“The macOS MDM client does not support managed applications. However, it does support the parts of the InstallApplication, InstallMedia, and InviteToProgram MDM commands related to VPP enrollment and installation.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTested on Mac OS X 10.11, macOS 10.12 and macOS 10.13.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince this supported on iOS and we need to support BYOD of our university population for managed application for macOS like students, staff and faculty. Were we can use criteria defined in the MDM to remove managed VPP applications based on if they no longer a university students, staff or faculty or other options like a application checkout period (i.e. 2 weeks) and then they applications could be legitimately distributed to other users and not breaking assigned VPP licensing. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently, we can distribute VPP software via MDM and retrieve license, but VPP software is NOT removed on the mac client.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis impacts our university population around 53,000."
