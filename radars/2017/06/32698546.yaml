    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Documentationeros,\r\n\r\nThe position: fixed headers in Release Notes documentation pages hides important information.\r\n\r\nConsider the AppKit Release Notes for macOS 10.13, found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/AppKit/RN-AppKit/index.html\r\n\r\nThis page has a link titled “Layer-backed Views”. Since my app uses layer-backed views for some pretty important features, and since I started getting mysterious layer-related crashes when I tested my app on macOS 10.13 (see rdar://32698202), I was pretty interested in this section of the release notes. So I dutifully clicked on the link. I didn’t find anything relevant to my crashes. Fortunately, I attended WWDC17 and was able to talk to AppKit engineers who diagnosed my problem and explained the change in AppKit that caused my problems.\r\n\r\nI later discovered that this change *is* documented in the “Layer-backed Views” section of the release notes, in a paragraph titled “Stricter allocation of view-backing layers”! So why didn’t I see it? I didn’t it because it was covered by the position: fixed headers. Please see the attached video. Here’s what’s in the video:\r\n\r\n1. I start at the top of the AppKit Release Notes for macOS 10.13 page.\r\n2. I click the “Layer-backed Views” link.\r\n3. The “Stricter allocation of view-backing layers” title and paragraph are *not* visible. I have no idea that I’m not seeing the critical information *to which I clicked a link*.\r\n4. I use the Safari debug tools to hide the fixed headers.\r\n5. The critical information *to which I clicked a link* is now visible.\r\n\r\nPlease fix the documentation layout so that the target of a link actually becomes visible when I click the link.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h) / 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
