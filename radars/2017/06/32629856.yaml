    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf the UISearchBar is partially obscured by the navigation bar (as can happen when the content fits the entire area between the navigation bar and the tab bar, or when trying to scroll the table view when it is not filling the whole area), tapping on it and cancelling results in an incorrect inset from the top equal to the height of the status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have the UISearchBar partially obscured in some contexts.\r\n2. Tap on it.\r\n3. Press cancel to stop searching.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search bar's insets are correct.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe insets aren't correct; it's shifted down too far.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 [14E8301]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
