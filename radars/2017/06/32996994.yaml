    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDrag-and-drop provides a new way to open tabs. It's not perfect.\r\n\r\nThis radar chain (of which this ticket is the start) centers around a reasonably common action for me while reading on iPad: I open a web-page, such as a link-heavy article, and spawn many many links from the page in tabs. The overall experience has regressed in iOS 11 beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page in Safari with links\r\n2. Drag-and-drop a link over the spring-loaded New Tab button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew page opens in background because of my \"Open New Tabs In Background\" preference.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNew page is foregrounded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
