    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you use an Xcode editor theme that has a medium-dark color scheme, the I-Beam mouse pointer becomes almost impossible to see unless you are looking at it directly.  With my preferred medium-contrast theme (background color of #3F4630) I often can't find the pointer even while actively searching for it while moving the mouse!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a code file in Xcode and change the Fonts & Colors theme to Civic.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the mouse pointer to be easy to see, regardless of my choice of theme.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe I-Beam mouse pointer that is shown when the pointer is in the code editing area becomes very hard to see, particularly when it's located in an area that's dense with text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTake a look at the attached screenshot and see how long it takes to find the mouse pointer.  Now imagine that on a 27\" monitor\r\n\r\nTerminal.app has a \"Use high contrast I beam\" option, which would be a step in the right direction, but ideally I should be able to pick a color for the pointer just like I pick colors for the cursor, the text area, and all the other elements of the theme."
