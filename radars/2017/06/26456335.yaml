    description: "Summary:\r\nMaps and MapKit are unable to understand \"unique\" or \"post office box only\" zip codes in the US. These are zip codes that are assigned to a single high-volume address or a post office facility. Most mapping services like Google Maps and MapQuest have no problem understanding these zip codes.\r\n\r\nWikipedia has a brief explanation of these types of zip codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code#By_type.2Fuse\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the Maps app or the MKLocalSearch API to search for a string like \"14603\", which is the zip code for a specific post office in New York.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should find the correct location, which is a post office near the center of Rochester, NY.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt finds a location near Niagara Falls, with the zip code 14303. As search for \"ROCHESTER NY 14603\" actually shows up outside of Minneapolis. \"ROCHESTER, NY 14603\" does manage to get fairly close, guessing \"Rochester, NY 14606\"â€”but it's still not correct.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example, there are many others that also fail.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.2 (I've also tried 9.3.3 beta 1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wasn't really sure whether to mark this as a bug or enhancement request. As a user it looks like a bug when Maps and apps that use MapKit fail to understand these zip codes, while Google understands them perfectly fine. As a developer that understands these zip codes it seems more like an enhancement request!"
