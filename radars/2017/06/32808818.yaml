    description: "Summary:\r\nIn macOS, typing a character when some text already selected should replace the entire selection with the character. However, this does not seem to be the case when typing the opening square bracket character \"[\". Instead of replacing the selected text with the character, Xcode 9 attempts to wrap the selection within square brackets. See attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select some text in Xcode 9 source editor (objective-c source code)\r\n2. Type the opening square bracket \"[\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected text should be fully replaced by the square bracket\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe selected text becomes enclosed in square brackets instead\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
