    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis is a large security risk since users are being trained to enter their Apple ID password while using 3rd party apps. This opens up the possibility that a malign 3rd party app could use the same prompt and request a user's Apple ID password. The iOS-provided prompt has no indication that it is Apple-sourced or otherwise legitimate, so there's no way for a user to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change your Apple ID password on macOS, using Safari.\r\n2. Unlock an iPhone.\r\n3. Start using apps that are not published by Apple.\r\n4. A prompt to enter your Apple ID password appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOption A: The prompt looks different than other prompts to indicate that it is safe to enter your password\r\nOption B: The prompt does not appear at all until the user is on the home screen or using an Apple app\r\nOption C: If the UIAlertController title or message contains the word password, add a note that \"Apple will never ask or request for your Apple ID password in an alert.\"\r\nOption D (my favorite): The UIAlertController contains no text field whatsoever, and simply has an action (\"Re-enter Password\" ?) that redirects the user to Settings.app to enter their credentials. Also include the note in Option C in the alert.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe prompt looks like a normal UIAlertController, thereby normalizing user behavior to enter their Apple ID password into random alert views. See attachment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 (14F89)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB T-Mobile"
