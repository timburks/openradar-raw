    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8, when scrolling through the Build Settings tab of your project, it was easy to distinguish build settings that were customized from the default since their rows appeared bold. In Xcode 9 this is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\r\n2. Navigate to Build Settings\r\n3. Filter by \"Customized\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe customized build settings rows are bold\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe rows look the same as non-customized build settings\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 1 (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the screenshot Xcode 9 beta 1 is on the left, and Xcode 8.3.2 on the right."
