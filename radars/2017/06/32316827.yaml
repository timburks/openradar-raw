    description: "Summary:\r\nPrior to Xcode 8 it was possible to search for build settings by their command-line argument equivalent (e.g. searching for \"-Wdocumentation\" filtered to the CLANG_WARN_DOCUMENTATION_COMMENTS build setting). Xcode 8 removed the command line arguments from build setting Quick Help, so this is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project settings\r\n2. Select the Build Settings tab\r\n3. Select \"All\"\r\n4. Enter \"-Wdocumentation\" in the build setting search field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild settings are filtered to include the \"Documentation Comments\" (CLANG_WARN_DOCUMENTATION_COMMENTS) build setting.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAll build settings are filtered out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2/8E2002\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis worked in Xcode 7.\r\n\r\nThis was a useful ability for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- If after reviewing the build log you wanted to know what a particular compiler or linker option did, you could search for the equivalent build setting and view the Quick Help text right in the IDE.\r\n- In the case of options added specifically for Apple LLVM, Xcode's Quick Help is sometimes the *only* source of documentation for the compiler flag.\r\n- If you needed to disable a warning you could copy the compiler flag from the build log and then search for it to find the equivalent build setting.\r\n- If you already knew a compiler flag you wanted to set you could search for it to find out if Xcode had an equivalent build setting."
