    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDrag-and-drop provides a new way to open tabs. It's not perfect.\r\n\r\nThis radar chain (see also: <rdar://problem/32996994>, <rdar://problem/32997088>) centers around a reasonably common action for me while reading on iPad: I open a web-page, such as a link-heavy article, and spawn many many links from the page in tabs. The overall experience has regressed in iOS 11 beta.\r\n\r\nI explore in <rdar://problem/32997088> that retaining the Safari long-press menu for links and images is sub-optimal when drags preempt them, necessitating that I wait longer. After struggling with this for a few minutes, I eventually found that the New Tab toolbar item is spring-loaded. This was completely un-discoverable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I open a webpage.\r\n2. I want to open links from the webpage.\r\n3. I tap-and-hold on the link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can open multiple tabs quickly.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI must wait for a drag to engage before the long-press even shows, then wait for it to end before tapping in the action sheet. This process is noticeably longer than iOS 10 and still way way way longer than macOS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPossibility: by default or through an accessibility setting, the system indexes views that have added a spring-loading interaction or have activated an SDK-provided one.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
