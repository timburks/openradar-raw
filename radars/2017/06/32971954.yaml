    description: "Summary:\r\niOS flags possible spelling errors, but unlike macOS, doesn't offer a \"Learn Spelling\" option. In cases where the word is correctly spelled, the offered replacement are either incorrect, or \"No Replacement Found\" which is useless. Please add \"Learn Spelling\" so we can train iOS dictionaries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType unknown, but correctly spelled, word on iOS\r\nObserve red underline indicating spell check\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrompt \"Learn Spelling\" which results in red underline disappearing\r\nFuture uses of word are recognized (and appear as spell check options)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nEither \"No Replacement Found,\" which is reasonable, or completely incorrect replacements that would be bad if applied automatically. For example company or product names."
