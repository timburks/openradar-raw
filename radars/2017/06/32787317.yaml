    description: "Summary:\r\nGoogle Drive, OneDrive, and various other cloud storage solutions provide the ability to download a folder as a zip file. This can be very useful when e.g. a user wants to download a project, but either iCloud is restricted by MDM, or theyâ€™re using Windows. The iCloud web app should provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Store many related files in iCloud Drive, like a folder containing files for a project.\r\n2. Visit icloud.com and launch the iCloud Drive app.\r\n3. Single-click on a folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDownload button is available; clicking it begins generating and downloading a zip file.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDownload button is disabled while a folder is selected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
