    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 11 we have been experiencing issues with our widget. From our testing it seems like the viewWillTransition method on widget’s UIViewController is not being called when the first call to widgetActiveDisplayModeDidChange happens. After than any calls to widgetActiveDisplayModeDidChange will trigger viewWillTransition though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open attached project\n2) Run the NotificationCenterWidget target\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDebugger console should have 2 lines printed:\n1) widgetActiveDisplayModeDidChange was called\n2) viewWillTransition was called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDebugger console has just one line printed:\n1) widgetActiveDisplayModeDidChange was called\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happens only on the initial layout pass, after user manually taps on the “Show More” button, both of the methods are called.\n\nThis worked fine on iOS 10."
