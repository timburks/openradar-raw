    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #32881405\r\n\r\nIn DEBUG builds of an iOS app that calls `SKStoreReviewController.requestReview()`, upon giving a rating and pressing the CANCEL button from the Review UI, a crash occurs. \r\n\r\nThis crash is intermittent and only appears to occur on DEBUG builds when the user presses CANCEL from the SKStoreReviewController alert view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch a DEBUG build of an iOS app that uses the SKStoreReviewController.requestReview() API function.\r\n2. Trigger the SKStoreReviewController.requestReview API to call the review screen to show up.\r\n3. Slide your finger across the stars of the rating alert\r\n4. Press the Cancel button which will dismiss the rating alert\r\n5. The crash may occur.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpon pressing the CANCEL button of the rating prompt, the SKStoreReviewController should dismiss gracefully and silently to the user in DEBUG builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn intermittentâ€‹ crash will occur in DEBUG builds when pressing the CANCEL button from the SKStoreReviewController.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue does not appear to happen every time the SKStoreReviewController is presented to the user. It appears to occur more often when a star rating is given then the Cancel button pressed."
