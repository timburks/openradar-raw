    description: "Summary:\r\nBefore Xcode 9, Re-Indent puts the cursor to the beginning of the line *if it was before the beginning* before indention, which makes it easy to subsequently edit code at the beginning of the line. Now in Xcode 9, the cursor is indented with same relative movement as the code which is not a useful behavior. I think it is a regression.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find any line of code with some space before its final indented beginning.\r\n2. Pus cursor at the beginning of the space before the line.\r\n3. Re-Indent. Notice the cursor doesn't move to the beginning of the code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor moves to the beginning of the code.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe cursor doesn't move to the beginning of the code."
