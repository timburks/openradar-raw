    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Swift, command-click on an operator to jump to the definition. Would be great if C++ can do that as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDeclare a C++ operator in a class\nTry command-clicking\nObserve nothing happens\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould jump to define\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoesnâ€™t jump\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo sample as you will have a ton of code around that already uses C++ operators, or see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators for some sample code."
