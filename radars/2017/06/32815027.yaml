    description: "When using the iPhone simulator on a Mac with a trackpad it feels natural to attempt swipe and pinch gestures on the trackpad and expect them to control the simulator. Unfortunately it appears this is not supported by the latest iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe Mac trackpad and OS X can already interpret gestures which allow you to pinch and zoom images in Photos, perform swipes to scroll content vertically and horizontally. So it would be great if there was a Connect Hardware Trackpad setting in the iOS simulator which allowed the simulator to capture all touches on the trackpad and translate them into multitouch events in iOS.\r\n\r\nThis could be something you can toggle on and off using a Mac keyboard shortcut as when trackpad capturing was on you would loose some control over the host operating system. Alternatively the simulator might only capture multi touch events when the mouse pointer is within the simulator region.\r\n\r\nI find myself trying to control the simulator like this constantly as it's feels natural and am disappointed when it does work. Attempt to scroll by holding down the trackpad and flicking is very hard so this would be a great addition to the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iOS Simulator\r\n2. Attempt to scroll some scrollable content by sliding on the trackpad or attempt to zoom an image in Photos.app on the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the gestures to just work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe simulator doesn't capture gestures or translate multi touch events on the trackpad.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a"
