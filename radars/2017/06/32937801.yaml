    description: "Although UITextField's API indicates that its `text` property is an optional string (String?), in practice it never produces nil. If there is no text programmatically assigned to an instance, or entered by a user, its `text` property will return an empty string which must be unwrapped. As mentioned, this contradicts its API, which could lead to bugs or unexpected behavior. At best, it creates an annoyance in handling the unnecessary optional.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nlet foo = UITextField()\r\nfoo.text == nil\r\nfoo.text = nil\r\nfoo.text == nil\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth nil checks produce true\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBoth nil checks produce false\r\n\r\niOS Version/Build:\r\nLatest iOS SDK as of Xcode 9 beta 2, but I've personally confirmed back to Xcode 8.3 and a search of open radars shows the related radar 25780524 which was opened April 18th 2016, so the issue could stretch back as far as Xcode 7 iOS SDKs."
