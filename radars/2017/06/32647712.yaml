    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 11, when prompted for my Apple ID password, I’m unable to paste my password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install iOS 11\r\n2. After finishing setup, iOS shows an alert that asks for the Apple ID password\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this does *not* apply to the alert that asks for *both* Apple ID and password, which you get when you’re not signed in at all. I’m unsure how to trigger the alert that only asks for a password, other than installing iOS 11.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to be able to enter a password by pasting.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways happens on my iPhone 7"
