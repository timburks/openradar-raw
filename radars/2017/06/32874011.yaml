    description: "Area:\r\nHealth App\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPer rdar://29144768, third party apps should be able to add workouts to Health.app to populate the activity rings. Full note from radar:\r\n\r\n> Summary values are computed from other values that third party apps can get write access to. You donâ€™t write appleExerciseTime, you write a workout or other activity and the summary query takes those into account automatically. Activity Summaries should never get write or share access.\r\n\r\nWhen a workout from today or yesterday is added to the health store, it is added correctly once a paired Apple Watch processes the workout. However, workouts that occurred more than two days in the past have no effect on exercise minutes for those past days.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (\"Radar20Jun2017.zip\").\r\n2. Build and run in the simulator.\r\n3. Allow access to writing workout data.\r\n4. Tap \"Continue\" after you have provided access.\r\n5. Wait until the alert has appeared that says \"Workout has been saved.\"\r\n6. Open Health.app.\r\n7. Tap \"Activity\".\r\n8. Note that a 1 hour workout has been logged in the workout section for this month (see attachment \"Radar20Jun2017-1.png\").\r\n9. Now tap on \"Exercise Minutes\".\r\n10. Tap on the \"M\" label in the segmented control at the top.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn hour of exercise minutes is shown to have been logged for the month.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo exercise minutes are visible. (see attachment \"Radar20Jun2017-2.png\")\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
