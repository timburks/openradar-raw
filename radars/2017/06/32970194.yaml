    description: "Summary:\r\nEnabling \"Use Safe Area Layout Guide\" for a Storyboard created with Xcode 8 should automatically convert all constraints that were using top and bottom layout guides. If there was a constraint to a top or bottom layout guide that was using \"standard spacing\" that spacing is lost when converted to use the safe layout guide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project with Xcode 8.3.3 using the single view template\r\n2. Use Interface Builder to drag a new view onto the root view of the view controller.\r\n3. Add constraints from the view to the leading and trailing container margins and the top and bottom layout guides.\r\n4. Using the attributes inspector modify the Constant value for the top and bottom constraints to use \"Standard\" spacing.\r\n5. Build and run the project. On an iPhone 7 the view should have 8 points of spacing to the status bar and the bottom of the screen.\r\n6. Stop and close the project in Xcode 8 (see attached SafeArea8).\r\n6. Open the project in Xcode 9 and in Interface Builder enable \"Use Safe Area Layout Guides\" in the file inspector. (see attached project SafeArea9)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The top and bottom layout guides in the Storyboard scene are replaced by a safe area layout guide\r\n2. The top and bottom constraints have standard spacing to the top and bottom anchors of the safe area layout guide\r\n3. The view has the same position when run as before.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. safe area layout guide added as expected\r\n2. the constraints appear to have \"Standard\" spacing in the attributes inspector\r\n3. When run there is no spacing between the view and the status bar or the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is possible to create vertical constraints with \"Standard\" spacing to top and bottom layout guides but not to the top and bottom anchors of the safe area layout guide."
