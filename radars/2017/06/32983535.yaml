    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m running Xcode 9 beta 2 (and also Xcode 8.3) on 10.12 locally, and 10.13 in VMWare Fusion, and to be able to kick off integrations and edit bots, I need to frequently restart Xcode locally and restart the VM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click on a Bot in Xcode\n2. Click “Edit Bot”\n3. Change a pre-integration trigger\n4. Click Done\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBot saves successfully\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo modal sheets appear simultaneously (overlapping), stating “Internal Error Updating Bot”, “Please try configuring the bot again.”. I get the same behavior with Xcode 8.3 on the client side.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnce I get the “Internal Error Updating Bot” errors, I am unable to edit bots anymore. The only workaround I’ve found is restarting the server machine, and also restarting Xcode."
