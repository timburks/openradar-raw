    description: "The most recent version of Clang has 'objc_boxable' attribute, that can be used within C structures to box them into NSValue.\r\nHere is more info:https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/commit/3849076ca69f4277bfac55479c2fc0929f5bbd9d\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInitially I hardcoded the structures into compiler, but I was pointed by John McCall that the best way is to add special attribute, so that it's possible to mark C structures easily.\r\nHowever, it didn't happen."
