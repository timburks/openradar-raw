    description: "I'm trying to create CGBitmapContexts which match the pixel format of the CGContext in UIView's drawView. I tried to force them to be 8 bit on Wide Color devices by using self.layer.contentsFormat, but that setting is ignored. In fact, it incorrectly reports \"RGBA8\" when queried on a Wide Color device even though the context in drawView is reports 16 bits per component.\r\n\r\nThere is a bizarre workaround. By simply implementing an empty implementation of layerWillDraw(_ layer: CALayer) then the context will receive an 8 bit backed context on Wide Color devices.\r\n\r\nSet the contentsFormat of a view's layer on a Wide Color device. Observe that within drawView, \"UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext().bitsPerComponent\" will return 16 no matter what the layer's contentsFormat is set to.\r\n\r\nNow, add an empty implementation of layerWillDraw(_ layer: CALayer). Even on a Wide Color device now when drawView is called \"UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext().bitsPerComponent\" will return 8."
