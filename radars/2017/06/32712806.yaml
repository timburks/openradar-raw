    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI understand for privacy reasons you wanted the user to know when an app was getting the user's location. However, I personally find it pretty distracting because colors will randomly flash on the screen. \r\n\r\nI gave these apps permission to access my location. I have the option to say only do it when using the app, I chose to let them track me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Allow an app to use your location In the background\r\n* Leave the app\r\n* Wait for that app to try to access it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI don't want to see anything. (put some icon in the status bar if you want)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nA colored banner appears while they are accessing the location, saying that the app is accessing it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'd like a way to at least turn this off in the settings system wide\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
