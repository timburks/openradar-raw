    description: "Area:\r\nCalendar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsers running iOS 10.3.2 attaching to our Exchange environment are reporting seeing numerous meeting invites in their Outlook mailbox. These URLs detail the issue: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ericwhitehill/2017/05/10/smart-forward-on-ios-devices-or-why-am-i-seeing-so-many-calendar-invites/  and https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/help/4014990/meeting-invites-are-forwarded-by-an-attendee\r\n\r\nAfter troubleshooting, the workaround for this problem is disabling the \"Time to Leave\" feature in iOS under Settings...Calendar...Default Alert Times...Time to Leave.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup Exchange meeting, attach iOS 10.3.2 to account via Exchange ActiveSync and keep Time to Leave enabled. Set location of meeting to someplace other than where you are at, when it gets close to meeting time, dismiss the time to leave prompt. This causes the multiple meeting invites in the mailbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should not see any additional meeting invites being sent if Time to Leave is enabled on iOS.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nMultiple meeting invites show up in the user's Exchange mailbox.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 (14F89)"
