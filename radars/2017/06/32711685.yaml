    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn recent versions of Xcode (such as 8) pressing Command + S in the simulator would save a scaled screenshot to the desktop. This is still true in Xcode 9, but there's a strange sizing issue I noticed in Xcode 9's iPhone 7 and Plus simulator. 100% and 200% screenshots are same size, while 50% and actual size are smaller. This seems wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iPhone simulator from Xcode 9\r\n2. From the Menu Bar, select Window > Scale > 200% \r\n3. Hit Command + S to save a simulator screenshot to desktop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 200% screenshot should be larger than the 100% screenshot.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe 200% screenshot is the same size as the 100% screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9 simulator on macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73)"
