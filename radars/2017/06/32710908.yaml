    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease consider adding the ability to drag and drop cluster annotations (MKClusterAnnotation) on the map, just like regular annotations. I have provided my use case, which I believe to be a genuine and useful one, below.\r\n\r\nMy photography app has a geotagging feature, in which users can drag and drop photos from a tray onto a map to geotag them at the dropped location. Additionally, photos may be placed on the map automatically either from reading geotags built into the photos, or by comparing the photos' timestamps to a location history recorded by the user. \r\n\r\nOne feature is that the user can pick up a pin from the map and move it somewhere else to alter a geotag. While at first glance this seems like a useless feature, there are a few reasons a user might want to alter a geotag:\r\n\r\n- Data accuracy. To save battery, many cameras cache GPS fix data with a reasonably high refresh time. This can cause tags to be inaccurate. Also, depending on the accuracy of the GPS fix, the geotag might be incorrect. \r\n\r\n- Privacy. Geotags can be accurate to within a small number of meters. A photographer might want to move geotags away from their house, but still keep a geotag in their town for archiving and search reasons. \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, it would be useful to be able to alter many geotags at a time. For instance, if Iâ€™ve been wandering around the garden taking photos of my kids, I could zoom out a little so all of the tags are clustered, then pick up that cluster and drop it on the town marker on the map to move all of those geotags there in one operation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Set up a project that presents and MKMapView and add annotations close to one another with clustering allowed.\r\n2) When dequeuing annotation views for the annotations, ensure the views has isDraggable set to true.\r\n3) Attempt to drag the annotation around the map, and observe that it is possible.\r\n4) Zoom out to cause the annotations to cluster together.\r\n5) Attempt to drag the clustered annotation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect there to be an (opt-in?) way to allow clustered annotations to be dragged around the map.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe clustered annotation (MKClusterAnnotation) is not draggable. I recognise that this is by design at the moment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0/15A5278f"
