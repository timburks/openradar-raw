    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I open my AirPods case next to an iOS device, a graphic appears showing the battery levels. This is useful, and appears more reliably in iOS 11. It would be even more useful if I could connect my AirPods to that device by tapping a button in that view. It's strange that I can check the battery levels so much easier than I can actually use them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair AirPods with an iOS device\r\n2. Turn on another iOS device signed into the same iCloud account\r\n3. Open the AirPods case near that device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view that appears should include a button that lets me connect the AirPods to that device.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI can only see the battery levels from the view that appears (as well as a nice graphic of the headphones themselves).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 (15A5304i)"
