    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe large title in iOS 11 is used for announcements, identity; big statements. Liberal use of inherited large titles from the mailbox screen feels un-designed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail\r\n2. Select Edit\r\n3. Tap on a Message\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEntering edit mode and selecting a message should collapse the large navigation title to reflect its purpose of showing context, a la the bottom status bar in macOS.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDisabling the back bar button item and changing the title, with the inheriting the large title from the main mailbox leaves a very large amount of whitespace.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
