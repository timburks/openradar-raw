    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController allows to rename a document by long-pressing on it and then tapping “Rename”. The transition animates the thumbnail image of the document to the center of the screen, but doesn’t take into account the frame of the keyboard that is appearing at the same time. Therefore the image is animated to the wrong frame and then jumps up, once the animation is finished.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the built-in Files app\n2. Long-press on a document with a thumbnail image\n3. Tap on “Rename”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe thumbnail animates to its final position\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe thumbnail first animates to the center of the screen, and then jumps up\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo sample project needed, can be replicated with the built-in Files app"
