    description: "Summary:\r\nPer rdar://29144768, developers should be able to write Activity Summaries to Health.app, but the explanation I received in that bug report is not visible on the public documentation. This documentation should be available so that developers can understand how to add to the user's Activity Summaries.\r\n\r\n> Summary values are computed from other values that third party apps can get write access to. You don’t write appleExerciseTime, you write a workout or other activity and the summary query takes those into account automatically. Activity Summaries should never get write or share access.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the HKActivitySummary documentation. Link: https://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit/hkactivitysummary\r\n2. Look for documentation on this page on how to save activity summaries to the user's local health store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation contains information how to add HKActivitySummary data to Health.app. E.g., from the previous radar I filed:\r\n\r\n> Summary values are computed from other values that third party apps can get write access to. You don’t write appleExerciseTime, you write a workout or other activity and the summary query takes those into account automatically. Activity Summaries should never get write or share access.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe documentation states: \"You can instantiate your own HKActivitySummary objects (if needed), but you cannot save HKActivitySummary objects to the store.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
