    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController offers the possibility to specify additional leading or trailing UIBarButtonItems, which is very neat. However, the default UI itself already takes up so much space (e.g. default item \"Select\"), that specifying 2 additional trailing items with an image already results in a more than crowded NavigationBar on iPhone, once a title is shown (e.g. drilled-down into a Folder).\n\nSince UIDocumentBrowserViewController doesn't give us any other way to add custom global actions like showing the In-App Settings, Help etc., this is a serious problem for document-based apps on iPhone.  It would be very easy to integrate the \"Recent Documents\" into the \"Browse\" Tab, leaving space for a UIToolbar instead of the UITabBar at the bottom. UIDocumentBrowserViewController is the only sane option for document-based apps going forward, so it's very important that it can be better customized to the different Apps' needs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based App on iPhone 6 in Portrait mode\n2. Create a new Folder named \"Secret Folder\"\n3. Open the Folder\n4. Observe the NavigationBar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything looks nice and clean, the name of the Folder is visible, the ViewController title and the buttons are visible and legible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NavigationBar looks very crowded and the Title of the current folder is barely visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPossible solutions:\n 1. Remove default \"Select\" button from NavigationBar and place it somewhere else\n 2. Allow us to only show additional items on certain screens (e.g. the first level, not when we are drilled-down into another level)\n 3. Give us the option to show a Toolbar at the Bottom instead of the default TabBar, which only has 2 options. The \"Recents\" TabBar Entry could be easily integrated into the \"Browse\" Tab and would free us from the need to always show a TabBar at the bottom"
