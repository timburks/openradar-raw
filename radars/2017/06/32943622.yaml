    description: "Summary:\r\nKeynote 7.2 (or previous versions) does not support magic move changes between movies. Doing so would provide more impactful presentations, and Apple has shown similar enhancements on WWDC 2017, or previous events. It would be very good to share those with the rest of Keynote presenters. Furthermore, similar concepts exist in HTML5 through CSS transforms, which would allow for the technique to be used in the iCloud version of Keynote.\r\n\r\nAn example of the desired outcome is shown in the HomePod page (https://www.apple.com/homepod/), where a \"transform: translate3d(0px, X px, 0px);\" style is applied to the movie as a result of swiping on the page.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a similar 3D transform should be applicable to the movies in Keynote, and Magic Move should animate between values in the 3D transform.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a blank slide (Slide_1)\r\n2. Insert a movie in slide 1, say 5 seconds long\r\n3. Duplicate Slide_1 in Slide_2\r\n4. Set the poster frame for the movie in Slide_2 to 2.0 seconds in.\r\n5. Insert a Magic Move transition between Slide_1 and Slide_2\r\n6. Reproduce presentation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen doing the transition, the movie should animate from the poster frame in Slide_1 to the poster frame for the movie in Slide_2 within the number of seconds indicated in the Magic Move transition.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe movies are not matched between slides, and only a fade is produced.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nKeynote 7.2 (or prior)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (or prior)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
