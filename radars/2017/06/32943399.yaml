    description: "Summary:\r\nNSDistributedNotificationCenter should be available as an easy way to communicate between processes. While on iOS it may not make sense to be able to communicate between completely unrelated processes, it would be nice if it would be possible to communicate between processes from the same app (extensions / containing app) or maybe even between apps from the same developer in an easy way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile communicating between an extension and its containing app is possible right now, doing so in a nice way with a good interface requires some wrapping or usage of third party frameworks. NSDistributedNotificationCenter seems to be a good way of erasing the need of such a third party framework even if it would only be enabled for extension <-> containing app communication."
