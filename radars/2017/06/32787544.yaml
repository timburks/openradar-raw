    description: "Summary:\r\nGoogle provides a feature called Takeout that allows a user to download a backup of the content they have stored on their service. This includes their cloud storage, email, calendar, browser bookmarks, etc. iCloud users should be able to export (at minimum) all files stored in iCloud Drive and all stored emails in one go. This allows the user to have a local backup, or move their data to another service if they switch away from the Apple ecosystem. This seems especially important to have now that users have more freedom to store data in iCloud with iOS 11, but can’t easily download a backup of except with a Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Accumulate months or years of content in iCloud.\r\n2. Decide you want a current backup of all iCloud content, or that you no longer want to use iCloud.\r\n3. Search how to export all data from iCloud.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn Apple support page describing how to export all data in one go, or an icloud.com page that performs this task.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nUser most likely finds https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204055, which only provides a solution for when the content is already entirely on the user’s Mac (they might not have a Mac), or downloading files individually.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
