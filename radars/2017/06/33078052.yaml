    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen doing a clean installation, the time zone chosen in the install assistant isn’t honored. The system is always in the Pacific time zone.\r\n\r\nIt’s possible to set the time zone in the Date & Time system preference pane, but the choice made during installation never takes effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do a clean install. (For example, boot from an SD card made by createinstallmedia, and erase the disk before installing).\r\n2. Near the end of the installation, when asked to choose a time zone, choose anything other than the Pacific time zone. Choose New York, for example.\r\n3. Complete the installation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe system’s clock should reflect the chosen time zone.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe system’s clock reflects the Pacific time zone regardless of what was chosen during installation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.3db2u1 17A291m.\r\n\r\nI also experienced this in 10.13db1 17A264c and 10.13db2 17A291j.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have seen this bug both when trying to set the time zone to New York and UTC."
