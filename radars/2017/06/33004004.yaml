    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController allows to sort documents by Name, Date, Size and Tags. For both \"Name\" and \"Tags\" the sorting is clear, it isn't however for \"Date\" and \"Size\" in Grid View. In this view neither the date nor the size of a document is shown, figuring out whether the sorting happens ascending or descending is left as an exercise for the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open the Files app\n2. go to any folder with several documents in it\n3. enable grid view\n4. sort by date\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe date is shown, when the documents are sorted by date (respectively size)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date is only shown in list view\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo need for a sample project, can be reproduced with built-in Files app"
