    description: "Summary:\r\nUIAccessibilityCustomAction is a very important class to enhance Accessibility Support of our app. In our current self-implemented Document Picker we added custom actions to allow for easy renaming, duplication, moving and deletion of documents. UIDocumentBrowserViewController however neither has support for custom actions out of the box, nor allows to add them on our own.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Files.app\n2. Enable VoiceOver on the Device\n3. Put the VoiceOver Cursor on a document\n4. Swipe up/down to select custom actions\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are actions available to duplicate, move, delete, (etc.) a document\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is only an action to drag a document and there is no way to add custom UIAccessibilityCustomActions in UIDocumentBrowserViewController\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a serious accessibility regression for us, as it makes handling of documents through VoiceOver much harder"
