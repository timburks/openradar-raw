Open a radar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe description is expanded by default\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe description is collapsed by default, even when there are no comments\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from the old bug reporter.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G12b)"
