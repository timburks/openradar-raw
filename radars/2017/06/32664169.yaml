    description: "Summary:\r\nBuilding a project that uses C++ with Xcode 9, results in “ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7” errors. This issue only occurs during release builds. We observed the issue in our framework (PSPDFKit) and could also reproduce it in an isolated sample project. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the provided C++Test project. Use the Xcode Archive action to build a release build of the application. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should build without any linked errors. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe following linker error occurs:\r\n\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture armv7:\r\n  \"operator new(unsigned long, std::align_val_t)\", referenced from:\r\n      triggerStuff() in Test.o\r\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLimiting the application to arm64 works around the issue, but is obviously not a viable workaround:\r\n\r\n<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>\r\n  \t<array>\r\n\t\t<string>arm64</string>"
