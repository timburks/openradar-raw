    description: "Summary:\r\nIt appears that introducing groups into regex search doesn't support replacing groups using \"$1\" format\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI searched for following pattern within the file: self\\.(\\w+Block)\r\nIt matched around 10 results\r\nIn replace text field I typed _$1 which to my understanding should've replaced property access to ivar access, e.g. self.didAnimateBlock should've been replaced with _didAnimateBlock\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmatches should've been replaced with corresponding regex groups\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nall the matches were replaced with _$1 string\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)"
