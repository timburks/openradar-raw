    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS11 and before version, when a customized image is set to navigation bar back button, the default back image will be hidden. However, In iOS11, both back images(the default one and the customized one) will be shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Make a navigation controller as root and add a button that pushes another view controller\n3. Add UIBarButtonItem.appearance().setBackButtonBackgroundImage(image, for: .normal, barMetrics: .default) to the AppDelegate with some image\n4. Run the app and tap the button that pushes another view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the image you set should be shown in the back button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe default back button image is shown as well\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIâ€™m attaching a sample project that shows the issue, as well as two images that show it (using a 50x50 red image)"
