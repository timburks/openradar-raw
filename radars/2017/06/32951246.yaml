    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #32873040\r\n\r\nWhen developing and testing my apps, I often need to see what's going on within my app's sandbox, especially in the Documents folder. I can open it up in Finder when testing on the simulator by finding the directory's path and navigating to it, but this is impossible when testing on an actual iOS device, and thus, I cannot view the contents of my app's folders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the following code on the iOS simulator. You will be able to access the folder on macOS, and view its contents, allowing you to better test your app. When run on a physical iOS device, there is no way to access that directory.\r\n\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither be able to access the directory through Finder on macOS, or by using a dedicated tool bundled with Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am unable to access the directory.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.3, 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
