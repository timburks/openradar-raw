    description: "Summary:\r\niCloud has a handy feature, that lets the user browse and restore old versions of a document. Since UIDocumentBrowserViewController is the new default UI to browse documents on iOS, it should offer a default implementation of a Versions UI, freeing all developers from rolling their own and inconsistent UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Files app\n2. Try to restore an old version of a document\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's possible to restore an old version of a document, and the same UI is available in the in-app UIDocumentBrowserViewController\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not possible to restore an old version of a document, developers have to create their own, potentially inconsistent UI\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo need for a sample project, can be reproduced with the built-in Files app"
