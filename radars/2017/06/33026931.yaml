    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you use `__auto_type` to declare a variable, it does not inherit any nullability definitions marked by the return type of the value being assigned.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt is easy to reproduce this with any _Nullable return type in Foundation, for example -[NSBundle pathForResource:ofType:], which is defined as such: `- (nullable NSString *)pathForResource:(nullable NSString *)name ofType:(nullable NSString *)ext;`\r\n\r\nThis can easily be setup:\r\n\r\n__auto_type path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@“foo” ofType:@“txt”];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`path` should be the type `NSString * _Nullable` because __auto_type should inherit nullability.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`path` has the type `NSString *` and is assumed _Nonnull\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis can affect the use nullability warnings, since __auto_type will mark variables as assumed _Nonnull and therefore not be caught by `-Wnullable-to-nonnull-conversion`\n\nI know this has been reported before and was put off because of complexity, yet I post it again because it would *really* help to prevent bugs."
