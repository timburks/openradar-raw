    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I want to open notification from the lock screen, this is my intent. It means that it comes first, I don't think \"I want to unlock the phone and then open notification\" where this is exactly the model iOS enforces on me. \r\nI also consider this a regression from iOS 10. In iOS 10 it was possible to slide notification and *then* being prompted to type in passcode or use touch id to unlock the phone.\r\nIn iOS 11 the only way to reproduce the same behavior is to force touch notification and tap opened view again. This is 2 taps instead of one swipe previously.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 (Model 1660, 1778, 1779, 1780)"
