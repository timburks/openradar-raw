    description: "Area:\r\nCore Bluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe sample App is the central and starts scanning when UIApplicationDidBecomeActive is fired and stops scanning when UIApplicationWillResignActive is fired. When pulling up the control center the app stops/starts scanning reliably. But when the app is suspended when pressing the home button and the user waits a little bit and opens the app again, scanning does NOT start.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a service UUID to the sample project of a peripheral that is in the vicinity.\r\n2. Open the App. The text view should be filled with logs of the peripherals properties and a log count.\r\n3. Close the App by pressing the home button.\r\n4. Wait for a short amount of time (~10s).\r\n5. Open the App again.\r\n6. The app now may NOT get new didDiscover peripheral calls.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should get new didDiscover peripheral calls after scanForPeripherals was called when UIApplicationDidBecomeActive was fired.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app does NOT get new didDiscover peripheral calls after scanForPeripherals was called when UIApplicationDidBecomeActive was fired.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta 1 (15A5278f)\r\niPhone 6 (Model: NG4A2ZD/A)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA sample project is attached with a video that shows the issue in action. The bug is not always reproducible.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe circumstances that show the bug are random and not clear."
