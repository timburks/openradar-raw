    description: "Summary:\r\nNot every undefined behavior is bad or really undefined, sometimes __attribute__((no_sanitize(\"integer\"))) is required. This works great for C functions and ObjC methods, but we get in trouble when methods use blocks to calculate data, as the attribute doesn’t apply there and there’s also no way to add such attribute to a block.\t\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample, see UBSan assertion.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome way to prevent that UBSan assertion\t\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can’t find any way. Not even with manual exclusion lists\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suggest that inline blocks automatically get this attribute OR that at least there’s a way to apply the attribute to them - includig blocks created for method calls like in the sample.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9b1"
