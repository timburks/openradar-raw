    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using capture groups in regular expressions, those groups should be interpolatable in the replace text using $1, $2, ..., $n. Xcode 9 does not interpolate them in the source editor's search/replace (⌘ ⌥ F). The Find navigator's replace does still perform the interpolation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use a capture group with regular expression search/replace in the source editor (not the Find navigator).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the captured matching patterns to be written back into the source editor upon replacing.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe capture group interpolator symbols ($1, $2, etc) are written in place of the matched patterns."
