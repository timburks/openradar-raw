    description: "Summary:\r\nnetworksetup: add functionality to set preferred network\n\nnetworksetup cli tool allows to list, add (at index) and remove one or all preferred wireless networks. In enterprise environments, we need to set the preferred network. \n\nBusiness Case: While setting up the Mac via DEP, it is not uncommon to choose a guest Wi-Fi network during MacBuddy. We will then push a SCEP+Wi-Fi profile which will arrive at index 1 (vs. 0). Meaning the computer will preferably connect to the guest network. \n\nWe could delete the guest network, but we'd like to keep it in case the corporate network go down, or when visiting certain affiliates where the corporate network is connected differently. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup Mac via MacBuddy\n2. Connect to a guest network during setup\n3. Push a profile with a Wi-Fi network\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPushed Wi-Fi network should either be set at index 0, or we should have an option to script it. In this case networksetup is a good start\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPushed Wi-Fi network is appended to preferred networks array.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'd like to have an option like \"networksetup -setpreferrednetwork <device name> <network>\""
