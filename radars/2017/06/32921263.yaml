    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9 does not add the current file name to the list of suggested Code Completions. This is a regression from Xcode 8.3. \nIt has proven quite useful to me, as often I create a Swift file and then start writing a struct with the same name, which used to be then autocompleted. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swiftfile named MyFile.swift in Xcode 9\n2. Start typing My into the source code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should suggest MyFile as a code completion\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 9 does not suggest MyFile as a code completion\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d) with Swift 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
