    description: "Summary:\r\nThe address book is not part of the iTunes / Apple Configurator backup anymore on iOS 11, if the device is set up as a \"new device\".\r\nIt works fine when an iOS 10 backup has been restored to an iOS 11 device, the address book is part of the backup.  But when you back up a fresh new iOS 11 installed device, contacts are not backed up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install iOS 11 on a fresh erased device\r\n2. Add a \"test\" contact in Contacts app\r\n3. Back up the device with iTunes\r\n4. Erase the device\r\n5. Restore the backup with iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"test\" contact should be restored to the device.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe \"test\" contact is not restored to the device."
