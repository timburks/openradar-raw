    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 11, a full-sized WKWebView is pushed down by the height of the status bar.  The `viewport-fit=cover` workaround for this is not documented, and a change from the default behaviour from previous iOS versions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an app with a full-sized WKWebView as its main view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web view should fill the full screen, including behind the status bar.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe web view is pushed down by the height of the status bar. In particular, content scrolls behind the status bar when scrolling the page, but fixed position elements do not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 1 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is viewable in a sample app: https://github.com/dpogue/WKScrollTest/tree/visual-viewport\r\nEdit ViewController.swift and change VIEWPORT to \"auto\".\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThere is an undocumented workaround to restore the old behaviour via `viewport-fit=cover` in the meta viewport tag."
