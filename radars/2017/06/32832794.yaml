    description: "Summary:\r\nOn many projects I'm working on, I sometimes need to return a pair of objects from a function/method.\r\nReturning a `NSArray` or `NSDictionary` is always possible, of course, but it's not really suitable.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the `Foundation` framework had support for a `NSPair` class, acting like `std::pair` in C++.  \r\nIt's of course easy to implement, but I think `Foundation` would really benefit having such a class.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n    @interface NSPair< __covariant FirstType, __covariant SecondType >: NSObject < NSCoding, NSCopying >\r\n    \r\n    @property( atomic, readwrite, strong, nullable ) FirstType first;\r\n    @property( atomic, readwrite, strong, nullable ) SecondType second;\r\n    \r\n    - ( instancetype )initWithFirstValue: ( nullable FirstType )first secondValue: ( nullable SecondType )second NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;\r\n    \r\n    @end\r\n\r\nAttached is a proposed implementation."
