    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to start the Xcode 9 Beta the icon is jumping 2-3 Times and then the App is crashing directly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Deinstall the Xcode 9 Beta\r\n2. re-install the Xcode 9 Beta\r\n3. try to start the Xcode 9 Beta\r\n4. Xcode is not starting anymore\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode 9 beta is starting\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode 9 beta is carshing and won't start\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta with macOS Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that Xcode tries to load /Library/Developer/PrivateFrameworks/CoreSimulator.framework/Versions/A/CoreSimulator but it's not located there. I checked it on my co-workers mac and there is no such folder PrivateFrameworks. Maybe it's missing but there is no indication how to become this folder back.\r\n\r\nMore Information about the crash is in the attachments.\r\n\r\nConfiguration"
