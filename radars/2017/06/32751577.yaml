    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMouse Keys don't seem to work at all in this beta. Pressing the Option key five times makes the \"Mouse Keys on\" bezel show up, but nothing happens; the trackpad works as it did before and mouse keys don't seem to be activated. Attached is a screenshot of System Preferences, showing my configuration, and a sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Mouse Keys.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMouse Keys will be activated, the trackpad will stop responding, and I can use the keyboard to move the mouse.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo change.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from macOS Sierra.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)"
