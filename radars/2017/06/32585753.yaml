    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using split screen on an iPad it would be great if the keyboard could be configured to be full-width or just appear in one of the two apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open two apps on an iPad in split view (perhaps Safari and Notes).\r\n2. Start editing a note.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard appears and spans the full width of the device. I'd like to have a key or swipe gesture which allows me to toggle between this and a version of the keyboard which only appears in the Notes split view, leaving Safari occupying the full height of the screen.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe keyboard appears and spans the full width of the device. A large chunk of the area available to view the Safari page is removed because of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 (14F89)"
