    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRight now, developers need to sync to iTunes to collect a sysdiagnose. It would be really great if iOS would place sysdiagnose packages inside of iCloud Drive/Files so that we can upload sysdiagnose to radar from iOS over WiFi without being tethered to a Mac. It took three days for me to have time to sync my iPhone with iTunes, but it would have been much faster to use my phone directly for the upload.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Observe some problem on iOS\r\n2. Take a sysdiagnose by pressing the relevant hardware buttons to trigger \r\n3. File a radar via bugreport.apple.com\r\n4. Attempt to attach the sysdiagnose to the bug report\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to locate the sysdiagnose in Files.app and upload from there (over WiFi).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nA sync with iTunes is required to access the sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 15A5278f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Verizon\r\nComments"
