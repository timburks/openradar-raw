    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the voice dictation button on the US English keyboard, text that is input is incorrectly capitalized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any app with a UITextField, such as Messages or Notes\r\n2. Bring up the US English keyboard. (On my phone this was the default.)\r\n3. Say something. (I used \"Old McDonald had a farm period\" in my example.)\r\n4. Wait for the text to finish processing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text field should now contain \"Old McDonald had a farm.\" with the first word and proper noun capitalized.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe entire sentence, except for the article \"a\" is capitalized: \"Old McDonald Had a Farm.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n• I also tried \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog in the afternoon.\" The result was \"The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Last Dog in The Afternoon.\" \r\n• While the text appears during dictation, the case is correct. Once the dictation session ends and the chime plays, indicating that the voice keyboard is processing, the text field animates to fit the final version of the text and the incorrect capitalization appears.\r\n• I took a sysdiagnose around 8:25pm on 6/27/17 and I need to upload it, along with a screen recording. (It seems the keyboard captured the audio to the exclusion of the screen recording app.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i) on iPhone 6S NKQ2LL/A"
