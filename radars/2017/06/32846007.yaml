    description: "Summary:\r\nUsers are used to the system-wide interactive pop gesture to go back the the previous ViewController by performing an edge-swipe from the left edge of the device.

Create a new Folder named \"Secret\" anywhere\n3. Tap on the Folder to drill down into it\n4. Perform an edge-swipe from the left edge of the device to go back\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe interactive pop gesture is triggered and it’s possible to pop to the previous ViewController like this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, the only way to go back is tapping the back button in the top left corner of the NavigationBar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
