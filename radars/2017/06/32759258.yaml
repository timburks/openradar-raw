    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI've built many iOS apps that used NSURLProtocols to override UIWebView content loading, and I'd love to use WKWebView instead. Most of them used caching logic to store responses to disk and reload later if no network was available. These apps can't use custom URL schemes because they have to support arbitrary pages. Other apps I've built relied on proprietary network security rules. Again, they still need to work with pages built for standard websites, but they need custom logic for some resource loads.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I could override the http and https WKURLSchemeHandlers with my own logic and delegate back to standard WKURLSchemeHandlers if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the caching example, I would delegate to a standard http handler, but if the resource load failed, I would attempt to load the resource from a disk cache.\r\n\r\nIn the proprietary network security rules example, I had to perform some custom security API calls with only the first https resource load. Subsequent loads could use the standard https handler, except I would need to add a header to the standard URLRequest.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
