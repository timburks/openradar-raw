    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI integrated search in the navigation bar by setting the searchController to the navigationItem. When the navigation bar uses large title the rubber banding works perfectly when scrolling down content. However, if you set largeTitleDisplayMode to .never, the behavior feels wrong, as the search bar gets split, leaving a hole in the middle.\r\n\r\nYou should reconsider the rubber banding behavior with normal title, for example by leaving the search bar attached to the navigation bar, or by expanding the entire navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached project\r\n- Run in an iPhone simulator\r\n- Select the \"Small\" tab\r\n- Scroll down the table view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search bar should remain attached to the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe navigation bar gets split, showing the view underneath.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
