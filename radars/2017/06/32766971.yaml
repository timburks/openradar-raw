    description: "iOS should mirror the Android \"register intent\" capability with an info.plist entry to register to open the app when a specified url is detected in an NFC payload. \r\niOS should sense NFC when no app is in the foreground and check the registry for apps that have registered their intent to open these urls. \r\nSafari should be the default responder for web urls. \r\nConsider the following Android device encountering nfc with the url http://websiteX.com/nfcportal/123\r\n* If App X is registered for http://websiteX.com/nfcportal/* it will launch and receive the url\r\n* if App is not installed, the device will launch the browser which will request the url. The remote server will redirect to the appropriate app store."
