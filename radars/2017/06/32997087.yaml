    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDrag-and-drop provides a new way to open tabs. It's not perfect.\r\n\r\nThis radar chain (see also: <rdar://problem/32996994>) centers around a reasonably common action for me while reading on iPad: I open a web-page, such as a link-heavy article, and spawn many many links from the page in tabs. The overall experience has regressed in iOS 11 beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page in Safari with many links\r\n2. Desire to open many links on the page.\r\n3. Hold finger down on link to select \"Open In New Tab\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI must wait for the drag interaction to register and let go of the drop in order to use the accessory menu.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI am able to open many tabs quickly, like I am on macOS by holding down the command key. The previous iOS behavior was not optimal, but the behavior in iOS 11\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis likely extends beyond just the reach of Safari, but it's a major regression there as one of the places with crucial long-press action sheets.\r\n\r\nJust spitballing a bit with some options/ideas. I recognize they're like terrible in practice, just want to get the gears turning:\r\n- Leave overall interaction unchanged. Safari can present a pseudo-drop target near the drag target to open a new tab when dropped on.\r\n- Change the overall interaction. Safari can present a pseudo-drop target that opens a menu on hover, not unlike the 3D Touch drag-up addition for associated actions.\r\n- Make the spring-load target for New Tab a lot more obvious (radar to follow).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
