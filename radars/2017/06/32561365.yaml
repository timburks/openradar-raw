    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS Simulator can simulate locations; however, it get its time data from the host OS. I'd like to see an option to set a custom value for the time zone so that epoch/Unix time can be simulated as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change location\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime zone in simulator changes too, or at the very least there's an option to have them be synchronized\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo option to do this\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3.2 (8E2002)/macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G12b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\nChange macOS time zone; restart simulator. I'd rather not have to do this since it messes with other stuff unrelated to the simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G12b)"
