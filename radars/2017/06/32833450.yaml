    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI noticed something strange working on my app - I wanted to `po` an object (which I've written a rich -description), but all I got was an address, like the object didn't exist.  Works great in Xcode8.\r\n\r\nHere's a video that shows the failure, and it working in Xcode8\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/[redacted]/xc9-vs-xc8-lldb-po-address-sanitizer.mp4?dl=0\r\n(dropbox UL because radarweb is not happy with large files. c.f. rdar://30364703)\r\n\r\nAfter making the video I noticed that I had all the sanitizers turned on.  Turning off Address sanitizer makes it work ok (whew).  Address sanitizer on in xcode 8 works fine.\r\n\r\nPure objective-C project. We use a number of fairly large third party libraries.\r\n\r\nThe project is big, but if you really need it, let me know.  It's many hundreds of megabytes large and will take hours for me to upload.  \r\n\r\n(P.S. Another plug for rdar://30028579 - Please add a \"don't show this alert again\" to \"Clean Build Folder\". You can see I do this operation a lot :-) )\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a big app (I didn't try with any other apps because I need to get some work done today :-)\r\nTurn on address sanitizer\r\nRun and break somewhere interesting\r\n`po` an interesting object\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the rich -description the object has\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nJust get an address\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks great in Xcode8.  See the attached video."
