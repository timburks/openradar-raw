    description: "My app (Hammerspoon - http://www.hammerspoon.org) includes an NSStatusBar item, and also allows users to create their own.\r\n\r\nSomething, unfortunately I don't know what, because I haven't been able to reproduce it myself, is causing occasional status bar rendering to crash very deep in a stack which contains none of my code. Here is the main recurrence of this that my crash logger is catching: http://crashes.to/s/4f66b4a188b\r\n\r\nThe source for Hammerspoon is all on GitHub (https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) the code for the main app status bar item is in Hammerspoon/MJMenuIcon.m and does very little indeed. The source for user added status bar items is in extensions/menubar/internal.m and is much more complex.\r\n\r\nI don't have any idea which of the two is causing the crash, but I would note that BetterTouchTool also is experiencing these crashes, and they do not have user-created status bar items: https://github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool/issues/831\r\n\r\nI'm very prepared to believe that we are doing something wrong, but the crash happens so far down a stack that I sort of feel like even if we're doing something wrong, macOS should really be rejecting the mistake earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot really sure - it may have something to do with connecting monitors and/or coming out of sleep (perhaps where the display configuration is changing during a wakeup? but that's a guess)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
