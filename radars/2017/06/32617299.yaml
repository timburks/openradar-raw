    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen making a cross-platform hybrid disk image, `hdiutil` only supports HFS+, ISO9660, ISO9660+Joliet, and UDF filesystems. Since macOS High Sierra can now be installed with APFS, it makes sense to include APFS as an argument to the `hdiutil` command.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal\r\n2. `cd` into your Documents or local workspace\r\n3. Ensure you have a folder named \"project\" which contains the following non-zero files:\r\n\r\n     * mac.txt\r\n     * win.txt\r\n\r\n4. Run the following command:\r\n\r\n`hdiutil makehybrid -o image.iso project -iso -apfs -hide-iso project/mac.txt -hide-apfs project/win.txt`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA hybrid disk image file named \"image.iso\" is created with the ISO9660 and APFS filesystems, and presents console output similar to the following:\r\n\r\nCreating hybrid image...\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n`hdiutil` returns an unknown option. Replacing `apfs` with `hfs` obviously succeeds, but does not generate the desired APFS+ISO9660 hybrid disk image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13 beta 17A264c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is the generated HFS+ISO9660 hybrid image, and the two extracted plaintext documents, mac.txt and win.txt, which are visible only on macOS and Windows, respectively.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny/All Macs running High Sierra"
