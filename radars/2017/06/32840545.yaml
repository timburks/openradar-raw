    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a user long-taps on a URL that is a Universal Link in Safari and chooses to \"Open in New Tab\", the link opens in a new tab, as expected, but has the unexpected side-effect of not being able to use Universal Links for that app in the future.\r\n\r\nYou can sometimes re-enable Universal Links by choosing \"Open in XXXXXX app\" from the long-tap menu, but it does not always appear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Navigate to a web page that has a link to another domain which is a Universal Link for which an app is installed\r\n    - e.g. on site.com with a link to site2.com/item (where site2.com/item is a valid Universal Link to an installed application)\r\n- Long tap on the hyperlink with the Universal Link\r\n- Select \"Open in New Tab\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDestination content opens in a new tab with no side-effects\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDestination content opens in a new tab, with the unexpected consequence of having disabled Universal Links for the App that the link pointed to.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Developer Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
