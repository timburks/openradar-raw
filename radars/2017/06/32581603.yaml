    description: "Summary:\r\nLaunched Xcode 9, did not open any projects. System CPU consumption at 300% to 500%, MBP fans running pretty loudly.   After letting it sit idle for 10+ minutes it seems to have calmed down. It would have been nice to know what it was doing, some kind of activity indicator.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch xcode.  It presents the welcome to xcode window.  WatchCPU climb.\r\n\r\nVideo attached.  Thought I had taken a sample, but I hadn't.\r\n\r\nc.f. rdar://29884107 - it'd be nice to have a button to push to collect relevant information that would be useful for you. I bet that any sysdiagnose would be too late for anything useful.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattachment: idle-cpu.mp4"
