    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen tagging classical files in iTunes with work and movement values, I expect them to be written to the ID3 block in my AIFF files. This does not seem to happen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTag a blank AIFF file in iTunes with work and movement.\r\nRename the file in Finder.\r\nAdd the file a second time to iTunes, so that iTunes imports its tags.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see the work and movement values I set.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\niTunes does not show any work or movement values.\r\nInspecting the file with a hex editor shows, that the tags were never written.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.6.1.25 on OS X 10.10.5.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 3085538"
