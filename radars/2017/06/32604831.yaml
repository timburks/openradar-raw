    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I switch away from iTunes, it hides the Lyrics pane.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a song that shows lyrics of some kind when you view the Lyrics sub-tab within the 123 hamburger button just to the right of the Now Playing rectangle. (I know, I'm sorry.)\r\n\r\n2. Try to go back to doing work in any application other than iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Lyrics pane stays open so I can learn to sing the song on Repeat One.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe Lyrics pane disappears instantly, crushing my karaoke dreams.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.6.1.27, OS X 10.12.6 Beta (16G12b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI get that the underlying UX object selected to represent the 123 hamburger dropdown is *intended* to disappear when you switch applications. I assert, however, that this not the correct intention for the Lyrics sub-tab within the 123 hamburger dropdown. I have no idea what resolves that, but I care about Lyrics far more often than any other button on the toolbar, and I'd give up all of them for a dedicated Lyrics button that stays open.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEvery Mac I own that runs OS X and iTunes with Lyrics support."
