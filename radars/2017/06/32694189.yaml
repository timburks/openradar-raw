    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9’s Markdown editor is a joy to use – thanks! It would be useful to include a Quick Look generator with Xcode (or macOS), so Markdown files can be displayed identically in Quick Look as they are in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Work on a Markdown file in Xcode.\r\n2. Go to Finder and press space on this file to reveal Quick Look.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPreview is identical or similar to the output of the Xcode Markdown editor.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe preview is rendered by the default plain text generator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
