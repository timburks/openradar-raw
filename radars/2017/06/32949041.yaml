    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I open maps in CarPlay, it usually recommends me to navigate Home or to Work. But in the German localization, these words are replaced by \"Home (but localized)\" instead of \"nach Hause\" or \"Privat\" (which is the label for the \"Home\"-icon on the map)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Maps in CarPlay with German as language\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe German localization should appear\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt's not localized. Instead, the text \"(but localized)\" is added"
