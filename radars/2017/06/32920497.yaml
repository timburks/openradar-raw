    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter working on a daily basis with the latest Xcode 9 beta, some people don’t like the new feature in which the project structure is kept in sync with the filesystem structure. So, for example, whenever you move a file into an Xcode group, the file is actually moved on disk.\r\n\r\nThere’s an internal, undocumented flag to avoid this behaviour:\r\n\r\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEDisableStructureEditingCoordinator -bool YES\r\n\r\nI think the addition of a UI setting to control this behaviour (enabled by default) and its required testing may be worth the effort. See the Notes section for an example of public interest in this feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a project in Xcode 9.\r\n- Click on Project Navigator, then drag files into groups.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFiles are actually moved on disk if the corresponding “Keep Xcode groups and filesystem folders in sync” UI setting is enabled. Add that new UI setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFiles are actually moved on disk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample of public interest in this feature: https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/876095560159182849"
