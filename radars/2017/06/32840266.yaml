    description: "Summary:\r\nhi!\r\n\r\nWhen command-mousing around (not clicking) in swift code, it shows the structure (this is _REALLY_ nice. Thank you for this. I like it so much better than the accidental-collapso-ribbon in prior versions)\r\n\r\nI'd love to have this in Objective-C.  \r\n\r\nJust in case it should actually be working on objc, here's a video:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/object-structure.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nhold down command and mouse over an objc for loop or if statement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet cool ephemeral vertical lines like in Swift\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nJust the variable names highlight when moused over\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe Swift behavior is what I'd like to have in objective-C land."
