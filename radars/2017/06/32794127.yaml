    description: "Summary:\r\nWith a table view controller configured for single selection when not editing and multiple selection when editing, two-finger tapping a row begins editing and selects the tapped row. However, the setEditing(_:, animated:) method is not called and the view controller’s editButtonItem fails to toggle from Edit to Done.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached project\n2. Tap the Edit button\n3. Notice that the Edit button switches to “Done”, the trash button in the toolbar is enabled, and multiple select mode is entered.\n4. Tap Done\n5. Two finger tap a row\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Edit button switches to “Done”, the trash button in the toolbar is enabled, multiple select mode is entered, and the tapped row is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultiple select mode is entered and the tapped row is selected, but the Edit button does not switch to Done and the trash button is not enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe enabled state of the trash button is set in ViewController.updateToolbarItems(), called from setEditing(_:, animated:)."
