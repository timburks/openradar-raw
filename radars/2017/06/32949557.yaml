    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #32929902\n\nIn iOS 10 it was possible to swipe left on the notification and chose \"close\" to remove notification both from lock screen or notification center.\r\nin iOS 11 the only way to achieve the same behavior is by force touching the notification and trying to hit an extremely small close button at the top right which makes such a privacy-sensitive task rather hard.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
