    description: "Summary:\r\nOld-style property lists are still used (strings files, pbxproj) and it’s arguably easier to use than XML.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to edit a plist by hand.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFire up a text editor and easily write stuff, with little risk of getting things wrong\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n* Fight with XML, or \r\n* “Just Use JSON” but no NSDates in your property lists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe XML format needs to go: its justification is to use a single format for machine and human uses. These days, we use “binary1” for machine uses, and the complexity of XML is not justified when editing a plist by hand.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
