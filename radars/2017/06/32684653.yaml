    description: "Summary:\r\nAttached project has two gesture recognizers on its content view:\n\n- An NSClickGestureRecognizer that increments the count visible at the bottom of the window.\n- A CustomGestureRecognizer that does nothing, but begins on mouseDown and ends on mouseUp.\n\nThe content view also has a context menu.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached project.\n2. Click in the app window a few times to see that the click gesture recognizer fires, incrementing the counter.\n3. Right-click to summon the content menu.\n4. Click any menu item.\n5. Click in the content view.\n6. The click gesture recognizer does NOT fire on the first click in the content view after the menu is dismissed.\n\nUncomment -[CustomGestureRecognizer rightMouseDown:] to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClick gesture recognizer fires on the first click after the menu is dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClick gesture recognizer does not fire on the first click after the menu is dismissed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h) / 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince CustomGestureRecognizer doesn’t care about right mouse activity (or any activity except the left mouse button), it is confusing that it needs to explicitly respond to rightMouseDown:. It would be better if it didn’t need to."
