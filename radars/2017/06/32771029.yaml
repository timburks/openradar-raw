    description: "Area:\r\nMaps\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMaps are a great way to find new places and find your way into the city, but it is missing one critical piece to become my goto maps app.\r\n\r\nHere in Brazil waze is the top navigation app but it does not integrate with Siri.\r\n\r\nPlease add this feature, since is already baked in iOS and works great in US (used there in a recent trip to California)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set language to Portuguese(Brazil)\r\n2. Open maps\r\n3. Find a place to go\r\n4. Click in go\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould enable turn-by-turn navigation and begin directing me to my destination\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nGoes to a interface where I have to swipe no know my next move. This do not work on a car where I can't interact with the phone!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
