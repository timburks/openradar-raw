    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen adding a menu item with a custom view to (context) menu, said menu can't be used when opened in an NSPopover with the behaviour set to NSPopoverBehaviorTransient.\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation “interacting with menus or panels that become key only when needed will not cause a transient popover to close”. However, as shown by the sample project, this isn’t the case when the menu contains a custom view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open and run the attached sample project.\r\n- Click the button that says “Menu With Custom View”.\r\n- Select some text and right-click.\r\n- Try to copy, paste or cut something.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected action should be executed without closing the popover.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe popover is being closed after the selected action has been executed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample project also contains a button “Default Menu” that shows a popover with the same configuration and view controller, but with a default context menu with no custom view. This popover behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nSample Project:\r\nWindow with two buttons, both open a popover containing a text view. Right-clicking the first text view opens a menu containing a custom view, right-clicking the second text view opens the default menu."
