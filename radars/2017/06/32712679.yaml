    description: "Summary:\r\nDrag and drop between process on the iPad is fantastic and is a powerful tool. I was sad to learn that this is disabled behind the `CancelOnDeactivationPhone` BOOL on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nThe functionality works great for the iPhone and should be enabled\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pick up an item such as a URL from safari\r\n2. Press the home button and multitask to another app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Item should remain held beneath my finger\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Item is discarded when leaving the app to find the receiving app\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
