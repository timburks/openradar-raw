    description: "This radar is weird for a few reasons:\r\n- This would be a long term, future direction and a huge change to existing behavior.\r\n- iPads don't support 3D Touch yet. I assume this is just a matter of time\r\n- iPhones don't support drag and drop yet. Based on this, I assume this is also just a matter of time. https://twitter.com/i/moments/874343411373023237\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI believe 3D Touch should be changed to initiate a drag and drop, and not for the myriad of marginally useful things it's used for right now.\r\n\r\nDetailed rationale: \r\n\r\nAs an analogy, remember watchOS 1 and 2? The side button would activate Digital Touch as it was thought this would be a marquee feature of Apple Watch. It turns out that users didn't use Digital Touch as much as initially imagined. Apple, to your credit, ate crow and changed the side button to activate the much-more-useful Dock. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the app icon shortcuts are not that useful. I think your usage metrics would indicate this. Other things like 3D Touch to interact with notifications, probably also doesn't get used very much. Peek and pop, I never see anyone use that either.\r\n\r\nInstead, why not change 3D Touch to initiate a very useful feature - Drag and drop. It would be consistent, and regularly used, and could save people a lot of time. \r\n\r\nThe one truly useful case for 3D Touch is on the keyboard to quickly move the cursor. I use this feature all the time. The nice thing is that it could still do this feature, and work for Drag and Drop in all other cases. It would also work fine with pressure sensitivity for drawing."
