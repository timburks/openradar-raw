    description: "Area:\r\nExternal Accessory Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs of iOS 11, we never receive a EAAccessoryDidConnectNotification via the [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] (even after invoking [EAAccessoryManager.sharedAccessoryManager registerForLocalNotifications]). This was not the behavior as of iOS 10 and below. This prevents our application from connecting to our device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPair our Bluetooth device via the Settings app and wait for callbacks via the EAAccessory notification methods.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect to receive an EAAccessoryDidConnectNotification from the -[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] after invoking [EAAccessoryManager.sharedAccessoryManager registerForLocalNotifications].\r\n\r\nThis was the behavior as of iOS 10 and below. This prevents our application from connecting to our device.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo EAAccessoryDidConnectNotification notifications are sent via the -[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter].\r\n\r\nThe device is shown as \"Connected\" via the system \"Bluetooth\" settings when this occurs. We have tried unpairing and re-pairing the device, but still have yet to receive any callbacks or notifications."
