    description: "Summary:\r\nFor Darwin releases from older versions of macOS (around Mac OS X 10.5), the AppleI386GenericPlatform project was used to boot. At PureDarwin, we are very close to having a functioning, booting Darwin virtual machine, however we can't boot due to errors related to PCI and ACPI, which are controlled by the platform expert. We cannot continue to use AppleI386GenericPlatform, as it is becoming too old to use in conjunction with recent releases of XNU. We are not asking for a full release of AppleACPIPlatform, but a new, ACPI-based platform expert would definitely be of use to the Darwin community.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to Boot XNU with AppleI386GenericPlatform.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAppleI386GenericPlatform initialises the hardware, and XNU boots the machine.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nMany different errors, ranging to kernel panics and black screens, when attempting to emulate modern Intel CPUs. Other errors we have experienced include the machine hanging at lines such as \"[ PCI configuration begin ]\""
