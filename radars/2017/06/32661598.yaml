    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently the API In UIKit (as of iOS11) doesn't allow for custom container view controllers to notify contained views/viewcontrollers to layout or adjust insets. The properties just allow to turn settings off.\r\n\r\nThe API 'safeAreaInsets' and `safeAreaLayoutGuide` in UIView is read-only, so custom containers are not able to set it to desired values based on the chrome it has. The new API for UIScrollView `frameLayoutGuide` is also read-only.\r\n\r\nIdeally the APIs would allow to implement behaviour similar to what UINavigationController and UITabbarController do.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 SDK (beta)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-"
