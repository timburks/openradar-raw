    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 10 SFSafariViewController, used in third party apps, had a shared cookie jar, so e.g. you were already logged into accounts from Safari when using SFSafariViewController.\n\nThis has changed with iOS 11 beta 1, where each app has its own SFSafariViewController cookie jar. This makes sharing an account more hard and defeats the original purpose of SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari, log into an account on a website\n2. Open a third party app and use SFSafariViewController\n3. Note that you are not logged into the account from Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShared cookie jar between Mobile Safari and SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo shared cookie jar between Safari and SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
