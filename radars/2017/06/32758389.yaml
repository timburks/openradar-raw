    description: "Area:\r\nDock\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDuring Handoff, an icon of the app shows up on the Dock on the very left, next to Finder. However, if the request is ignored and it eventually goes away, there is a blank spot left in the background so Finder looks like it's floating off the side. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do something on another device that would make Handoff appear in the Dock.\r\n2. Stop that activity so the icon goes away.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Dock returns to normal.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is a blank spot left.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have seen this issue for a whileâ€¦at least since OS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A264c)"
