    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI noticed the Xcode simulator has a new cursor - the finger with extended thumb cursor.   I find this to be a regression in accessibility and usability.  I do not have good vision, so that cursor's hot spot _to me_ is kind of between the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nI have bad vision, so this is an accessibility issue for me.\r\n\r\nCheck out the four images attached.\r\n\r\n1. Sharp-focus is what it looks like pixel perfect\r\n2. my-vision, I've blurred it a bit to mimic what the world looks like to me\r\n3. visual hot-spot is the cursor blown up\r\n4. darkest-part has a callout to the darkest part of the cursor, which my mind is telling me is the hot spot.\r\n\r\nThe standard arrow cursor and text cursors aren't a problem - it's unambiguous where they're pointing.  Software that uses big-white-hand-cursors typically only use them for gross gestures, like scrolling, rather than precise gestures such as using an Apple pencil.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
