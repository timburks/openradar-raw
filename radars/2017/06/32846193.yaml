    description: "Summary:\r\nTo show the UIMenuController, that allows the user to trigger actions on a specific document, the user has to long-press a document. This however starts drag-and-drop and the user then has to cancel drag-and-drop by lifting his finger to actually show the edit menu. This is very confusing and undiscoverable. Most of these actions are also available when the user taps \"Select\", including the option to specify our own custom actions there. As noted in another Radar however, there is so little space on the iPhone in the NavigationBar that it's not practical to add custom actions that show up in the NavigationBar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. Try to browse the versions of a document\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's easily discoverable how to browse the versions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's hard to discover that you either have to (a) long-press and lift or (b) tap \"Select\" to browse the versions of a document\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
