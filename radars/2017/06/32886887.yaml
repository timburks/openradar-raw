    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the the StoreKit API, SKStoreReviewController.requestReview() API, no feedback is given to if the user interacted with either the star-rating, the cancel button, or the submit button from the rating alert view.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful for developers to know when this view is dismissed, regardless if the user submitted an app rating or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an app that uses StoreKit and the requestReview() API.\r\n2. Trigger the SKStoreReviewController.requestReview() API\r\n3. Developer receives no feedback to if the view has been displayed or if the user has dismissed the rating alert view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome sort of UINotification or delegate callback would be nice to inform developers that the user is done interacting with the App Rating prompt.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo notification, delegate callback or other information is available to inform the developer that the user is done interacting with the iOS App Rating/Review prompt.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.3 (14G5047a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus (MKTQ2LL/A)\r\niOS 10.3.3 (14G5047a)\r\nXcode 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73)"
