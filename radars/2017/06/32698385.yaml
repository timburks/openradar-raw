    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Documentationeros,\n\nThe NSView.wantsLayer documentation, as of Xcode 9 beta 1 / macOS 10.13 beta 1, still says this:\n\n> Creating a layer-backed view implicitly causes the entire view hierarchy under that view to become layer-backed. Thus, the view and all of its subviews (including subviews of subviews) become layer-backed. The default value of this property is false.\n\nHowever, as of macOS 10.13 beta 1, setting wantsLayer on a view does *not* guarantee that all of the viewâ€™s subviews get layers. This is a pretty big change in the behavior of both NSView.wantsLayer and NSView.layer.\n\nThe wantsLayer documentation needs to be updated to explain the new behavior, and (since this change can cause crashes in formerly-correct apps) the change should be called out in a pretty big way in the documentation for both wantsLayer and the layer property.\n\nThanks,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h) / 10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
