    description: "Summary:\r\nIn its documentation, the App Store says not to worry about listing a word and then also listing its plural form, ex \"ski\" and \"skis\". However, another common form, -ing, is not considered in this matching intelligence. So \"run\" vs \"running\" for fitness apps are two keywords in and of themselves. This requires usage of the -ing form in the title, and then extra space in the keywords field for the base-word.\r\n\r\nI noticed this in my own app 2+ years ago when I would be ranked for \"skiing\" (a word I had in my title), but wouldn't rank at all for \"ski\". I've since added \"ski\" to my keywords to make up for this.\r\n\r\nTaking this a step further, as a user, I would also expect searching for \"ski\" vs \"skiing\" to yield the same search results and order.\r\n\r\nAttached is a current snapshot at the comparison between searching for \"ski\" vs \"skiing\" and \"snowboard\" vs \"snowboarding\". You can see that not only is the rank position different between the same words, but the result count is also vastly different.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add an app to the store with the none-ing form of a word. EX: run, ski, hike, climb, etc.\r\n2) Search for the -ing version of the word.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect an app with \"run\" in the title to come up for \"running\".\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nRight now, the app won't rank.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
