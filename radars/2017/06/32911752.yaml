    description: "Summary:\r\nThe blue status bar is now visible for applications that have \"Always\" authorization status. This is very annoying as it takes up a lot of space and is distracting. Users grant some applications always authorization status with the understanding that it will be tracking in the background. In these cases, users don't want to be constantly bothered that the app is using location services. The location arrow icon is adequate for illustrating that location services are on. If curious about which application is using location services, they can investigate in Settings.\r\n\r\nA lot of users are reporting this as a bug already:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/78693\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/79526\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/79989\r\nhttps://forums.imore.com/ios-11/389507-apps-using-location-banner.html\r\nhttps://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/877528841543188480\r\n\r\nFrom a user perspective, I like the blue bar as way to quickly jump back to active GPS navigation applications such as Apple Maps. Which works well for When in Use authorization status. I don't need to be alerted that specific apps have location services on, especially when my assumption is that they will be tracking location in the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGrant an application Always authorization status. Have the application use location services.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLocation arrow icon is filled. Blue status bar is not visible.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBlue status bar is visible."
