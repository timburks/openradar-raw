    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m really not sure if this is an AppKit issue, or an Xcode issue, so bear with me.\n\nIn macOS 10.12, NSNib had the following method:\n\nopen func instantiate(withOwner owner: Any?, topLevelObjects: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSArray>?) -> Bool\n\nIn macOS 10.13, that method is now:\n\nopen func instantiate(withOwner owner: Any?, topLevelObjects: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSArray?>?) -> Bool\n\nNote the changed optionality of the NSArray instance.\n\n\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project, specifically the included `NSNib.swift`\n2. Compile the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is some way of handling optionality changes in the SDK, much like there is with new/changed method, parameter and class naming changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere’s no way to have Swift code that compiles this example on both Xcode 8 and Xcode 9.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d) / macOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
