    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see movie at this dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/random-cursors.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nNotice as I move the cursor around, it's often wrong - a splitter cursor, a regular arrow, and the text cursor.  \r\n\r\nI haven't been able to see when the badness happens - just going along, and then notice the arrow cursor is the splitter one (kind of hard to position the insertion point with such a wide cursor :-) )\r\n\r\nHappened in Xcode9Beta1 also\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Xcode for awhile.  Even with a screen recorder running, I couldn't really tell when things started going off the rails cursor-wise.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncursor is text cursor in the text editor\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSometimes it isn't - splitter cursor or regular northwest-pointer\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHappened in xcode9 beta 1 too.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
