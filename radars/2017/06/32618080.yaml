    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSlideover to start multitasking doesn't work. Starting on the bezel shows the \"hand pointing\", but a swipe in with trackpad starting there does nothing. Video attached. \r\n\r\n(Same swipe does trigger slideover on older non-beta simulators iOS 10.x/Xcode 8.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAny app in iPad simulator. No slideover.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSlideover should engage like older iPad simulators/device.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo slideover\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS11 / Version 9.0 beta (9M136h) - first seed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVideo attached.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS11 / Version 9.0 beta (9M136h) - first seed. All iPad simulators tried. macOS Sierra 10.12.5. Late 2016 MacBook Pro. External monitors connected.\r\nComments"
