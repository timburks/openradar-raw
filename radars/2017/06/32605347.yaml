    description: "Summary:\r\nRearranging icons in a folder leads to a whole bunch of odd behavior when the folder is minimized. Confining this radar to the fact that the icons when minimized are out of order and occasionally missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move item into folder\r\n2. Rearrange items in folder\r\n3. Close folder by hitting home button \r\n4. Look at folder thumbnail, realize one icon is missing and others are in incorrect order\r\n5. Go back in, try to rearrange again to clear the cache\r\n6. Close folder by hitting home button\r\n7. Notice missing icon is still missing, moved icon is now duplicated\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter rearranging icons within a folder, when the folder is minimized, the thumbnails of the contents should reflect the order of the items within the folder. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompare the highlighted bit of “folder_wat.png” to “correct_order.png” in the “folder_sillies.zip” file attached to this radar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.0 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was not able to test how often this reproduced on other folders because all of this folder futzing got springboard into a state where I had to restart my iPad to be able to do pretty much anything. That seems like a whole other kettle of fish that y’all probably already know about, so I figured I’d keep this one more focused."
