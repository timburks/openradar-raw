    description: "Where the periods are spaces, and the I is the insertion cursor, if you press tab - the insertion cursor does not move. If there were *no* spaces, the insertion cursor would jump to the appropriate place (ie. four characters in - anyone who has indentation set to anything other than four spaces deserves what they get).\r\n\r\nXcode 8 and earlier jump the insertion point cursor to the place where you want to start typing. After all - there is no way for the meagre human brain to know that there are four spaces there already as opposed to nothing at all, and so it's impossible to know whether to hit tab, or ^e to jump there. Xcode's infinitely superior capabilities and wisdom should be helping us mere mortals out here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith tab key set to \"always indent\" in the indentation preferences, if you have e.g.:\r\n\r\n{\r\nI....\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhere the periods are spaces, and the I is the insertion cursor, if you press tab - the insertion cursor does not move. If there were *no* spaces, the insertion cursor would jump to the appropriate place (ie. four characters in - anyone who has indentation set to anything other than four spaces deserves what they get).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor jumps to the indented starting place where we wish to start typing our awesome world-changing code.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode stubbornly continues to blink it's insertion point at the same location, as if it's made friends with a USB type A connector and is insisting that we try at least three different key commands in random order before it will begrudgingly move the insertion point to where we want."
