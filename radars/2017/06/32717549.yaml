    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe new Files app on iOS 11 has currently no support for iTunes file sharing (UIFileSharingEnabled).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it only lists files on iCloud and shared containers.\r\nIt should also list the Documents folder of apps having UIFileSharingEnabled.\r\n\r\nI think it would also be great to enable UIFileSharingEnabled on the Files app itself, so users can quickly upload files to the device using iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall an app with iTunes file sharing enabled, like VLC, and upload some files to the device with iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Files app should list the VLC app, and its files.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nApps with UIFileSharingEnabled are not listed in the Files app.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.9 (beta 1)"
