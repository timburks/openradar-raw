    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 9 & 10 you could choose an app from all available apps by starting Slide Over when swiping from the right edge of the screen or while in Slide Over or Split View slide from the top of the screen.\n\nYou could choose between all available Split View capable apps using a scrollable list of applications.\nThis is no longer possible on iOS 11 and you have to drag an app from the Home Screen or Spotlight using Drag and Drop while opening another application and then dropping it on the side of the app. Or use the Dock, which doesnâ€™t contain all available applications, making it inconvenient to open an app not on the Dock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app\n2. Try to open a second app in Slide Over or Split View\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to show an app picker of all available apps that can be used for Split View.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to use the Dock, Home Screen or Spotlight to open a second app in Slide Over/Split View.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
