    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you rotate an iPhone from portrait to landscape, the navigation bar title switches from large to normal (I suppose this is the expected behavior). However, when rotating back to portrait, the navigation bar remains compact and the large title is not restored. This issue is always reproducible for both automatic and always largeTitleDisplayMode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached LargeTitleRotationBug project\r\n- Launch it on an iPhone simulator\r\n- You should see the \"First\" title large in the navigation bar\r\n- Rotate the device to landscape (the navigation bar is now compact)\r\n- Rotate the device to portrait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe large title should be restored as it was before the first rotation.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe title remains normal as it was in landscape.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
