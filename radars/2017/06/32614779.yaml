    description: "Summary:\r\n`xcodebuild` command can run unit tests and UI Tests of a specified scheme via `xcodebuild test`\r\nAnd it runs all of them.\r\nBut it seems that there are no way to run unit tests only or UI tests only.\r\nIt would be more flexible if xcodebuild can do that.\r\n\r\nContext\r\n----------------\r\nSee this:\r\nhttps://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/9356\r\n\r\nfastlane's `snapshot` uses xcodebuild to take snapshots. But xcodebuild can't.\r\nUnless xcodebuild implements this feature, the above issue will not be solved."
