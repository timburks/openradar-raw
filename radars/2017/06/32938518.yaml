    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to install apps from the App Store, I am met with a dialog box saying \"Your account is not valid for use in the US store. You must switch to the Canadian store before purchasing\" and giving me the option to switch to the Canadian store (it should already be on the Canadian store, as I am located in Canada). When I choose the option to switch me back to the Canadian store, it instead just takes me to the \"Today\" tab of the App Store and displays a page that just says \"Cannot Connect to App Store\". If I go back to the app listing and try to download it again, the same thing occurs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Be located in Canada and be using the Canadian App Store\r\n- Try to download any app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should download and install to my device\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI get a dialogue box, and then a page saying iTunes can't connect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2 (15A5304i)"
