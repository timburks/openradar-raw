    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen listening to music, tracks will repeat, even if repeat is off. Cycling repeat resolves the issue but only while Music is open/backgrounded in memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music.\r\n2. Play a track and wait for it to finish.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTracks should not repeat if Repeat is off.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nTracks will repeat even if Repeat is off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the issue doesn't occur, cycle through Repeat (off, repeat all, repeat one, off) and retry. A force quit of Music may also be required to trigger the issue. Once it occurs, it will occur every time Music is freshly opened.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
