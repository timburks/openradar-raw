    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html\r\n\r\nThis is the text for `purchase_date` field:\r\n\"\r\nThis value corresponds to the transactionâ€™s transactionDate property.\r\n\r\nFor a transaction that restores a previous transaction, the purchase date is the same as the original purchase date. Use Original Purchase Date to get the date of the original transaction.\r\n\r\nIn an auto-renewable subscription receipt, this is always the date when the subscription was purchased or renewed, regardless of whether the transaction has been restored.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nFrom our testing we clearly see that the following is not correct:\r\n\r\n\"For a transaction that restores a previous transaction, the purchase date is the same as the original purchase date.\"\r\n\r\nIt is exactly the opposite \"for a transaction that does not restore a previous transaction, the purchase date is the same as the original purchase date.\"\r\n\r\nIf transaction does not restore, the dates `original_purchase_date` and `purchase_date` are equal, otherwise `purchase_date` is the date of a transaction that restores original transaction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Purchase a subscription product, look at the corresponding Receipt, record the evidence that `original_purchase_date` is equal to `purchase_date`.\r\n- Restore this product later, record the evidence that Receipt that restores this product now has `original_purchase_date` equal to original purchase date and `purchase_date` equal to the current date of when transaction is being restored.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect the documentation to correspond to what actually happens.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWe expect the documentation to correspond to what actually happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
