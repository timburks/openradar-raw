    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nWhen I resize the debugger pane, the editor scrolls randomly, oftentimes scrolling the current selection out of view. \r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to keep my bearings in a source file as I adjust panels.\r\n\r\nPlease see attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect text in the editor\r\nResize the debugger panel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDebugger panel resize. Text in the editor remains stable (i.e. the line of text at the top remains the line of text at the top)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOn mouse-down, the editor sometimes scrolls randomly, making me lose my position in the code and breaking my train of thought as I scroll to re-acquire my position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI use all-black for my code highlighting - source kit hasn't crashed :-).  Text with different colors reacts badly with the chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses, leading to migraine-level headaches).\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\njumpy-selection.mp4\r\n5.6 MB"
