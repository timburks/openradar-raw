    description: "When pushed on a UINavigationController, CNContactViewController calls its delegate method contactViewController:didCompleteWithContact: when the user comes back from edit mode.  This causes the presenting application to dismiss the view controller early.  The dismissal should come when the user hits the back button.\r\n\r\nSample app: https://github.com/paulBuchanan/CNContactViewControllerBug\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the attached sample app on a simulator or device running iOS 10.3\r\n2) Accept the contacts access prompt\r\n3) Tap the \"Push on Nav Stack Button\"\r\n4) Tap the \"edit\" button\r\n5) Tap the \"cancel\" button\r\n6) Delegate method is called, causing presenting application to dismiss the CNContactViewController\r\n\r\nAlternate steps:\r\n1) Run the attached sample app on a simulator or device running iOS 10.3\r\n2) Accept the contacts access prompt\r\n3) Tap the \"Push on Nav Stack Button\"\r\n4) Tap the \"edit\" button\r\n5) Make an edit and tap the \"Done\" button\r\n6) Delegate method is called, causing presenting application to dismiss the CNContactViewController\r\n\r\nWhen the user presses \"cancel\" or \"Done\" the contactViewController:didCompleteWithContact: delegate method is called, causing the presenting application to dismiss the CNContactViewController.  If you compare with the iOS contacts app, the contact details screen is not dismissed when the user exists edit mode, instead, it is dismissed when the user taps \"back\"  I would expect the contactViewController:didCompleteWithContact: to be called only when the \"back\" button is pressed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contactViewController:didCompleteWithContact: delegate method is called only when the \"back\" button is pressed\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe contactViewController:didCompleteWithContact: delegate method is called both for the \"back\" button and when the user exits edit mode."
