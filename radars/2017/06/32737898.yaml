    description: "Summary:\r\nA common use for pragma marks is to group implementation of protocols. In Xcode <9 you could cmnd+click into the text in the source code and if the text was the name of a protocol Xcode jumped into the definition. \nXcode 9 has lost this functionality, even using the new shortcuts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite \n#pragma mark PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate\nin a source file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncmd+click jumps into the definition of PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncmnd+click doesnâ€™t jump into the definition.\nNot even the new ctrl+cmd+click that is used to jump into definitions now works here. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nctrl+cmd+click opens a menu that contains a Jump to definition option but is far from ideal. Ideally it should be treated as any other usage and have the shortcut work directly."
