    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"corecrypto\" project provides the low-level routines for performing cryptographic operations on macOS and Darwin, in the form of kernel extensions and user space libraries. Important projects such as commonCrypto and coreTLS which provide libraries which get reexported into libSystem.B.dylib also depend on corecrypto, and cannot be used without it.\r\nThe source to corecrypto is public, however it is not provided under a suitable open-source license. From the corecrypto license:\r\n    \"Apple grants you, for a period of ninety (90) days from the date you download the Apple Software [the corecrypto project, kernel extensions, and libraries], a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under Appleâ€™s copyrights in the Apple Software to make a reasonable number of copies of, compile, and run the Apple Software internally within your organization only on devices and computers you own or control, for the sole purpose of verifying the security characteristics and correct functioning of the Apple Software...\".\r\nThis license prevents groups such as PureDarwin from using corecrypto, and by extension CommonCrypto and coreTLS (which are both depend on it).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit https://opensource.apple.com/source/corecrypto/ or https://developer.apple.com/security and try to download corecrypto.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe core crypto sources should be provided with a suitable open-source license (preferably one approved by the open-source initiative (https://opensource.org).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe source code for corecrypto and any binaries compiled from it are not licensed for redistribution."
