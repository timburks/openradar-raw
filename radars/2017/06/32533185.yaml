    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen simulating an iOS app in the Simulator, I sometimes notice \"diagnosticd\" taking up 200% CPU and more.\r\nCurrently I see two diagnosticd processes spinning at 130% and 70% respectively. They take roughly 5 minutes to complete their work and go back to 0% CPU again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can reproduce the issue when my simulated app is backgrounded in the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI question if it's actually useful to run diagnosticd on simulated iOS apps. There are better tools for developers to do performance analysis than a diagnostics report that is buried somewhere deep on the disk. \r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's not very useful when diagnosticd spins up for minutes at 200% just because there was a (much less severe) performance problem of the app being diagnosed.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee above\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching you a sample and spindump of diagnosticd and the simulator folder."
