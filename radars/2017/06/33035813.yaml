    description: "Summary:\r\nWe make an iOS SDK for reporting feedback within apps, and most apps using our SDK present an alert when a user takes a screenshot. They do this by observing UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshotNotification.\n\niOS 11 now immediately shows a thumbnail of the last taken screenshot in the bottom-left corner of the screen. This thumbnail conflicts with the in-app screenshot alert mentioned above. It confuses users, as it presents two conflicting methods for handling a screenshot.\n\nApps using our SDK are unwilling to switch over entirely to the iOS 11 screenshot sharing flow, because our SDK provides powerful advanced feedback collection & routing features.\n\nIt would be great if applications could perhaps set an Info.plist key that would disable screenshot thumbnail overlays for that app. Or some other way to disable this functionality on a per-app basis.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the “Breaker” podcast app (this was an app featured on Planet Of The Apps that uses our SDK): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaker/id1215095006?mt=8\n2. Open the app, and take a screenshot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “Report a Bug” alert should appear unobstructed. There should also only be 1 UI element prompting the user to do something with the screenshot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe “Report a Bug” alert is covered by the screenshot thumbnail. Also, there are 2 different UI elements prompting the user to act on the screenshot (the “Report a Bug” alert, and the system screenshot thumbnail).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
