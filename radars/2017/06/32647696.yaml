    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile I understand the intent, I think using the right arrow key to toggle the \"Open as Swift bridging header\" button in the Open Quickly dialog is a very discutable UI choice.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it results in a inconsistent UX when the whole string in the box is selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Xcode project with mixed Objective-C and Swift files\r\n2. Open the Open Quickly dialog with Cmd + Shift + O\r\n3. Type something\r\n4. Open a result file by pressing Enter\r\n5. Reopen the dialog with  Cmd + Shift + O. The whole texte typed at step 2. is selected (normal behavior).\r\n6. Press the Right arrow key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverywhere else on macOS when a text fragment is selected, pressing the right arrow key moves the cursor at the end of the selection.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIn the new Open Quickly dialog, pressing the right arrow key keeps the selection unchanged (so impossible to complete the file name without grabbing the mouse and clicking, as typing will overwrite the selected text) and instead toggle the little Swift icon on the right of the dialog.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screencast of the boggus behavior\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
