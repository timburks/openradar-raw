    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen Reduce Transparency is enabled (Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Increase Contrast -> Reduce Transparency), the control center does not respect that setting like the navigation drawer does.  I would expect the Control Center not to blur while it's being presented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrag up from the bottom of the screen to show the Control Center when the Reduce Transparency setting is enabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would not expect the view to blur underneath the Control Center.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe view underneath the Control Center is blurred.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 7, iOS 11 Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
