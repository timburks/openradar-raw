    description: "Currently, there is no obvious way to schedule long running deferrable background tasks to run later, in the background. For activities like indexing, one should be able to schedule some work that runs later when the system is idle, and additionally configure things like only running on battery power, etc.\r\nThis could also be modelled as an app extension that runs exclusively for this purpose. However, it would be nice if these operations could also be run on-demand if the application requires it, effectively creating out-of-process jobs."
