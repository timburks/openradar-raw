    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHi, I'm writing this just after watching Session 413 of WWDC 17.\r\n\r\nI'm a member of https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten and will give you feedback on *why we are using `dlopen()`* in SourceKitten.\r\n\r\nSourceKitten is a tool that makes use of `sourcekitd.framework` attached to Swift toolchain.\r\nTo support multiple versions of Swift, SourceKitten uses `dlopen ()` to make it possible for the user to control where to load `sourcekitd.framework` at run time.\r\nhttps://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/blob/master/Source/SourceKittenFramework/library_wrapper.swift#L56\r\nIt looks for `sourcekitd.framework` with the same rules that `xcrun` looks for `swift`.\r\nThis is why we are using `dlopen()`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I tested, SourceKitten has no problem on loading `sourcekitd.framework` on macOS High Sierra with Xcode 9 beta 1.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this feedback will be of help to you.\r\nBest,\r\n--\r\nnorio\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13 (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 1 (9M136h)"
