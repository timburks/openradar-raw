    description: "The documentation states:\r\n\r\n\"Always assign the document browser as your app's root view controller. Don't place the document browser in a navigation controller, tab bar, or split view, and don't present the document browser modally. If you want to present a document browser from another location in your view hierarchy, use a UIDocumentPickerViewController instead.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, UIDocumentPickerViewController provides no means for creating new documents, or for selecting the location for a new document to be created. Requiring the UIDocumentBrowserViewController to be the root of the app is overly restrictive and prevents the developer from implementing the best user experience for their app. If the document browser is analogous to the \"Openâ€¦\" window on macOS, then presenting it modally would make more sense."
