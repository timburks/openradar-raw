    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Software Update is running, if you background and then foreground the Settings app, the animation on the Settings icon stops, and does not resume.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings.\r\n2. Initiate a software update in Settings → General → Software Update. This one was from iOS 11 Beta 2 to iOS 11 Beta 2 Update 1.\r\n3. Background the Settings app by tapping the Home button.\r\n4. Open Settings again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Settings icon on the Software Update screen is still spinning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe gear icon is no longer spinning. If you tap the Back button and then go in to Software Update again, it resumes spinning. Note that, in my testing, sometimes it took two round trips to the Home screen to stop spinning, but as shown in the attached video, sometimes it takes only one trip.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached video also uploaded at https://cl.ly/lJ3O"
