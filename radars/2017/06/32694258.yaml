    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a followup to rdar://28666836.  I was attempting to test whether this Radar was fixed by adding a named pipe as a resource on Xcode 9 beta 1, but managed to make Xcode hang instead!  To make things interesting, when adding a named pipe to an Xcode 9 project, Xcode now makes such named piped visible when you attempt to add them in a project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create a single view iOS project in Xcode.  \r\n2.  Create a new folder in your project directory, whether under Finder or a terminal.\r\n3.  Navigate to your new folder in a terminal & run these commands one after the other.\r\n\r\nmkfifo my_pipe\r\ngzip -9 -c < my_pipe > out.gz &\r\n\r\n4.  Still in the terminal in your newly created folder, for the sake of comparison, add a random 1024 byte binary file using this command:\r\n\r\nhead -c 1024 </dev/urandom > bfile.dat\r\n\r\n5.  Drag your newly created folder into Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see an icon in the editor area matching the filesystem entry on Xcode, as happens with any file Xcode canâ€™t read like bfile.dat."
