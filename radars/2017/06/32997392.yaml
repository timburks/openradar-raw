    description: "Area:\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Numbers, individual cells in tables can be selected to perform all sorts of actions in it. Importantly in iOS 11, these could/would be drag-drop targets, much like they are in the iWork apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Insert a table in a note\r\n2. Fill out some of the cells\r\n3. Dismiss the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can tap precisely on a single cell to select it in order to clear it, copy/paste into it, style it, and, now, drag-drop it.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nA single tap inserts the caret in the text in the cell. A drag invocation drags the entire table.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 2 (15A5304i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand there are constraints here; Notes probably doesn't want to provide a full directional selection or allow directional paste, CSV paste, etc, like all those things Numbers provides. I use tables sometimes to organize data I need to drag/drop, like to complete a repetitive task in a web form; that's very important to me.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
