    description: "Summary:\r\nPreview has a feature where it detects lines, and, if you click on them, lets you \"fill\" them out as if it was a real form. Unfortunately, it appears that for certain PDFs this functionality doesn't quite workâ€“Preview detects where to put the box, and moves the cursor there, but typing is impossible. Attached is a sample PDF.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move cursor to any of the lines and double click.\r\n2. Start typing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text shows up.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNothing appears, other than an empty text box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G12b)"
