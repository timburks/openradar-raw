    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UINavigationBar displays its title in the large type style, the title should respect any titleTextAttributes set on the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a navigation controller with a root view controller that has scrollable content (e.g. a UITableViewController) as the root\r\n2. Set a foreground color in the navigation bar's titleTextAttributes\r\n3. Run the app: the large type title will display in black, ignoring the foreground color, while the \"compact\" title size (shown after scrolling the table view) shows the desired foreground color.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth the large- and normal-size titles should respect the foreground color assigned in titleTextAttributes\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOnly the normal-size title respects the foreground color assigned in titleTextAttributes, while the large title displays in black."
