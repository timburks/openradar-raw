    description: "Summary:\r\nUIKit offers UIAppearance as a way to customize controls in your app. UIDocumentBrowserViewController however doesn’t allow to customize any of its controls with UIAppearance, which is unfortunate since it leads to all apps using it looking exactly the same\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. observe that it looks the same as Files.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt’s possible to customize the appearance of UIDocumentBrowserViewController with the help of UIAppearance\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIBrowserViewController ignores any styles set with the UIAppearance Proxy\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know that there’s .browserUserInterfaceStyle and that it’s possible to customize the tintColor, but that’s not enough customization possibilities needed"
