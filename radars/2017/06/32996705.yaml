    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMy roommate uses a lot of toilet paper.  Like, a LOT.  Given that high toilet paper use could possibly be correlated with a number of health issues, they need a way to track their toilet paper use.  It seems like Apple Health and HealthKit would be an ideal candidate for helping them to track this data point throughout the week.  It could leverage the built-in Apple Health graphs to give them a visual indicator of how much toilet paper they use, when they will need to buy more, and correlate it to other data that might also see spikes in usage when their toilet paper use spikes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open Apple Health.\r\n2.  Search through the available categories of data.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect their to be a data category of \"squares of toilet paper used\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is no data category for \"squares of toilet paper used\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2/14F89\r\nAlso occurs in beta versions of iOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you want me to file real bugs on Apple Bug Reporter, then you'll fix this issue to indicate that someone actually heard what I requested.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on all types of iPhones and versions of iOS.  Weirdly, my roommate uses less toilet paper when they have a physically larger iPhone: maybe they use their phone for wiping?"
