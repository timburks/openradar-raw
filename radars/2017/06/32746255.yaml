    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a 1-2 hour delay before emails regarding updated information (requests for more information, etc.) are sent out. I that an engineer at WWDC remarked that these were sent out manually; I was wondering if it was possible to either:\r\n\r\n1. Have the person posting responses send out an email manually, or\r\n2. Make this automatic (which is probably the better option).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a response for a radar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn email notification is sent out immediately.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt takes a while before anything is sent out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRelease 32 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 13604.1.23.0.4)"
