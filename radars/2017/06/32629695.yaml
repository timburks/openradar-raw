    description: "Summary:\r\nA very simple code sample consistently gives a \"Refactoring engine ranges didn't match initial ranges\" error when trying to refactor in Xcode 9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new command line Mac project in Xcode. Put the following code in the main.swift file...\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n    import Foundation \r\n\r\n    guard let x = \"z\" as String? else { exit(1) }\r\n    let y = x.data(using: .utf8)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nRight click on the `x` in the last line and select \"Rename....\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth instances of `x` should appear in the refactoring user-interface.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe editor continually tries to select the entire `x.data` text, instead of easily selecting `x`. A few attempts may be required. I don't know if this is a related problem or a bug for another time.\r\n\r\nAn alert sheet with the message \"Refactoring engine ranges didn't match initial ranges\" appears and refactoring is not possible.\r\n\r\nIf the x on the `guard` line is selected, refactoring is offered but the `x` on the next line does not appear."
