    description: "Summary:\r\nI have the Xcode 8 (App Store) version installed at default location (/Applications/Xcode.app).  I downloaded the WWDC seed of Xcode 9 while at WWDC.  Xcode 9 launches fine.  The Simulator application launches fine, but I see an error dialog: \"Error returned in reply: Connection invalid\".  iOS never launches in the Simulator.  Simulator requires a force-quit to exit.\r\n\r\nI've found two temporary workarounds:\r\n\r\n1. Rename the App Store version of Xcode.app to Xcode 8.app\r\n2. Use xcode-select explicitly set my new location (sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/).\r\n\r\nNeither workaround was required when jumping between prior Xcode/Simulator versions.  Typically xcode-select was used for command line tools.  Actually, that's stated specifically in xcode-select (\"This directory\r\ncontrols which tools are used for the Xcode command line tools\").  This is a problem for anyone who will be switching between the two versions regularly over the next few months.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Xcode 8 from App Store\r\nInstall Xcode 9 (WWDC seed)\r\nLaunch Xcode 9, then launch Simulator from within Xcode 9\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode 9's simulator functions\r\n(and with above workarounds, ability to use multiple Xcode's is preserved)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode 9's simulator halts with \"Error returned in reply: Connection invalid\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9, WWDC seed, macOS 10.12.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
