    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I'm debugging both my iPhone and my Watch app in the simulator, I'm not able to 1) run both processes simultaneously (so for one of both I need to manually attach) 2) if I manually attach to the iPhone process, I cannot override the location via the set location icon (via a GPX file).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Launch a iPhone app, that contains a watch app. (or first launch the watch app)\r\n- Separately, launch the watch app (or via run without installing)\r\n- You see, the iPhone process isn't debugged anymore \r\n- Manually attach to the iPhone process (or, when first launched the watch app, attach to watch app)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to fully control both processes, and most importantly, override the simulator's location.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen I select the iPhone process in the Debuggable Processes list, no Set Location button is showing up."
