    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I launch my app, I get a [UIFocus] Focus system disabled message in the console log. I haven't tried it on a device.  Happens all the time in the simulator.\r\n\r\nThe output looks like NSLog, but a breakpoint on NSLog doesn't trigger it.  I tried breakpoints on os_log, to no avial, or setting a breakpoint inside of UIFocus stuff.  \r\n\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\n(and if If possible, could someone tell me what I could break on to see this output (outside of something like 'write', which is so voluminous to not be worth it), so I could do more footwork on figuring out what's going on? I like figuring stuff out for myself when possible :-) )\r\n\r\nSee video at https://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/focus-system-disabled.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nHere's output:\r\n\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.446973-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.450257-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.501494-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.504392-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.507017-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.740952-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.789531-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n2017-06-17 14:09:23.831244-0400 [redacted][61754:3616536] [UIFocus] Focus system disabled\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoesn't happen in Xcode 8\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nFollow-up to my question about setting the breakpoint - I tried regex breakpoints on NSLog.* (no hits), os_log.* (way too many hits), '-\\[UIFocus .*\\]$' (no symbols to set a breakpoint on). Pondered setting one on write(), but didn't want to slog through _that_ many calls :-) - wondering what an alternative would be."
