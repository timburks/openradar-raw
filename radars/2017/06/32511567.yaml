    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe subject of this report is the error which happens when testing the purchases in Sandbox environment. \r\n\r\nError Domain=SKErrorDomain Code=0 “Cannot connect to iTunes Store”\r\n\r\nI start getting this error if I do some purchases and restorations one the same user created in Sandbox Testers.\r\n\r\nI AM logged out of my regular Apple ID when I do testing and most of the time I don't see this error. Then this error starts to happen and I have to create another fresh sandbox tester user to get rid of this error.\r\n\r\nThere is a bunch of StackOverflow topics complaining about this error and the different sources of its origin:\r\n- Upgrading from one product to another [1] \r\n- Just purchasing a product [2], [3], [4]\r\n- Using inappropriate iTunes ID\r\n\r\nAll of these links contain different answers which suggest:\r\n- Using appropriate iTunes ID\r\n- Check the implementation according to IAP programming guide\r\n- Reset device!!!\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42658170/sandbox-iap-returns-error-domain-skerrordomain-code-0-cannot-connect-to-itunes\r\n[2] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8208195/error-domain-skerrordomain-code-0-cannot-connect-to-itunes-store?rq=1\r\n[3] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2359739/iphone-store-kit-cannot-connect-to-itunes-store?rq=1\r\n[4] https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5705245?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nI know that this code 0 means `.unknown` according to error codes of SKError so this error is probably an umbrella for multiple errors that could be made more specific. When I look at recent to additions to SKError codes like this one:\r\n\r\n        @available(iOS 10.3, *)\r\n        case cloudServiceRevoked // user has revoked permission to use this cloud service\r\n\r\nit makes me think that it is doable to specify these error cases that are hinding behind code 0 because as you might see from these and many other links a lot of people suffer from it: they make arbitrary hypotheses, take magical actions like resetting phone etc.\r\n\r\nPlease take any action because a lot of people want their features based on IAP to be reliable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI am not aware of a guaranteed steps to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nI start getting this error if I do some purchases and restorations one the same user created in Sandbox Testers.\r\n\r\nOther people report they start getting this error by:\r\n- Upgrading from one product to another\r\n- Just purchasing a product\r\n- Using inappropriate iTunes ID\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect StoreKit to explain to me what is going wrong.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI see StokeKit error with code 0 and it communicates nothing to me.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3.2 (8E2002)"
