    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has a particle editor but not an integrated bug reporter.\n\nApple engineering encourages developers to file radars. However, this requires going to bugreport.apple.com, logging in, then writing the report in the web app. Lots of fields need filling in. This takes time. Radars take more time to file => fewer radars.\n\nApps like QuickRadar and Brisk (https://github.com/br1sk/brisk) has proven useful for filing bug reports by reducing friction.\n\nThe main friction points are needing to log in, and needing to supply information that could be filled automatically such as product version and configuration (depending on the type of bug). This could be done by Xcode which already stores Apple developer login information, and knows its own version, the Mac version and hardware, and the version and configuration of Simulators and connected devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to file a radar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth flow with as much info as possible filled automatically or provided in a dropdown from recent devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeed to log in and supply configuration by copying from About screens every time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA documented API for Radar would also be awesome as we could use the third-party tools as currently but they wouldnâ€™t break so easily."
