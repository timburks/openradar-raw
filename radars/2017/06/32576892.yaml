    description: "The screenshot annotation feature of iOS 11 is great. However, it severely undercuts the appeal of 3rd party annotation apps and will destroy their sales when released without 3rd party extension support.\r\n\r\nSo please add 3rd party extension support, similar to Photo Editing Extension, to this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks very much."
