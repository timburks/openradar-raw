    description: "Summary:\r\nOur existing iMessage app does not build on Xcode 9/iOS 11 (targeting 10.3) because our MSMessagesAppViewController subclass invokes methods like `dismiss()` that used to be defined on MSMessagesAppViewController but are now on the MSMessagesAppCompactOrExpandedPresentation protocol which is only available on iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Ensure the Messages app extension scheme is selected.\r\n3. Build the product.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should compile when using non-deprecated methods that were available in iOS 10\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe application does not compile because the `dismiss()` method is defined in a protocol that is only available on iOS 11."
