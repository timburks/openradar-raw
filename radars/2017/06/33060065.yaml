    description: "The doc says:\r\nBecause the movement of the slider’s thumb changes the width of the area occupied by the maximum track image, the image width must change accordingly. To accommodate this requirement, specify track images as stretchable images that can grow or shrink to fill the available space. For information about how to create stretchable images, see UIImage.\r\n\r\nI guess it is just copied from the doc of setMinimumTrackImage with \"minimum\" replaced by \"maximum\".\r\n\r\nHowever the reality disagrees. The width of the area occupied by the maximum track image is not affected by the position of slider’s thumb. It is always the whole width of the slider.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it is a documentation bug or implementation bug but they conflicts with each other. From my understanding of how it should work I preferred to think it is a documentation bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Slide the thumb to see that only the minimum track image stretches.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!IGZ2UbJA!JvyQVH5whr67JouHqSxbWyBWxfm0GMFAY4bkiAP5SaQ"
