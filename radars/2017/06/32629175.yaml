    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 11 beta 1, pasting text into UITextView interrupt editing, more specifically:\r\n1. It ends the current editing session: keyboard is dismissed, textViewShouldEndEditing and textViewDidEndEditing are called with UITextView.text being the old value.\r\n2. textViewDidChange is called with the new value.\r\n3. It begins a new editing session: keyboard is shown again, textViewShouldEndEditing and textViewDidEndEditing are called.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't end the current editing session in the first place, not to mention the weird delegate call orderâ€” textViewDidChange being called in the between implies the text is changed non-interactively because it is out of any editing session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap the text to begin an editing session.\r\n3. Select and copy the text.\r\n4. Put cursor at the end.\r\n5. Paste.\r\n6. Pay attention to the keyboard and read the console logs.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cSFGitbKWHr"
