    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving both an alarm clock and a Calendar reminder set at the same time leads to a situation in which the alarm clock goes off for about half a second, being instantly muted by a successive Calendar notification. Marked as Serious as I oversleep work for the second time this month.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the alarm clock to, say, 8:00 AM\r\n2. Add the Calendar event with a reminder set to the same time when the alarm clock is due to go off (e.g. an event at 9:00 AM with \"Alert\" set to \"1 hour before\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlarm clock starts blaring, after stopping / snoozing it user gets Calendar notification.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAlarm clock goes off first, however it goes on only for half a second before the Calendar notification appears and silences the alarm clock, making the alarm clock to effectively never go off."
