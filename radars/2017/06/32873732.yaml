    description: "Summary:\r\nSee title.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (\"Radar13Jun2017.zip\").\r\n2. Build and run in the simulator.\r\n3. Allow access to writing workout data.\r\n4. Tap \"Continue\" after you have provided access.\r\n5. Wait until the alert has appeared that says \"Workout has been saved.\"\r\n6. Open Health.app.\r\n7. Tap \"Activity\".\r\n8. Note that a 1 hour workout has been logged in the workout section (see attachment \"A.png\").\r\n9. Now tap on \"Exercise Minutes\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA paired Apple Watch simulator can be launched alongside the iPhone simulator. The Watch can then process the workout per rdar://32739919, and an hour of exercise minutes is shown to have been logged for the day in Health.app.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo simulated Apple Watch is visible, and therefore no exercise minutes are visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
