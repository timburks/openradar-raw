    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently when there is no active app in Slide Over and you swipe from the right edge of the screen on iPad, nothing happens.\nOn iOS 9 & 10 this always activated Slide Over, and would show an app picker when there was no active app in Slide Over.\nThis behavior should be brought back, as the current behavior is non-deterministic to the user on what might happen when swiping from the right edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app\n2. Swipe from the right edge of the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSlide Over is activated (also when there is no app in Slide Over) and shows an app picker when there is no active app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlide Over is only shown when there is currently an active app in Slide Over. Nothing happens when there is no active app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
