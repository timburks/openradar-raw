    description: "In Xcode 9b1 the Apple LLVM 9.0 C++ standard library does not bring the functionality of C++17 standard e.g. std::optional, std::any and other features remain under *experimental* implementations. \r\nAs in Xcode 9b1 it is possible to choose C++17 language dialect, having standard library matching the standard would be more than welcome."
