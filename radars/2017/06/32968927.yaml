    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn an APFS drive in macOS 10.13 beta 2 (17A291j), storage space is not always reclaimed when deleting files and folders (from Terminal or by clearing Trash).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Note the amount of free disk space listed in Finder's status bar.\r\n2. Delete a sizable file/folder, either by moving it to Trash and then emptying it or by using `rm`.\r\n3. Note the new amount of free disk space listed in Finder's status bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe amount of free disk space will increase by the size of the file/folder that was deleted.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe amount of free disk space remains the same, both immediately after deletion and after a restart.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13 beta 2 (17A291j)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDaisy Disk lists the occupied space as \"(hidden space)\", even after scanning as administrator -- this hidden space increases as more files are deleted. None of the files/folders that I have tried deleting are copies of other files (so this is not a consequence of the new copy-on-write semantics). I've noticed the disk space fluctuating +/- ~1GB since noticing this bug, but I'm not sure if this behavior was around before (or if it's being caused by another running application). Running First Aid on the disk from Disk Utility reports no problems and does not correct the error.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is on a low-end 15\" 2016 MBP with a 512GB SSD, with an APFS macOS partition (as well as a Bootcamp partition)."
