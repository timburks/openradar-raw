    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nthe iPad's new multitasking features make it convenient to do split screen with recently opened apps or apps in your dock. However, for apps that are not currently in your dock, there are a lot of gestures required to put the app into split screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScenario:\r\n* I have an app open\r\n* I want to open another app in split view\r\n* That other app is not in the dock (not mine or recents)\r\n\r\nCurrently I have to go to:\r\n* Go to the home screen\r\n* Hold down on the app I want with one hand\r\n* Bring up the app switcher or go to the space with the app I want to put it in split view with, all with my other hand\r\n* Drop it on\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd really like an easier way to do this, perhaps some sort of search functionality for the app.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt forces me to do two handed gestures, which isn't always convenient.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5278f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf it weren't for seeing a video on twitter, I may not have figured out any other way than opening the app so it was in the recent section of the dock.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
