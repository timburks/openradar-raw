Launch the iOS Simulator into a development app\r\n2. Press Home button to get back to springboard.\r\n3. Launch the Maps app. \r\n4. Try Pinching to zoom. \r\n5. Profit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect to be able to zoom in and out on UIScrollViews\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI don't zoom at all, but the UIScrollView does pan.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: Version 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS: Version 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\niPad Pro (10.5-inch Simulator)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
