    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController allows the user to switch between a list and a grid view, which is great. The mode change however is done without any animation, which could be improved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. open the \"Browse\" Tab and create a few new documents\n3. Tap on the icon to switch between grid and list view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a nice transition between grid and list view, similar to the one in the \"PDF Viewer\" App by PSPDFKit (The document preview images animate from their respective position in list view to grid view and vice versa).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo animation, the view simply changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
