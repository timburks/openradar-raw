    description: "Summary:\r\nI filed rdar://32576416 because I was confused about why there were two different numbers in the info window. The reason it got closed makes sense, but it seems like something which could be far more readily understood by your average user and/or idiot developer. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Finder to navigate to /Applications\n2. Select a version of Xcode (it is one of the worst offenders)\n3. Invoke command-I to show the info window\n4. Wonder why the bit in the top right corner is more consistent with the size in bytes than the number next to the size in bytes\n5. File a Radar\n6. Have Radar closed as intended behavior. \n7. [optional] Impostor Syndrome\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSize distinctions are explained clearly enough for an average user and/or an idiot developer to understand them. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot understanding distinction without filing a Radar; Feeling like an idiot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nObviously not a lot of screen real estate to explain difference this with, but even a tooltip that showed up on mouse-over saying something like “Why are these numbers different?” with a link to a longer explanation would be helpful. \n\nJust having that tooltip would make it far clearer that the difference is intentional, and then for those who are curious a full explanation could be in the Finder’s Help section."
