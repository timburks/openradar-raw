    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the new App Store, devs are encouraged to use more concise titles for their apps that avoid keywords, and leverage the subtitle instead. Of course, this is expected to lead to some more conflicts as there are less permutations of single-word and two-word titles now.\r\n\r\nHowever, one thing not considered seems to be apps that are no longer for sale. It appears as though these apps' titles still count for whether or not a title is in-use.\r\n\r\nEspecially with all the app pruning apple is doing for apps that haven't been updated, we're going to be running into lots of cases were \"dead\" apps are holding names.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo into iTunes Connect, and try to create an app with the name \"Slopes\". You'll get an error that the title is in use.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe title should be valid as no app is live in the App Store with the name \"Slopes\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/id825086897 this app, which has been removed from sale, is holding the name."
