    description: "Area:\r\nControl Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome of the toggles in Control Center have a very fluid UX, in which with 3D Touch, one can 3D Touch a toggle (such as brightness or sound), and simply swipe up or down anywhere on the screen as long as the gesture has not ended. There are other toggles in Control Center such as Flashlight, Timer, and Text Size for which a gesture like this would make sense.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Swipe up Control Center on a 3D - Touch enabled device\r\n2. 3D Touch the Flashlight toggle\r\n3. Notice that to modify the scalar state of the Flashlight, one must lift one's finger, and then swipe up/down to change it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Flashlight's value does not change based on the initial gesture, but requires lifting a finger and performing a new gesture, which is a much less fluid experience.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. Swipe up Control Center on a 3D - Touch enabled device\r\n2. 3D Touch the Flashlight toggle\r\n3. The Flashlight's scalar value changes based on the initial 3D touch gesture, without needing to lift a finger.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 [15A5304i]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behavior is not only tied to Flashlight, but also Timer, and Text Size.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
