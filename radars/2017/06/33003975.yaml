    description: "Summary:\r\nSince UIDocumentBrowserViewController is required to be the rootViewController and there’s no delegate when the initial loading of documents finishes, apps are more or less forced to use an empty, white/black (depending on browserUserInterfaceStyle) Launch Storyboard to have a decent animation when switching from the Launch Storyboard to the actual app UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. observe the cut between the Launch Storyboard and the UIDocumentBrowserViewController loading state\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt’s possible to customize the loading state of UIDocumentBrowserViewController\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe loading state is an empty white screen with a UIActivityIndicatorView in the middle\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
