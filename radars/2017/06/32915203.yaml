    description: "The addition of screen recording as a system feature of iOS 11 is a welcome feature, however there is currently no known way to capture on screen feedback for tap actions made on an iPad.\r\n\r\nIn QuickTime for macOS, there is an option that allows the recording to include mouse clicks; this is a useful feature that assists viewers of screen recordings to understand where the mouse is and what action is being taken.\r\n\r\niOS 11 incorporating an option for screen recordings to include all touch events and gestures via animations would be beneficial to organisations that need to create training videos for users, as well as for streaming gameplay, filing bug reports for iOS where it is necessary to demonstrate on screen actions, and other unknown/unforeseen uses."
