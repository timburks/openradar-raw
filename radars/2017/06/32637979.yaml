    description: "Area:\r\nCallKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nwhen using an app integrated with callkit, an incoming call to a locked phone presents the callkit ui which has \"video\" and \"app\" buttons which should trigger a phone unlock and then open the app. But if the device was already in the middle of unlocking (i.e., entering passcode) then those buttons do not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the call kit sample app, Speakerbox https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Speakerbox/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\n2. Run the app and tap the \"simulate incoming\" call, enable \"video call\", set a delay of 6 seconds. tap done.\r\n\r\n3. quickly lock the phone, and then tap the home button and enter the first digit of a passcode. then wait for the speakerbox simulated incoming call.\r\n\r\n4. answer the call and verify the callkit ui looks normal. then try to tap either the video or the speakerbox button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected tapping either of those buttons to trigger a phone unlock and then be taken to the app.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI observed that tapping either of those buttons does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1"
