    description: "Notifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting UIApplication's badge value to 0 directly or using remote notifications clears all notifications from Notification Center. Clearing Notification Center should be a separate API without this side-effect.\r\n\r\nThis is very problematic for applications where users can receive multiple notifications outside of the app and want to be able to act on them independently.\r\n\r\nYou can set it to -1 using a local notification to avoid this but setting the badge to -1 or 0 via a remote notification (or by setting applicationIconBadgeNumber) always removes any notifications corresponding to the receiving app from Notification Center.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send remote visible notifications (i.e. where the \"alert\" key is present) to your device. Note that appear in Notification Center.\r\n2. Send a silent (badge only) remote notification with a badge count of 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotifications in Notification Center are not cleared\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNotifications in Notification Center corresponding to the app receiving notifications are removed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n3.0+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWould you consider changing this behavior? The UserNotifications framework already provides a way to do this via UNUserNotificationCenter.removeAllDeliveredNotifications(). And maybe a new flag could be supported in the payload to allow the same for remote notifications.\r\n\r\nPlease and thank you!"
