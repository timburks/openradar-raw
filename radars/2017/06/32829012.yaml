    description: "Classification: Bug\r\nReproducible: Always\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the find/replace panel of the new source editor, if you start from the \"Find\" text field, you cannot tab through all elements. It gets stuck on the case sensitive toggle button, which seems like a bug.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to navigate all the elements in the new source editor's find/replace panel, pressing spacebar to toggle the new case sensitive and regular expression modes, and reach the replace/all buttons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any text file in Xcode 9, and make sure the new source editor has focus.\r\n2. Open Find (⌘F) or Find/Replace (⌘⌥F)\r\n3. Click the Find field to give it focus\r\n4. Hit the Tab key twice\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFocus should traverse to the regular expression button. Subsequent presses of Tab should traverse Previous Match, Next Match, Done (and if Replace controls are visible, the Replace textfield and Replace and All buttons).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nFocus remains on the Case Sensitive search mode button, regardless of how many times Tab is pressed."
