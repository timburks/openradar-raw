    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see movie at this dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/unstable-insertion-point-sidebar-show-hide.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nWhen I show and hide the right-hand panel (which I end up doing a lot because of rdar://27248509), the editor scrolls the line with the insertion point to a random location, most often no where near where it originated.  This is a productivity bummer (ok, where did it go), plus an accessibility issue for me because often times this will scroll the cursor out of my field of good vision, so I have to move my head to look around the screen to find it, rather than just flicking eyes around\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode8 is very stable.  Even under minimum window smallness, it scrolls no more than one or two lines worth.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
