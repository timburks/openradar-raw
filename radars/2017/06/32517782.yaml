    description: "When there are two sizes of cells in a UICollectionViewFlow layout a smaller cell that fits multiples in a row and a larger cell that only fits a single cell in a row, the smaller cells get incorrect horizontal placement on screen.  \r\n\r\nSample App: https://github.com/paulBuchanan/CollectionViewFlowLayoutBug\r\n\r\nThe sample application shows the following scenarios when run on an 9.7\" iPad, with the wide cell toggled on (button at bottom)\r\n\r\nPortrait orientation\r\n1) (Section 0, 2, 4) Odd number of small cells in a section, one wide.  The last small cell gets incorrectly horizontally centered.\r\n\r\nLandscape orientation\r\n1) (Section 0) Single small cell in row, one wide cell.  The small cell gets incorrectly horizontally centered.\r\n2) (Section 1, 4) Two small cells in row, one wide cell.  The second small cell is shifted over to the right leaving a gap.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample application on an iPad 9.7\" simulator like iPad Air 2.\r\n\r\nDo the following to see the various incorrect layout scenarios:\r\n\r\nPortrait orientation\r\n1) (Section 0, 2, 4) Odd number of small cells in a section, one wide.  The last small cell gets incorrectly horizontally centered.\r\nView the sample app in portrait orientation, scroll to one of the affected sections.  Notice that the cells are left justified.  Now press the 'Toggle wide cell' button at the bottom.  Note that when the wide cell is added, the last small cell is horizontally centered.  \r\n\r\nLandscape orientation\r\n1) (Section 0) Single small cell in row, one wide cell.  The small cell gets incorrectly horizontally centered.\r\nView the sample app in landscape orientation, scroll to section 0.  Notice that the small cell is left justified.  Now press the 'Toggle wide cell' button at the bottom.  Note that when the wide cell is added, the small cell is horizontally centered.  \r\n\r\n2) (Section 1, 4) Two small cells in row, one wide cell.  The second small cell is shifted over to the right leaving a gap.\r\nView the sample app in landscape orientation, scroll to section 1 or 4.  Notice that the small cells are left justified.  Now press the 'Toggle wide cell' button at the bottom.  Note that when the wide cell is added, a gap in the cell layout exists between the last small cell and the preceeding small cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results is that cells are left justified, even when mix of cell sizes exist, and not gaps in layout are present.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSmaller cells are horizontally centered, or gaps are left in layout.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2"
