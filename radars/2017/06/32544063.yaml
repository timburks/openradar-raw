    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease see the included stack traces for this bug.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to reproduce this crash, but it has started occurring in as high as 0.1% of sessions. While we do not have reproduction steps, we know that when using `UICollectionView.reloadSections` instead of `UICollectionView.reloadData` this crash does not occur. \r\n\r\nBecause `UICollectionView.reloadSections` instead of `UICollectionView.reloadData` fixes the crashes we suspect that this is similar to the bug filed in Bug Report #32543861 (https://openradar.appspot.com/32543861).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown. We have been unsuccessful in attempts to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\nIt seems that a similar crash has been reported in bug report #27354858 (https://openradar.appspot.com/27354858) which has reproduction steps. However, we do not use `insertItems` in the `performBatchUpdates` or elsewhere in our code. We do use `insertSections` but only once at the beginning of our `UICollectionView` lifecycle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown.
