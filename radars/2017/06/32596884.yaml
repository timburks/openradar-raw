    description: "The new DeviceCheck feature is awesome. Would love to have a few more bits though. 8 bits would allow for much more functionality, while still preserving privacy.\r\n\r\nA few things that would be useful to track per device:\r\n\r\n• Free Trial Used\r\n• Abusive User (Harassment etc)\r\n• App Hacking Detected (Forged receipts, code injection/unauthorized debugging detected)\r\n• Network Security Issue Detected (Excessive login attempts, packet manipulation detected etc)\r\n• Cheating Detected (Game data manipulation, unearned high scores submitted, coin count manipulated)\r\n\r\nA lot of the flags we'd like to track will have more than two states. Things aren't always black and white, often you need to smackdown a user who is trying to cheat for example, but still give them another chance to behave. And if they continue to cheat, then ban them (and their device). Some other examples:\r\n\r\nFree trial flag:\r\n• Never granted\r\n• Granted\r\n• Additional trial granted (user bought a used device)\r\n\r\nAbusive user flag:\r\n• Normal user\r\n• User warned about behaviour issues\r\n• User banned\r\n\r\nApp hacking flag:\r\n• Normal use\r\n• Receipt/purchase hack attempts detected\r\n• Code injection detected\r\n\r\nThe list could go on.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, 2 bits is a great start, but limited. Expanding this to 8 bits seems like it would give developers much more flexibility, without compromising user privacy."
