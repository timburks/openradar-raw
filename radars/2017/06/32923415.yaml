    description: "Summary:\r\nImmediately after today's WWDC keynote where iOS 11 was announced, a new set of documentation and information was released to developers about iOS 11.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this set of documentation is information about API changes - i.e. modified, added, and deprecated APIs - which, currently, can only be viewed through the Apple Developer Documentation viewer, located here:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation?changes=latest_minor\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this viewer is a poor tool for broadly analyzing the large number of API changes that come with a major new release of the OS. Most importantly, the viewer requires users to drill down through the class hierarchy to discover changes. This is cumbersome and slow.\r\n\r\nIn the past, a 'list-style' API diff document was published. This is an example of this:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/iOS10APIDiffs/\r\n\r\nThis list-style format is a far better format for quickly identifying API changes. All changes are summarised on a single page, without requiring the user to manually drill down through a class hierarchy and separate differences from unchanged APIs.\r\n\r\nIt is requested that this style of documentation is added to the standard set of documentation released at announcement-time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAssess API diffs using https://developer.apple.com/documentation?changes=latest_minor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn easy, convenient way to assess all API changes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA hard, cumbersome way to assess all API changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
