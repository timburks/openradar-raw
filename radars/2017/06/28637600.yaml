    description: "In iOS 10, Apple changed the file structure view when saving files to iCloud Drive from other apps (such as saving a photo from Messages to iCloud Drive). It is now hardwired to be a file and folder list view, with all folders and all subfolders defaulted to open. For those of us moving years of folders and work into iCloud Drive, this makes it *impossible* to find the proper folder for saving a file. Please see my screenshot.\r\n\r\nPlease give us a choice to use file list or icon views in this save window. Or, at the very least, adapt the macOS Finder's Column view, so we can drill down into folders when necessary. Either way, at least we aren't inundated with thousands of opened folders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pick a file that has support in the share sheet for \"Save/Add to iCloud Drive\" (viewing a photo in Photos will suffice)\r\n2. Tap that option\r\n3. As long as you have at least a few folders and subfolders in iCloud Drive, notice how they're all open and you have to scroll for days just to find the folder you need\r\n4. Cry, because it hurts\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to see the file view from iOS 9 and previous, which was at least an icon view which was easier to navigate for browsing and saving.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA completely unusable file list view with all folders and subfolders open, making it impossible to navigate the list in a reasonable amount of time to save a file."
