    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAbout 1% of users across different publications running iOS 10.2 and up seem to get stuck in a bad state which can only be recovered from by uninstalling and reinstalling the app.\r\n\r\nInside our `URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL` delegate methods we call `moveItemAtPath:toPath:error:` to move the download into our sandbox.\r\n\r\nFor 1% affected, the move always fails no matter what we download. We have attached an extract of the device logs for an affected user of the <redacted> app, the last line of the log is our NSLog of the error returned by the `moveItem` call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnsure what leads devices to be in this state in the first place.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe move fails and the OS logs a sandbox violation even though we are merely moving the file the NSURLSession is telling us to move.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe move should succeed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 and up"
