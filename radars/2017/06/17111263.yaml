    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that some Microsoft wireless mouse/keyboard receivers, or at least the hardware I use (see below), cause the cursor to jump to (0,0) every few seconds, making the mouse almost unusable. Unplugging the receiver solves this, and other wired keyboards seem to be ok (I don't have any other wireless keyboards).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attach the described mouse and wireless receiver (similar hardware could also work).\r\n2. Pair the described keyboard to the receiver.\r\n3. Move the mouse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor should follow the mouse movement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor jumps to the top-left every few seconds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 14A238x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy Mac mini has a wired Microsoft Basic Optical Mouse 2.0 and Microsoft Desktop Receiver 3.1, which can do mouse and keyboard, however I only use it for a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 1000. There is no mouse paired with the wireless controller."
