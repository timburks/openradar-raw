    description: "Area:\r\nControl Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith the new Smart Invert Color options on iOS 11, there is as much of a 'dark mode' as we can dream of. But the option to enable Invert Colors is hidden very far inside the settings and I highly doubt that anyone would use it on a regular basis.\r\nThe best would be to bring a new option to Control Center and let users use this feature. It doesn't have to be a default one, but it would be pretty unfortunate if Invert Colors, something that we wanted for so long, is not used because it takes ages to enable it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOne exemplary use case could be, you lay in bed with your significant other which wants to sleep already, but you are still quite awake. You use your phone and although the brightness is set to lowest, the white colors of the photo app still irritate your SO.\r\nSo, you want to enable invert colors.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwipe up to reveal Control Center\r\nTap the Invert Color icon\r\nDone.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nClose the app you are using.\r\nSwipe to the screen with settings\r\nOpen settings\r\nScroll to General and tap\r\nTap on Accessibilities\r\nTap Display accommodations\r\nTap Invert Colors\r\nEnable Smart Invert.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 1"
