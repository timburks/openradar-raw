    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSee title. A subview in the view of a child view controller updated via `setOverrideTraitCollection` is given an incorrect `previousTraitCollection` when `preferredContentSizeCategory` is involved. Since many implementations (including those backing `UILabel.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory` et. al.) check for duplicate content size categories in order to not do duplicate work, these subviews never get the effect of the override trait collection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample code.\r\n\r\n1. Set up a view controller containing another view controller using \"Container View\" in the Interface Builder.\r\n2. In the child view controller, set up a `UILabel` with `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true`.\r\n2. Call `setOverrideTraitCollection` from the parent view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can drag the slider in the sample project to resize the label.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe label does not automatically update its font size from a custom event.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 Beta 1 (15A5278f) / Xcode Version 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\n\r\nAlso occurs on iOS 10.3 (14E8301)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround was not forthcoming. The root view of a UIViewController propagates trait notifications down asynchronously, after the view controller has re-cached the new trait collection as its \"previously notified\" trait collection.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
