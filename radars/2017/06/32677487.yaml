    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8.x, if searching for a string and a results comes from a .plist file, when clicking said result, the plist file would open and the editor would expand to reveal / highlight the matched value.\r\nIn Xcode 9.0 beta (9M136h), the plist file is opened, but the matching bit is not hightlighted, and the plist's content hierarchy is kept collapsed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a plist file in your project\r\n2. Search for a string contained in the plist file\r\n3. Click the matching string in the Find results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file containing the matched string opens up, and its content expand to reveal were the file was matching (Xcode 8 behavior).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe file containing the matched string opens up, and but its content do not expands, thus making finding the matching part of the file difficult (Xcode 9 beta).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from Xcode Version 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nComments"
