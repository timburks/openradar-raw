    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode9, there is a new feature to use scalable PDFs as your image assets and preserve the vector data.\r\nAdding that image via code seems to produce the desired effect of a scaled image, but when adding a UIImageView in storyboards with constraints and referencing that image, it does not scale as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode project.\r\n2. Import a scalable, PDF vector into the Image Assets and check the \"Preserve Vector Data\" checkbox.\r\n3. Add an UIImageView with a height + width constraint and select the above UIImage.\r\n4. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe added image should scale it's vector data and be clear.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe added image is blurry and not scaled properly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)"
