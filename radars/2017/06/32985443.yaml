    description: "Summary:\r\nThe audio source control in Control Center should be available on the top level. It currently takes going down two levels to see the current audio source. When switching devices that my AirPods are connected to, this is something that I have to do multiple times per day (I always try make sure that my AirPods are correctly paired before starting any audio out of respect for co-workers around me).\n\nIdeally, it would be the large control size with the label (like the screen mirroring button) so you could see the current source right from control center.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 (Beta 2)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
