    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an objective-C method I've declared but doesn't have a backing implementations (happens during cleanup)\r\n\r\nI get a warning:\r\n/Users/markd/[redacted]:56:17: Method definition for 'yPositionsForAllEventsFrom:toEventEnd:' not found\r\n\r\nAnd a tantalizing message:\r\n/Users/markd/[redacted]:146:1: Method 'yPositionsForAllEventsFrom:toEventEnd:' declared here\r\n\r\nWhen I click there, it takes me to the header file scrolled to the top, rather than the actual place that's indicated in the tantalizing message.  Line 146 is the correct location.\r\n\r\nSee movie at this dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/[redacted]/missing-method-formation.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a clean building objc class.\r\nTake out the implementation of a method declared in the header\r\nbuild\r\nget a warning about missing implementation\r\nclick on the \"Method 'allyour:Base:' declared here\" thingie in the issues inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ngot to where the legacy method declaration lives\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\njust go to the top of the file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks fine in Xcode8 IIRC.  This is a rarity for me doing objective-C inside of Xcode. I usually use another editor for that."
