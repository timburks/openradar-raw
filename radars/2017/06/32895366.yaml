    description: "Summary:\r\nThe macOS \"U.S International - PC\" keyboard is very convenient for people who want an U.S. keyboard configuration but also want to type characters like ä, ü, ï, ñ, é, å since it has a special behavior where \"+a becomes ä and '+e becomes é.\r\n\r\nWhen the system keyboard setting is \"U.S International - PC\", using Xcode 9 and typing a single straight double quote (\") and then pressing spacebar or the right arrow key (used to write a plain straight quotation mark the isn't combined with the character after it) instead inserts 3 straight quotation marks and breaks syntax highlighting for everything that comes after in that file.\r\n\r\nThis used to work in Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the 3 quotation marks, the lines below still has no syntax highlighting and needs to be modifier to get it back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Xcode 9 source editor in either a project or a playground\r\n2. Set the system keyboard Input Source to \"U.S International - PC\"\r\n3. Write some code that gets syntax highlighting \r\n4. On any line - that isn't the last of that file - type \" and press spacebar\r\n\r\n(See attached GIF)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA single \" is added to the source file.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen spacebar is pressed a total of 3 \" is added to the source file and syntax highlighting disappears for every line after the edited line.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta (9M136h)\r\nmacOS Version 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode 8 and other applications like TextEdit and Notes has the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
