    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you tap-and-hold on a Universal Links in Safari and select \"Open in New Tab\", that will disable Universal Links for that domain. This is the same behavior as iOS 9/10, but before there were numerous options to undo. All of these options appear to be gone in iOS 11, meaning once the domain is disabled, it is impossible to re-enable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page in Safari containing a valid Universal Link.\r\n2. Click the link and ensure it correctly launches the corresponding app.\r\n3. Tap-and-hold on the link and select \"Open in New Tab\".\r\n4. App will not open.\r\n5. Click the link again. The app will not open.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, selecting \"Open in New Tab\" would trigger Universal Link behavior as with any other link. If not, at the very least there should be the same \"Open in [app name]\" option available in the menu.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nUniversal Links are permanently disabled for a domain with no option to re-enable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMost recent version in iOS 11 beta 2."
