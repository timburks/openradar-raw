    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlayback of HLS live event skips part of video on pause/unpause on iOS\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe software product my team is working on delivers personalized\r\ninteractive video communications. We serve HLS video to visitors using\r\niOS Safari. The video is generated at the time of visit, and we let the user\r\nstart playing it while it's still not completely generated to reduce\r\nlatency. FFmpeg on backend generates video in the background.\r\n\r\nSo basically that's video on demand (VOD) emulated as live event \r\nbecause VOD type of HLS playlist cannot be appended with new chunks per\r\nHLS spec. The problem we have is that if user starts playback and then\r\npauses for long time, on iOS 9 on resume playback automatically jumps to\r\nmuch later moment (to one of last segments available on latest\r\nplaylist). We want user to watch video without skips, unless user does\r\nit manually.\r\n\r\nWe have to support iOS 9 and fullscreen playback with native controls\r\n(not inline video playback on HTML page).\r\n\r\nI understand that developers can't provide much support for obsolete\r\nversions of software (iOS), but on our commercial projects iOS 9 alone\r\naccounts for 10% of visits so we'd like at last some hack. And by the\r\nway, we don't use HLS for iOS 10 anyway in favour of inline video\r\nplayback.\r\n\r\nSee attached archive ios9_hls_event_footage_skip.tar.xz with files of\r\nbug reproduction case.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Put these files to a web server directory. PHP must be supported.\r\n* Run ./ffmpeg.sh to generate HLS video where each frame shows its PTS.\r\n* Optionally, start watching web server access log\r\n (e.g. tail -F /var/log/apache2/access_log)\r\n* Open index.html (served by your web server) in Safari on iPhone with\r\niOS 9.3.5\r\n (iOS 10.1.1 doesn't reproduce the issue).\r\n* Press \"play\" on web page on iPhone.\r\n* When native player opens, immediately pause the playback.\r\n* Wait for 5 seconds or more (but less than 2 minutes).\r\n* See that playback has skipped a portion of video.\r\n* To repeat the test, remove file with name \"visited\" from the web\r\nserver directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPlayback proceeds from the same point on unpause.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPlayback skips part of video footage on unpause.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 9.3.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 5s"
