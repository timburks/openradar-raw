    description: "Hello Apple,\r\n\r\nWe have noticed a problem in our production app, related to zooming of text in a UIWebView, in iOS11b9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have simple HTML content in a UIWebView, with a \"line-height\" value in \"px\":\r\n\"  body {line-height:20px;}  test test test test test test \"\r\n\r\nand we affect the zoom with this:\r\n\"[self.webview stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"document.getElementsByTagName(\\\"body\\\")[0].style.webkitTextSizeAdjust = \\\"%d%%\\\"\", size]];\"\r\n\r\nOn iOS10.3 it works correctly (the line height is resized automatically with \"webkitTextSizeAdjust\") (see screenshot test1_ios10.png), but on iOS11b9 the line height is not resized (see screenshot test1_ios11b.png with text overlap)\r\n\r\nSee attached test project \"webviewtest_apple_sample2.zip\" for details, and zoom to the maximum value using the \"Bigger\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, using \"line-height: 130%\" seems to work correctly, but we're not ready to make this change in our production app, without knowing the reason for the change. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-the problem appears in iOS11b9 (latest developer beta), but also since iOS11b6, using Xcode 8.3.3. But works correctly in iOS10.3\r\n-we also tested similar code on our macOS application and it seems to be working correctly on macOS 10.12.6 and macOS10.13b9\r\n\r\n\r\nA few Questions: \r\n-Is this a bug or a new feature in iOS11?\r\n-Is there documentation for these changes?\r\n-Are there any workarounds we could use in our production app that would work on iOS10 and iOS11?"
