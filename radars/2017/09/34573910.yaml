    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Settings>General>Language & Region, setting the calendar to Japanese instead of Gregorian breaks the display of dates and time across the whole system (both iOS and watchOS). I don't know how to categorize this issue or if I need to make multiple, please advise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings>General>Language & Region, set the Calendar to Japanese instead of Gregorian (didn't try Buddhist, but should worth a check from your side), especially while keeping the iPhone language to English.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo work the same as it always did since my first iPhone a decade ago, display all dates and times correctly, as well as correctly calculate date difference (\"yesterday\", \"X days ago\", etc)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Multiple bugs depending on the format, short format displays \"(minutes)\", \"(seconds)\" etc, with numbers overwriting the words, for ex: \"(05inutes)\", this appears in Timers such as the Clock app and Music App when playing a song for remaining time.\r\n- In the Clock app and elsewhere, same problems, but also no AM/PM display for 12h clock, making it impossible to know what time an alarm is set to.\r\n- The weather app doesn't respect the 12/24 hours setting on sunrise/sunset positions.\r\n- Long formats are broken, for example the current Japanese year is 29H (Heisei), but it displays 0029, etc.\r\n- Other formats display weird dates, such as the Health App that displays the year as 678 in the graph view, but correctly everywhere else in the app.\r\n- Date differences are completely broken, for example, the Music App displays \"-1,452,201 Days Ago\" for a mix that is a couple days old.\r\n* Note: Outside of the last bug in the Music App, none of these problems existed in prior versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 betas through the final release 11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMultiple iPhones (6s, 7s+), iPads (Air, Pro 12.9\") and Apple Watch Series 2"
