    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a UIViewPropertyAnimator performing autolayout animations with a non-linear curve, and you reverse it, and then call `continueAnimation(withTimingParameters:durationFactor:)`, you end up with some unexpected animations.\n\nThere seem to be 2 different cases of this:\n\n1. If you're using custom control points, when you reverse and continue, the view will jump to what would've been its final position, had you not reversed the animation, and then begins to animate back to the starting position. This happens instead of animating from its current position, back to the starting position.\n\n2. If you use a non-linear built in curve line `.easeIn` the view does not jump to the final position, but does seem to very quickly complete a significant portion of the reversed animation, before quickly slowing down. This behavior is of course different per built in curve, but none of them seem to behave correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project and run it on an iOS 11 simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- For the custom control points case, you should not see the view jump to its final position, before animating in reverse\n- For the built in curve case, the curve seems to be exaggerated after continuing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- With custom control points the view jumps across the screen, only to animate back to the starting point\n- With a built in curve, the view animates very slowly back to the original position\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This seems to be a regression from iOS 10. Using an iOS 10.3 simulator, all these combinations work as expected\n- Attached is the sample project, and 2 videos, one from an iOS 10.3.1 simulator, and one from an iOS 11 simulator. You can see the jumping issue there.\n- Different combinations are commented in/out in the sample project in ViewController.swift, you can see different issues there."
