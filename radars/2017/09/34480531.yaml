    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Mail.app loses a connection (IDLE errors out?) to one of mail servers even though Internet connection is still available, it becomes a frontmost app and steals the focus. This behavior greatly disrupts the flow, e.g. you’re typing in some app, and then you suddenly see that there’s a connection issue in Mail.app and your keystrokes go to Mail.app. User shouldn’t be informed about connection issue this way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mail.app is open but not a frontmost app.\r\n2. Mail.app loses connection to one of the servers. It shows a thunder icon next to it in list of inboxes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app shouldn’t disrupt what user is doing by stealing the focus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app becomes a frontmost app and steals the focus.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
