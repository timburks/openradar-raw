    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that indexing phase was taking a long time in my project. I did a little investigation and noticed that it’s somehow throttled when my MBP is not plugged in to power.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clear derived data folder.\r\n2. Open a non-trivial Swift project.\r\n3. Start a stopwatch when “Indexing” label appears.\r\n4. Stop a stopwatch when the indexing is done.\r\n\r\nRepeat steps 1-4 both when running on battery power and when plugged in to external power.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIndexing should take the same amount of time no matter if a MacBook is plugged in or running on battery power. There’s a tradeoff between energy impact and performance but in this case I think the performance is more important.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn my case the indexing takes on average:\r\n- 2:32m when my MBP is plugged in\r\n- 5:11m when my MBP is running on battery power\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
