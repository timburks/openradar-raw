    description: "Summary: When working with calendar events there is sometimes a need to specify the last Monday/Wednesday/etc. of the month. My understanding is that this is achieved by setting the DateComponents.weekdayOrdinal to -1. However, while the date components consistently resolve to the correct date, calling dateComponents.isValidDate(calendar:) returns false when weekdayOrdinal = -1. \r\n\r\nFor context, I'm running into this while working with EKRecurrenceRule.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see the attached playground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect it to return true when weekdayOrdinal is negative, as long as the date exists within that month, i.e. for values between -1 and -4/-5, depending on the month.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nisValidDate(calendar:) returns false when weekdayOrdinal = -1.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 GM"
