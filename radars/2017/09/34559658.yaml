    description: "Area:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the Control Centre in iOS 11 to power off Bluetooth does not work, instead, any active connections are disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure an iPhone or iPad has Bluetooth powered on and has devices paired with the device.\r\n2. Use the relevant swipe gesture to bring the Control Centre into focus.\r\n3. Tap the Bluetooth icon to power it off.\r\n\r\n<video attachment demonstrating issue>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBluetooth should be powered off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActive Bluetooth connections to a device are disconnected. Bleutooth remains powered on.\r\n\r\nThe only means of turning off Bluetooth from the Control Centre is now through Airplane mode. This is not desired behaviour as it also disables Cellular and Wi-Fi.\r\nThere are many circumstances where disabling _only_ Bluetooth is the desired action.\r\n\r\nThis change in behaviour is also a step backwards in functionality as users are now forced to go back into the Bluetooth settings in the Settings app to power off Bluetooth; this changes quick troubleshooting steps that users have previously been able to take when dealing with flaky Bluetooth connections.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 (15A372)"
