Select/highlight the variable to rename using the keyboard\n2. Press the keyboard shortcut and acknowledge the alert to open the refactoring in the primary editor by pressing the return key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected variable is highlighted and editable in the refactoring view. \nIt is possible to cancel the operation with the escape key. \nIt is possible to execute and finish the operation using the return key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing is highlighted, nothing is editable. \nThe refactoring view shows a never ending spinning wheel in the top right corner. \nIt is not possible to cancel using the escape key. \nIt is not possible to execute and finish the operation using the return key.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached zip is a sample project and screenshots showing the issue."
