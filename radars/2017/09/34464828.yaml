    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you put a comment after a break statement in a switch, it causes Xcode to auto-indent the line differently than without a comment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy and paste the following code into a Swift file in Xcode, or open the attached playground:\n\n// Select all and use Control-I to apply auto-indenting in Xcode 9\n\n// This switch statement looks OK\nswitch true {\ncase true:\n    break\ncase false:\n    break\n}\n\n// this switch statement is\nswitch false {\ncase true:\nbreak // a comment causes the break to not auto-indent correctly\ncase false:\n    break // but not in this case\n}\n\n// END CODE BLOCK\n\n2. Select all of the code.\n3. Type Control-I to auto-indent the code. Nothing should change, because the code is already formatted the way Xcode likes to format it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll of the break statements are indented from their parent case statements.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first break with a comment is outdented. The second break is not outdented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached playground also uploaded at https://cl.ly/mXRV"
