    description: "Area:\r\nAVKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 GM, on iPhone 7 (128GB, Verizon). \r\n- Viewing web video in the system AV player, in fullscreen landscape.\r\n- Modify the volume level.\r\n\r\nExpected: Corner volume HUD shows the volume.\r\nActual: Both the corner volume HUD _and_ center screen volume HUD (from iOS 10 and earlier) are visible. This takes up an inordinate amount of screen space and is rather annoying. I'd personally prefer only to show the corner HUD, but if the center is going to persist into iOS 11, it should not also show the corner HUD.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this is just a bug, since the center HUD didn't show up prior to the GM."
