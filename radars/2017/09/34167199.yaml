    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari Technology Preview crashes for me since Release 37 because you've changed -[BrowserWindowController _updateKeyboardLoopIfReady] to query the BrowserWindowController's _toolbarController's lastVisibleItem's view. This will crash if the item is a NSFlexibleSpaceItem, since its view will return nil; this causes -[NSArray addObject:atIndex:] to throw an exception when this nil view is added. See (second) attached screenshot for disassembly of Safari Technology Preview.app/Contents/Frameworks/Safari.framework/Safari and analysis of the issue (the first screenshot is the original Safari.framework from /System/Library/Frameworks, which doesn't have this issue).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Quit Safari Technology Preview, if it's running.\r\n2. Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SafariTechnologyPreview.plist.\r\n3. In \"NSToolbar Configuration BrowserToolbarIdentifier-v2/TB Item Identifiers\" add \"NSFlexibleSpaceItem\" to the end of the array.\r\n4. Relaunch Safari Technology Preview.\r\n5. Crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash, Safari Technology Preview just launches with the funky toolbar layout.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCrash because NSFlexibleSpaceItem's view is nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRelease 38 (Safari 11.1, WebKit 13605.1.3.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nContinuation from rdar://problem/33815640, which was not resolved even though it was marked that it was.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nFor end users: Remove \"NSFlexibleSpaceItem\" from the end of the preferences array mentioned above.\r\nFor Apple: Check for \"NSFlexibleSpaceItem\" before adding its view to an array.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A358a)"
