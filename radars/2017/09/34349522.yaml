    description: "There should be an \"Add to Device\" menu entry in the contextual menu of an entire album. Since I can add one or more titles by right-clicking (or clicking on the ellipsis button next to one of the selected tracks) directly to a device, I would expect the same to be possible by right clicking on an album (or it's ellipsis button).\r\n\r\nRight now, I have to go to the album, select every track and then open the menu to add them to my iPhone."
