    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a notification content extension has an action that requires authentication and also defines the didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler: in the view controller,  didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler is not called from a locked screen.\r\n\r\nThe notification content extension disappears, but the notification banner remains on an unlocked lock screen. Subsequently responding to the notification from the unlocked lock screen works as expected.\r\n\r\nAdditional information here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/86577 \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a notification content extension target for your app. Define the didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler: function in the view controller of the notification content extension.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding category for the notification content extension should contain an action that requires authentication.\r\n\r\nAttempt to respond to the notification from a locked screen with the action that requires authentication.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter the fingerprint prompt, the notification should disappear, and the response should be forwarded to the main application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the fingerprint prompt, the notification alert/banner remains on the unlocked lock screen, and the response is not forwarded to the main app. (Because didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler: is never called).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 GM\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 and iPhone 6 with iOS 11 GM. Should be reproducible on any device.\r\n\r\nI've attached a demo project with the bug. It contains a \"working\" and \"buggy\" notification content extension. The \"working\" extension does not define didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler:, and the \"buggy\" extension does."
