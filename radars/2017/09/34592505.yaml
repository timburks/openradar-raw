    description: "Area:\r\nSceneKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith iOS 11 SceneKit framework, the method hitTest:options: returns invalid results. Along the segment from camera to model, it finds and returns points, returned in hits array that are NOT on any node geometry. It may also return no points when it should. Number of points returned vary from 0 to 16. All points are correctly aligned on the projected segment but not positioned correctly along the segment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild a single node custom mesh as to model a real world terrain.\r\nGive it a scale.\r\nImplement the hitTest:options: method in response to a screen touch to get a hits array.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReturned hits are positioned on the terrain node geometry.\r\nSee valid screenshots of the results attached, file name prefixed with ok_\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIOS 10- framework results are OK. On device or in simulator.\r\nXC9 builds with IOS 11 framework return invalids results on device. Running on simulator is not an option, due to general metal/openGL failure of simulator on GM 1OS 11 release.\r\nSee invalid results screenshots attached, file name prefixed with ko_\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXC9/iOS 11 GM build (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRun in debug mode"
