    description: "Area:\r\nFileProvider Framework\r\n\r\nSummary: Unclear how we can localize the action name for one of the FileProviderUI custom actions. The name is defined in an info.plist and it is unclear what key to use for an infoPlist.strings file. Since there can be multiple actions and they are added to an array under `NSExtension/NSExtensionFileProviderActions` and under the key `NSExtensionFileProviderActionName` inside each item. Simply having `NSExtensionFileProviderActionName` on `infoPlist.string` doesn't seem to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Build the app in another language and see the FileProviderUI action not be localized.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Expected a way to localize FileProviderUI actions\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The title of the action is not localized.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11 GM (15A372)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Xcode 9.0 GM (9A235 ) iPhone X Simulator"
