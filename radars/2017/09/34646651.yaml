    description: "Summary:\r\nI've overridden Xcode's placeholder jumping shortcuts because the defaults don't work on a Finnish keyboard. I've had them set to cmd-opt-, and cmd-opt-. for years and years and they've worked fine. Starting with a late Xcode 9 beta and continuing in the release version, the shortcuts work for a while after setting them and then stop working. If I go the the preferences panel it still shows them being set to the values I've chosen, but they don't work anyway. If I set them again to the same values, nothing changes in the Preferences display but now they work again. For a while. Then they stop working. Repeat.\n\nI haven't discovered what triggers the bug, it just happens usually within a few hours.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode preferences\n2. Select \"Key Bindings\"\n3. Set \"Jump to Next Placeholder\" to cmd-opt-. and \"Jump to Previous Placeholder\" to cmd-opt-,\n4. In Xcode editor add some code from autocompletion that adds placeholders\n5. Press the shortcuts you've selected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode jumps between placeholders.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode jumps between placeholders for a while, but then, usually after an hour or two, stops doing it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
