    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be very helpful to indicate the access control level of properties and functions in the jump bar with some type of indicator like the P and M that denote properties vs member functions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nActivate the jump bar on a file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee access control level (public, private, internal, etc.) for each property and method. Maybe even have a method to filter to just see the public ones, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo indication of access control level\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode-beta (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
