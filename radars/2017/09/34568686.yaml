    description: "In WWDC 2017, Apple announced auto-renewable subscription will provide server-to-server notification to developers' server to inform user's subscription status updates.\r\n\r\nTo setup is described in https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev0067a330b.\r\n\r\nHowever there is only one subscription URL for each app. There is no support for staging environment. This will make developer's server-side team hard to develop and test new integrations, since the same URL need to support dev/test and production environment.\r\n\r\nWe would like to suggest Apple to provide a SIT or sandbox URL setting for auto-renewable subscription notification, alongside with current production URL.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOctober 2 2017, 10:26 PM\r\nEngineering has provided the following information regarding this issue:  Only one URL is used for notifications. When the app is in sandbox, the notification will have sandbox indicated in the notification."
