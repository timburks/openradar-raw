    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you drag an item from the Recents area of the Dock and use it to create a new Home Screen page, then change your mind and drag it back to the Dock, the Home Screen gains an empty page that doesn’t go away unless you put the icons in wiggle mode and then hit the Home button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the last home screen page.\r\n2. Press and hold one of the icons in the “Recents” section of the iOS Dock.\r\n3. Drag the icon to the right side of the screen and hold it there so that it switches over to a new empty page.\r\n4. Change your mind and decide you don’t want to move the icon there, and drag the icon back to where it was in the Dock.\r\n5. Release the icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon hasn’t moved, and the provisional “next” Home Screen page is deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe provisional “next” Home Screen page is still there, but it’s empty. It won’t go away unless you press an icon for long enough to put it in “wiggle mode,” then click the Home Button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5372a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached video also uploaded at https://cl.ly/mPwc"
