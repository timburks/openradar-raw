    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 9 simulator screen is scrambled. Xcode 8 simulator continues to draw just fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis one is simple: launch the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSee attachment \"Xcode8.png\"\r\n\r\n[This is a normal-looking simulator screenshot.]\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSee attachment \"Xcode9.png\"\r\n\r\n[This is a simulator screenshot where the screen graphics are all scrambled.]\r\n\r\n[There is also a movie that shows the launch sequence where first the little square in the middle where the Apple logo appears, all scrambled in colored bars, later switching to a uniform colorful pixel static. Then the screen is filled with the scrambled bars. Eventually the pointer taps the screen and it switches to the colorful pixel static.]\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9 GM versus Xcode 8.3.3\r\n\r\nMacOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\nMac mini Server (Mid 2011)\r\nIntel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\r\n\r\nRegression Notes:\r\n\r\nThis started when I moved Xcode from 8.3.3 to 9 beta 6.\r\n\r\nI did try reinstalling Xcode in the sense I upgraded from beta 6 to GM.\r\n\r\nThis happens on every simulator device type and OS version.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if I launch an app from Xcode or just launch the simulator without even running Xcode.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots attached were saved from the simulator itself.\r\n\r\nLG monitor connected via HDMI; everything else is working just fine."
