    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 11, calling `[PHPhotoLibrary authorizationStatus]` always returns `PHAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined`, regardless of whether the user has granted the app access to their photos.  If the use did allow access to their Photos, the image WILL be saved, regardless of the status of `[PHPhotoLibrary authorizationStatus]`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that attempts to save a photo to the users photo library\r\n2. When prompted, either allow or deny the app permissions to access the users photo library (it does not matter which)\r\n3. Call `[PHPhotoLibrary authorizationStatus]` and check the returned value.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter granting or denying permission to Photos, the value returned from `[PHPhotoLibrary authorizationStatus]` should be either `PHAuthorizationStatusDenied` or `PHAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nValue returned from `[PHPhotoLibrary authorizationStatus]` is always `PHAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined`\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 and Xcode 9.1 beta 1\r\niOS 11, iOS 11.0.1, and iOS 11.1 beta 1"
