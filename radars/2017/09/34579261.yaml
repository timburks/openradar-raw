    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\niOS 11 sometimes have unexpected behaviour using opening share sheet with URL items that conforms to UIActivityItemSource. A couple of examples of this bug in the wild are:\r\n• Go to any app page in the App Store. Tap the overflow button to open share sheet. Tap on \"Copy Link\". Paste in Messages. You see the link appears twice when it should only appear once. rdar://34128091\r\n• 3D touch any 3rd party app on the homescreen. Tap share to open share sheet. Tap on \"Copy Link\". Paste in Messages. You see the link appears twice when it should only appear once.\r\n\r\nI've created and attached a sample project that demostrates this bug. I've also attached video of tapping on the last button in the sample project on iOS 10 and iOS 11 which shows that it worked in iOS 10 as expected but is now broken in iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Run the test project on iOS 11\r\n• Tap on each of the buttons\r\n• Tap \"Copy\" when share sheet appears\r\n• Contents of the pasteboard will be printed out at the bottom.\r\n• The first 3 behaves correctly on both iOS 10 and iOS 11. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• For the last button, we expect only 1 URL to be copied which is the case on iOS 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• On iOS 11, two URLs are copied into the pasteboard when only one of the item source contains a URL.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11"
