    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHello!  Xcode9's editor has introduced a bunch of animated glitz. Unfortunately, most of it is a detriment to my use of Xcode due to the distracting animation, \r\n\r\nIn particular, the \"kissing\" animation, whenever the cursor is moved over a delimiter. Please see the attached gif file.\r\n\r\nIt's also an accessibility problem - the flashes of color react badly with my eyeglasses prescription (chromatic aberration) which can trigger migraine-style headaches because colors appear in random places in 3-space.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love for a way to turn that off. I can see how some people could find it useful (what does this balance?), but I personally don't need to do that very often, and most certainly not every single time I cursor over a delimiter.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nArrow over the closing ) of a function call\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe cursor moves\r\nI can continue concentrating on my work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nthe parens flash a bright yellow color.  The opening paren catches my eye, now I need to re-acquire the cursor an remember what I was doing.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nXcode 8 did not have this problem."
