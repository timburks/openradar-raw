    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building Swift static libraries, the stdLibTool doesn’t always correctly detect the use of the Swift standard library and doesn’t copy the swiftSupport.dylib into the resulting bundle.\n\nThis occurs when the static library is linked against a dynamic framework that requires the types from swiftSupport.dylib.\n\nALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES setting doesn’t seem to influence this at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open attached project\n2) Run test on Static scheme\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests succeed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tests fail to start with an error:\n\n2017-09-05 14:55:21.747162+0200 xctest[93583:11564089] The bundle “Tests” couldn’t be loaded because it is damaged or missing necessary resources.
