    description: "Summary:\r\nAn outdated version of FaceTime (1.0.5) is still available for purchase on the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nThe Mac App Store shows that I am able to purchase it for AU $1.29 despite the fact that I have FaceTime Version 3.0 (2142) already installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Mac App Store and search for \"FaceTime\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFaceTime is not available on the App Store because it is now included as part of the OS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn older version of FaceTime is available for purchase and contains outdated information and screenshots.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApp Store Version 2.0 (376.0.5)\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsers of older versions of OS X (where FaceTime was not included) should not be given the ability to download FaceTime and should instead be encouraged to upgrade their OS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
