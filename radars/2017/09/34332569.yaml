    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAn app, running on iOS 11, that handles push notifications while in the Inactive state (for example, if the app was Active when the Notification Center drawer is displayed), reports it's state as Active if it handles a push notification in response to a user tapping a notification for that app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached sample application reproduces this problem.  It prints the state of the application in application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:).  It can be reproduced on iOS 11 by executing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run the app.\r\n2. Put the app into the background\r\n3. Send two (or more) unique push notifications to the notification token printed on the console\r\n4. Tap one of them to open the app, \r\n3. Check the state reported by the app during application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:). \r\n4. Notification Center\r\n5. Tap the second (or another) notification. \r\n6. Check the state reported by the app during application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth steps 3 and 6 above should report Inactive as the app state (this is true on iOS 10.3.3)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep 3 reports the application state as Inactive (as expected), but at step 6, the app reports its state as Active.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 beta 10 (15A5372a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)\r\n\r\nAffected app:  ApplicationState\r\n\r\nDate and Time Issue Occurred:  11:30 AM Central Time 8 September 2017"
