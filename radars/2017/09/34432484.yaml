    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 10 (and previous versions) the UIKeyboardWill{Show|Hide} notifications are sent by the system whenever a UITextField (or other responder) becomes/resigns first responder. That allows the layout to adopt to a screen with/without a keyboard covering part of the contents. This ability is crucial when making flexible and dynamic layouts.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 11 these notifications are no longer sent if a keyboard is already visible, which makes it impossible to adopt to the changing screen infrastructure. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the project suffixed with _iOS10 in Xcode 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n- Notice how will{Show|Hide} notifications are sent by the system every time a textfield becomes/resigns first responder (regardless of whether the keyboard is already visible or not)\r\n- Run the other project in Xcode 9 GM (9A235)\r\n- Notice how will{Show|Hide} notifications are only sent by the system the first time a textfield becomes/resigns first responder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIKeyboardWillShow notification will be sent every time a new textfield becomes first responder. Vice versa for WillHide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly one UIKeyboardWill{Show|Show} notification is sent.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 GM (9A235)\r\nXcode 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-"
