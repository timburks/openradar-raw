    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDuring the implementation of the drag and drop in our application, we noticed that the app is crashing when we want to use the feature for right to left languages. We made a sample application to produce the bug, and it is clear that something is not fine when we want to move a cell in the collection view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the application language to right to left Pseudolanguage. \r\nStart the sample application. \r\nDrag the green cell to the cyan arrea. It will make a copy into the collection view.\r\nGet the green cell again and drag it to the right side of the collection view (above the copied cell).\r\nThe `_UICollectionViewDragAndDropController _beginDragAndDropInsertingItemAtIndexPath:` will crash with Assertion failure (see the log in the attached `crashlog.txt`)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash when copying or moving cells.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11, Xcode: Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApplication language is set to Right-to-Left Pseudolanguage\r\n\r\nGithub link for the example files: https://github.com/csacsi/RightToLeftExample"
