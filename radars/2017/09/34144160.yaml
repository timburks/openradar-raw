    description: "Summary:\r\nRun a late 2016 MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, with power and a Thunderbolt 2 display (via the TB3-TB2 dongle). All good.\r\n\r\nAt the end own the day, unplug both ports. If you open the laptop, the screen remains black - yet touchbar and all other feature remain active. Its as if the laptop has not detected the display removal. Only way to get back is to hard reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun a late 2016 MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, with power and a Thunderbolt 2 display (via the TB3-TB2 dongle). All good.\r\n\r\nDisconnect both plugs and open the laptop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see the display light up and showing your windows\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe screen remains black, but the keyboard and touchbar work fine\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnly a hard reboot restores the display.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I leave the cables plugged in, open the laptop, the display then changes and lights up and THEN disconnect, in that scenario it works fine.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens almost very time when disconnecting from older TB2 display when run in clamshell mode"
