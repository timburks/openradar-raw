    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use a custom linter tool to check ObjC that runs as a script and outputs warnings to Xcode. When a warning is outputted on first line of an objc-method implementation (-(void)bla {), those warnings no longer show up when the method is folded. This used to work in Xcode 8\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a method:\n- (void)bla {\n  NSLog(@\"bla\");\n}\n\n2. Have a warning on the first line of the method (the -(void)bla {) part.\n3. Fold all methods\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe warning is still visible on the folded line\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarning is not visible anymore, until the method is unfolded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode8: the warning used to be visible in Xcode 8, but no longer is in Xcode9."
