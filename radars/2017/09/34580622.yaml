    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 allows you to press 5 times the sleep/wake button to access the emergency options while also locking the device and requiring a passcode (disabling biometrics such as TouchID). When TouchID is disabled or non-existent, there's a security option to require a passcode after a period of time that's not \"immediately\". Whenever that option is used (e.g. 1m, 5m, 15m), and the 5-times-press action is performed, the device shows the emergency UI, but if attempted to unlock (assuming the device was previously unlocked and the set time hasn't passed yet) the device will succeed. The device should be locked immediately when the emergency trigger is activated.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Disable biometrics or use a phone without them\r\n2) Set a passcode to unlock\r\n3) Set the \"Require Passcode After\" time to something other than immediately.\r\n4) Set the device in sleep mode.\r\n5) Fast press the sleep/wake button 5 times until the Emergency UI comes up.\r\n6) Cancel the emergency UI.\r\n7) Attempt to unlock the device by pressing the home button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device requires a passcode to unlock.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device unlocks.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11\r\n15A372\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone without TouchID setup or enabled to handle unlocks."

    title: On phones locked only with passcode, 5-press to lock doesn't lock if "stay unlocked for n amount of minutes" is set.
