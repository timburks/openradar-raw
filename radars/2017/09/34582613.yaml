    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes 12.7 breaks web links to iOS apps. Search results on the web do want to open iTunes on the Mac. iTunes just gives me a blank page. \nThis drives away customers!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave iTunes 12.7 in macOS. Search for any app via your favourite web search engine. The web search result wants to open iTunes. iTunes shows just a blank page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes must never break links to existing iOS Apps. Especially not the ones from https://search.itunes.apple.com/ which are the best ranked search results on the web for iOS apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAny Browser want to open a link from https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search to iTunes which iTunes then ignores by showing a blank page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug in iTunes is breaking discoverability of Apps. This bug in iTunes is breaking millions of existing links on the web to Apps by your developers. This bug in iTunes is breaking millions of affiliate links, stripping website owners, who support the Apple ecosystem, of necessary income.\n\nThis bug in iTunes breaks any possibility for Mac users to buy iOS apps which they may be doing for reasons of accessibility, security or convenience."
