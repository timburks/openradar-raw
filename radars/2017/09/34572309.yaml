    description: "Summary:\r\nTriggering sysdiagnose on iPhone 7 Plus (Volume Up, Down + Sleep) is very hard to do, since the gesture is a superset to Force Restart gesture (Volume Down + Sleep).\r\n\r\nThis somehow seems especially challenging since iOS 11.0 update, and I have wasted hours trying to collect sysdiagnose so I can help you guys fix the bugs, but instead I got my device forced restart. Four times today, I had to reproduce the bug all over again.\r\n\r\nPressing all three buttons with infinitesimal delays between each press, and I'd get no vibration at all. When I try doing the same thing (three-button press) for a couple of times, my device force-restarts. I'm not evening pressing all three for 10 seconds. I just press all three buttons many times, in attempt to trigger the sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nI did read the updated instruction that I should press for at least 250ms. That didn't help me getting better success rate.\r\n\r\nPlease, change the Force Restart gesture and make it exclusive from sysdiagnose gesture. This is frustrating, because failure to trigger the sysdiagnose results in something destructive -- I lost all my bug reproduction progress!\r\n\r\nConsider that you do this not for me, but for Apple (yourselves). You rely on many sysdiagnose and bug reports to make your products better. Why not try to make it easier for us to help you?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Try to press all three buttons to trigger sysdiagnose with 1-2 second period.\r\n- Sometimes, many times, you'd get no vibration feedback.\r\n- Attempt the same thing a few times, and the device force-restarts instead.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExclusive sysdiagnose, Force Restart gestures.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsysdiagnose gesture is a superset of Force Restart, making it prone to destructive consequence if gesture is misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (also since iOS 10.x)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
