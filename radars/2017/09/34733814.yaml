    description: "Before the 10.13 High Sierra upgrade, I had a partition layout with three HFS+ partitions, roughly as follows:\r\n\r\n1. large HFS+ partition\r\n2. smaller HFS+ partition\r\n3. HFS+ partition with my main OS (now on 10.13 High Sierra)\r\n\r\nWith the upgrade, 3 was automatically converted to APFS and wrapped inside an APFS container. 1 and 2 were left untouched. I was able to manually convert them. Doing so, however, created another APFS container for each, so now I have:\r\n\r\n* container disk3\r\n** partition disk3s1\r\n* container disk4\r\n** partition disk4s1\r\n* container disk1\r\n** partition disk1s1\r\n** (additional partitions such as VM and Preboot)\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no way to losslessly merge the three contains into one, nor, as a more cumbersome alternative, to move a volume from one container to another?"
