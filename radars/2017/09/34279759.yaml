    description: "Summary:\r\nNote that I am not sure whether this an iOS 11 SDK or Xcode 9 bug.\n\nWith Xcode 9 / iOS 11, images from the asset catalog with the rendering mode set to \"Template Image\" will be rendered as \"Original Image\" (i.e. without taking into account the tint color and alpha channel of the image) if the UIImageView displaying them has 2 or less \"Spacing to nearest neighbor\" autolayout constraint.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a new image to your asset catalog\n2. Set the image rendering mode to \"Template Image\"\n3. Add a UIImageView to a storyboard / nib, and set its image to the image added in step 1\n4. Position the UIImageView with at most 2 \"spacing\" constraints\n   (For example, a Vertical Spacing to Top, a Horizontal Spacing to Left, a Width, and a Height constraints)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image is rendered as template, with its pixels where alpha = 1 taking the color of tintColor, and the other pixel as transparent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is rendered as \"original\", with its original colors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached project reproducing the problem. The two UIImageView use the same image with rendering mode set to \"Template\", but only one of the same actually is rendering as template.\n\nThis used to work fine pre-Xcode 9.\n\nSee also this SO answer explaining the same problem: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43524192/404321"
