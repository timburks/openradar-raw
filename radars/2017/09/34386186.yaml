    description: "Summary:\r\nThe product numbers across the Apple product lines are confusing to no end: There's:\r\n\r\nXcode 9\r\niOS 11\r\nmacOS 12\r\nwatchOS 4\r\nSwift 4\r\n\r\nAll these products are on a yearly schedule, so next year, they will all become:\r\nXcode 10\r\niOS 12\r\nmacOS 14\r\nwatchOS 5\r\nSwift 5\r\n\r\nWhen discussing anything Apple-technology related, these small variations in the numbers seem to constantly confuse people. I heard people mention (in brackets what they actually meant):\r\n- Xcode 4 [Xcode 9]\r\n- Xcode 11 [Xcode 9]\r\n- iOS 9 [iOS 11]\r\n- macOS 11 [macOS 12]\r\n- Swift 11 [Swift 4]\r\n\r\nIt would be great if all these different versions would just move to the same number every year as they're all being updated every year anyway. Examples would be:\r\n\r\nUsing the highest Number:\r\nXcode 13\r\niOS 13\r\nmacOS 13\r\nwatchOS 13\r\nSwift 13\r\n\r\nUsing the year:\r\nXcode 2018\r\niOS 2018\r\nmacOS 2018\r\nwatchOS 2018\r\nSwift 2018\r\n\r\nThis would greatly remove confusion and much align the product numbers."
