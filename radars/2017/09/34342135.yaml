    description: "Summary:\r\nYou should be able to paste the name of a method when the jump bar is open to filter out the results, but it is not working. I thought it worked at some point, but it’s definitely very inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a Swift project, open the jump bar, paste in the text of a method or property name or partial method name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list of methods and properties will be filtered and the filter box will show with your pasted query just like if you had typed it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt randomly selects some method or property and doesn’t filter. The one it selects is never correct that I’ve found.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
