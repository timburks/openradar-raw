    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen rotating the device, it appears that the CSS safe-area-inset constants are not getting updated in UIWebView. They seem to be getting updated after the rotation, but not in time for them to apply to the re-drawn view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load a page with `viewport-fit=cover` and `constant(safe-area-inset-top)` into a fullscreen UIWebView on iPhone X in portrait view (example HTML: https://gist.github.com/dpogue/dbfe53aaa2c8ed914c8f2d8fd8beb78a)\n\n2. Rotate the device to landscape view.\n\n3. Rotate the device back to portrait view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe safe area constants should be correct for the given view, and update automatically when rotation occurs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter rotating to landscape view, the safe-area-inset-top still seems to have a value of 44px.\nAfter rotating back to portrait view, the safe-area-inset-top seems to have a value of 0px.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is fixed in WKWebView, possibly by this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174598 & rdar://problem/33364275"
