    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to search for files matching a range of file sizes, searchfs() should only return matching files. However, on APFS, it returns seemingly every symlink as well, even if their symlink data does not match the size range.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is the Xcode project for a \"searchfs\" tool along with an executable.\r\n\r\nRun the tool on 10.13 with an APFS volume like this, replacing lowsize and highsize with numbers such as 2 and 2:\r\n\r\n  ./searchfs -v -s lowsize -S highsize /\r\n\r\nThis would list all files whose data length is between lowsize and highsize on that volume.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould only list files that match the given size range.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLists many 1000 items alongside. It seems to be EVERY symlink existing on the volume.\r\n\r\nNote 2: The same search, when performed on an HFS+ volume, correctly lists only the files, not the folders.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 beta 9 (17A360a)"
