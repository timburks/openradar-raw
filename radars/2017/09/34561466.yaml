    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an integration was run on xcode server (the independent app formerly used with Xcode 8), a simulator actually running the tests could be seen after logging in to the non-administrative user (2nd user created to run the integrations only).\r\n\r\nWith Xcode 9's xcode server, this is not being seen. \r\n- I see the integration running and it shows the name of the test being run, but when I log in to the user running the integration in xcode server, I see only a blank screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- On xcode 9.0 (9A235), setup an xcode server on the same machine.\r\n- Create a bot running tests on specific simulators, unselecting 'Run tests in parallel'\r\n- Run the bot integration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn logging into secondary user, simulator(s) can be seen running the UI tests\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo simulator(s) are seen on logging in to the secondary user, although the bot shows integration being run at the chosen moment.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 (9A235) release build\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\nProcessor 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3"
