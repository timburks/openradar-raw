    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a mobile device management (MDM) profile on my iPhone. I cannot share things to the Messages app via the Messages Share Extension on iOS 11. This thread (https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-11-messages-missing-in-share-menu.2061848/) suggests it's an issue with how iOS 11 interprets MDM profiles.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to share a photo from the Photos app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThe Messages icon appears as a sharing option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Messages icon does not appear as a sharing option. It is not present in the More... menu either.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, model MG4P2LL/A"
