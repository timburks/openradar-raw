    description: "Area:\r\nReplayKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThank you thank you thank you for `startCapture(handler:completionHandler:)`!!! Now that RPK is a viable method for Lookback to perform UX research, I ran into an issue: ReplayKit only seems to record the main application window?\r\n\r\nI have two overlay windows in my test app, and neither seems to be part of the final recording; only the main window is.\r\n\r\nAttaching sample project to demonstrate issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a project with two UIWindows\r\n2. Present them both on screen, so one is visible over the other; bottom being key and top being just visible.\r\n3. Use ReplayKit to record the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. In the Preview, both windows are visible\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n4. Only the bottom-most key window is visible\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 developer beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAffects both startRecording and startCapture\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 12\", iPad 10\"\r\n\r\nAttachment: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkiv27ys9kd75f6/RPK%20multiwindow%20recording%20bug.zip?dl=0"
