    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you nest an invocation of SKAction.run(_ block:) inside a call to SKScene.run(.sequence([…])), double-clicking or hitting Return to expand the code placeholder replaces the whole nested stack with the innermost call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass of SKScene.\r\n2. In an instance function or initializer, add the following code:\r\n\r\nrun(.sequence([\r\n    .wait(forDuration: 3),\r\n]))\r\n\r\n3. Add a newline after .wait(forDuration: 3), and type the following:\r\n\r\n.run\r\n\r\n4. Note that there are three available autocomplete suggestions that take a closure parameter:\r\n - 1. run { code }\r\n - 2. run(block: () -> Void)\r\n - 3. run(block: () -> Void, queue: DispatchQueue)\r\n\r\n5. If you accept the first suggestion, it expands the suggestion inline as you would expect, using trailing closure syntax, as .run {\\n\\t<#code#>\\n}. (newlines and tabs indicated with \r\n\\n and \\t for clarity).\r\n6. Instead, go back a step and try accepting the second suggestion.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike step 5, it replaces just the innermost placeholder with the {\\n\\t<#code#>\\n} trailing closure syntax.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt replaces the whole run(.sequence([…])) block with just run {\\n\\t<#code#>\\n}.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9M214v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached video also uploaded to https://cl.ly/mJu2"
