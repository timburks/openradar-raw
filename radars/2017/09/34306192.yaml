    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 11, UIImageView sometimes renders its image rasterized even when the image as `preserves-vector-representation` set to `true` in the assets catalog.\n\nThis occurs when the UIImageView has less than 3 \"Spacing to nearest neighbor\" autolayout constraints.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a new image to your asset catalog\n2. Set the image resizing mode to \"Preserve Vector Data\" (check the checkbox)\n3. Add a UIImageView to a storyboard / nib, and set its image to the image added in step 1\n4. Position the UIImageView with at most 2 \"spacing\" constraints\n   (For example, a Vertical Spacing to Top, a Horizontal Spacing to Left, a Width, and a Height constraints)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRegardless of the original image file size, the UIImageView renders the crisp, non-aliased version of the image, based on the vector data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is rendered as if the `preserves-vector-representation` property was set to false, with a rasterize version of the image enlarged to fit the UIImageView size. The result being a scale-up, blurry, aliased image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 9 (15A5370a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a minimal sample project exhibiting the bug. The 2nd-to-top image has only 2 \"spacing\" constraint and is blurry, the bottom one has 3 \"spacing\" constraint and is crisp.\n\nThis is probably related to rdar://34279759 (http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5005434293321728), as the conditions to reproduce the bug are the same.\n\nRelated SO question, were I discuss the bug with Matt Neuburg: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45622894/"
