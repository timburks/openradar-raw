    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34651564\n\nSmart Punctuation causes data loss when the dash key is tapped 3 times with the US English keyboard (other keyboards also likely). It enters a NULL character. This is unexpected and normally not easy to achieve as a user, but due to Smart Punctuation itâ€™s very easy. Much logic breaks and stops string counting after a \\0.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnter text e.g. in https://pdfviewer.io/ via a free text annotation. Tripe-tap the - key to create em-dash + null character. Continue tapping. \nRestart app\nLoad document, edit, observe all text is missing after the null-character\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should not ever under any circumstance insert \\0 characters in text fields.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInserting \\0 into text\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis causes data loss in core data as well as every other sqlite backed store and probably everywhere where strings are converted to cstrings at some point.\n\nOriginally stumbled over this issue in https://twitter.com/gabrielhauber/status/912590194099888128.\n\nThis also breaks any app using Core Data. No sample needed as it can be trivially tested with basically any app. Also affects Apple Notes. (https://twitter.com/teek_eh/status/912624127768371202)"
