    description: "Summary: When an app with auto-renewing subscriptions is distributed for testing via TestFlight, the user is prompted for their sandbox password multiple times when trying to purchase the subscription, then over and over again when launching the app and even when not using the app. This dissuades users from testing the app and subscriptions which is a huge issue since that's the whole point of TestFlight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Distribute an app with auto-renewing subscriptions via TestFlight\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Purchase experience and password request scenarios should match what is seen when the same app is released on the App Store\r\n\r\nActual Results: Purchase experience in the TestFlight sandbox is significantly different than that of the App Store and the user is prompted for their password over and over again.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 10/11 all builds"
