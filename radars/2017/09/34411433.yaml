    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf a UIResponder view (text field, text view, etc.) provides an inputAccessoryView and an external keyboard is attached, the inputAccessoryView is drawn by the system pinned to the bottom of the screen and does not respect the safe area insets of the current context.\r\n\r\nThis is a noticeable problem on the new iPhone X, where the input accessory view is clipped by and conflicts with the space reserved for the home button swipe.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLaunch attached sample project in iPhone X simulator, hide on-screen keyboard if visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen on-screen keyboard is hidden due to attached external keyboard (or CMD-K in Simulator), the input accessory view should be pinned to the bottom of the current context's safe area insets, not the bottom of the screen to avoid conflicts with home button area on iPhone X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nInput accessory view (red background) maintains it's 44.0pt height pinned to bottom of screen behind home button area.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.0 (9A235) + Simulator.  No hardware available to test at this time."
