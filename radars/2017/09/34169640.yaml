    description: "Summary:\r\nLong stock prices (4 digits to the left of the decimal point, 3 to the right) do not fit in one line in Stocks and are wrapped to a second line. Since there isn't enough space for a second line, the stock is clipped. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a long stock (for example, BTCUSD=X).\r\n2. View the stock in the Stocks app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text wraps and is clipped.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe text is resized to fit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 4.0 (15R5371a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 2 running watchOS 4.0 (15R5371a)"
