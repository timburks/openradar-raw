    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe received a bug-report that opening an image from the gallery with editing (square-cropping) enabled would return a wrong edited image and cropped rectangle. \r\n\r\nI have attached 3 files (2 screenshots): \r\n1. crop_rect.png - Screenshot taken when image is selected and open in crop mode.\r\n2. captured_image.png - Screenshot taken when “choose” button selected and cropped image set to image view.\r\n\r\nIf you see ‘captured_image.png’, you will see that actually captured image has came from area bounded between two horizontal red lines in ‘crop_rect.png’. Ideally it should capture image from default crop rectangle area which can be seen in ‘crop_rect.png’.\r\n\r\nIt looks cropping rectangle is getting translated in vertical upward direction, which is a problem with iOS 11 only.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample app and compare the resulting screens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image is cropped as selected in the editing-screen after selecting the photo.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is cropped incorrectly and does include areas that have not been selected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nDefault - Xcode 9, iOS 11.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDefault"
