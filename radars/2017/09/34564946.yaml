    description: "Summary:\r\nEver since I installed High Sierra, my mac randomly freezes and becomes unusable. I have to force a reset to be able to use it again. Sometimes the mouse cursor still moves, sometimes the entire OS is completely frozen (even the mouse cursor).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI couldn't find specific steps to reproduce the issue, it happens randomly. I noticed that every single time it happened I had Safari opened.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy Mac should not freeze randomly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy Mac freezes randomly and becomes unusable.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 Beta (17A362a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)\r\n2,7 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1 GB\r\n\r\n(OBS: the hang happened around 23:58, looking at the diagnostics info there's a WindowServer spindump around that time.)\r\n\r\n(Attachment: sysdiagnose)"
