    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a new playground I should be able to add it to an existing group. However, I’m not able to select the group corresponding to the workspace that I currently have open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an existing xcworkspace.\n2. Click File > New > Playground\n3. Click Next to create a blank playground.\n4. Provide a name for the new playground.\n5. Navigate to the location where the xcworkspace file exists.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe group drop down at the bottom should let me select a folder group inside the existing workspace.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only group available is the “Unsaved Xcode Document N” group.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:"
