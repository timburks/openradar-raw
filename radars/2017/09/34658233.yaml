    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen pushing a view controller that has stack view and stack's isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement is set to true, all arranged subviews inside stack animate from their initial frames. This does not happen in iOS 10.x.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create ViewController that will push StackViewController\r\n2. Create StackViewController which has a custom view as its main view. The custom view has a UIStackView as its main subview\r\n3. Set stack's isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement to true\r\n4. Add multiple views as stack's arranged subviews\r\n5. Run\r\n6. Push StackViewController from ViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStackViewController has all its views configured correctly before being pushed. Only push transition is being animated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStackViewController has all its views not configured before being pushed, instead, views are at their initial frames. Push transition and arranged subviews transition are being animated.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nAttachment: \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ikhsan/466df0568cd84d68a05d34a8c960d791"
