    description: "Summary:\r\n(Apologies for the categorization of this ticket. The “Documentation” category seems to have disappeared. Feel free to reassign to the appropriate folks.)\r\n\r\nStemming from this conversion: https://twitter.com/smileyborg/status/910723205970649088 — I was going to file a radar to improve the documentation, but found https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/positioning_content_relative_to_the_safe_area instead. Apparently y’all do articles now, which is awesome! This had exactly what I want, but I only stumbled upon the article through a web search (not a developer.apple search \U0001F641).\r\n\r\nBacktracking, I found the article references from the ToC in `UIView`. This is really hard to discover, particularly from a perspective of “you don’t know what you don’t know.” These articles should be surfaced both from the relevant methods (i.e., in this case, from the `additionalSafeAreaInsets` instance property documentation) and at a higher-level above classes or categories."
