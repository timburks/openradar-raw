    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserVC comes with its own set of Key Commands, which is great. However it would be desirable to add our own keyCommands to the already existing ones like so.\n\noverride var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {\n        let custom = UIKeyCommand(input: \"n\",\n                                  modifierFlags: [.alternate, .command],\n                                  action: #selector(handleCustomKeyCommand),\n                                  discoverabilityTitle: “Custom Key Command“)\n\n        guard let superCommands = super.keyCommands else { return [custom] }\n\n        return superCommands + [custom]\n    }\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a subclass of UIDocumentBrowserVC\n2. override `keyCommands` as shown in Description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth the system-provided and the custom key commands work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe custom keyCommand’s discoverabilityTitle actually shows up, if you hold Command, but the KeyCommand can’t be invoked and does nothing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCustom KeyCommands worked in an early beta, before UIDocumentBrowserVC added its own"
