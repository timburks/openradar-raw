    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter changing some point of a Swift class (adding a new variable, changing the name to a function or adding a class) the whole Swift project is recompiled.\r\n\r\nThis is causing a lot of wasted time.\r\n\r\nWe have reproduced the problem with a clean project, only with 2 classes written in Swift, without relation between them.\r\n\r\nIncremental builds are working only if we change something INSIDE a function.\r\nThis forum thread is related https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/62737\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a Swift project\r\n2. Add 2 classes.\r\n3. Add 2 vars to the classes.\r\n4. Compile.\r\n5. Change the name of one of the variables.\r\n6. Compile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe incremental builds should not recompile all the Swift classes that were not changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the classes are recompiled even if there were no changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIs happening on any machine.\r\nMine in particular has these configuration:\r\nOS 10.11.6 (15G1004) - 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7 - 16 GB DDR3\r\n\r\n--------\r\nUpdate from September 1st: this is still happening with Xcode 9 and Swift 4"
