    description: "As far as I can tell, there only appears to be one way to gain access to the list of Completed items within the macOS 10.12.6 (16G29) version of Reminders: use the scrollwheel on your mouse to scroll upwards, revealing the previously hidden row at the top, then click the Show label on the right side of that row.\r\n\r\nThere are no menu shortcuts that achieve the same thing, no keyboard actions appear to achieve it, and it doesn't appear to be possible to obtain that row without using the scrollwheel (or scrolling region on a trackpad or other tracking type device).\r\n\r\nWhat if I'm using a MacMini, and the only mouse I've got connect doesn't have a scrollwheel? Not every user is using an Apple Magic Mouse. I *am* using a Magic Mouse and I found it frustrating that there was no keyboard shortcut or menu item that says \"Show completed items\"."
