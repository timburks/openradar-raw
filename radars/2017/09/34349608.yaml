    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nView controllers without top in edgesForExtendedLayout temporarily receive an increased safeAreaInset during navigation transitions. This happens during an animation, so scroll views whose contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior is not never will show a quick \"bounce\" during the transition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached repro project (or, build your own view controller with a scrollView and without top in edgesForExtendedLayout)\r\n2. Tap the \"Hello, World!\" cell to push another view controller onto the navigation stack\r\n3. Tap the back button to pop back to your original view controller with a scrollView\r\n4. Observe during the transition that the scrollView initially starts too low and bounces back to the top by the end of the transition\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no bounce while transitioning back to the view controller. This is the behavior under previous iOS versions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a bounce while transitioning back to the view controller. I've attached a video displaying this bounce and a screenshot showing that the top cell of the table is too low on the page during the transition.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5361a) built with Xcode 9 beta 6"
