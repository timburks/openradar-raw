    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere's a bug in xar latest public source code (https://opensource.apple.com/source/xar/xar-357/xar/lib/darwinattr.c.auto.html) and as far as I can tell, the problem is also in the version used in High Sierra.\r\n\r\nIn the stragglers_archive function, the fits struct is not declared as packed. This leads to issue when dealing with files on a APFS volume (and maybe HFS+ too) as the returned value is random and so the FinderCreateTime property will contains incorrect values such as:\r\n\r\n \r\n     402096012-07-25T21:56:16 \r\n     123145302310912 \r\n \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Look at the source of the stragglers_archive function.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe struct should be packed. Personally, I didn't know this. Someone else pointed out the issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe struct is not packed. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nxar-357 and High Sierra b9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro Retina"
