    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a new Exchange account on the iOS 11 Mail app, there are only two options: Sign in with Microsoft and Setup manually. It ignores the automatic setup via autodiscover entirely which was available in iOS 10 and previous versions and made Exchange account setups seamlessly if a user's domain is configured for autodiscover\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Settings App\r\n2) Go to Accounts and Passwords\r\n3) Tap Add Account\r\n4) Select Exchange\r\n5) Enter an Exchange email address that is *not* hosted by Office 365 (in our case, we used Rackspace's Hosted Exchange service)\r\n6) Click Next\r\n7) Selecting either \"Configure Manually\" or \"Sign in\" will yield the same undesired result\r\n8) Enter mailbox password\r\n9) You get prompted for the Exchange server settings. Prior to iOS 11, the system would look for the autodiscover record and set the account automatically if it found one, and reverted to the server settings screen if there was no record found.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf there is an autodiscover record on the domain (which all our test domains had) to setup the account automatically using the autodiscover record\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the account is not an Office 365 account, we get prompted to enter the Exchange server settings instead of checking for the autodiscover record and attempting to set up automatically.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016 mailboxes, both configured with an autodiscover record.\r\n\r\nThe domains tested were raxmex08.com and raxmex09.com and their respective autodiscover records can be found at autodiscover.raxmex08.com and autodiscover.raxmex09.com"
