    description: "If I’m driving, or using Apple Maps for driving directions, the stand notification on my watch should be silenced. \r\n\r\nYou already know that I’m either driving (in iOS 11) or using Apple Maps for driving directions (in iOS), why bother me with a notification to stand up while I’m already driving. It’s counterintuitive and a distraction."
