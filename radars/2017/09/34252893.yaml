    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is currently no way to tell if a device supports Apple SSO. If I am using a device with US App Store, I see an option in settings to sign in/out with my cable provider.\r\nIf I am as using a device with Polish App Store, the TV provider option disappears from settings - Apple SSO is not available.\r\nBut when I launch my app, when it calls VSAccountManager.checkAccessStatus it still asks the user if it can use provider information (makes no sense since this information is not available on the device), only later VSAccountMetadataRequest fails with VSError.unsupportedProvider - which is kinda true, but this is the same error that is returned when I tap 'Other TV provider' on the Apple SSO picker screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch an app that uses Apple SSO, with a user signed in to a non-US App Store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVSAccountManager.checkAccessStatus does not ask user for a permission to use Apple SSO. It should return an error (access not granted kind of makes sense, but other code like 'notSupported' would make more sense)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVSAccountManager.checkAccessStatus returns granted if a user agrees, and only later VSAccountMetadataRequest fails with unsupportedProvider error. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUser signed in with an Apple ID connected to a non-US App Store (one that does not support Apple SSO)."
