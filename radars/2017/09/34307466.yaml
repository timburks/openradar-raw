    description: "Summary:\r\nRemoving a KVO observer while it calls out in NSKeyValueObservingOptionInitial throws an 'NSRangeException', reason: 'Cannot remove an observer (â€¦) because it is not registered as an observer.' \n\nHowever it is registered - it is just still in the registration phase and doing the initial callback because of NSKeyValueObservingOptionInitial. This of course is a stupid example, but complex real-world code might has conditions where something is observed and immediately finishes. We discovered multiple crashes in PDF Viewer because of that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Sample.\nObserve exception throw.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nunobserving while in the initial callback should still work. This is leaking out an implementation detail and this issue is not documented, thus I consider it a bug.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnobserve crashes. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTested on iOS 8+ and always fails."
