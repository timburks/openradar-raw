    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf an app gets permission to access the image library, it will get full access to all image metadata also, including the exact location.\r\nThis is a serious privacy issue, as third party camera apps that want to just store a picture the user took, will also get full access to all photos and their locations in their image library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask the user for permission to access photo library\r\n2. If approved, get a list of all the past locations using\r\n```objective-c\r\nPHFetchResult *photos = [PHAsset fetchAssetsWithMediaType:PHAssetMediaTypeImage options:nil];\r\n    \r\nfor (PHAsset *asset in photos) {\r\n    if ([asset location]) {\r\n        // Access the full location, speed, full picture, camera model, etc. here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Use that data to get a great understanding of what the user does\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a clear separation of \r\n\r\n- `Saving a photo` (e.g. a 3rd party camera app wants to save a photo you just took)\r\n- `Selecting a photo` (e.g. you want to upload an existing picture to Instagram)\r\n- `Granting full access to the photo library` (e.g. Dropbox or Google Photos to backup your complete library)\r\n\r\nAdditionally the native image picker should be enforced by Apple, and apps that use their custom one will be rejected. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is only one kind of permission for photos: `Full access`, resulting in privacy issues for the user\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCheck out the sample project attached, works with Xcode 9 on iOS 11\r\n\r\nyou can find the sample code, with screenshots on GitHub as well: https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location/"
