    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'd like to see a way to turn off the current alarm while in Nightstand Mode, say by pressing one of the side buttons or something similar. This would be useful if someone needs to turn off an alarm that they've previously scheduled. Currently, this process is tedious: take Apple Watch off its charging puck, unlock it, open the Alarms app, find the alarm, and flip its switch. If someone realizes at 4 AM that they have an alarm that they don't need and want to sleep through (for example, a recurring alarm on a holiday) they should be able to just turn it off without having to fumble around with Apple Watch in the dark. This would also be useful if someone accidentally snoozes an alarm they meant to turn offâ€“they could just use this button combination to cancel the snooze."
