    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a custom UICollectionViewLayout for displaying cells in a 2x2 grid in full screen. When the view first loads, UICollectionViewDelegate collectionView:willDisplayCell:forItemAtIndexPath is called for all 4 items in view. When paging to the next page of cells, the delegate method is NOT called for the focused cell under tvOS 11.\r\n\r\nExample: If I move to the top right cell (cell #1 in my custom layout) and move to the next cell horizontally (cell #4), the delegate method is called for all other cells except cell #4. If I move to the bottom right cell (cell #3) and move horizontally to the next cell (cell #6), the delegate method is not called for cell #6.\r\n\r\nThis happens in both the simulator and on an actual Apple TV device.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT the case in tvOS 10, only tvOS 11\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn the attached sample project (CollectionViewTest) I have set up something very similar to my actual project - the custom layout code (CollectionViewLayout) is directly copied from my project. The currently focused cell has a white border drawn around it. Move from Cell #0 to Cell #1, then move horizontally to the next page to select Cell #4. Notice in the console output that \"Will Display Cell #\" is output for all cells #5, #6, and #7, but not for cell #4. When moving back to the previous cell (Cell #1) notice that \"End Displaying Cell #\" is again output for all cells except Cell #4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the delegate method to be called for all cells.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelegate method is not called for all cells.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\ntvOS 11 SDK (beta 6?)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6\r\nXcode 9 beta 6\r\n\r\n\r\nComment: Sept 29, 2017\r\nStill present in tvOS 11 and tvOS 11.1 beta 1 using Xcode 9 and Xcode 9.1 beta 1"
