    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary: On 10.13, on a FileVault protected APFS disk (upgraded from 10.12.6), changing the recovery key (-personal) and supplying the wrong password deletes the recovery key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Start with a 10.12.6 system with a Filevault2 protected Disk with a personal recovery key\r\n- Install 10.13\r\n- as root, run \"fdesetup list\" to verify that there is a recovery key.  The user shows up as \"(null)\" for the recovery key.\r\n- run \"fdesetup validaterecovery\" to see that the recovery key is correct.\r\n- run \"fdesetup changerecovery -personal\" and enter an incorrect password.\r\n- run \"fdesetup list\" again, and see that the entry for the user \"(null)\" has disappeared.\r\n- run \"fdesetup validaterecovery\" again, to see that the recovery key no longer works.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe changerecovery operation should be rejected due to an incorrect password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe recovery key is removed!\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13/17A365\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro 15, late 2013"
