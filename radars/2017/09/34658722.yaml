    description: "Summary:\r\nThe release notes for iOS system software updates have no bottom padding.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait for an iOS update to be available.\r\n2. Go to Settings → General → Software Update.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe release notes have a visually pleasing bottom padding.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe release notes have no bottom padding. If you press and hold on the text, you can select it, and if you pull down while selecting, you can slowly scroll the text view that appears to be embedded in the table view cell, revealing the proper padding. The text view’s padding just doesn’t seem to be taken into account during cell sizing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttachment also uploaded to https://cl.ly/mj1o"
