    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCannot \"reveal in project navigator\" from the RTF editor.  The usual right-click->Reveal doesn't exist. Just get the text men.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen an RTF file in Xcode\r\nDesire to see where it is in the project navigator (in my case to remove it. Perhaps this is a self-preservation mechanism the file has)\r\nRight-click n the editor and get contextual menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSee \"Reveal in Pröject Navigator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDon't see \"Reveal in Pröject Navigator\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAttached is a gif showing numerous file types (swift files, totally-unknown, TTF font) that show the reveal contextual menu item, and RTF that does not (and interestingly, I had mistakenly added some PDF files, and those dudes also don't have the Reveal in Project navigator)"
