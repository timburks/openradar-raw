    description: "Summary:\r\nI have videos downloaded in the WWDC app and it seems after the update of the app around the time of the September 2017 Special Event and the release of the Fall 2017 videos the ‘Downloaded videos only’ always returns ‘No Results’. This applies both to videos downloaded before the update and those downloaded after.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have downloaded videos in the WWDC app. You can see this by some having a check in a circle instead of a cloud with a downwards arrow.\n2. In the Videos tab, choose All in the segmented control, then tap Filter then enable ‘Downloaded videos only’.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould show downloaded videos (and only downloaded videos).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShows ‘No Results’.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0.2 (649)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
