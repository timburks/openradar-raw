    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen switching from one Input Method, for example US to Hiragana (Japanese), although the keyboard shortcut seems to be recognised and the icon in the menu bar changes the text inserted in the text field in focus do not reflect the change.\r\n\r\nWhen this occurs, by attempting to type into Spotlight field seems to reset with a bit of a delay enabling the change.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiragana to US fails, yellow highlight appears instead of underlines to indicate it has not been confirmed/converted. When US to Hiragana switch fails, it continues to input the alphabets without any indications of conversion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fill in a text field\r\n2. Attempt to change from one input method to another (US -> Hiragana | Hiragana -> US) using keyboard shortcut (Command+space)\r\n3. Observe that menubar icon indicates the input method is changed \r\n4. Attempt to type a text into a field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe behaviour of text input should reflect the input method indicated on the menubar.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. The text input does not reflect the input method indicated in the menu bar\r\n2. Trigger spotlight and type a text into field, with a small delay the correct input method is engaged. \r\n\r\nNote: This may happen more if one switches from one application to another.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nThis has been happening since the previous version.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt has occurred in two completely separate clean install macOS systems without any configuration migration. \r\nBoth configured with Hiragana (Japanese) and US input configuration."
