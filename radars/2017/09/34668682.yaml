    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHi! I have oleb's what's-new-in-swift-4 playground.  I'l also teaching this week and using this as part of the instruction.  I embiggen fonts using cmd-= so folks can see things (obtw THANK YOU so much for that feature.  When that was announced, all the instructors around me went oooooh). The width of the number in numbered lists does not grow to match the font size, so eventually \"15. \", enlarged turns into \"15\", enlarged  turns into \"1\"\r\n\r\nSee attached gif file, doing cmd-= \r\n\r\nOle's repo is at https://github.com/ole/whats-new-in-swift-4\r\n\r\nand to save you a trip, the playground is attached here too."
