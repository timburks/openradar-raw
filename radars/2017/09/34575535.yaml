    description: "Summary:\r\nAll non-Japanese movies on iTunes suffer from these problems:\r\n- Available in two versions (original audio and Japanese) rather than only one with audio choice.\r\n- The one with clear image is the one \"dubbed\" in Japanese.\r\n- The one with original audio has huge Japanese subtitles stuck on the image (yes, hard sub, not soft, like back in the 90's with the VHS era)\r\n- The price of digital rentals/purchases is higher even than latest releases in video clubs, that have Blu-ray versions with better image quality and SOFT subs (most of the time even multiple subtitles) and bonuses, making renting/buying from iTunes a really bad choice especially when we have to chose between an annoying image or annoying dub.\r\n\r\nPlease at least add the possibility to disable subtitles, that would make me at least chose to rent on iTunes instead.\r\nBetter, have one version with multiple audio rather than 2, and subtitles in CC.\r\nThanks."
