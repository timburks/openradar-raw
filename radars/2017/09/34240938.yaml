    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI drag-added a file to an Xcode project, indenting for it to go into my application bundle. I choose the target to add it to. When I ran, the file wasn't there.  It actually did not get added to the project.\r\n\r\nSee movie at this dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/redacted/add-to-target.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDrag a file into the your Xcode project \r\nIn the sheet that drops down, choose a target to add it to.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe item gets added to the target and I can keep working\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe item does not get added to the target, and I burn time debugging it and filing a bug report.  I have to manually tick the \"member of target\" in the file inspector.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)"
