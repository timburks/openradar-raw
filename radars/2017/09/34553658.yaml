    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a Swift extension on an Objective-C class, Navigate -> Jump to [Previous/Next] Counterpart works from Objective-C to the Swift extension, but not from the Swift extension. This worked correctly in Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an Objective-C class and a Swift extension on that class\r\n2) Open the .m file\r\n3) In the Navigate menu, select Jump to Next Counterpart. The swift file opens.\r\n4) From the swift file, Jump to Next Counterpart again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe .h file should open\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode attempts to show a generated swift interface for the .h file. This sometimes succeeds and sometimes just shows a loading indicator endlessly.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
