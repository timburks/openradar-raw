    description: "Summary:\r\nCompiling crashes in the build construction phase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRequires PSPDFKit project, we cannot share that.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould work. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWorked (mostly) through Xcode 9 betas, stopped compiling successfully in 9GM and now crashes in build construction phase. We also have iMessage Stickers which isnâ€™t yet supported so we were not able to fully use it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNotes are limited to 1000 characters so put crash report log here:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/steipete/a05e322c40f4424e86c5603d41882b8a"
