    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an important design discrepancy in how Size Class is enforced for 2/3 Split Portrait View on iPad Pro 12.9.\r\n\r\nApple's official doc indicates that 2/3 Split Portrait View for iPad Pro 12.9 gets Regular Width (I don't think it makes sense, since ratio-wise it should be Compact, but ok.)\r\n\r\nXcode's interface builder also enforces the same thing. Screenshot attached.\r\n\r\nHowever, `traitCollectionDidChange` informs me that 2/3 Split Portrait View has **Compact** Width. Screenshot attached, and a sample Xcode project attached.\r\n\r\nPlease address this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached Xcode project on an iPad Pro 12.9 simulator in Portrait Mode\r\n2. Put the app in 2/3 Split View.\r\n3. See the logging message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSame horizontal size class as in the official doc and in IB expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`traitCollectionDidChange` returns inconsistent horizontal Size Class.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 with iOS 11 SDK\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBP mid 2014. See attachment."
