    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the Control Centre in iOS 11 to power off Wi-Fi does not work, instead, any active connections are disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure an iPhone or iPad has Wi-Fi powered on and is connected to a Wi-Fi network.\r\n2. Use the relevant swipe gesture to bring the Control Centre into focus.\r\n3. Tap the Wi-Fi icon to power it off.\r\n\r\n<video attachment demonstrating issue>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWi-Fi should be powered off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActive connections to a Wi-Fi network are disconnected. Wi-Fi remains powered on.\r\n\r\nThe only means of turning off Wi-Fi from the Control Centre is now through Airplane mode. This is not desired behaviour as it also disables Cellular and Bluetooth.\r\nThere are many circumstances where disabling _only_ Wi-Fi is the desired action.\r\n\r\nThis change in behaviour is also a step backwards in functionality as users are now forced to go back into the Wi-Fi settings in the Settings app to power off Wi-Fi; this changes quick troubleshooting steps that users have previously been able to take when dealing with flaky Wi-Fi connections.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 (15A372)"
