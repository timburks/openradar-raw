    description: "Summary:\r\nBeing an English speaker living in Japan, I set up my display language and Siri to English, while keeping the region set to Japan. This works on every single device I won and have owned (countless Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs).\r\nThe problem with the Apple TV 4 onwards, is that Siri turns completely off if the region is Japan and display is English, I have to set everything to Japanese for it to work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the region to Japan and display to anything else but Japanese.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike all other devices supporting Siri, that Siri stays active and usable.\r\nEven if I understand it may be difficult for some movies names or so, all other commands like \"Rewind\", \"Play Music\" etc should still be usable (in fact even searching for movies works in English if I use dictation, as almost all have an English name).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri turns completely off and the Siri Remote becomes pretty much useless.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\ntvOS 9 onwards, now 11.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 4 64GB"
