    description: "Summary:\r\nSmart Punctuation causes data loss when the dash key is tapped 3 times with the US English keyboard (other keyboards also likely). It enters a NULL character. This is unexpected and normally not easy to achieve as a user, but due to Smart Punctuation itâ€™s very easy. Much logic breaks and stops string counting after a \\0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnter text e.g. in https://pdfviewer.io/ via a free text annotation. Tripe-tap the - key to create em-dash + null character. Continue tapping. \nRestart app\nLoad document, edit, observe all text is missing after the null-character\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should not ever under any circumstance insert \\0 characters in text fields.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInserting \\0 into text\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOriginally stumbled over this issue in https://twitter.com/gabrielhauber/status/912590194099888128.\n\nThis also breaks any app using Core Data. No sample needed as it can be trivially tested with basically any app. Also affects Apple Notes. (https://twitter.com/teek_eh/status/912624127768371202)"
