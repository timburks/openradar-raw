    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes I have some styled text that has multiple mismatching styles because it was edited in a variety of environments, e.g. it is an email draft that was edited from a variety of clients, including the mail provider's webmail interface. But when preparing it for publication I would like to harmonize the style because there is no point in reflecting these edition artifacts in the final pieces. Note that I don't mean downgrading to raw text, as some decisions I might want to keep (e.g. one of the fonts).\r\n\r\nSo for instance instead of just a blank indicator for the font when the selection contains multiple of them, I would like to know which one is most used, and where the outliers are, so that I know if I should bring these outliers in line or not. Same for color, for size, etc. An option to harmonize as a single step everything except bold, italics, underline and strikethrough (which are typically kept when publishing for the web) would be helpful, too."
