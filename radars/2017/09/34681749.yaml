    description: "I'm currently in the process of migrating away from a custom tiled map to MapKit, which just works so much better for our app. The app shows custom map overlays though, which, when drawn on the map, obfuscate the labels already present on the map itself leading to a very unexpected UI. \r\nI had thought that the labels were included in the MKMapView's `showsPointsOfInterest`, which I've set to false, but they're still shown as demonstrated in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic if it were able to disable the map's own labels altogether, as they're not relevant at all for the app in question.\r\n\r\nThank you! \U0001F642"
