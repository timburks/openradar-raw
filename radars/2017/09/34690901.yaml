    description: "Summary:\r\nmacOS playgrounds frequently stop working. There is a spinner in the UI at the top saying “Running [playground name]”, but nothing appears in the live view, and there is no text in the right-hand side to indicate that pieces of the code are running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI don’t really have steps to reproduce, it happens quite frequently, but I’m not sure why or what the circumstances are.\n\nSometimes there are error messages in the console indicating a compile error, but even when that compile error is fixed, the playground can still be hung.\n\nStopping and starting the playground doesn’t have any effect. Usually closing the window and re-opening the playground has no effect. The only reliable solution is quitting and restarting Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playground should run, or if unable to run should give an error message, or if there’s no error message, there should be something to click on for more information, like an error log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. No feedback.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf there is additional information I can provide, or additional diagnostics I can turn on to help, I’m happy to do that. This issue is quite frustrating and makes playgrounds nearly unusable."
