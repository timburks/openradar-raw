    description: "Summary:\r\nThe build variable XCS_ARCHIVE that is produced from a successful archive results in a path that no longer exists on disk\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode\r\n2. Use manual signing with a new app id and distribution certificate\r\n3. Create a git repository for the project and commit to the remote\r\n4. Do an initial archive of the project, and ensure the exportOptions.plist is created \r\n5. Set up a new build job that performs an archive. Use the exportOption plist file from the previous step in the Export Setting popup list\r\n6. Log the path assigned to the XCS_ARCHIVE variable in a post build trigger using \r\necho \"XCS_ARCHIVE: ${XCS_ARCHIVE}\"\r\n7. Run the new build job and go to the logs to get the path emitted from the build variable\r\n8. Confirm that the path does not exist on disk\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive should exist at the location specified by the environment variable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no directory at the specified path. This causes post build scripts that rely on this variable to fail. Uses include using this path to get the resulting ipa file for upload to iTunes Connect or for ad-hoc distribution.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
