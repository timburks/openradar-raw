    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHello.\r\nWe're preparing our application to be submitted to the App Store has soon as iOS 11 final releases comes publicly available.\r\nIn the process we have noticed there is a system alert appearing every time the user wants to be redirected to SafariViewController to sign up with Facebook.\r\nIs this intentional? Can we do something to prevent this alert to be presented in the middle of the registration funnel? \r\n\r\nThanks for your assistance.\r\nSincerely.\r\n\r\nBarbara Rodeker\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Compile the app against iOS11\r\n- integrate latest FB SDK 4.25.0\r\n- try to sign up with FB \r\n- Observe the system alert appearing in the middle of the registration flow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- User should be redirected to Safari view controller without intermediate extra steps\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- Users are interrupted by a system alert\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS11 Beta 7 \r\nXCode Version 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 8 2017, 11:38 PM\r\nCan you please confirm if you are using SFAuthenticationSession api?\r\n\r\nBarbara Rodeker\r\nSeptember 11 2017, 9:52 AM\r\nGood morning, we are using FB SDK FBSDKLoginKit 4.25.0 which is using SFAuthenticationSession as far as I know, since I found other developers having the same popup. So I guess is it the expected behaviour?\r\n\r\nSeptember 15 2017, 5:40 AM\r\nThank you for your feedback. Engineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended.  We are now closing this bug report.  If you just have questions about the resolution, then please update your bug report with that information so we can respond."
