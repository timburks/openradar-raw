    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n(I'd be even happier if rdar://32718717 were addressed to remove all in-editor indications of warnings and errors. I find them intrusive, plus it's an accessibility issue with my given chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses)\r\n\r\nThe in-editor errors/warning (the colored background, plus the in-edtior placards) do not go away when the code they indicate has been deleted.  Because these are now impossible to hide (We used to in Xcode8 - rdar://32718717), this colored intrusion persists for the entire time we're writing replacement code.  The \"build then immediately interrupt\" hack is not always an option because that stops the simulator too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a warning. Build. Get a wash of color over the warning.\r\nDelete the entire line of code the warning points to\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe code goes away.  The warning goes away\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe code goes away.  A now-worthless warning stays.  Please see attached gif.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nXcode 8 used to let us hide these things. (command-control-M.  My favorite keystroke in Xcode8)\r\n\r\nThe warning stays if I delete the line with control-A control-K, also if I select the line with triple-clicking and backspace.  Deleting the whole function and then undoing it makes the warning go away."
