    description: "Area:\r\nPreview\r\n\r\nThe enclosed PDF renders incorrectly in Preview. It renders fine in Acrobat Reader and also when using Quick Look from the Finder.\r\n\r\nI have investigated the problem a bit and it seems to be related to the interplay between the embedded RGBA PNG and the associated SMask in the PDF.\r\n\r\nThe image is specified as having /BitsPerComponent 16 whereas the SMask is specified as having /BitsPerComponent 8. The problem does not show up in files where these values are equal. \r\n\r\nNote: The included PDF was processed with QPDF (http://qpdf.sourceforge.net), to make it easier to debug.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThe problem exists in macOS 10.12.6 (16G29), Preview Version 9.0 (909.18)\r\nThe same rendering problem exists in iOS 11 beta 9"
