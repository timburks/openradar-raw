    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen backspacing over a pair of delimiters (such as (), {}, []), a single backspace is deleting _both_ of them. \r\n\r\nI usually expect when there's not a selection involved that a single backspace will remove a single character.  This is pretty hard-wired into my muscle memory.So when I want to do this scenario:\r\n\r\n(cursor is at the | )\r\n\r\nfunc stuff()| {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nI want to add a parameter to the function, so I backspace once, type my parameter stuff, and then a close paren.  I have a deep typing pipeline (100wpm ftw), so my hands have already been told \"_backspace_ blah thing: String) -> Bool\", but because Xcode deleted the open paren, I now have gibberish:\r\n\r\nfunc stuffblah thing: String) -> Bool {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nSo now I have to carefully acquire that place in the middle of `stuffblah` with the mouse or keyboard and fix it. By this time the automatic issues thing has plastered error messages everywhere, which courtesy of rdar://32718717 I can't hide, I get a headache due to chromatic aberration in my eyewear sending all the colors to random places along the Z-axis, dogs and cats living together, which makes me cranky and then I file radars :-)\r\n\r\nAttached is a gif showing the problem. In each case, just a single backspace happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)"
