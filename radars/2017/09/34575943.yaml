    description: "Summary:\r\nBackground: I live in Japan, I set up my devices' language (interface) to English ... While this is specific I guess it works for all other combinations.\r\n\r\nThe Music App/iTunes displays a lot of Japanese songs in \"Romaji\" (Latin version of the pronunciation) rather than keeping them in Japanese (Kana or Kanji).\r\nThis makes it very hard to:\r\n- Read the song name (there are no spaces in Japanese)\r\n- Search for a song (as the Japanese name doesn't return Romaji transcript and vice versa)\r\n- Have an organized library.\r\n- Use Siri to play a song (especially with the combination English Display + Japanese Siri)\r\n\r\nTHIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR MOVIES.\r\nWhich is annoying as Switching the interface to Japanese (or any other language) gets a localized name that can be completely different from the english/original version.\r\n\r\nI don't know how you can handle that, but one idea is to do like with units (temperature, currency, etc), have the option in settings to \"Display Original Names\" or \"Display Localized Names\".\r\nAs this is problematic not only for Japanese, but all non latin scripts (Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Korean, etc)"
