    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m seeing this probably once a day but can’t reproduce it now. The project uses CocoaPods. After changing the branch and running `pod install` (which changes contents of Pods.xcodeproj which is one of two projects in the workspace), Xcode gets stuck in the Indexing phase. It doesn’t ever leave indexing (I left it for 20 minutes once).\r\n\r\nWhen you then try to quit Xcode, it beachballs. Only force quit helps for that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can reproduce it only occasionally when switching between branches and causing changes in Pods.xcodeproj by running `pod install`:\r\n\r\n1. Cause a change in xcodeproj, possibly while Xcode is building.\r\n2. Xcode moves to Indexing phase. Loading indicator is visible on the left side but the blue progress bar isn’t visible.\r\n3. Start a build.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project should build, even though the indexing phase started.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert shows saying: Build operations are disabled: ‘Pods.xcodeproj’ has changed and is reloading.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to quit Xcode it hangs and the beachball appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
