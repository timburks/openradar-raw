    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached program makes a call to host_statistics when you press the button:\r\n\r\n  host_statistics(mach_host_self(), HOST_VM_INFO64, (host_info_t)&vmstat, &count)\r\n\r\nThe HOST_VM_INFO64 flavor is used to get detailed memory statistics about free/cached memory levels on the device, e.g. number of file backed pages, number of free pages, and number of purgeable pages in the system.\r\n\r\nPrior to iOS 11, this syscall always returned extremely quickly (< 1 ms) which is expected since it seems to just copy out some integers from kernel to user space. However, in iOS 11, sometimes the call takes almost exactly 1 second, indicating some sort of 1 second timeout in the kernel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached app. Tap the button some number of times (tapping the button quick succession usually will start resulting in the 1 second hang). Notice that the syscall takes 1 second to complete.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe syscall should complete almost instantaneously, as it did before iOS 11.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe syscall sometimes takes 1 second to complete.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10.3.3 (no hang) => iOS 11.0 (hang)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S"
