    description: "Summary:\r\nThe OS Logging documentation site (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging) omits much of the logging documentation in the default Swift “mode” when compared to viewing Objective-C.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging?language=objc, and note the length of the documentation page rendered. Now change the language to Swift, and note that most of the page content is not shown, and the length of this page is much shorter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content for both languages would be the same, differing only in the actual code sections of the documentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift language mode for this page is missing much of the usability information present in the Objective-C version.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt’s not clear to me if this is related, but the “Customizing logging behavior while debugging” link also does not seem to actually find the subheading and instead loads the page again from the top): https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging#1682426?language=objc"
