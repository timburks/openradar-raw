    description: "Summary:\r\napplicationIconBadgeNumber does not seems to do anything with negative values, and the observed behavior is the same as setting it to zero. So shouldn't it be defined as `NSUInteger` instead of `NSInteger` to express this behavior?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet applicationIconBadgeNumber to a negative value\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf applicationIconBadgeNumber was defined as NSUInteger, we'd get a compiler warning us that the assigned value made no sense\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value is accepted without any warning, masking a potential programming error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
