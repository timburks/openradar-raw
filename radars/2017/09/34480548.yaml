    description: "Summary:\r\nFix All in Scope doesn’t seem to ever work in Xcode 9. It worked fine in Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSimplest steps to reproduce I could find:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new playground.\r\n2. Type:\r\n  let a = 1\r\n  let b = aa + 1\r\n3. Wait for the compiler to catch up and show “Use of unresolved identifier ‘aa’” hint.\r\n4. Go to Editor menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFix All in Scope is not greyed out. When you click it, the fix-it gets applied – ‘aa’ is renamed to ‘a’.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFix All in Scope is greyed out. You have to use the mouse, to apply the fix-it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
