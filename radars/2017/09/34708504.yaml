    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have  a UITextField that we size-to-fit directly after we have set the .text property, by triggering a layout pass directly (layoutIfNeeded) on the parent view.  On iOS10 and before, the full text would scroll into view always. Since iOS11, the textfield doesn't seem to update its internal scroll position anymore, so some text stays hidden, even if there's enough space for it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a UITextField and call .text = \"blaaaaa\" on it\n2. Trigger a direct layout pass (layoutIfNeeded) on its parent view and size-to-fit the UITextField\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- full text would be visible in the UITextField\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- beginning of the text is cut-off in the UITextField (related to the previous smaller size of the UITextField), because it didn't update its scroll position in its inner scrollview.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression from iOS10: this worked fine on iOS10."
