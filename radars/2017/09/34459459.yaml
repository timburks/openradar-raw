    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8, cmd+clicking on the name of an identifier (e.g. classname) inside a comment or #pragma mark would jump to the declaration of the identifier (e.g. the @interface). This no longer works in Xcode 9. \n\nThis functionality in Xcode 8 was really handy when one segmented code into different \"#pragma mark\" sections based on superclasses. Unfortunately, this no longer works in Xcode 9.\n\nRightclicking on the identifier name and  using \"Jump to definition\" also does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a pragma \"#pragma mark - UIView\" or a comment \"// this references UIView in some way\"\n2. cmd+click on \"UIView\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Jumps to the definition of UIView\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Nothing happens :-(\n2. Sadness\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 8: it worked perfectly well in Xcode 8"
