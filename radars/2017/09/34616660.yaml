    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen engaging the Mono Audio Accessibility setting in iOS, the Left and Right audio channels are summed, but not divided by 2. This can clip the output of the iOS device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a mono audio file with a full-scale sine wave output.\r\n2. Play that file on iOS with volume at max -- observe that output is clean.\r\n3. Turn on Mono Audio.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo change in output -- output should be (L+R)/2, which means no change for a mono source. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOutput clips. It seems that output increases in level by 6dB because it is not being divided by 2.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A372)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWell, this is embarrassing -- this bug was present for years, but I just went to verify and submit photographs of the issue with a scope, and it appears to have been fixed in iOS 11! \U0001F44F\U0001F44F\U0001F44F"
