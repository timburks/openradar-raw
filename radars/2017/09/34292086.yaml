    description: "In order to properly test IAP (especially subscriptions) prior to releasing an app on the App Store, the experience of purchasing an IAP in the TestFlight sandbox should match the experience of purchasing that IAP once the app is live on the App Store. Specific issues:\r\n\r\n1. On iOS 11 the new IAP purchase sheet is not used in the sandbox\r\n2. On iOS 10 TouchID doens't work for IAP purchases even if it's enabled for the App Store\r\n3. The user is prompted for their password multiple times\r\n\r\nThese issues are confusing to explain to beta testers and dissuade them from fully testing the app and using the beta version of the app once the app is released on the App Store."
