    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Pixel Height and Pixel Width fields in Preview.app’s More Info panel should be swapped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an image in Preview.\n2. Type Command-I to open the Info panel.\n3. Click the second tab, the one with the “i” in a circle.\n4. Choose the General sub-tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe width and height are shown as width first, then height, to match the common way to referring to them (in English, at least - not sure if there are locale concerns here).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe height is displayed before the width, which is confusing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screenshot also posted at https://cl.ly/mP1R"
