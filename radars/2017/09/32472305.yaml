    description: "Summary:\r\nTesting VoiceOver on iOS can be difficult, especially to developers that are new to iOS. Ensuring and testing that all accessible elements are being updated properly with correct and meaningful accessibility labels, values, hints, etc takes a lot of tedious work, often requiring stepping through to listen to each and every element in every state to check that it's being set correctly. This likely causes developers to miss details they'd otherwise notice. Besides making developing cumbersome, not having a caption panel induces the wrath of nearby co-workers that are sick of hearing Voice Over announce everything at 95% speed which threatens the wellbeing of the developer. Additionally because the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone port testing VO on that device while connected to the debugger requires testing over the device's speakers (unless one has Bluetooth headphonesâ€”disconnecting mine from my mac to reconnect them to my iPhone is tragically difficult).\r\n\r\nPlease help developers like me working on accessibility features avoid the scorn of co-workers and the confused look of cafe onlookers by bringing this feature standard to iOS for developers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS has a feature like \"VoiceOver caption panel\" to aid developers in creating and testing accessible apps.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is no \"VoiceOver caption panel\" and people hate me.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3"
