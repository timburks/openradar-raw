    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery morning when I plug in my mac to:\r\n- One screen using a 3rd party (because Apple doesn't sell one) DisplayPort to USB-C cable.\r\n- Another screen using Apple's USB-C to HDMI adaptor and an HDMI cable (also plugged into the power using Apple's USB-C charger connected to this adaptor) #donglelife\r\n\r\nI can seem to wake up the mac by moving the mouse and typing keys on the keyboard (all Apple, new Magicâ„¢ hardware) because an iPhone that is connected via USB to one of the monitors starts charging when I do so. However, no signal is output to the monitors.\r\nIf I open the lid of the laptop, both the laptop screen and the touchbar remain black. I usually wait >20 minutes until I get fed up that my $2000 laptop is not working and choose to force reboot it by holding the touch ID button.\r\nAfterwards I get a screen asking me if I have forgotten my password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Spend $2000 on a brand new computer\r\n- Try to use it\r\n- Wait for 20 minutes\r\n- Laptop doesn't wake up / won't output any video signal to external monitors or its own screen\r\n- Force reboot\r\n- Complain on Twitter\r\n- File a snarky radar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The Mac wakes up in a reasonable amount of time and starts working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- I have to force-reboot it and waste 20-30 minutes every morning.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)"
