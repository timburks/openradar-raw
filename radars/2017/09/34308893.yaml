    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: Zindex and ZPosition are not honoured in CollectionView headers\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up a collectionView with a header and cells. Set the zPosition or zIndex of the header to position it below the level of the cells. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHeader is positioned below the level of the cells\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHeader is positioned above the level of the cells, as if the zIndex or zPosition had not been changed\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nAdd a small delay before setting the zPosition (0.35s seems to work)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThis only occurs on iOS11 and only if building with XCode 9\r\nTested on XCode 9 beta 5 and XCode 9 beta 6. \r\nSimulator (SE and 6 tested) and Device (SE / ios11 beta)."
