    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider a view controller A that presents a view controller B, using a custom UIPresentationController.\n\nNext, B presents a view controller C, using a `modalPresentationStyle` other than `.currentContext` and `.overCurrentContext`, so that the C’s presentation controls B’s view.\n\nNext, C is dismissed, so B becomes the topmost view controller again.\n\nB’s frame isn’t automatically recalculated as per its own presentation controller, however\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate a view controller A\n2. Present a view controller B from A, using a custom presentation controller that modifies B’s frame\n3. Present a view controller C from B\n4. Dismiss C\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nB’s view’s frame is recalculated as per its own presentation controller, returning to the same state as before presenting C\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nB’s view’s frame remains the same as set by C’s presentation. It needs to be manually set to `frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView` in `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews()`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 10\r\n\r\nNotes:"
