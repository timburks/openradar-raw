    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I enable network debugging, Xcode basically beachballs all the time. It takes me a few minutes to make it dispatch enough clicks so I can disable network debugging again. It’s crazy how slow this is, and I own the top of the line 2017 MacBook Pro 15’ TouchBar - literally costing 5000 Euros. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen complex project\nEnable network debugging\nObserve that Xcode slows to a crawl\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should work normally (so, beachballing < 2 seconds is acceptable and I’m used to it)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy devices are all within 1 meter and WiFi is stable. Jet it seems that Xcode has connection troubles and thus triggers a device refresh. This takes around 5 seconds of pure main thread freezing time and is the same that I reported at WWDC: rdar://32626309\n\nAnd by the time it’s updated, KVO triggered already another refresh, freezing it again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 9A235\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis feature is completely unusable. What’s Xcode really doing when it calls -[IDEScheme availableRunDestinations]? Why is that taking so long? Why is that refreshed so often? I did a Activity Monitor sample."
