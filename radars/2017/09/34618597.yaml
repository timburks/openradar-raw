    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen booting into a NetInstall of macOS 10.13 GM Candidate (build 17A362a), the machine halts/hangs at a grey screen with a mouse in the upper right corner. The NetInstall process does not continue on.\r\nThe NetInstall is an 'Automatic Installation' to a specified target drive (Macintosh HD).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch System Image Utility on a macOS 10.13 GM (Build 17A362a) machine that has the Install macOS High Sierra Beta app (build 17A362a) downloaded to /Applications\r\n2. Select Install macOS High Sierra Beta app (build 17A362a) as source.\r\n3. Select NetInstall Image as the Network Disk Image Type.\r\n4. Agree to ToC.\r\n5. Proceed through each step, leaving the defaults as they are, until the Automation Settings screen is presented. At this screen, make sure Automatically install to:   is selected and that Erase target volume before installing is also selected.\r\nUse 'Macintosh HD' as the  . Leave the System (Default) Language as English.\r\n6. Accept the remaining suggested value in all remaining steps as default.\r\n7. Publish the created NBI using NetBoot services in macOS Server 5.4 beta 5 (Build 17S1180a).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Mac device should boot up using the selected NBI image, and then once NetBoot processes have completed, an automated installation of macOS should start and complete.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac device boots up off the selected NBI, but halts/hangs at a grey screen with a mouse cursor in the upper left corner. Attached photo demonstrates this issue.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13 GM Candidate (build 17A362a), and macOS Server 5.4 beta 5 (Build 17S1180a).\r\n*Note - this is still present in macOS 10.13 (build 17A365) and macOS Server 5.4 (build 17S1207)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Server is configured to only serve NetBoot images via HTTP. It does not store client data.\r\nThe NBI location is /Library/NetBoot/NetBootSP0.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible to collect a macOS sysdiagnose on the machine booting up from the NetInstall image.\r\n\r\nThe device in question is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) which has been used to test macOS High Sierra from Beta 3 onwards (updated using the software updates presented through the Mac App Store)."
