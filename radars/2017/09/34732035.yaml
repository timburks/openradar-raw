    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now if you want to deactivate a constraint in interface builder (and then activate it later in code) you have to use a custom IBInspectable that trampolines the setting through to the actual value. It would be great if this was natively exposed to users in Interface Builder\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to set isActive on a NSLayoutConstraint in a storyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a dropdown to set this value\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to set this value without defining a custom IBInspectable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 9A235\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's an example of a working inspectable for this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic extension NSLayoutConstraint {\r\n    @IBInspectable public var isActivated: Bool {\r\n        get { return self.isActive }\r\n        set { self.isActive = newValue }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```"
