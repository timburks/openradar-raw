    description: "Area:\r\nNews\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen viewing an article in the News app, if a hyperlink or \"read full article\" link references another article that is in Apple News, it should open up the full article view instead of opening up the embedded (and surprisingly not Safari View Controller) web view. Curiously, Safari already knows how to resolve an Apple News article from a URL, as demonstrated in the attached screen recording.\r\n\r\nâ€”\r\n\r\nAttached: http://jmp.sh/23nqrTR"
