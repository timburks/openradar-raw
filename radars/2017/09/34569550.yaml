    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease see the attached. I am seeing this weird issue after Xcode is crashing on a certain UIKit exception which I am debugging now. Sometimes it happens that after I press stop button, Xcode starts to build the app again, even though it must be in a \"stopped\" state at this point.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLooks like it is easier to reproduce this issue when the app is in a \"pre-crash\" state with exception handler and then you stop it. Then it starts building itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should not happen. Stopped state is a stopped state!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app building itself for a while Xcode being in a stopped state.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
