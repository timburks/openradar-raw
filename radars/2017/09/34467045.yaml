    description: "Summary: When using MapKit in any capacity in any iOS 11 simulator provided by Xcode 9, such as opening the Maps app or using MKMapView inside an app, the simulator becomes unusably slow.\r\nCPU usage spikes to 100% while the map view is visible, and there's a delay of 10-20 seconds before a taps is recognized. (Interestingly, certain animations like the blue location spot pulsing still animate at regular speed)\r\nProfiling with Instruments shows that OpenGL rendering is making up the bulk of CPU usage.\r\niOS 10 Simulators show acceptable performance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch any iOS 11 simulator and open the Maps app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsable performance (at least 30fps)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelay of 10-20 seconds before a tap is recognized.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13 GM, Xcode 9 GM, iOS iPhone X simulator, iOS iPhone 6 11.0 simulator\r\nmacOS 10.12.6, Xcode 9 GM, iOS iPhone X simulator, iOS iPhone 6 11.0 simulator\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\r\n2.5 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Pro 1536 MB"
