    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using `presentController(withNames:contexts:)` to present multiple pages modally in a watch app, there's a black row between the view and the title, making the usable area of the watch screen reduced. There is no way to put any content in that black row. See screenshot `screenshot_watchos4.png`.\r\n\r\nThis did not happen with watchOS 3 (see screenshot `screenshot_watchos3.png`). Also, if you present just 1 view using `presentController(withName:context:)` in watchOS 4 it works correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've attached two sample projects: `WatchX_3.zip` is a watchOS 3 app, please run in Xcode 8. `WatchX_4.zip` is a watchOS 4 app, please run in Xcode 9. Interesting, running the `WatchX_3.zip` project in Xcode 9 gives you the same bug since it's building against the watchOS 4 SDK.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe presented views should go up to the title, and not have a black bar above it. Just like it worked in watchOS 3.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere's a bar, and so views that should fit on the screen no longer do. Also, when scrolling up, they go under that black bar, instead of going under the title.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9 GM - Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\nwatchOS 4 GM - (4.0 15R372)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached files: https://www.cerebralgardens.com/radarfiles/34508128/"
