    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA UINavigationController with large titles won't collapse on scrolling the underlying scroll view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHere's a sample project: https://github.com/tzahola/iOS-11-Large-Title-Navigation-Bar\r\nLaunch the application and scroll up/down on the first page. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation bar will be displayed with large title, and it won't collapse on scroll. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe navigation bar will stay the same large size regardless of scrolling the underlying table view. \r\n\r\nIf you tap on the first row, it'll push a second view controller on the navigation stack, which uses regular-sized navigation bar (i.e. \"Large Title\" is set to \"Never\"). Now, if you navigate back from this second page, you can observe that the navigation bar on the first page will properly collapse/expand on scrolling up/down - so pushing a second view controller on the stack and navigating back seemingly fixes the issue. \r\nUnsurprisingly however, the bug will occur again if you terminate the app and cold-launch it. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 (15A372)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNo special configuration required."
