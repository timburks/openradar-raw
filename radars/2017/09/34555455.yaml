    description: I love my kids so I will occasionally let them play songs of their choosing in the car or on the Apple TV through Apple Music. The catch is their musical tastes do not overlap with the hip dad cred that I've been accumulating over the last 10ish years. Basically I need a way to hide all the Taylor Swift, Katie Perry, and Carly Rae Jepsen from all the judgement that is raining down on me now.
