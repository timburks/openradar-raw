    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe're using the `inputAccessoryView` as part of our `UIViewController`, but the placement of it by UIKit puts it within the restricted area of the bottom of an iPhone X. I've included a sample project that reflects what happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use an iPhone X.\r\n2. Create a UIViewController subclass with a `inputAccessoryView`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `inputAccessoryView` should not overlay the new restricted area at the bottom of the iPhone X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `inputAccessoryView` is flush with the bottom of the iPhone X.\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niPhone X simulator running iOS 11 from Xcode 9"
