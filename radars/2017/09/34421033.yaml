    description: "Summary:\r\nApple teased the AirPower charger coming next year, and mentioned that it will work with iPhone 8, iPhone X, Apple Watch, and AirPods 2, but what about Apple Pencil? \r\n\r\nThe current Apple Pencil plugs into the iPad to charge, but it would be really nice to allow Pencil to take advantage of this too. Some have suggested that the pencil would roll off of the mat, but a gentle trough would be a nice solution."
