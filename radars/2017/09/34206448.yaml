    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are an MDM Vendor and we just implemented support for new SetFirmwarePassword options added to 10.13.\n\nAs the option requires a reboot to be effective (or even to be called a second time), it would be nice if we could restart the device remotely too - like we can do with iOS and tvOS devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSupport restartDevice command.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnot supported on macOS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13\r\n\r\nNotes:"
