    description: "Summary:\r\nSince there's no Bug Reporter app for iOS, many take to pinning the website to their homescreen. This experience could be improved if Bug Reporter declared itself as mobile web app capable (see https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008193-SW3), so that the Safari chrome would be hidden instead of taking up a bunch of space on the screen."
