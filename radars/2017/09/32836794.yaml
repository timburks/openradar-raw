    description: "Area:\r\nHomeKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently there is no public method to find the size of a camera stream from HMCameraStream or HMCameraProfile.\r\n\r\nThis would be good to have to enable apps to show HMCameraView in the correct aspect ratio vs just guessing that most cameras will be 16:9.\r\n\r\nIf there is a method, the documentation on Homekit is lacking and so is auto complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to find aspect ratio or video feed image size, see no public method to do so.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind a method to give aspect ratio or size\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo method for this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS10/11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
