    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8, building & running on the simulator almost instantly launched the app on the simulator. No longer in Xcode 9: the simulator seems to simulate the actual installation of the app as it would normally happen on the device. While it is more of a true simulation, this is slowing development down when doing quick change/build/runs: one now has to wait for the installation to finish (a couple of seconds) every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a change to the code of an app\n2. Build\n3. Run on simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp launches almost instantly on simulator as it did in Xcode 8\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstallation animation on the app icon taking a few seconds EVERY TIME.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis worked fine in Xcode 8"
