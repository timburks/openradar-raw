    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you would present UIImagePickerController with sourceType == .camera on device where In-Call Status Bar is turned on then presented view would have 20 pt offset (but status bar is hidden). Because of this there would be part of UIWindow on the top (20 pt of it).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set In-Call Status Bar to be turned in (start navigation route, phone call, microphone recording or anything else, that would show this bar)\r\n2. Open application and show UIImagePickerController:\r\n```swift\r\nlet imagePickerController = UIImagePickerController()\r\nimagePickerController.sourceType = .camera\r\nself.present(imagePickerController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\nP.S. You can test only on device, because of camera requirement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause status bar is hidden, the should not be any top offset. So origin.y should be equal to 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou would see 20 pt offset on the top (screenshots attached). And from 0 to 20 pt of top there would be UIWindow background color.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 8.3.3 (also reproduced on Xcode 9 beta 6)\r\niOS 10.3.3 (also reproduced on iOS 11 beta 8)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\nScreenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qrwQX\r\nProject: https://github.com/azimin/UIImagePickerRadar-34253549"
