    description: "Area:\r\nAV Playback\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe play/pause button on the Apple TV remote stops working after playing a video with an AVPlayerViewController on Apple TV 4th generation.\r\n\r\nThis problem only appears on the physical device and not the simulator. \r\nAnd the problem occurs if an audio file is played before or after presenting the video in an AVPlayerViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a Xcode project with a single viewController and storyboard. \r\n\r\nIn the view controller I create two buttons, one for playing the audio file and the other to play a video file.\r\n\r\nI create a UITapGestureRecognizer with the allowedPressTypes = UIPressType.playPause\r\n \r\nWhenever the play/pause button is pressed on the remote the view changes back ground color as visual indicator that it worked. The play/pause button also pauses and resumes the audio.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe play/pause button should remain functional even after the video is played. The screen should always change color and the audio should pause or resume\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf the audio is played before or after the video is played, the play/pause button stops working. The UITapGestureRecognizer does not call its targeted function any more.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n tvOS 10 and 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nApple TV 4th generation"
