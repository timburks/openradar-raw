    description: "Summary:\r\nFolders on a SMB share point created by Windows Server File and Storage Services, will not allow themselves to be renamed or moved. When attempting a rename, macOS will ask for an administrative password, and then display the following error “You don’t have permission to rename the item “External Disks”. This occurred for use with Microsoft Server 2012r2, but have collaborated with other enterprises and it has be verified with multiple versions of Microsoft Windows Server and other non-Apple SMB implementations.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHere is a blog post and video that shows the steps to reproduce the issue step-by-step:\n\nhttps://apple.lib.utah.edu/mac-bug-connecting-to-non-apple-smb-shares/\n\nDescription of steps in the video.\n\n1. Create folder A\n2. Create folder b\n3. Create folder C\n4. Save document into folder C, named test.rtf. Quit TextEdit.\n5. Attempt to rename b, request for admin access.\n6. Attempt to rename C, success\n7. Attempt to rename A, request for admin access.\n8. (After video ends) Delete entire folder structure without error.\n\nI have also seen error -36 when trying to rename C. But it’s rare.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect macOS client to allow user connected to SMB file share to be able to rename & move folders without issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBut, with multiple macOS versions up-to macOS 10.12.6 user will get errors and/or prompts for administrative permissions which doesn’t solve issue if they do have administrative permissions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOpened a problem ticket with Microsoft Enterprise support case number: 115110913354757. And AppleCare Enterprise case number: 838648"
