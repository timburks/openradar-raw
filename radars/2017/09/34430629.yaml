    description: "As per this website... https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html ... and Wiki and various other references for the ISO8601 date format...\r\n\r\n\"It is also possible to add fractions of a second after a decimal dot or comma, for instance the time 5.8 ms before midnight can be written as 23:59:59.9942 or 235959.9942\"\r\n\r\nThe actual standard is that a fraction can be added to the smallest of the time component included in the format. So three and a half minutes past 1 pm can be indicated with a time format of `13:03.5` (using a comma or full stop for the decimal point).\r\n\r\nThe ISO8601DateFormatter added in iOS10 does not include an option to customise the decimal part of the format and so for many commonly used web formats... `yyyyMMddTHH:mm:ss.SSSSZ` cannot be converted into a Date using the ISO8601DateFormatter and instead returns `nil`.\r\n\r\nIn order to conform to the ISO8601 standard this should be added.\r\n\r\nThe standard says that the number of decimals is not set as part of the standard and should be agreed between the writers and consumers of the API.\r\n\r\nSo, not only should the fraction of the smallest time component be part of the `ISO8601DateFormatter.Options` (with a name something like `withFractionalTime`) but it should also allow for the configuration of the number of decimal places required.\r\n\r\nThanks"
