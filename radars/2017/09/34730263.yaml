    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UITabBarController contains a UINavigationController set to show its bottom bar, the iPhone X simulator in versions 11 and 11.1 beta (9B37) shows a gap between the tab bar and the tool bar. \r\n\r\nThe gap appears to be the height of the home area. The tab bar appears to be correctly adjusting its content up by that amount, but the navigation controller’s tool bar is unnecessarily adjusting up by that same amount.\r\n\r\nThe gap is also visible in Interface Builder if you check “Shows Toolbar” instead of showing the toolbar via code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UINavigationController and set isToolbarHidden to NO (or check “Shows Toolbar” in Interface Builder. Set it as one of the view controllers of a UITabBarController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe toolbar should sit immediately above the tab bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the iPhone X simulator, a large gap between the two bars.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1 (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
