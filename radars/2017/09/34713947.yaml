    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an app that has the ability to play audio from AVAudioSession and Safari Tab. Since upgrading to iOS 11, audio no longer continues to play when the app is backgrounded. Control center shows the audio as playing, but does not produce any audible sound.\r\n\r\nUpdate: iOS 11.0.1 has fixed the bug with audio not continuing to play in the background for AVAudioSession, but audio played from SFSafariViewController still does not continue playing when the app is backgrounded.\r\n\r\nHere are some hyperlinks with audio content for reference.\r\nhttp://radiomaria.us/listen-to-the-radio/\r\nhttp://ice7.securenetsystems.net/WVHF\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Safari view controller to a webpage with audio content\r\n2. Play audio\r\n3. Background the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected audio to continue playing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince iOS 11 (and even after iOS 11.0.1), audio does not play in background. Control center shows the audio as playing, but does not produce any audible sound. Tapping on audio controls within Control Center does nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame exact code in iOS 9 and 10 works as we would expect.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
