    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's not possible to uninstall the app or it's preferences between test scenarios\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to do this as some tests within the suite may require a clean install.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do this currently is to set a launch argument and handle that code but an XCTest provided way to ensure no preferences are set would be best and also launch arguments can't be used for undocumented system preferences e.g. location permissions which would be resolved if the app was uninstalled.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of the suggestion \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
