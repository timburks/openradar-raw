    description: "When run non-interactively '/usr/bin/log stream' appears to buffer its output in 4kB chunks. When run interactively, it appears not to.\r\n\r\nIt would be hugely helpful if it supported a configurable buffer size via a --buffer flag, and/or a configurable timeout after which to flush logs if no new input is received.\r\n\r\nIn particular this would help for uses where /usr/bin/log is used non-interactively (e.g. in a pipeline) with a fairly tight `--predicate` expression, or with relatively low volume/frequency log output."
