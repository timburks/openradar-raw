    description: "PHPhotoLibrary instance is not available on macOS, so there is no ability to access and modify user's Photo Libraries on macOS.\r\nSince Photos.framework is present on macOS, this would be really good feature to request user's permissions to access and modify the photos library (like on iOS).\r\nAnother issue is that for now (14.09.2017) the documentation is common for all platforms (iOS/tvOS/macOS), but for macOS some symbols are private:\r\n-sharedLibrary\r\n-performChanges:completionHandler:\r\n..and so on.\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phphotolibrary\r\nThanks in advance."
