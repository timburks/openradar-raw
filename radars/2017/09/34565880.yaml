    description: "Duplicate of rdar://31928212\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe App bar below the text entry field (see Screenshot 1) appears even when no apps are favorited (see Screenshot 2). It only happens after selecting a conversation from the list of conversations; selecting the text entry field or one of the other buttons causes the bar to disappear.\r\n\r\nWhile this might be intentional, it would be smarter to hide the bar if no Apps are favorited. In any case, it seems superfluous to have two App Store icons right next to each other by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages.app and go to the top-most level of navigation (conversation list).\r\n2. Select a conversation.\r\n3. See App Bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp Bar is hidden unless Apps are favorited.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp Bar is visible and displays a second App Store icon.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A372)"
