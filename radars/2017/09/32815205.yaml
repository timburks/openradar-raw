    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a split view based app on iPhone, when pushing a detail view controller using [self showDetailViewController:sender:], the detail view controller won't show its navigationItem.searchController search bar.\r\n\r\nInstead the insets will be a bit wrong and any scroll view content will jump up behind the bar when you try to reveal the search bar.\r\n\r\nIf you use showViewController:sender: instead, the large navigation bar and the search field will show up correctly. However, this is not always the correct thing to do it split view based apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a split view controller based app and run it on iPhone (I tested on iPhone SE simulator).\r\n\r\n2. Make a master navigation controller whose navigation bar prefersLargeTitles = YES.\r\n\r\n3. Use showDetailViewController:sender: to push a UITableViewController which has its navigationItem.searchController set to a UISearchController\r\n\r\n4. Try to reveal search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search bar should show up below the large title\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe search bar doesn't seem to exist, and content insets get bugged and the content end up behind the navigation bar. Oddly enough, on landscape-capable devices in landscape mode, the search bar appears and behaves normally.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta (all builds)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Use showViewController:sender: instead of showDetailViewController:sender:. This however will break the intended behaviour of a split view based app."
