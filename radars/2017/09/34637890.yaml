    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe're getting crash reports of a crash inside StoreKit that we are unable to reproduce locally. The crash is only happening to users of iOS 11, it appears to happen across a wide range of devices. I think it may be caused by cancelling an inflight SKProductsRequest, but I have not been able to verify that.\r\n\r\nThis forum post is experiencing the same issue: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/262097#262097\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed is in all of the crashes I've examined, the bad address that triggers the crash ends in `beb8`.\r\n\r\nI have tried cancelling the inflight SKProductsRequest we make in our app, and it has not reproduced the crash. In particular, I have ensured that all SKRequests in our app have their delegates nilled and are cancelled when their owner is deallocated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEXC_BAD_ACCESS KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS 0x000000006fcebeb8\r\nCrashed: com.apple.StoreServices.SSRequest.0x1c42c86c0\r\n\r\n0  libobjc.A.dylib                0x185c34430 objc_msgSend + 16\r\n1  StoreServices                  0x1914131b4 -[SSRequest _shutdownRequestWithMessageID:] + 228\r\n2  libdispatch.dylib              0x186091088 _dispatch_call_block_and_release + 24\r\n3  libdispatch.dylib              0x186091048 _dispatch_client_callout + 16\r\n4  libdispatch.dylib              0x18609ae48 _dispatch_queue_serial_drain$VARIANT$mp + 528\r\n5  libdispatch.dylib              0x18609b7d8 _dispatch_queue_invoke$VARIANT$mp + 340\r\n6  libdispatch.dylib              0x18609c200 _dispatch_root_queue_drain_deferred_wlh$VARIANT$mp + 400\r\n7  libdispatch.dylib              0x1860a44a0 _dispatch_workloop_worker_thread$VARIANT$mp + 644\r\n8  libsystem_pthread.dylib        0x186336fe0 _pthread_wqthread + 932\r\n9  libsystem_pthread.dylib        0x186336c30 start_wqthread + 4"
