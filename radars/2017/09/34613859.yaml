    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHi!  It's the corner-case fairly come to pay you a visit today :-)\r\n\r\nToday I discovered I can't drag-select the last character of a soft-wrapped line. See attached screen shot and gif file.\r\n\r\nFor the lines that are soft-wrapped twice and end with the text going all the way across (such as lines 181.2, 185.2) I cannot drag-select the last character (the gif file shows that).\r\n\r\nLines that are soft-wrapped once (such as the comma on line 184.1) does let me drag-select.\r\n\r\nI can also extend the selection into the 'unselectable' characters by shift-arrow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a line of code that soft-wraps three times.\r\nHave this line of code be the second line with text that runs all the way to the edge of the editor.\r\nHave the moon in Waxing Crescent soon after the autumnal equinox\r\ndrag-select the code to the right, dragging outside of the editor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ntext is selected til the end of the line\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ntext is selected, save for the last character\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
