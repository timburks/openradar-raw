    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the new navigationItem.searchController feature in combination with a table view, there's no way to scroll away the search bar if it was previously visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an run the attached sample project. \nScroll down to reveal the search bar.\nThen tap \"Scroll Search Away\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search bar should be scrolled away. The called -scrollSearchAway: method sets the table view's contentOffset to (0, -64).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe table view cells are positioned at the correct content offset. However, the search bar still overlays the first row.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nsetting the content offset should also affect the position of the search bar."
