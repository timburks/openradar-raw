    description: "Summary:\r\nWriting a comment at the end of the last line of active code in a file in Xcode will eventually cause the editor to hang, with the beachball cursor. Generally this causes you to need to force quit Xcode, or you can (slowly) delete back over the comment and Xcode will get faster with each deleted character. This occurs in both files in projects, as well as in playgrounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new playground\r\n2. Start adding a comment to the last line (in new playgrounds this would be this line: var str = \"Hello, playground\")\r\n3. Notice the editor getting hung up eventually as you type. On faster Macs you can go longer than on slower Macs, but every Mac will get hung up on this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe editor to let you add a comment as usual.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe editor begins to get hung as you type further characters in the comment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 9.0/9M189t\r\nmacOS: 10.12.6/16G29\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe first noticed this in a project, but tested it in a playground as well. Since it appears in playgrounds we offer that as the steps to reproduce since that is simpler. The playground we used to test this is attached to this bug report.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWe tested this on both a slower 2011 iMac as well as a faster 2013 iMac."
