    description: "I have tested it both with Spotify and iTunes. When I browse Twitter from Tweetbot and I click on video or .gif, after videoplay is finished when I close that modal window music is not played longer. \r\n\r\nThis only happens on audio output over bluetooth, I have Bose QC35 connected. Might be also connected with issue that Mac OS can connect to them, output sound on them but doesn't show them in audio output sources, even if music is playing on them at the moment. Simply, they are not listed in output devices nor any device is selected."
