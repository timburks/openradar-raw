    description: "Summary:\r\nIt appears that Xcode 9 has changed the way indentation of Tab chars is calculated, leading to out-of-alignment formatting of lots of code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached text in both Xcode 9b3 and 8. Note that \"attrlist_t\" and \"fssearchblock_t\" are supposed to be vertically aligned. In Xcode 8 they are, in Xcode 9, they are not.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncorrect alignment\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nincorrect alignment\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached text for demonstration:\r\n\r\n// The identifiers (attrlist_t, fssearchblock_t) should be indented at the same position on screen, provided TAB width is set to 4 spaces,\r\n// and using a fixed-width font (e.g. Menlo 11).\r\n// That's happening in BBEdit as well as in Xcode 8 and every other common programming editor I did try.\r\n// However, Xcode 9b3 indents these incorrectly, shifting the fssearchblock_t to the left, requiring ANOTHER Tab char to align it with attrlist_t.\r\n// That's not good as it would mess up any such indentation suddenly for practically all existing code.\r\n\r\n;\t;\t;\t;\t;\t;\t;\t;\t;\r\ntypedef struct attrlist\t\t\tattrlist_t;\r\ntypedef struct fssearchblock\tfssearchblock_t;\r\n\r\n\r\nResolution from ADR:\r\n\r\nIssue the following Terminal cmd:\r\n\r\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode NSFontDefaultScreenFontSubstitutionEnabled NO"
