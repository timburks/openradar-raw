    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Safari is used for a while and multiple tabs open, suddenly macOS may freeze with the mouse cursor moving or not moving. Waiting will not help, the MacBook needs to be hard turned off and back on.\r\n\r\nThe attached sysdiagnose was generated directly after the reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen multiple tabs in Safari.\r\n(Have Parallels Desktop 12.2.1, build 41615 running with Windows 10.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormal behaviour.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSuddenly macOS may freeze. This happened to me three times in three consecutive days, but only in macOS High Sierra Developer Beta 2 (Update 1 only? I donâ€™t know).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 11.0 (13604.1.25.3.3)\r\nmacOS High Sierra Developer Beta 2 Update 1, 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMid-2014 MacBook Pro 15\""
