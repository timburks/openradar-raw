    description: "Summary:\r\nin Swift 3 the NSValueTranformer class has been renamed to ValueTransformer. Applying this name change caused the Value Transformer drop down in interface builder to exclude the class from the list. Leaving the superclass as NSValueTranformer keeps the class in the list; obviously, the code won't compile like this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the attached sample file in a Swift 3 macOS project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n'TransformerWithoutNS' Should be present in the list\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOnly 'TransformerWithNS' is present in the list\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\nXcode Version 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote, TransformerWithoutNS still works if it's written into the dropdown field manually."
