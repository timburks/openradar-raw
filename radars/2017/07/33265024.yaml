    description: "Summary:\r\nTo automate internal workflows, it would be great if the mailto: URL scheme also supported a \"from\" parameter to set the From address of the drafted email.\nThe parameter should only be accepted if the specified address is configured in Mail as one of the From addresses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA URL such as mailto:recipient@icloud.com?body=Hello&subject=My%20subject&from=myname%40icloud.com is opened.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail should display a draft email with the To-address and the From-address already pre-filled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently, a from parameter is not supported.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
