    description: Allowing auto-play without audio does not address the unwanted bandwidth and battery consumption. Plus, it is still incredibly annoying. Apple is doing the right thing on the Mac by allowing the user to disable auto-play altogether. I think this courtesy should be extended to users on iOS.
