    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI was editing a comment in some swift code, and as I typed, Xcode's responsiveness went away, almost like it was repeatedly processing the line with something exponential.\r\n\r\nAttached is the project in question, and a spindump and sample.  I'll be attaching a dropbox link in a subsequent comment.\r\n\r\nSeems to be related to editing comments.  Editing code around it is fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite Swift code\r\nStart an end of line comment with //\r\nKeep typing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEditor stays super-responsive and I can type in the comment\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nEditor gets.... Slow...er.... w.......i...........t.......h........ e.................. [SPOD]\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI use all-black as my code colorization because of chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDid not occur in Beta3.  I don't recall seeing this in other projects. all UIKit (This particular project is a friend's Cocoa command-line application)\r\nComments"
