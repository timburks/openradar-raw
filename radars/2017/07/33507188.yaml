    description: "There is currently no documented way to determine a file that's identified by its Catalog Node ID, especially if it's using a 64 bit value.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when using BSD level functions such as searchfs() or getattrlist() returning such CNIDs. In the case of searchfs(), that's the only information returned, meaning searchfs() is effectively unusable without this missing function.\r\n\r\n(See also DTS request #669480283 which confirms this issue)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch the macOS SDK docs for a function that resolves a CNID\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind at least one function, making everyone happy\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSad faces.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6, 10.13b3"
