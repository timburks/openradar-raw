    description: "I have vpn configured by OpenVPN which installs VPN profile system wide that is being toggled by VPN switch in settings or from app.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to connect from settings it times out, trying to connect from app works every single time.\r\n\r\nConnecting from app and disconnecting from settings over vpn toggle works as well."
