    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #29401440\n\nSummary:\n<AdSupport/ASIdentifierManager.h> doesn't specify nullability of +sharedManager or -advertisingIdentifier\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen ASIdentifierManager.h in Xcode\n\nExpected Results:\n+[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] should return `_Nonnull`. (I assume. There is no documentation that indicates what the nullability should actually be.)\n-[ASIdentifierManager advertisingIdentifier] should return `_Nullable` because of the following documentation:\n> In iOS 10.0 and later, the value of advertisingIdentifier is all zeroes when the user has limited ad tracking.\n> If the value is nil, wait and get the value again later. This happens, for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has unlocked the device.\n\nActual Results:\nNullability is unspecified.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.1 (8B62)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
