    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMy mouse keeps getting activated as I am typing and my cursor is jumping around the page. This causes issues since it changes where on a document my text is written, or what UI element is currently in focus.\r\n\r\nIt prevents me from typing effectively, since every day I need to fix my mouse position at least once. I tend to write without looking at the screen some of the time as I think (eyes closed or looking out into my yard).\r\n\r\nThe palm rejection is not working well enough, since it's not detecting that I'm typing and that I'm not trying to move the cursor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start typing on MacBook Pro 2016 Touchbar keyboard.\r\n2. Type 1000 words for an article\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The mouse cursor should not move when I'm typing\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. The mouse cursor moves, and that causes me to type text in the wrong place, or it highlights some other UI element, which is not the main typing area\r\n2. I have to constantly fix my cursor position, and fix the text, when I write without looking at my screen (sometimes I write with my eyes closed, so this is really frustrating)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 16F73\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's more work to type on this keyboard than previous keyboards because the cursor can move around. So text doesn't go where you'd expect it to go.\r\n\r\nThere should be some kind of control to increase the amount of palm rejection, or you need to make it better.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro 2016 TouchBar"
