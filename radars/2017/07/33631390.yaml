    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a while now I've been seeing an issue in the \"Recently Added\" section of iTunes. The album artwork and headings (like \"This Month\") flash whenever the view is updated. By \"flash\", I mean that the content disappears completely and then reappears immediately after. A single flash can happen when a song is updated (for example by clicking the \"love\" button\") or multiple flashes can happen if an album or playlist is downloaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- This is probably easiest if iTunes Match and/or Apple Music is enabled, since that allows you to remove something from your computer and download it again.\r\n- Make sure you have at least one album in your library. If the album is already downloaded to that computer, remove the downloads.\r\n- Select the \"Recently Added\" section\r\n- Click on the small album cover to reveal the large album cover and track listing.\r\n- Make sure one of the large, bold headings is in view, like \"Today\", \"This Week\", etc.\r\n- Click the download button for the album\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing should flash (disappear briefly) when the view is updated.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nEvery time the view is updated, the bold headings and large album covers flash briefly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.6.2.20 and macOS 10.12.6 (16G29). I've been noticing this problem for months so it definitely is not specific to either version.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching a video of the problem happening. The album was downloading while I captured this video.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm confident it's a bug in recent versions of iTunes and not specific to any particular macOS software or hardware configuration. I've had it happen on a 2014 iMac, 2017 iMac, 2016 MacBook Pro with TouchBar, and 2014 MacBook Pro."
