    description: "When making a UITableView, adding a UIContextualAction will not show the title and image unless the cell is at least 91 pixels tall, even if you specify a title and image, and both properties are non-nil.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMake a UITableView and set the UIContextualAction with an image and a title, in a row that is 90 pixels tall or smaller. You can see the attached project as well, where that is being done.\r\n\r\n--\r\nExpected results\r\n\r\nAn image and a title is shown.\r\n\r\n--\r\nObserved results\r\n\r\nOnly an image is shown."
