    description: "Summary:\r\nThe more characters I type after a comment on the same line as a case statement like this: // the more characters...\r\n\r\n...causes SourceKitService to spin up to 200% CPU and then typing slows, beach balls happen, and then Xcode hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have an enum like this:\r\nenum ImageShape: String {\r\n    static let name = \"shape\"\r\n\r\n    case tall = \"tall\"\r\n    case thumb = \"thumb\"\r\n    case square = \"square\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nI was trying to type: // Crop gravity: north, ratio: 1:2.25 at the end of the line for case tall.\r\n\r\nThe farther along I get in typing those characters, the slower input to Xcode is received until the application hangs. If I leave that line before the comment gets too long, I can continue to use the application fine. If I return and add more text to that comment, Xcode goes back to hanging immediately on the first keystroke.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAble to type comments anywhere in the code without hanging\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode hangs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9, beta 4, OS X 10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can reproduce this in a Playground without any other impacting code. Playground and video showing the experience attached."
