    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of a method shows up just fine in the quick help when option-clicking it. However as soon as you mark a method as deprecated either by adding the `DEPRECATED_ATTRIBUTE` or the ` __attribute__((deprecated(\"Foo”)))` attribute to it, quick help only shows ‘Symbol not found‘.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the attached sample project.\n1. Open AppDelegate.m\n2. option-click on `doSomething:`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe quick help shows the information provided in `ViewController.h`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQuick help shows ‘Symbol not found‘.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis can be fixed by simply commenting out ` __attribute__((deprecated(\"Foo”)))` in `ViewController.h`.\n\nAs a side note: Quick help in Xcode 9 seems to not work at all as of beta 2, so I assume this behavior is not fixed in Xcode 9 yet."
