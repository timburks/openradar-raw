    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSelecting multiple files in the UIDocumentPickerViewController does not work properly unless the folder is one that is initially shown when the picker is presented.\r\n\r\nIf you try and navigate into a folder and then tap Select and choose multiple files the `Open` button in the navigation bar no longer seems to work. Tapping the open button doesn't trigger the didPickDocumentsAt delegate method or dismiss the picker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Make sure you're logged into iCloud on the simulator or device.\r\n- Build and launch sample app (or create your own where you display a UIDocumentPickerViewController with allowsMultipleSelection set to true)\r\n- Navigate into a folder that is not initially shown in the UIDocumentPickerViewController\r\n- Tap `Select` in the nav bar and select a few files\r\n- Try and tap the `Open` button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `didPickDocumentsAt` delegate method receives a list of select URLs and the UIDocumentPickerViewController dismisses.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe `didPickDocumentsAt` delegate method does not get called and the UIDocumentPickerViewController does not dismiss.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you navigate into the folder then dismiss the UIDocumentPickerViewController, then the next time you open a UIDocumentPickerViewController it will be in that folder and selecting multiple files will work as expected."
