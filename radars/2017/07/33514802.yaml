    description: "Summary:\r\nRealm’s Objective-C/Swift tests run fine with Xcode 9 beta 4 in Swift 3 mode, but the Swift tests don’t run in Swift 4 mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Realm.xcodeproj in Xcode 9 beta 4 from the attached archive\n2. Select the “Realm” scheme\n3. Run unit tests (cmd-U)\n4. Observe that the unit tests from Swift sources do not run\n5. Perform a `git reset —hard` command to revert the `SWIFT_VERSION` configuration setting to 3.0\n6. Run unit tests again (cmd-U)\n7. Observe that the unit tests from Swift sources now run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor Swift unit test sources that compile and run in `SWIFT_VERSION=3.0` mode, they should also compile and run in `SWIFT_VERSION=4.0` mode, or in the case of a compilation error, should display that compilation error and abort the test process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanging the SWIFT_VERSION mode from 3.0 to 4.0 just skips the Swift sources, neither compiling them nor running their unit tests.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterestingly enough, Xcode’s test navigator pane does _detect_ the tests, but doesn’t compile them or run them.\n\nI’ve attached a video walking through the reproduction steps as well as an archive of the project."
