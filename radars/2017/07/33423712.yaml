    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS11, UITextField query it's `intrinsicContentSize` and call `layoutSubviews` inside the initializer.\r\nOn iOS10 and below, `intrinsicContentSize` and `layoutSubviews` are called only after the view is added to its superview.\r\n\r\nThis means that, when subclassing UITextField for adding custom UI elements, I need to trick the system with wrong values until the view is actually added to its superview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is a simple subclass of UITextField with char counter at the bottom.\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/dral3x/35c86d1c3645bae81de73487a1765239\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Playground should run correctly and the instance of SPKTextField should be visible.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe Playground crashes, because `intrinsicContentSize` and `layoutSubviews` are called too early (during the super.init call)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5318g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue happens also if the code is compiled with iOS10 SDK"
