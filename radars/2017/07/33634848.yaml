    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a UITextField, it's textContentType is set to UITextContentType.emailAddress and when the field is selected, email addresses are properly shown above the keyboard. However I have a limited set of characters allowed in this UITextField and that is gated by the textfield's delegate implementing textField:shouldChangeCharacterIn:replacementString. One of those invalid characters is a space.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when tapping the suggested email address above the keyboard, the replacementString sent to the delegate function is \" \" and not \"the@email.address\". Also what is finally inserted is \"the@email.address \" with a trailing space at the end. This functionality makes it challenging to validate input and also erroneously inserts spaces after an email address in a field designated only for email addresses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITextField\r\n2. Set the text field's textContentType to .emailAddress\r\n3. Set its delegate\r\n4. Implement func textField(_ textField: UITextField, shouldChangeCharactersIn range: NSRange, replacementString string: String) -> Bool in the delegate\r\n4. Select the text field\r\n5. Try to insert the suggested email address\r\n6. Note that the string sent to func textField(_ textField: UITextField, shouldChangeCharactersIn range: NSRange, replacementString string: String) -> Bool is \" \" and not the email address.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould receive the actual email address in the delegate function without a trailing space.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe delegate function is told that a single space is attempting to be inserted, then if it returns true, the email address plus a space is inserted, if it returns false, nothing is inserted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11, Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested so far on an iPad Air 2 and an iPhone 6s Plus running iOS 11 beta."
