    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 9 beta 2, when I drag and drop an external framework to Linked Frameworks and Libraries section, the framework is copied from the original directory to the directory that contains the main project. After this operation, the framework is not listed in Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.\r\n\r\nXcode 8.3.3 works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrag and drop an external framework into Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should list the dragged framework in Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode creates a group called Frameworks that contains a missing reference. The dragged framework is moved from the original directory to the main directory that contains the project.\r\nThe framework is not listed in Linked Frameworks and Libraries section."
