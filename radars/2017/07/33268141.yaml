    description: "If we want to add font styling to display a string that has lower case letters as upper case, there doesn't appear to be an option for that any more.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have `kLowerCaseType` but that only has small or petite caps.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `String` function `uppercased()` but that changes the string value.\r\n\r\nThere use to be `kLetterCaseType` and `kAllCapsSelector` but its deprecated.\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to add a `kLowerCaseAllCapsSelector` to `kLowerCaseType`.\r\nThis might also need a `kUpperCaseNoCapsSelector` for `kUpperCaseType` but this is not the subject for this Suggestion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an attributed string\r\nUse UIFontDescriptor to set the font style\r\nNotice no option for all-caps\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA `kLowerCaseType` selector for all-caps\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere use to be `kLetterCaseType` and `kAllCapsSelector` but its deprecated. There may be a regression to lose an all-caps option."
