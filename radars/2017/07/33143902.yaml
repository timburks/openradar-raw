    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFinder will refuse to copy any file over 4 GB (4,000,000,000 bytes) to a FAT32 volume, claiming that it is too large for the volume's format (see screenshot). However, the limit for FAT32 is actually 4 GiB (4,294,967,296 bytes)â€“as evidenced by cp, which will happily comply.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Acquire a FAT32 volume with more than 4 GiB free space.\r\n2. Create a 4.001 GB (3.73 GiB) file (or use the attached, zipped one):\r\n$ cat /dev/zero | head -c 4001000000 > ~/Desktop/4gb\r\n3. Try to copy this file to the target volume using Finder.\r\n4. Try to copy this file to the target volume using cp.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth Finder and cp succeed in copying this file.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nFinder refuses to copy the file since it's larger than 4 GB.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from OS X El Capitan, I believe. I haven't tried this in macOS Sierra.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
