    description: "Area:\r\nHome App\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHomeKit automation is an incredibly useful feature. However, one of my automations is to turn off my lights and turn everything off when I go to bed. The time I have set is a static 12:00 AM, however, if the Home app could grab the bedtime set in the Clock app, it would provide more flexibility as to when the lights turn off depending on the day of the week or if I need to stay up late, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Home app\r\n- Tap Automation tab\r\n- Create new automation based on \"A Time of Day Occurs\"\r\n- Look for \"Bedtime\" option\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- There should be a \"Bedtime\" option with the time set in the Clock app\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- No such option exists and a static time must be chosen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta 4 (15A5327g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConsidering that the Health app is able to determine the amount of time slept based on the Bedtime feature in the clock app, Home should be able to access it in a similar manner as well.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPhilips Hue Lights + Bridge Starter Kit, Light Model LWB014, Base Model BSB002\r\niDevices Switch, Model ADEV0001 (v. 1.7.16)"
