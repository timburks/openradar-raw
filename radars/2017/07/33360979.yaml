    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the new navigationItem.searchController feature in combination with a table view and searchController.dimsBackgroundDuringPresentation=NO, the search table view scrolling is not perfect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the attached sample project.\r\nScroll to the top to reveal the search bar and tap it.\r\nNow scroll up and down.\r\nWatch the scrollIndicator while scrolling to the top.\r\nWatch the contentOffset while scrolling to the bottom.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth scrollIndicator and content offset animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. When scrolling to the top, the scrollIndicatorInsets seem to be changed when the top of the page is almost reached. So the indicators are not animated smoothly.\r\n2. When scrolling to the bottom, the contentOffset is set back one row after the scrolling deceleration ends.\r\n3. The content inset is wrong and leaves one empty row above the keyboard. (Note, I didn't specify any custom insets. So this is the default behavior.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the screen video within the sample project folder."
