    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen drag and drop are enabled on UITableView the traditional reordering operation using cell's reordering control becomes harder to trigger. It requires much longer time for the press on the reordering control to enter the ordering state.\r\n\r\nIt makes it very hard to offer the best experience to both advanced users(who prefers new iOS features like drag and drop) and traditional users(who may not even know about drag and drop). These traditional users may think it broken.\r\n\r\nActually the current behavior feels weird even to me as a developer. Why interaction on a explicit control doesn't feel immediate and direct but delayed and indirect as if the tap is on the cell?\r\n\r\nI think the whole experience of reordering with reordering control should be exactly as before(including the movement limitation inside cell occupied region) and not routed via drag and drop at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap Edit button.\r\n3. Use reordering control to move cells. Feel the delay.\r\n4. Comment out these lines in TableViewController.swift to disable drag and drop:\r\n            tableView.dragDelegate = self\r\n            tableView.dropDelegate = self\r\n5. Repeat step 2 & 3 to see the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!Ea4QyCpA!tUMbC0DnGTwPaDb5WNsNYwMlXo1LG9pQE4-0TnmUUVE"
