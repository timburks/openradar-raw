    description: "Summary:\r\nI am attempting to add support the MediaPlayer framework in one of my apps; however, it doesn't not seem to work on macOS Sierra 10.12.1+ as the documentation states. It only works on macOS High Sierra. You can download a copy of the project, at the commit that has this bug, here: https://github.com/lhc70000/iina/tree/8c6aad6f6571c5ca32a372e45c3b923b1900b142\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the app on macOS Sierra 10.12.1+.\r\n2. Run the app on macOS High Sierra.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMediaPlayer's functionality (i.e.) play/pause with AirPods or a Now Playing icon in the Touch Bar works in both cases.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThis only works in macOS High Sierra.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\nrdar://problem/33296681\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
