    description: "As a solo developer handling my own support emails, one of the most common types of emails I get is a confusion around how family sharing and IAP works; namely most people who setup family sharing (who presumably do so so they can share app purchases) expect IAP to be shared with their family members and get confused when it doesn't, thinking it's a fault with the app rather than a limitation of family sharing.\r\n\r\nI understand why consumables don't make sense as a shared purchase but non-consumables (level packs, skins, hats, etc) should be shared since customers expect this behavior and my solution of generating IAP promo codes to send out to the confused dads and sad 13 year olds emailing me takes a lot of time away from development."
