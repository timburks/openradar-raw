    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33004080\n\nIt's great that iOS now offers a consistent UI to browse and pick documents of document-based apps. The customization possibilities of UIDocumentBrowserViewController however are very limited, which might lead to user confusion if all apps look exactly the same and he/she doesn't know the name of the active app anymore. UIDocumentBrowserViewController shows the big NavigationBar title \"Browse\" in all apps, it would be good if we could customize this title and show the app name instead.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. If not for the custom tint color, try to distinguish it from the built-in Files app and look for the name of the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user can clearly recognize the current app, even if itâ€™s still open after the phone was locked\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user can only see the title \"Browse\" in every UIDocumentBrowserBased app\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
