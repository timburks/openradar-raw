    description: "Summary:\r\nThe brightness slider in control centre (iPhone) or multitasking (iPad) is all black when the brightness is minimum. Black items are hard to see when the screen in dim compared to ambient light. This makes the slider hard to find in the situation you want to find it most.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn off Auto-Brightness in Settings > Display & Brightness\n2. Set the brightness to minimum\n3. Go outside in the sun\n4. Try to find the brightness slider\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe design should make this easier to see in poor lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSlider is hard to find.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 developer beta 4 (15A5327g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don’t use Auto-Brightness on my iPad because I mostly use it inside and want it set to near minimum brightness, and Auto-Brightness makes it get brighter annoyingly.\n\nThis was better with iOS 10 because control centre had a light background so was easier to see.\n\nHopefully with time I’ll learn to put my thumb in exactly the right place without being able to see anything."
