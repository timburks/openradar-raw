    description: "(I did not write the bug report, but in essence it's the same as https://openradar.appspot.com/33454922)\r\n\r\nAn unofficial response from an Apple engineer explains:\r\n\r\nFSCatalogSearch will not be supported on APFS because APFS has 64-bit nodeIDs and parentDirIDs (inode numbers and linkIDs) and Carbon File Manager API only supports 32-bit nodeIDs and parentDirIDs. The FSRefs to items on APFS volumes do not use the 64-bit nodeIDs and parentDirIDs from the file system. The change will be to return the bHasCatSearch and bSupportsFSCatalogSearch bits clear for APFS volumes."
