    description: "Summary:\r\nVoiceOver navigation not working in nested WKWebView:\r\nSwipe navigation of WKWebView inside of UICollectionViewCell doesn't escape to remaining accessibility elements (next/previous cell)\r\nWhen nested in UIScrollView, swipe navigation works as expected; direct touch fails to grant focus on accessible elements.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith UICollectionViewCell as WKWebview's superview: Activate VoiceOver, observe swipe navigation behavior.\r\n\r\nWith UIScrollview as WKWebview's superview: Activate VoiceOver, observe direct touch does not grant AccessibilityFocus.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccessibilityFocus should traverse all accessibility elements on screen. Direct touch on accessible element should grant accessibilityFocus.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWith UICollectionViewCell as WKWebview's superview: AccessibilityFocus does not exit WKWebview by swipe navigation.\r\n\r\nWith UIScrollview as WKWebview's superview: Direct touch on web view's accessible element does not grant focus.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 / IPod Touch (5th Gen)\r\niOS 10.3 / Simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttempted workaround by inserting a UIView into the view hierarchy between the WKWebview and it's container view had no impact."
