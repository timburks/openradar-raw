    description: "In documentation and online discussions, everyone refers to a Download Size column in the popup that appears when, in iTunes Connect, we click on Activity > [build number] > App Store File Sizes (under Compressed File Size). However, I only have the Installation Size column in my version.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe App Store File Sizes should have the \"Download Size\" column as well, depicting the download sizes for each of the devices.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n\"Download Size\" column is missing from the App Store File Sizes popover display."
