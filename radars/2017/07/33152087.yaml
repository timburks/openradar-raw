    description: "Summary:\r\nThe simulator causes to change the current audio codec between my Mac and bluetooth headphones (Bose QC 35).\r\n\r\nDuring normal listening the connection uses the AAC or SBC codec. At the moment when the simulator plays sound (e.g. keyboard clicks) the codec switches to SCO which is a massive drop in sound quality. The switch back to the better codec happens only after you quit the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Connect your bluetooth headphones with your Mac\r\n- Play music in iTunes\r\n- Make sure the current codec is AAC or SBC by alt-clicking on the bluetooth icon in the menu bar and selection the headphone\r\n- Open the attached project in Xcode\r\n- Run it in a simulator. IÂ´ve used the iPhone 7 Plus\r\n- Type a letter in the UITextView. Make sure that you use the software keyboard in the simulator to produce a keyboard click sound\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- You hear the keyboard click sound and your playing music altogether in a good quality\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- At the moment you type a letter, the codec between the Mac and the headphones droppes to SCO."
