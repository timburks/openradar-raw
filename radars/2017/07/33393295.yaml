    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!  This is a hard one to explain, and I've only been able to catch it \"on camera\" once, but it happens to me fairly often.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - some combination of ^P and ^I is killing Xcode\r\n\r\nI use emacs navigation keybindings a lot. I also use ^I a lot to indent lines - the default indentation Xcode chooses for me is usually not correct, so I fix it as I navigate over it.\r\n\r\nAttached are about 6 crashlogs caused by this.\r\n\r\nHere's a video that I captured during an Xcode9 demo to my local (Pittsburgh) cocaheads.  (I was screen recording, but forgot to have it record the microphone :-(  )  Overall my coocaheads are really impressed with Xcode9) : https://www.dropbox.com/s/redacted/control-killer.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe video is slowed down to 1/3rd speed, and it shows the keystrokes being done in all their glory.\r\n\r\n(If you end up asking for a sysdiagnose, lemme know specifically what you want plzkthx - they're _gigantic_ and hose my DSL connection for an hour to upload.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ncome combination of ^P and ^I.  Check out the video for one caught en medias res.  I haven't been able to reliably reproduce it, but it happens to me occasionally, especially when I'm adding something brand new, like a new protocol or extension.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
