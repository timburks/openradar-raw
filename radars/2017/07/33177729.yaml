    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33176154\n\nAs discussed in radar #32786254 GKRTreeâ€™s elements(inBoundingRectMin:rectMax:) only returns elements which are fully contained by the specified boundingRectMin/Max (although the documentation is contradicting on this). \nFor various R-Tree use cases (like collision detection, lasso selection, nearest neighbour search) it would make sense to have a method elements(overlappingBoundingRectMin:rectMax:) which returns all elements which are fully contained by the boundingRect + all elements which are intersecting the boundingRect.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe query in the attached playground should work with elements(overlappingBoundingRectMin:rectMax:)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
