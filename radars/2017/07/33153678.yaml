    description: "Summary:\r\nPlaying a video/stream in PIP is really useful for following e.g. sport events, while still getting some work done. But when a goal is scored (or other noteworthy events are happening), the stream might take the full attention, and the user might want to switch the stream to fullscreen.\n\nThis is currently only possibly by dismissing the PIP into the inline video player, and then pressing the fullscreen button.\n\nIn short: Switching between PIP and fullscreen would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a video/stream in e.g. Safari\n2. Enter PIP mode\n3. Switch the video/stream from PIP to fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to press a fullscreen button near “dismiss PIP” button and the pause button, which would move the PIP video into fullscreen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such button exists, and dismissing PIP is required to get back to the native inline video player controls where a fullscreen button exists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
