    description: "This bug report affects both FSCatalogSearch and its low level searchfs functions when used with the APFS volume format.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when the code compares file names with the search parameter, it does that case-sensitively, but it should be done case-_in_sensitively. On other volume formats, e.g. HFS+, this works as expected, so this is a APFS specific bug.\r\n\r\nThis issue is known by the dev team. I'm just filing this to add my vote for having this fixed before 10.13 goes final.\r\n\r\nIt may also affect searching with Spotlight, as it supposedly also invokes searchfs (I was frequently told this by several Apple engineers though I do not know the exact circumstances when this is the case), so this may not only be affecting 3rd party apps using this function, but a key component of macOS itself.\r\n\r\nI consider this a \"serious bug\" because there is no work-around. Please don't forget to fix this. Many 100,000 of users of EasyFind and Find Any File rely on this working correctly when they convert their disks from HFS+ to APFS format.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs said before, this is a known issue with the APFS file system team, so a verification should not be necessary.\r\nRegardless, I've attached an Xcode project with a cmdline tool that invokes \"searchfs\" accordingly. I also included a sample APFS img for testing.\r\n\r\nMount the img, then open Terminal to run the included \"searchfs\" command like this:\r\n\r\n./searchfs -v shot /Volumes/APFSi1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould list 57 files containing \"shot\" in their name.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nFinds no files. However, if you search for \"Shot\" instead of \"shot\", then the files are found.\r\n\r\nOn an HFS+ volume, the search would work no matter if you wrote \"shot\" or \"Shot\""
