    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33583799\n\nWhen you define a Swift enum, backed by a String or Int, it would be very useful if you could use them in Interface Builder with @IBInspectable.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift enum like this one, that defines how important the modal being presented is relative to other modals:\n\n```\nenum ModalPriority: Int {\n    case low = 0, medium, high, critical\n}\n```\n\n2. Add a property to a custom UIViewController subclass like this:\n\n```\n@IBInspectable var priority: ModalPriority = .low\n```\n\n3. Attempt to set this property in IB\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get a NSPopUpButton with the cases from the enum\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis property isn't exposed in IB\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
