    description: "aptic feedback has been a well loved and mentioned part of my app Blackbox since the week iPhone 7 launched. Blackbox's haptic feedback was even noted as in the description of why it won an Apple Design Award: \"It uses haptics for sensory feedback to make puzzles more personal, nuanced, and tactileâ€¦\" For those with low vision and other disabilities, the feature has literally provided another dimension of feedback and stimulation to make the game that much more immersive and real. For developers who may not have the budget or time to develop \"sonic\" interfaces to parallel their visual ones, haptics provide a relatively easy alternative that can add an additional layer of emotion and understanding especially for players with limited vision or hearing.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the variable haptics like those seem in the rumble of the iMessage heart balloon effect or disco laser would be welcome additions to the great library of UIFeedbackGenerators that set iPhone apps a class above the rest.\r\n\r\nA blind player describing the haptic feedback in Blackbox (18 minutes in): https://www.applevis.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/AppleVisPodcast1068.mp3"
