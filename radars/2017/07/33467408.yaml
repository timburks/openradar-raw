    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a swift app that also links against Swift frameworks. We have ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_LIBRARIES set to no on all our embedded frameworks and YES on the app target.\r\n\r\nIn the generated IPA we see two copies of identical swift runtime dylibs.\r\n\r\n- One under SwiftSupport/iphoneos\r\n- Another under Payload/Frameworks\r\n\r\nWe added a manual build step to remove the libraries in SwiftSupport/iphoneos to bring our app size down, and there were no issues in our enterprise dev/builds. However, submission to AppStore fails with an error that a SwiftSupport folder was not found.\r\n\r\nWe see that after processing there is just 1 copy of the swift dylibs packaged in the app (within Frameworks and not within SwiftSupport). \r\n\r\nIs this a bug in the tooling that publishes duplicate copies to the IPA or is this intentional?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a swift app linking against an embedded swift framework. Set ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_LIBRARIES to no on the embedded framework and YES on the app target.\r\n\r\nBuild an IPA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly one copy of the swift runtime dylibs should show up in the IPA\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere are two copies of identical swift runtime dylibs in the IPA."
