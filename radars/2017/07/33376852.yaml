    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode’s Build Settings search is very unforgiving, which is especially problematic when attempting to find awkwardly-named settings, or settings that may have plausibly been called different names by reasonable people. For example, searching for “Swift version” returns no matches, despite the setting in the *.pbxproj file being named “SWIFT_VERSION”. Instead, one must remember that the setting’s “natural” name is “Swift Language Version”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch for “Swift Version” in the Build Settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind the “Swift Language Version” in the search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing is returned in the search results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode’s “Open Quickly” feature has excellent fuzzy-string search capabilities. Presumably it wouldn’t be _that_ challenging to leverage it here? Although knowing what I know of Xcode’s internal architecture, maybe that’s naive of me to think \U0001F609"
