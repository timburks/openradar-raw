    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a specific situation, apps will no longer open in iOS. The loading screen for the app displays and then promptly closes.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis occurs with any app we have tested. For the sake of reproduction, we have selected a single app.\n\n1. Install \"Google - Search made just for mobile\" from the App Store using an Apple ID\n2. Using MDM, take management of the app using InstallApplication and ChangeManagementState set to true\n3. Using MDM, assign a VPP device-based license for the app to the device serial number.\n3. Using MDM, request that the app is updated using InstallApplication and PurchaseMethod of '1'\n4. Restart the device\n5. App will show loading screen and then close immediately if opened\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should open and remain open.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app closes immediately.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2, 10.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe have verified this with iOS 10.3.3 and 10.3.2 running on iPhone6 and iPhone 7.
