    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUITextFieldDelegate should have a delegate method textFieldDidChange(:) that's called when its text or marked text changes, just like UITextViewDelegate.textViewDidChange(:), especially considering that there is already a UITextFieldTextDidChange notification. Otherwise we have to use both delegate and notifications to get the complete picture and that'll be awkward."
