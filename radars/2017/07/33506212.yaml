    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you have an image in your xcassets that is similar to a keyword in Swift, if you type that keyword, Xcode will offer the completion for the image, which often gets completed when you hit enter, meaning you have to undo the change and type the keyword again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift project\r\n2. Add an image to the xcassets called `infoo`\r\n3. Attempt to type out a closure that takes a single argument so it would look like `{ foo in`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can type `{ foo in` without any interference (especially when typing `in`)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode attempts to autocomplete image names, so if you're not careful typing `in` will autocomplete to `infoo`, meaning when you hit enter, you will complete an image, have to undo your changes, and type `in` again this time pressing escape before hitting enter to make sure it doesn't complete for you.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a project setup to hit this case, open AppDelegate and complete `foo in`. Also attached is a screenshot of the situation you get into."
