    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe \"Now Playing\" icon never seems to show up on my \"Touch Bar\" (in reality Xcode's Touch Bar emulator), even when using it with system apps. I have seen this work with other computers, but for whatever reason it doesn't work on mine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app that implements the MediaPlayer framework (such as iTunes or QuickTime)\r\n2. Move the app to the background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA \"Now Playing\" icon appears in the Touch Bar that lets me control the audio.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo icon.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
