    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a monochrome bitmap context with `kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast`, generating a UIImage out of that and then encoding and decoding that image with `NSKeyedArchiver` and `NSKeyedUnarchiver`, the resulting image (or rather its backing CGImage) has an alpha info of `kCGImageAlphaLast`.\n\nThe problem here is that this is not supported by CoreGraphics when using a monochrome color space. Therefore when trying to create a core graphics context, it will log an error message complaining about this when doing so and no image context will be created.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the attached sample\n1. Run the sample\n2. Notice both images are drawn on screen without any issue\n3. Check the console logs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe console should state that the original image and the redrawn image both should have an alpha info of 1 before and after archiving & unarchiving.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe original image has an alpha info of 1 before and after the archiving-unarchiving roundtrip. However the image that has been redrawn before has an alpha info of 1 before archiving and an alpha info of 3 after redrawing.\n\nFurthermore core graphics logs a detailed error about the parameter combination being unsupported. (I added the environment variable for that).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3 + 11b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also added a shared breakpoint for the cg error log for your convenience which currently is disabled.\n\nI am not really sure if this is a bug or an enhancement request, as I guess technically there is nothing saying that you should only ever get `CGImage`s with parameters that are supported by bitmap contexts, however it at least seems like a bug to me that `UIImage`s are altered when being archived / unarchived. This is a duplicate of radar #33404326"
