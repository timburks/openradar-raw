    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the Network Link Conditioner on an iPhone to simulate a bad network connection CarPlay does not start on a head unit. If network link conditioner is turned on after connecting to CarPlay and launching an app the UI is delayed and unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThe docs for CarPlay specifically say to \"Test under poor network conditions\" but this is difficult as we are using a head unit on our desks and we have good wifi in the office.\r\n\r\nWe can work around this by using a proxy to send traffic to a Mac from the device, then use Network Link Conditioner on the Mac to slow the traffic. This leaves the CarPlay UI responsive, but the network is slower and simulates the situation we need to test.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect device to CarPlay.\r\nTurn on Network Link Conditioner and choose 3G or Edge preset.\r\nTry to interact with the CarPlay UI on the head unit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCarPlay UI should be responsive.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCarPlay UI is not responsive.\r\nIf Network Link Conditioner is enabled before connecting device to CarPlay then the CarPlay UI won't even start/display on the head unit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHead units tested are Sony xav-ax100 and JVC KW-M730BT.\r\nTests were done using an iPhone 7."
