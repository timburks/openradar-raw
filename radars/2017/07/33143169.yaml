    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt would be nice if NSByteCountFormatter had a way of configuring the unitsStyle, similar to NSDateComponentsFormatter which has unitsStyle.\r\n\r\nIf that was possible then I could use NSByteCountFormatter to produce the accessibilityLabel text for a label that formats bytes. In our app we put the download size in parenthesis which seems to cause a problem for VoiceOver. For example the label with text \"Download (5.37 GB)\" is read by VoiceOver as \"Download 5.37 GEEBEE\" instead of the expected \"Download 5.37 gigabytes\".\r\n\r\nIt's not too difficult to work around this, it seems if the byte string is on it's own without the parenthesis then VoiceOver will read the units in full, but having the unitsStyle would be clearer and more deliberate.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to pick the longer format in certain cases in our UI \"5.12 Gigabytes\" which currently isn't possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample project with VoiceOver on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLabels should be read correctly in all cases.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nPunctuation and parenthesis cause VoiceOver to read a string produced with NSByteCountFormatter incorrectly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nSample project:\r\nhttps://github.com/gspiers/radar_33143169"
