    description: "Summary:\r\nCBCentralManagerState is being replaced with CBManagerState in 10.13. The two enums are different types, but the entries have the same values. CBManagerState is marked 10.13+. We (chrome) can't use the new version without warnings because it's marked 10.13+, and we can't use the old version because then we get warnings because [CBManager state] now returns a CBManagerState, so comparing against the old constants results in a warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to write code that compares the result of [CBManager state] to either CBManagerStateResetting or CBCentralManagerStateResetting with the 10.13 SDK in a way that no warning is produced, and in a way that runs on 10.10.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's possible somehow.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIf we use CBManagerStateResetting, then clang tells us to use it in @available(macos 10.13, *) (which isn't good because this code runs on 10.10+ without issues), but if we use CBCentralManagerStateResetting then we get a warning that [CBManager state] returns a CBManagerState which is a different type than CBCentralManagerState\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta, macOS 10.13 SDK"
