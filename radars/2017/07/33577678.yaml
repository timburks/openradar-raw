    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4 adds swift source file to Headers build phase when move it from iOS app target to Cocoa Touch Framework target. Xcode should add moved file to Compile Sources build phase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new iOS project in Xcode 9 beta 4 with Single View App template.\r\n2. Add new Swift source file to created app.\r\n3. Add new Cocoa Touch Framework target.\r\n4. In Project Navigator move (drag and drop) file created in step 2 to target created in step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMoved file is added to Compile Sources build phase and compiles.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nMoved source file is added to Headers Build Phase and does not compile during build.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSelect moved file in Project Navigator and open File Inspector.
