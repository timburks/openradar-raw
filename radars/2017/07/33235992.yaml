    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen multiple (traditional) pin annotation views are placed next to each other, tapping and dragging over multiple annotations doesn't show callouts of all pins anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the attached app on an iOS 10 iPhone next to an iOS 11 iPhone.\nPress \"Annotations 1\".\nNow tap the rightmost pin and slowly drag to the left to select all pins after each other.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll Callouts from \"1\" to \"8\" should display once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly some callouts are displayed, in my case: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.\nNow compare to an iPhone running iOS 10 where all callouts from 1-8 are displayed in order.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also suspect that the order in which annotations are added to the mapView does matter now (it didn't in iOS 10). That's why I added an \"Annotations 2\" button that adds the annotations in a different order. However, I can't yet reproduce this."
