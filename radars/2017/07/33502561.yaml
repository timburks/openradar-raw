    description: "To reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsfiddle.net/cvrebert/cjn5n4z2/show/ in iOS Safari.\r\n2. Tap into the text input.\r\n3. Type in a long string of text, such that the start of the text has been pushed to far to the left that it's no longer visible.\r\n4. Attempt to move the cursor towards the start of the text by long pressing within the input and then, without taking your finger off the touchscreen, moving your finger beyond the left edge of the text input field.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe text in the input should start moving to the right, so that eventually the beginning of the text is reached.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe text in the input does not start moving to the right."
