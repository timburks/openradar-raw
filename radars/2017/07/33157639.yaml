    description: "RPScreenRecorder only allows recording the apps main window and does not capture any custom windows with a higher windowLevel\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached Xcode project, build and launch it on a device running iOS 11.\r\nTap the \"Start Capturing\" Button and confirm the dialog with \"Record Screen\".\r\nNotice the little preview of the captured image in the bottom right corner.\r\nIt does not contain the yellow square, which is a second window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe recorded video would contain all windows of the app.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe recorded video only contains images from the main window of the app (which isn't even the keyWindow in this case)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 (15A5304j)\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nApple Developer Relations\r\n\r\nThis issue behaves as intended based on the following:  \r\nReplaykit will only ever capture the applications main window. \r\nIf you wish for ui elements to be captured, then you would need to render them in the main window  We are now closing this bug report."
