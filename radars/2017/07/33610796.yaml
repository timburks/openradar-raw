    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33583911\n\nDuring Swift compilation if you modify a file that has been compiled, the compiler will fail. Currently in Xcode the error in the issue navigator is just a generic error, and you have to dive into the full build log to see that this was the cause. It would be nice if this error was surfaced so you didn't have to look at the entire build log.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift project\n2. Compile the project\n3. While it's compiling, modify a file\n4. See the build fail\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe issue navigator surfaces that a file was edited while building\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe issue navigator just says `swiftc failed with exit code 1`, and the details about why are buried in the full build log\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are the photos of the issue navigator, and the full build error."
