    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe iOS settings about page is important to developers outside and inside Apple, as well as other customers diagnosing issues. Build numbers are critically important to Apple developers in radars like this yet there’s no easy way to copy that information into radar and other tools. Some fields like serial number support copying but model and others seemingly arbitrarily do not. All fields should recognize a long press to copy their contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings > About \r\nTry to copy build, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt can’t be copied.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI have to practice my memorizations skills, inevitably screw up, and drive someone reading my radars to light the building on fire.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 (could not copy build number)\r\nFrom memory: 15A5318G\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease do not make me build a memory palace."
