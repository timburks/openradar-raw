    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have an app which lets people execute AppleScript/JavaScript scripts, and we do that using the OSAScript framework. They get to set how often the scripts are executed, and I've had a bug report from a user who is running the scripts *very* frequently, that he sees crashes.\r\n\r\nI've managed to whittle the code down to a consistent reproducer that will crash within 2 seconds on my 4GHz Late-2015 iMac (running 10.12.5)\r\n\r\nI realise this is probably not at all how OSAScript is intended to be used, but nonetheless, it doesn't appear to offer me any API for cleaning up its resources after I've used it each iteration, so it crashes because (afaict) it's hitting some kind of resource limit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild&Run the included Xcode project, it should crash pretty quickly. You can speed up the crash dramatically by removing the NSLog() for each iteration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nComments"
