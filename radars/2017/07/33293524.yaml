    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTable views are nested inside clip views inside scroll views. On macOS 10.13, the scroll view is is wrongly treated as an accessibility element, which creates another level the user needs to step into to reach the contents of the table view. Additionally, the scroll view contains the first header of the table view as an accessibility child, which should also not be the case.\r\n\r\nAttached is the sample project AccessibilityUIExamples.zip as provided by Apple, which showcases the problem nicely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the attached sample code and start VoiceOver.\r\n- If you are not inside a scroll area use VoiceOver to step into the scroll area and select the table view.\r\n- Try to navigate to the detail view on the right with VO-right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can switch between table view and detail view with VO-left and VO-right, and step into the table view (and its headers) with VO-shift-down.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nYou cycle between the table view and its first header, because you are stuck in the scroll view. Stepping into the table view will allow you to cycle between all items of the table view, but to reach the detail view, you will have to first step out of the table view and then again out of the scroll view.\r\n\r\nThe scroll view should not be an accessibility element and the first header should not be above the table view in the accessibility hierarchy. The header is actually reachable twice, once as part of the scroll view and once as part of the table view.\r\n\r\n(The attached file can also be found here: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/AccessibilityUIExamples/Introduction/Intro.html)"
