    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 10 and below, the text of the back button would hide when the navigation item's title was too long.\r\n\r\nin iOS 11 with large titles enabled, the behaviour is kept when running at narrow size classes (iPhone portrait, or iPad in split screen) even though there can be no overlap between the title and the back button (the back button sits atop the title). This leads to the back button's text being shown incosnsitently\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(Xcode project attached for demo)\r\n\r\n- Create a Navigation Controller in Interface Builder, add a root view controller\r\n- Turn on “Prefers Large Titles” on the navigation controller\r\n- Add a second controller pushed (“show” segue) form the first one\r\n- Add a navigation item to the child controller and set a long title\r\n- Run on a narrow size class (device or simulator)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe back button always shows the title of the previous view controller in the navigation stack\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe back button’s text is hidden if the title is long enough that it would overlap without `prefersLargeTitles`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 beta 4 (15A5327g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe back button behaves properly on wide size classes (iPad full size)"
