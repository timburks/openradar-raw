    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building an app that uses GameKit in Xcode 9 the GKPlayerAuthenticationDidChangeNotificationName notification name is an unresolved identifier error. Jumping to definition shows the definition of this identifier, and building the same project in Xcode 8 succeeds, so the identifier is there, but Xcode 9 seems not to be finding it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse a line like the following anywhere in a file that also imports GameKit:\r\n\r\nNotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: nil, name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: GKPlayerAuthenticationDidChangeNotificationName), object: nil)\r\n\r\nNote: selector is nil for the purposes of the sample project being attached. In normal use that would refer to a function elsewhere in the file or project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGKPlayerAuthenticationDidChangeNotificationName to be found.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nGKPlayerAuthenticationDidChangeNotificationName is an unresolved identifier error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 9.0/9M174d\r\nmacOS: 10.12.6/16G29\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a simple project that illustrates this bug. All the project does is try to register for the GKPlayerAuthenticationDidChangeNotificationName in the AppDelegate at didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. Even without building the static analyzer reports the line as an error."
