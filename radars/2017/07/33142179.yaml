    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome files, seemingly at random, appear as grayed-out in Finder (as if they were downloading). However, these files act completely normally if used. See screenshot for a (otherwise normal) file that has this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not sure how this occurs, since it only seems to affect some files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file isn't grayed-out since it's a normal file.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe file is grayed-out as if it is downloading.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from macOS Sierra.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
