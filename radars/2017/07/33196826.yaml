    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNSScrollView asks its NSScrollers to `drawKnob()` when you scroll; it also queries `rect(for: .knob)`. But the actual drawing is not affected until you command-tab out of the app or scroll to the edges of the document to make the knobs shrink. This means there's no programmatic way to initiate a change in the drawing reliably as the scroll view seems to cache the drawing result, even though the reported rectangle changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- add a text view inside a NSScrollView to the app\r\n- create a custom NSScroller subclass and use it as the vertical scroller\r\n- create a toggle that affects the style of the custom scroller, e.g. change the `rect(for: .knob)` size and draw something different than before in `drawKnob()`\r\n\r\nSee minimal sample project: https://github.com/DivineDominion/bugreport_NSScrollerKnob\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe knob changes its appearance and size the next time it becomes visible.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe knob stays as it was until you command-tab out of the app or move the knob to the edges of the scroll view to make it shrink.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMinimal sample project: https://github.com/DivineDominion/bugreport_NSScrollerKnob\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUsing a Magic Trackpad and having auto-hiding scrollers enabled."
