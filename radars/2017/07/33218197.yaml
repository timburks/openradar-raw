    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAttempting to use the above dylib as a PKCS11 provider stopped working as of 10.12.4. \r\n\r\nYou used to be able to perform the following operations:\r\n1.$ ssh-keygen -D /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib\r\n2.$ ssh-add -s /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib \r\n3.$ ssh -I /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib $host\r\n\r\nIn the case of 1 this works.  You can read the public key and it will be displayed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of 2 you can add the public key as an identity to the ssh-agent.  However, when you attempt to use this it fails at: \r\n\r\ndebug2: input_userauth_pk_ok: fp SHA256:[REDACTED]\r\ndebug3: sign_and_send_pubkey: RSA SHA256:[REDACTED]\r\ndebug3: send packet: type 50\r\nAuthentication failed.\r\n\r\nAnd the action for the third scenario just fails outright.\r\n\r\nI've attempted this using a Yubikey Neo, Yubikey Nano and Nitrokey HSM.  All appear to fail similarly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou used to be able to perform the following operations:\r\n1.$ ssh-keygen -D /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib\r\n2.$ ssh-add -s /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib \r\n3.$ ssh -I /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib $host\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. should return the keys that are accessible through the pkcs11 provider\r\n2. should add the public key to as an identity to the ssh-agent\r\n3. should use the pkcs11 (shared object) provider directly to query identity.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. Succeeds.\r\n2. Succeeds, but subsequent attempts to SSH (which uses the ssh-agent to pull the identity) fail at the signing operation.\r\n3. Fails outright.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWould love to speak to someone regarding plans re: pkcs11 and piv on MacOS.  \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSo far reproducible on all hardware specs tested."
