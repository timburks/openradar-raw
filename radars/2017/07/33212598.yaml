    description: "Summary:\r\nMy project has four build configurations, namely AdHoc-Debug, AdHoc-Release, AppStore-Debug & AppStore-Release. The project contains of an app and its Today extension. To facilitate file sharing between app and extension I’m using App Groups capability, whose value is being set using a variable from xcconfig file. There are multiple xcconfig files, one per build configuration and per target (meaning 8 files, 4 configurations x 2 targets).\r\n\r\nAdHoc & AppStore configurations have different App Group value to prevent ad-hoc builds from messing with App Store builds’ data.\r\n\r\nThe whole combo works perfectly fine with Xcode 8 & automatic signing, but I’m getting the following build error on Xcode 9 beta 2:\r\n\r\n“TodayExtension” has conflicting settings for automatic signing. Capabilities differ across build configurations. Make these settings the same for each build configuration to continue using automatic signing, or switch to manual signing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project from Single View App template\r\n2. Add Today extension target & connect it with App target\r\n3. Add App Group capability to both App target & Today extension target\r\n4. Make actual App Group value different in Debug & Release configurations (by using two distinct xcconfig files & a variable in entitlements files, for example)\r\n5. Make sure automatic signing is enabled\r\n6. Make App scheme active and try to build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth Today extension & App targets successfully build.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nToday extension fails to build due to an error:\r\n\r\n“TodayExtension” has conflicting settings for automatic signing. Capabilities differ across build configurations. Make these settings the same for each build configuration to continue using automatic signing, or switch to manual signing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 beta 2 (9M137d) & macOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI hope it’s just a regression and is going to be fixed before Xcode 9 GM."
