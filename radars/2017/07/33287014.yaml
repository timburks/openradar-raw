    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 7, a UIScrollView which is the content view of a UIViewController inside a UINavigationController has its contentInsets set automatically so that its content avoids the navigation bars.  In iOS 11, this is no longer the case; the contentInsets are zero.  Since the new contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior property defaults to UIScrollViewContentInsetAdjustmentBehavior, which is described in the documentation as \"Automatically adjust the scroll view insets\", I do not believe this is intentional.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a view controller whose content view is a UIScrollView, and make it a child of a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nThere is an example project which does this at https://github.com/percysnoodle/content-insets-bug-test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content should be positioned such that it does not underlay the navigation controller's navigation bar.\r\n\r\nIn the example project, the translucent navigation bar should appear green.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe content should be positioned such that it does underlay the navigation controller's navigation bar.\r\n\r\nIn the example project, the translucent navigation bar appears red."
