    description: "Android provides intent services to allow for the calling of methods within application bundles based on the receipt of NFC data.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if iOS could do this as well. This would allow an application to register interest to respond to certain NFC types and data sets, which the OS would use to call a delegate method in the application upon seeing such an NFC token.\r\n\r\nThis could operate similarly to the iBeacon ranging system where the application is allowed some background execution time based upon seeing something it is interested in."
