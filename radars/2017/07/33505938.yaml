    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you open Maps.app (or an app that uses Google Maps) on the iOS simulator, the simulator performance seems to be just a few frames per second (around 1 or 2 frames per second). This was not the case in Xcode 9 beta 3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Xcode 9 beta 4 simulator\n2. Launch Maps.app\n3. Pan around\t\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get somewhere between 30 and 60fps on your macOS machine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get about 1 or 2 fps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This is not a problem in Xcode 9 beta 3\n- Attached is a `simctl diagnose` a `simctl io booted enumerate` and a `sysdiagnose -q`"
