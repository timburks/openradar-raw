    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached project that reproduces the problem: https://filebin.ca/3T8fZNbKFBrC/TestZeroAlpha.zip\r\n\r\nTest app consists of the two screens, each screen contains 4 text fields:\r\n1) visible\r\n2) hidden by setting -[UIView setHidden:YES]\r\n3) hidden by setting -[UIView setAlpha:0]\r\n4) hidden by setting -[UIView setFrame:CGMakeRect(..., ..., 0, 0)]\r\n\r\nOn the first screen, text fields are added as direct subviews.\r\nOn the second screen, they are inside a UITableViewCell.\r\n\r\nSwitching between screens is performed by tapping a button in the bottom of the first screen.\r\n\r\nAttached UI tests contain two tests.\r\nThe first one validates the existence of the text fields on the first screen and passes.\r\nThe second one validates the existence of the text fields on the second screen and fails.\r\n\r\nOn the first screen, only text field #1 is considered to exist, which is the expected behaviour.\r\nOn the second screen, text fields #1, #3 and #4 are reported as existing, which is a bug.\r\n\r\nAn existence of the fields on the second screen should be reported in the same way as it is reported on the first screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project file and run included UI tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests should pass. Existence should be reported consistently. Elements with alpha = 0 or empty frame should be reported as non-existent regardless of their location in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nTests fail. Existence is reported inconsistently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5\r\nSimulator: iOS 10.1 (14B72), iPhone 6s"
