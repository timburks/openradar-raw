    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen trying to fetch a userToken from SKCloudServiceController an SKErrorDomain error 7 is always returned. As it is fetching from a web service, it is expected that it won't always be available 100% of the time but I haven't been able to retrieve a valid token in several weeks. This doesn't seem to be limited to a change in the iOS 11 beta as I was able to retrieve a token in beta 3 but then it stopped working in beta 3 with no code change - definitely feels like an issue on the server side which the SKErrorDomain 7 alludes to.\r\n\r\nThere are several people having the same issue:\r\n\r\n- https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/82454\r\n- https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/244924\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Request access to the user's Apple Music account / media library using SKCloudServiceController.requestAuthorization\r\n\r\n2. Fetch a developer token from my server at https://clients.dodoapps.io/playlist-precis/generate-token.php\r\n\r\n3. Request a user token with:\r\n\r\nlet controller = SKCloudServiceController()\r\n        controller.requestUserToken(forDeveloperToken: developerToken) { (userToken, error) in {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt this point I should have a userToken to use with the Apple Music API\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe operation couldn't be completed (SKErrorDomain error 7)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 developer beta 4 (15A5327g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nsysdiagnose attached. Error occurred at 09:11 BST within the app 'UserTokenTest'. I have also attached an example project to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 5S and iPad Pro (1st gen 12.9\") running both iOS 11 developer beta 3 and developer beta 4."
