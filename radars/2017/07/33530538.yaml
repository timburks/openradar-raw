    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a third party service to manage my passwords, and it’s always a pain to log into apps that don’t support the standard third party extension API for autofilling passwords. I like how password autofill is implemented in the iOS 11 beta, but I would love it even more if third party apps could provide a UI for or could provide data to the password autofill experience so that I can still enjoy this feature while using the password system I prefer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
