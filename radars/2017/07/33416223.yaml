    description: "Summary:\r\nAny attempt to install or update watchOS on an Apple Watch (running watchOS 4 beta 2) from an iPhone on iOS 11 beta 3 fails with the message \"Could not connect to Apple Watch\". Additionally, new profiles cannot be added or installed on the Apple Watch (fails with the same message). Despite this, it is possible to update the watch complications from the connected iPhone, install new apps from the connected iPhone, and manage some settings. Interestingly, communication activities like \"Ping iPhone\" from the Apple Watch do not work and fail without a message or error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect or pair an Apple Watch (see configuration) to an iPhone (see configuration).\r\n2. Open the Apple Watch App on the iPhone while both devices are connected to one another, on WiFi, and charged.\r\n3. Open the Software Update view controller in the Apple Watch app. If the option becomes available to download watchOS 4 beta 3, do so now, and then wait for the download to complete (close the Apple Watch app before continuing with installation). If the option is not available, proceed to step 4.\r\n4. Wait for the iPhone to check for software updates.\r\n5. An error message, \"Could Not Connect to Apple Watch\" (see attached screenshot), always displays and the software update halts, is aborted, or does not appear / begin.\r\n\r\nUsing a process similar to the above when attempting to install a profile (after transferring via AirDrop) on the watch also fails in the same manner and generates the same message (\"Could not connect to Apple Watch\").\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone should be able to appropriately connect to the paired Apple Watch and proceed with software updates and profile installations without issue.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSoftware Updates and Profile Installations fail to begin / proceed / complete because the iPhone and paired Apple Watch are seemingly unable to connect to one another. Despite this, app installations and face changes in the Apple Watch app are reflected on the watch, as if it is connected. This suggests that the Apple Watch is indeed nearby, powered on, and not in Airplane Mode - yet is unable to perform software updates and profile installs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 4 beta 2 (15R5307f)\r\niOS 11 beta 3 (15A5318g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUnfortunately, because watchOS 4 beta 2 does not seem to allow the connected iPhone to install any profiles on the watch, I was unable to perform a sysdiagnose on the watch. However, I was able to collect a sysdiagnose from the iPhone (which may actually be where the issue is, although I'm not sure). During the sysdiagnose period I started almost immediately by triggering an app install from the phone to the watch (which worked properly), then continuing to the \"Software Update\" section of the Apple Watch app and attempting to update the watch's OS. I attempted the software update multiple times but received the same failure message each time. Additionally, this was attempted while the watch was connected, with both devices unlocked and battery levels over 50% (watch was at 100% on charger).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 (model number: MN9U2LL/A)\r\nApple Watch (Sport Edition, Original Series 1, model number: MJ2X2LL/A)"
