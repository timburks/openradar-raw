    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS Single View Application project.\r\n2. Create some external resource file f.e. an empty text file 'test.txt' in the Downloads folder\r\n3. Drag it into the Project navigator under the main app group and make sure the option 'Copy items if needed' is checked\r\n4. Check the Location in the File inspector. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should refer to the project file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file was copied to the project, but the project refers to the external file instead of the project file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This is happening only since Xcode 9.\r\n- Workaround: Remove the reference and drag in a reference to the project-file (which is copied to the Xcode project, but not added to the group) - but then, this file is not added to the target and the target needs to be checked manually"
