    description: "Summary:\r\nAirPods make a chime connect sound when it connects to a device. \r\n\r\nWhen you are using different devices close to each other you can be surprised by which device is connected. Thus you risk starting loud sound on the wrong device such that it plays in public to great embarrassment.\r\n\r\nIf AirPods had a couple of different connect chime sounds and used different sounds for different devices, but always the same chime sound for a given device, the attentive user would quickly learn which device was connected by the nature of the chime sound.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put AirPods in your ears\r\n2. Wait for connection\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAirPods should play chime sound that is distinct for different devices it connects to\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAirPods always play the same chime sound, requiring me to check my devices to make sure the intended device made the connection"
