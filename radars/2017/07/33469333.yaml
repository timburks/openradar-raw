    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm unable to back up my phone using iTunes since it keeps saying that's it's disconnecting halfway through. I have tried different cables and different ports with the same result so I think it's an issue with iTunes rather than a cable issue. Attached is a screenshot of the message iTunes gives.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to back up my phone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone backs up.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nMidway through iTunes reports that the phone disconnected and aborts the backup.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.7.0.48\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
