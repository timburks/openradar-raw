    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33615330\n\nWith the new changes in iOS 11 to location services it appears that now you always see the location access arrow because of Apple Watch faces' weather support. I think it would be ideal if this location permission was moved to the system level, so the indicator was only shown if you opt into show system level location access.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an iOS 11 device to an watchOS 4 watch\n2. Enable the Siri face\n3. Notice the location access arrow on the iPhone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe location access arrow doesn't show for watch face support, since it seems to be a constant passive source of accessing locations\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe location arrow always shows the \"not receiving locations\" state, and never disappears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
