    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33073431\n\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController allows to easily create new documents by simply setting `allowsDocumentCreation` to true and implementing the delegate method `documentBrowser(_:didRequestDocumentCreationWithHandler:).\n\nOften it is however needed to create a new document through other means, e.g. a URL Scheme, a UIKeyCommand or simply another workflow. This is of course possible by creating a document manually, BUT it is not possible to create a document in the current visible Folder because I can \n\na) neither request the current visible folder\nb) nor programatically request the creation of a document on UIDocumentBrowserViewController\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. run the attached DocumentBrowser-based app\n2. navigate to some folder, which is not the root folder\n3. it has a UIKeyCommand (Cmd+N) set up to create a new document (Prints a logging statement)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is possible to \n\na) either request the current displayed folder to manually create a document in this folder\nb) programatically request the creation of a document in the current displayed folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe built-in document creation mechanism is only triggered, if the user taps on the “+” and there’s no way to read out the current folder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
