    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUISearchBarDelegate should have a delegate method(or reuse searchBar(_:textDidChange:)) that's called when marked text changes, just like UITextViewDelegate.textViewDidChange(:).\r\n\r\nOtherwise it's very clumsy—have to resort to something like repeating polling— to achieve what Session 242 WWDC 2017 advocates(https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-242/?time=1628): \"when user type in Chinese for example, before users select the candidate, Spotlight engine already start to show you all the results.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Activate search bar.\r\n3. Switch to Chinese Pinyin keyboard.\r\n4. Start typing.\r\n5. Read console logs.\r\n6. Activate text view and repeat step 3~5 to see the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!VSx3WCRS!15upHSFkyt0EQxSu7eFHUWndFSabRwSxcnF3sUd0MtI"
