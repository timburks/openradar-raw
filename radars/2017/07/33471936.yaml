    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of Xcode, when the user re-indented a line with the tab key, the cursor would move to the first non-whitespace character on the line. If no there were no non-whitespace characters, the cursor would move to the point where indented text would start. Xcode 9 does not do this. \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the Tab key setting in Preferences:Text Editing:Indentation is set to “Indents always”, and the cursor is in the first column of line 2 below. \r\n\r\n1: func doSomething() {\r\n2:     let lineInQuestion = \"This one\"\r\n3:     print(lineInQuestion)\r\n4: }\r\n\r\nPressing tab in Xcode 8 (and many, many versions prior) would move the cursor to column 5 (the l in let). In Xcode 9, nothing happens. Worse still, there doesn’t appear to be a single-key shortcut that can move to the indentation point. The best one I can find is cmd-right arrow, cmd-left arrow, which is far less convenient than just hitting the tab key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode’s preferences, navigate to  Text Editing:Indentation and set the Tab key popup to “Indents always.”\r\n2. Open an Xcode 9 editing window containing Swift.\r\n3. Paste the following code:\r\n\r\nfunc doSomething() {\r\n    let lineInQuestion = \"This one\"\r\n    print(lineInQuestion)\r\n}\r\n\r\n4. Place the cursor anywhere in the leading whitespace of the line that starts with “let lineInQuestion.”\r\n5. Press the tab key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode will move the cursor to the first column containing a non-whitespace character, or if there are no whitespace characters, the first column where a non-whitespace character would occur if Xcode’s indentation rules were followed.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAgain, the Xcode 9 behavior is different than any Xcode version I can remember.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
