    description: "AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is marked as being available since macOS 10.10, and clang insists on it being used in @available(macos 10.10, *).\r\n\r\nHowever, AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer has been around as public API since 10.8. The availability annotation should be fixed.\r\n\r\nSet deployment target to 10.9, build a program that uses AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo diagnostic.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n-Wunguarded-availability gets emitted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI'm building on macOS 10.12, but that's irrelevant to this bug.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis currently requires yucky workarounds like https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/ui/accelerated_widget_mac/availability_macros.h?type=cs&q=AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer&sq=package:chromium&l=5"
