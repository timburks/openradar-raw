    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nWhen I upload to the app store using Xcode9, there is no progress bar for the upload part. This particular app takes 15 minutes to upload, in that time there's none of the usual UI affordances when uploading large payloads, such as a progress bar and/or an estimated time left.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie.  Going from an archive, through the upload, and then 15 minutes (condensed thanks to screenflow) of no feedback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be on a slow network (that is, not apple's internal network. I know that network is screaming fast)\r\n2. Have a large IPA to upload to the app store\r\n3. Submit to app store, agree to the various settings.\r\n4. It'll show that it's doing different things, then end up \"uploading to app store\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a progress bar that shows upload progress, maybe even a guesstimate of how much time is remaining.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nJust an unchanging filled-in progress bar.  Luckily activity monitor can tell me if the bytes have stopped flowing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)"
