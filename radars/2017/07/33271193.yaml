    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm not quite sure how this is happening, but I was uploading a sysdiagnose when the upload cut out suddenly. Bug Reporter offered to re-upload the attachment, but it continued failing. The JavaScript console (see screenshot) showed that it had an internal server error, then refused to accept the attachment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload a file that causes the server to error.\r\n2. Try to re-upload the file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file uploads the second time.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe file is rejected with a 400 Bad Request.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRelease 34 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 13604.1.27.0.1)"
