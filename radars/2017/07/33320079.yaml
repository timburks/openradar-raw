    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an iMessage app, the view of the MSMessagesAppViewController subclass is automatically resized by the system according to the presentationStyle (.compact or .expanded). However, the safeAreaInsets and the height in .expanded style are incorrect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample app. The app prints the frame and the safeAreaInsets of the root view in a label. The app also displays a red border within the root view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn .compact and .expanded mode, the insets should be {32, 0, 0, 44}.\nIn .expanded mode, the frame height should be 635.\nThe root view should be moved 32 pt to the top.\nThe top and bottom bar should be translucent, so that the red border is visible (blurred) behind the bars.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn .compact and .expanded mode, the insets are {0, 0, 0, 76}.\nIn .expanded mode, the frame height is be 603.\nThe root view y origin begins below the top bar.\nThe bars are opaque.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOf course Apple might decide to make one or both bars opaque, not translucent. However, the frames and safe area insets should be consistent. Right now, either in .compact or in .expanded style the height is wrong.\n\nSee also the attached, annotated screenshots within the project folder."
