    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using UIActivityViewController to share a UIActivityItemSource vending UIImage to iCloud Drive the subject returned from -[UIActivityItemSource activityViewController:subjectForActivityType:] is ignored by iCloud Drive and it always uses \"Image\" on iOS 10 and \"Image.png\" on iOS 11 as the filename.\r\n\r\nIt causes 2 issues:\r\n1. On iOS 10 image files without image file extension cannot be identified, displayed or opened as images in iCloud Drive.\r\n2. Repeated saving images using the same filename triggers \"filename exists\" alert in iCloud Drive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap share button.\r\n3. Select Add to iCloud Drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFilename uses the subject returned from -[UIActivityItemSource activityViewController:subjectForActivityType:] so that it can be customized.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe subject returned from -[UIActivityItemSource activityViewController:subjectForActivityType:] is ignored and filename is always the same.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!Mfp1haSA!aRzel_FgVeG6FQk7Mu8vtLL6t2u83oWYMEI3gldfNWc"
