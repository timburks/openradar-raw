    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you copy text from any app and paste it into Messages, it'll create a file (named \"FILE_XXXX\"; X being a digit 0-9) instead of pasting the text. The file's content is the pasted text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy text from any app (okay, that's not entirely true, I couldn't reproduce the issue from Notes, so pick e.g. Safari)\r\n2. Paste into Messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCopied text should be pasted as text into the text field in Messages\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nA file named \"FILE_XXXX\" is being created and its content is the pasted text\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2"
