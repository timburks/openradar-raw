    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the UISwitch action handler for ValueChanged changes its own `on` property it triggers the action again which is not expected since iPhone OS 2 and it is exactly against what is documented. The problem isn't observed when the property is changed outside the ValueChanged action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Open the attached project (SwitchTargetActionValue)\r\n\r\n2 - Using iOS 10, 9, 8...: touch the switch and observe \"Changes: 1\" (the action is triggered once, as it expected).\r\n\r\n3 - Using iOS 11.0b3 (15A5318g): touch the switch and observe \"Changes: 2\" (the action is triggered twice, which is a problem)\r\n\r\n4 - Notice the behavior isn't observed then \"Change\" (button) changes the `on` property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiswitch/1623686-seton?language=objc\r\n\r\n\"Setting the switch to either position does not result in an action message being sent.\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nExactly the opposite of \"Setting the switch to either position does not result in an action message being sent.\".\r\n\r\nWhen the `on` property is changed within the ValueChanged action it is triggering the action changing a pretty old behavior.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0b3 (15A5318g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/t278os7dixtdmr1/Radar-33453656.zip?dl=0"
