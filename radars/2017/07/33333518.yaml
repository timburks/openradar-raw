    description: "Summary:\r\nI send a lot of things to myself via mail, either as todos or to work through them later. I usually do so by using the system share sheet. The issue I'm encountering is that the suggestion picker for contacts never shows my address at the top, even though the number of mails sent to this address is significantly larger than to any other contact in that list, by several orders of magnitude. And if I do send a mail to someone with a name or email address similar to my email address even once, it is shown at the top of that list for the coming months. Is there anything I can do to influence the sorting in that list? It seems to be sorted after mail activity, just not relating to my own address.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send several mails to your address from the same address.\n2. Send a single mail to someone else with a similar name or email address.\n3. Try sending a mail to yourself by typing the first few letters of your address.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour address is shown either at the top or at least near the top.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYour address is shown below several other results, never at the top.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 and previous\r\n\r\nNotes:"
