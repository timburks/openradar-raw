    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33614458\n\nIf a UIDatePicker's .datePickerMode is set to .countDownTimer, it will not send any actions the first time the user changes the picker's value. However, starting with the second value change, actions are sent as expected henceforth.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a UIDatePicker to have .datePickerMode = .countDownTimer (either in Interface Builder or programmatically)\r\n2. Add a handler to the date picker's valueChanged event (either in IB or programmatically)\r\n<compile and run>\r\n3. Change the value of the date picker: observe that the handler is not called\r\n4. Change the value of the date picker again: observe that the handler IS called\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the valueChanged event to be sent the FIRST time that the value of the date picker is changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value changed handler is not called until the second time the value of the date picker is changed (step 4).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInteresting side note: if the .datePickerMode is NOT .countDownTimer, then the valueChanged handler will be called, as expected, on the first value change.\r\n\r\nA web search for this behavior does seem to turn up that it has been present since iOS 7 (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20181980)"
