Open the summary view for it.\r\n3. Hover over a storage category on the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe arrow for the popup doesn't overlap with its content.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe arrow overlaps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.7.0.48\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from the last version of iTunes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
