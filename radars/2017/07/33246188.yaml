    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a moderately large Objective-C Xcode workspace with 2 projects depending on each other. Very often, Xcode seem to hang in \"Indexing | Processing files\" and takes 200% CPU for 24h straight on. This reduces battery life from 8 to 2 hours :-(\n\nClearing Derived Data does not seem to help\n\nRegression:\n\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode with a large Objective-C project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Indexing stops after a while; Xcode does not turn the MacBook into a CPU cycle burning device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. \"Indexing | Processing files\" runs on forever\n2. Xcode using 200% CPU for 24h straight on\n3. Depleted battery within an hour or two\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happened occasionally in Xcode 7, but almost always in Xcode 8.  Apple Engineering closed said this issue was fixed and that I should file a new bug report if it still happens, so here I am. Please don't close mindlessly again."
