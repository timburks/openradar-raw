    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Quoting Text radio in Preferences seems to have a different aliasing setting; while the others appear to be subpixel aliased; \"Include all of the original message text\" and \"Included selected text, if any; otherwise include all text\" are not. See attached screenshot (I would recommend zooming in).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Preferences.\r\n2. Go to the Composing tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll of the text is aliased the same way.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n\"Include all of the original message text\" and \"Included selected text, if any; otherwise include all text\" are aliased differently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
