    description: "Summary:\r\nCmd+B, Cmd+I, Cmd+U are extremely common shortcuts for rich text editing, and are supported throughout most Apple apps.\r\n\r\nBeta 3 fixed them not working at all, including non-conventional contenteditable contexts. However, after Cmd+B-ing to bold text, Cmd+B-ing again does not un-bold\r\n\r\n(Related to <rdar://problem/32996837>, <rdar://problem/32996750>.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit on editor on squarespace.com.\r\n  - Sorry, I don't have a login. Was only able to reproduce here, not on http://xing.github.io/wysihtml5/ or http://ckeditor.com like other contenteditable tickets.\r\n2. Tap on any text on the page\r\n3. Select text using the caret\r\n4. Tap Cmd+B on a hardware keyboard.\r\n4. Tap Cmd+B on a hardware keyboard again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText is bolded, then un-bolded.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nText is bolded, but not un-bolded. Text is bolded, then un-bolded on Mac Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 Beta 3 (15A5318g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5‚Äù, 1st generation"
