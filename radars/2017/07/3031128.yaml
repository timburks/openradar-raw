    description: "In iOS 10 on iPad there were 2 columns of widgets.\r\nIn iOS 11 there is only one big centered column.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the iPad's bigger screens, that behavior should revert to what iOS 10 had.\r\n\r\nRight now it's just a waste of space in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if you see this,\r\nFilippo"
