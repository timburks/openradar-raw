    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33547693\r\n\r\nIn beta 4 there is a regression in MapKit where overlays are not being rendered. I noticed this in my own app where Polylines and MKOverlays are no longer showing up (only annotations seem to work), leaving me with basically a blank map.\r\n\r\nThe code was unchanged on my end, and has worked fine since iOS 8. It also worked fine in iOS11b3. I confirmed the regression is not specific to my app by trying to run the KMLViewer sample code (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/KMLViewer/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010046).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Download the KMLViewer sample code at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/KMLViewer/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010046\r\n2) Run it on device or through the simulator for iOS 11 b4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhat is displayed should be the same as what is seen in iOS 10 - a pin annotation with multiple overlays of different colors surrounding it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the pin annotation is visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn my testing of iOS 11 b4 I did notice that the overlays do eventually render if you zoom the map out with a punch gesture. But without interacting with the map, the never render."
