    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe documentation for the method playableContentManager:didUpdateContext: on MPPlayableContentDelegate says the following regarding the context param: \"context – The previous context of the content manager before the change.\"\r\n\r\nFrom my investigation this isn't the case, the context passed in is actually the current/new context. It's easy to confirm this by just checking that the other param, 'contentManager', context and seeing they are both pointing to the exact same object in memory.\r\n\r\nThe first param 'contentManager' has a context property that is equal to the second param 'context' passed in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a CarPlay enabled app set a break point in playableContentManager:didUpdateContext: in the app's MPPlayableContentDelegate.\r\nConnect/disconnect to a CarPlay head unit.\r\nIn the debugger po contentManager.context and context and notice they are the exact same object.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe context passed in should be the previous context before the updates. Just as the docs specify: \"context – The previous context of the content manager before the change.\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe context param is the current/new context value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.3"
