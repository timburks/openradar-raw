    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter updating watchOS 4.0 beta 3 the vitals data points (heart rate) stopped being automatically saved to Health (HK). Two devices (Series 0) reproduced the issue, one device (Series 2) didn't reproduce the issue. When the Heart app (Watch) is used explicitly, it saves the data points correctly. The constant (10 min) background save doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Update a Series 0 device (MJ3N2FD/A, MJ3T2VC/A) to watchOS 4.0 beta 3.\r\n2 - Check HK data points: Health app, Source, Devices, Watch, Vitals.\r\n3 - Notice that explicit measures work fine: use Heart app (Watch) and it immediately writes the data points.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshots: Jul 16, 9:43 AM and 4:42 PM was explicit measurements. Background (10 mins) measures is missing. Also, when a Workout is started/finished using the native Watch app, it doesn't save the heart rate data points associated to the Workout session.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth background/automatic (10 min) heart rate is required for many activities (like sleep tracking using AutoSleep and other apps). Also, Workout sessions should associate heart rate data. Observed using Series 0 devices.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBackground/Automatic (10 min) heart rate is missing, breaking many apps. Also, Workouts are not associating heart rate. Observed using Series 0 devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 4b3 (15R5321h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo HK diagnostics (HealthKit_Logging_Instructions__Watch.pdf) was found. Still waiting for some sync.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
