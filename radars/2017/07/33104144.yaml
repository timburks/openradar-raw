    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m hunting down a retain cycle based on some blocks that strongly maintain my object and __NSObserver is in the middle. Unfortunately there’s zero debug output in there. I can use _ivarDescription but not everyone will know that trick and it takes extra time. This object should have a nice description (or at least a debugDescription) telling me what it maintains.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAny code that uses the self addObserverForName:notificationName object:object queue:queue usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) API on NSNotificationCenter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInternal management object should be more descriptive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInternal management object only prints it’s pointer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo sample needed, open the source for __NSObserver and see that description is simply not implemented.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/881813334936432641"
