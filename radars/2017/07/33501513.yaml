    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33501166\n\nWhen attempting to download our app on iOS 11 over LTE, you get the warning that the app is over 100mbs and that it cannot be downloaded over LTE, even though it can be downloaded over LTE on iOS 10.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable WiFi on an iOS 11 device\n2. Navigate to the App Store\n3. Download the Lyft app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app downloads fine over LTE as it does on iOS 10\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt warns that it cannot be downloaded over LTE and must be downloaded over WiFi.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is happening to us on various different hardware including the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 7+. We're assuming that it is using the incorrect value to determine if it can be downloaded over LTE. Also note the size displayed in the app store on the iPhone 6 is 98.1 mbs (which as far as we know is the uncompressed size)."
