    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSwitching between files causes the Inspector window's \"Stationary Pad\" and \"Locked\" checkboxes to shift up, eventually covering the text above it and causing the section to shrink. See attached screenshot (taken after the section has collapsed completely) and video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Inspector.\r\n2. Switch between two files quickly while the Inspector is open.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is no change in the layout.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe \"Stationary Pad\" and \"Locked\" checkboxes move up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from macOS Sierra, I believe.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
