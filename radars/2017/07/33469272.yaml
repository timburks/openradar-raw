    description: "Area:\r\nWatch Faces\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nChecking the time in Power Reserve mode by pressing either the side button or the Digital Crown takes longer than it should. I'd like to see this delay shortened because it makes it inconvenient to check the time on my watch when it is in this mode (as opposed to, say, pulling out my phone).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press either the side button or the Digital Crown in Power Reserve mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe time appears in under a second (like iPhone does!)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe time takes 3-4 seconds to appear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport Series 2 running watchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)"
