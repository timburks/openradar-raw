    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nParallels Desktop as a virtualiser requires kernel extensions.\r\nI had whitelisted them after upgrading to High Sierra.\r\nThe Parallels team has coded a dialogue that will appear when the kernel extensions cannot be loaded.\r\nThey then suppose the user has to unblock them in the System Preferences, Security section.\r\nBut in my case, this is not true – I have shown their code signature, copied their team ID (which is Parallels’ unique identifier in the Apple universe), whitelisted it in Recovery mode using ‘spctl kext-consent add 4C6364ACXT’, rebooted – same error in Parallels still. Then I again booted in recovery mode, this time disabling consent mode entirely ‘spctl kext-consent disable’, but after reboot Parallels still tells me that error.\r\nSo in fact it’s Parallels Desktop having incompatible kernel extensions that cannot be loaded in Developer Beta 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run macOS Sierra.\r\n2. Install Parallels Desktop 12.2.1.\r\n3. Upgrade to High Sierra Developer Beta 3.\r\n4. When prompted, whitelist Parallels Desktop team ID in System Preferences.\r\n5. Upgrade to High Sierra Developer Beta 4.\r\n6. Start Parallels Desktop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nParallels Desktop should start.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nParallels Desktop fails to load kexts and tells the user to unblock them, which has already been done.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Developer Beta 4 (17A315i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving Parallels Desktop and reinstalling it does not resolve the issue.\r\nRunning 'spctl kext-consent add 4C6364ACXT' in Recovery Mode does not resolve the issue.\r\nRunning 'spcrl kext-consent disable' in Recovery Mode does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nParallels Desktop 12.2.1\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\r\nAPFS"
