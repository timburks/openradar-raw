    description: "Summary:\r\nThe dates provided under apps listed under iPad storage should show the time they were last used, which is how it is marked. In actuality, that is wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings > iPad Storage on an iPad running the iOS 11 beta. \r\nScroll down until you see a list of applications and when they were last used\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dates shown should reflect when those applications were last opened.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe dates do not match. Instead, I believe it is currently showing modified date, or when the app was last updated. There are some that I used tonight, such as Photos, that are showing a last used date of May 31. Others show that they were used last week when I havenâ€™t used them In months.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens in iOS 11 beta 2 update 1 on iPad Air 2\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nJuly 13 2017, 9:36 PM\r\n- Still happening in iOS 11 beta 3\r\n\r\nJuly 24 2017, 11:18 AM\r\n- Confirmed that bug still exists in iOS 11 beta 4"
