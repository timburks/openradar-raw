    description: Both these 2 delegate methods are called "when a drag enters the view"/"when the drag enters the interaction's view". It causes duplicate works and unclear phase separation. I believe it is better if only sessionDidEnter is called "when a drag enters the view" and sessionDidUpdate is called only for updates while drag is inside the view.
