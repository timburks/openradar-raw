    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33584082\n\nCurrently if you attempt to make an IBInspectable with a type that isn't supported, you can successfully compile your projects with no errors at build time or runtime (unless you actually attempt to use the field). It would be nice if Xcode warned you so that you could only create IBInspectables of types that are supported.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Add an IBInspectable of type UIFont\n3. Build the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt build time there is a warning / error because UIFont is not currently a valid IBInspectable (rdar://problem/33583836)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can build and everything appears to be valid.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
