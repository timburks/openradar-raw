    description: "Summary:\r\nNow that static libraries with Swift targets are supported as part of Xcode 9 beta 4, it would be nice if there was a language dropdown when adding a new static library target where you could select Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new static library project\r\n2. Attempt to create it starting with Swift sources\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can choose Swift from a language dropdown like other targets\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can only create Objective-C targets and you must delete the Objective-C files and add your own Swift files\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
