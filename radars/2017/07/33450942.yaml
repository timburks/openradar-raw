    description: "Summary:\r\nHello, I've faced some strange behavior using iPad Pro with Apple Smart Keyboard case. In native 'Notes' app if I press one of these symbols: (' \" ` ~), it selects with semi-blue background, but then if I hold some another key (let it be 'a' character) I get this output: \" `a`a`a`a`a` \". Previous character (one of four I've mentioned) repeats with next character.\r\nPlease, could you approve this is a bug? I really doubt this is expected behavior but if so, how can I disable this in my app?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Apple Smart Keyboard case\r\n1. Open \"Notes\" application.\r\n2. Create note.\r\n3. Start typing.\r\n4. Type '  \" `  or ~ symbol\r\n5. Hold any other key (letter, digit or space)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRepeating symbol from step 5 is expected.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nRepeats symbols from 4 and 5 steps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Pro 12.9-inch Wi-Fi (and other iPads)\r\nApple Smart Keyboard case\r\niOS 11 Public Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCannot reproduce it with the software keyboard."
