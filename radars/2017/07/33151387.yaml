    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen displaying Odia (Oriya) text with an OpenType (instead of AAT) font, the existence of a reph (either introduced by typing or toor changing the font from and AAT one to an OpenType one) leads to application crashing.\r\n\r\nReph: The above base mark formed by the sequence <U+0B30 ORIYA LETTER RA, U+0B4D ORIYA SIGN VIRAMA> when preceding another consonant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install the \"NotoSansOriya-Regular.ttf\" font.\r\n- Open the \"test case.rtf\" file in TextEdit.\r\n- Change the font of the Odia text in the first line from \"Oriya Sangam MN\" (system AAT font) to \"Noto Sans Oriya\" (OpenType font), or remove the space between the two pieces of Odia text from the third line (already set to \"Noto Sans Oriya\").\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe edits should happen normally.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nTextEdit crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\"NotoSansOriya-Regular.ttf\" is a typical OpenType Odia font from: http://google.com/get/noto/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nChange the font of the second line (an additional character follows the reph-ed Indic cluster) to \"Noto Sans Oriya\" doesn't make TextEdit crash."
