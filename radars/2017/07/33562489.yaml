    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33551364\n\nScreen Recording is a beautiful new feature of iOS 11\r\n…except for the \"stop recording\" dialogs, the video dingle berries of screen recording.\r\n\r\nSince most people already spend time to do this manually and there is the technical ability to automagically improve it: Screen Recording should automatically trim out these dialogs when they're used to stop the screen recording, as well as trim Control Center (CC) opening when it is used solely to stop the recording (other interactions in CC would cancel the trimming in the case that the target of recording in CC itself).\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart a Screen Recording.\r\nStop the Screen Recording either by tapping the blue status bar or by opening Control Center and tapping the stop button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe recorded videos are trimmed to remove \"screen recording chrome\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe recorded videos leave the endings untrimmed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same smart trimming could be applied to the start of videos too!\r\nThe recording would then start as soon as Control Center (CC) finishes closing. Obviously some people may want to record something within CC so interacting with any elements before closing CC would invalidate trimming the beginning of the recording. \r\n\r\nThe \"3…2…1… countdown solves a lot of UX problems since it's clear to most people what's going on and gives enough time to close CC but still leaves most people manually trimming their videos. By reverting to the old UI and showing the pulsing record indicator immediately but trimming the video to when control center is closed (granted the user doesn't interact with anything else in CC) would both clearly indicate to the user what's happening and save users time trimming and space on their devices.\r\n\r\nAttached video: https://d26dzxoao6i3hh.cloudfront.net/items/1M1Z1m0T2H043Q0z242I/ScreenRecordingWithStinger.MP4"
