    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI noticed xcode9 deleting stuff unexpectedly when editing today.  I managed to track this down to:\r\n\r\n* double-click a word to select\r\n* immediately type after the click\r\n* extra text (a newline in this case) gets selected after the initial selection goes away, and then gets deleted on the next keystroke.\r\n\r\nSee movie at https://www.dropbox.com/s/redacted/double-click-selection.mp4?dl=0\r\n\r\nThere's a massively slowed down section that shows what's going on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is very timing dependent.\r\n\r\n* double click a word to select it\r\n* immediately start typing after releasing the mouse button. As in scalosian-water fast.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* the word is highlighted\r\n* typing commences\r\n* the word disappears and is replaced with new typing\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n* the word is highlighted\r\n* typing commences\r\n* the word disappears and is replaced with the first letter\r\n* the next character (or the next newline) gets unexpectedly selected \r\n* the next letter typed deletes this new selection\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDidn't recall having this problem with the old xcode8 editor."
