    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9 has been awesome. The new source editor is so great and everything is much snappier and faster. Thanks for all the new things! There is one easily reproducible freeze though:\r\n\r\nWhen currently having a placeholder in your code in the source code editor (the ones that show up for the parameter if you autocomplete a method name), and then right click on the class name > refactor > rename, Xcode freezes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Inside a class, add a method with a parameter through autocompletion\r\n- Donâ€™t fill out the parameters but leave the placeholders untouched\r\n- Right click the class name\r\n- refactor > rename\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new awesome refactoring UI opens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode freezes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached zip is a sample project and a screencast showing the issue."
