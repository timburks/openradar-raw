    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently, when I'm designing Auto Layout constraints in Interface Builder, I'd like to create a constraint that's initialized with a constant value of 0.\r\n\r\nCurrently, IB assigns AL constraints with a constant value that mimics the existing placement of the subview. It would be helpful to have a keyboard shortcut to suppress this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe easiest example of this is when I want to create a subview to be pinned along the edges of its parent view. This is something I frequently do, as content views are a common view architecture pattern.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I create a set of constraints for all of the subview's edges, all 4 constraints will be created with a non-zero constant value and I have to manually reconfigure each constraint with a constant value of 0.\r\n\r\nThis requires a few seconds of dedicated interactions to correct and is disruptive to a streamlined workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. In Interface Builder, create a view with a subview\r\n1. Control + Click and drag from within the subview to the parent view to open the Auto Layout constraint menu\r\n2. While holding Shift, select 'Leading Space to Container', 'Trailing Space...', 'Top Space...', and 'Bottom Space...'\r\n3. Click 'Add Constraints'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI am able to hold a modifier key (Control, Option, etc) while clicking 'Add Constraints' to force all constraints to initialize to a constant value of 0\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI am unable to hold a modifier key (Control, Option, etc) while clicking 'Add Constraints' to force all constraints to initialize to a constant value of 0"
