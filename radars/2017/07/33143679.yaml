    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the traditional UISearchController from a UITableView.tableHeaderView, the search field is positioned incorrectly when search is activated. This is especially noticeable in landscape. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the sample app https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/TableSearch_UISearchController/Introduction/Intro.html\r\nActivate search in landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSame UI as in iOS 10 with the search field vertically centered in the search bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch field is shifted several points to the top.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere's no API remedy to fix this. While there's searchFieldBackgroundPositionAdjustment, this doesn't fix the position of the Cancel button."
