    description: "Area:\r\nCore Graphics\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen doing any operation that's drawing an image, within a rect, either by way of CGContextDrawImage or UIImage drawInRect, the operation takes over 1 second under any of the iOS 11 betas that have been released to date. Under iOS 10.3.1 these operations take under .01 seconds to complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen running the following code with any given \"tileImage\":\r\n\r\n UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(contextSize, YES, 1.0);\r\n\r\n// use this\r\nCGContextDrawImage(UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(), drawInRect, _tileImage.CGImage);\r\n//   or this         [_tileImage drawInRect:drawInRect blendMode:kCGBlendModeNormal alpha:1.0];\r\n\r\n _tileImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();\r\nUIGraphicsEndImageContext();\r\n\r\nWhen run under iOS 10.3.1 this operation executes in less than .01 seconds. When the same code is run on any of the released iOS 11 betas this operation takes more than a second to execute. This is reproducible in the simulator or on a device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the CGContextDrawImage or UIImage drawInRect operations execute within a similar timeframe on iOS 11 as they do under iOS 10.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is a significant decrease in performance under iOS 11\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS beta 1, 2 or 3"
