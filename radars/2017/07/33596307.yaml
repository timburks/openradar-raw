    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is one of my favorite features of Terminal.app: https://twitter.com/simjp/status/890643918412423170\n\nHowever, as soon as I change the active window on macOS, the pane disappears, thus making multi-window uses of the process info pane impossible.\n\nEven when I change the active tab from within Terminal.app, the info pane immediately switches to display the process & child processes of the newly activated pane, making it impossible to keep “tabs” ;) on the family of processes I care about.\n\nFor example, I often want to keep the info pane visible on my leftmost monitor while I do other work in the window in my rightmost monitor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal.app\n2. Press command-I to toggle the Info pane\n3. Change the active window to something else (i.e. Finder, Safari, etc.)\n\nOR\n\n1. Open Terminal.app\n2.
