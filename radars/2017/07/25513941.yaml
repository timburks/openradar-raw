    description: "A particular source file causes the Swift compiler to crash when building the project.  The file references some types (both enums and classes) that are included from Objective-C header files and then extended in Swift.\r\n\r\nThe crash occurs when type-checking the following statement:\r\n\r\n            x = bounds.maxX - cardWidth - border - (gui.handVisible[player]) ? x_offset : 0"
