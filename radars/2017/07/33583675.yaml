    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently there is no official way to add placeholder text to a NSTextView. But there is a private property called `placeholderAttributedString` that provides the expected behavior. It would be nice if this was public (and possible have a variant that was just a NSString, not a NSAttributedString)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new macOS app in Xcode\r\n2. Add a NSTextView\r\n3. Attempt to set placeholder text for the text view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is an easy way to do this like the\x04 `placeholderString` and `placeholderAttributedString` properties from `NSTextField`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a private API for this, but nothing public.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
