    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Watch fails to vibrate for mirrored notifications that have sound disabled for notifications on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) On the iPhone, open the Settings app, go to Notifications, open the settings for a specified third-party app, and flip the Sounds toggle off for it.\r\n2) On the iPhone, open the Watch app, go to Notifications, and make sure the specified app's notifications are being mirrored from the iPhone to the Apple Watch.\r\n3) On the Apple Watch, slide up to reveal the Control Center and make sure the Apple Watch is not muted. Make sure you also receive vibrations and sounds.\r\n4) Lastly, with the iPhone locked, and the Apple Watch on your wrist unlocked, receive a notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you receive a notification, you should still feel a vibration even if the Sounds option is switched off on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen you receive a notification, there is no vibration to indicate that you received a notification when the Sound option is switched off on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 4.0 (15R5331g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be beneficial if instead of fixing this bug, we had the ability to have detailed configurations for Apple Watch notifications in the Watch app like we do in the Settings app for the iPhone.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf you have vibrations turned off, or have the Apple Watch muted, you will not notice the issue."
