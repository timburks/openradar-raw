    description: "(I do not know the actual description as I didn't write this report, but the gist of it is as follows:)\r\n\r\nThe attribute ATTR_CMNEXT_LINKID is similar to ATTR_CMN_FILEID in that it identifies a directory item (file, folder etc.) by a 64 bit node ID. The difference between both is that if the item is hard-linked, ATTR_CMN_FILEID identifies the targeted file, whereas ATTR_CMNEXT_LINKID identifies the link itself, making it possible for searchfs() to return all the hard links to a single file."
