    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn case a line accidentally ends in a double semicolon `;;´ in Localizable.strings, this breaks localization in the app. In Xcode, however, this error is not reported.\r\nIn contrast to other kinds of syntax errors, no warning, error or other kind of hint is displayed - neither inline (while editing), nor at compile time.\r\nIf an error like this happens, then the app won't be properly localized - instead, all localizations following the line ending with `;;´ will be ignored in the language affected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA sample project can be found here: https://github.com/lla01/radar-double-semicolon-in-localizable-strings\r\n\r\n1. Open the project\r\n2. In the settings for Scheme/Edit Scheme/Options select 'Application Language: English', 'Application Region: USA'\r\n3. Run in simulator\r\n==> Observe that texts are displayed properly localized\r\n\r\n4. Now change language and region to German / Germany\r\n5. Re-build and run in simulator\r\n==> Observe that the second string is not properly localized.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should display a warning, a compile time error, or any other hint that the Localized.strings file for German as syntax issues\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo hint displayed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n\r\niOS: n/a (not relevant)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote, that in the Localized.strings for German the first line ends in a double semicolon `;;´\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways happens when there is a line ending in a double semicolon `;;´ in Localized.strings"
