    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able in Interface Builder (Storyboard) or Xib) to take an existing UISlider and demote it to a UIView without having to delete and recreate.\r\n\r\nMy use case - I have an existing UISlider in a complex configuration (constraints, etc), and I want to replace it with a MPVolumeView. To do that, I have to add the MPVolumeView to a plain old view.   Right now, attempting to change the class of the slider to UIView is being rejected, requiring a lot of surgery to the interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. drag a UISlider into a view\r\n2. select slider\r\n3. Go to the command-option-3 panel\r\n4. Type UIView in the \"Class\" textfield and press return\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. Class changes to UIView, existing constraints are preserved. Things like UIControl connections get purged\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n5. class textfield is cleared, and retains \"UISlider\" as the prompt text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)"
