    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode is unable to debug my macOS apps sometimes because it appears that the process of attaching to the app is causing it to hang. This makes it impossible to attach the debugger to apps in any way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run an app.\r\n2. Wait for Xcode to say that it is \"running\" the app.\r\n3. Kill lldb-rpc-server.\r\n4. Wait for lldb-rpc-server to relaunch.\r\n5. Try to attach to the app's process.\r\n6. Kill lldb-rpc-server.\r\n7. Quit the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLLDB successfully attaches at steps 2 and 5 and the app continues running as usual.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAt step 2, the app does not appear to launch (in actuality it's likely hung up by the attaching process before it can spawn a window).\r\nAt step 3 the app finally \"launches\" and runs as normal, however the debugger is not attached.\r\nAt step 5 the app hangs.\r\nAt step 6 the app recovers and behaves normally.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)/macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think this is a regression from the last beta, since I don't remember this being an issue before.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
