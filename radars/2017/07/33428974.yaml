    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are an MDM vendor and one of our education customers is providing to their students iPads and apps - at the end of the 3 years students keep iPads, books and apps.\nThey are currently using VPP codes so they can permanently assign apps to student personal apple ids, but vpp codes are more complicated to use - you don’t know in advance if code is still available, or if the apple id has already the license.\nIt would be great to have an option when assigning licenses to do it permanently (similar to what happens with book) as they don’t want to bother with licenses once the students are gone.\n\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe talked about this issue with Alexandre Morin (alexmorin@apple.com) if you need more details."
