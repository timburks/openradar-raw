    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 adds the new great Siri voices, but those are not yet available to developers using AVSpeechSynthesizer.\r\n\r\nExpect my application to be able to read a text aloud using the new voices, but they're not available from the list yet.\r\nOnly very old and metallic ones are present.\r\n\r\nThe final user has the ability to download additional voices from Settings app, but even doing so only the old and rusty ones are listed. I'm considering this a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet all the available voices with\r\n`AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices()`\r\ncycle through them to find the new one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new new voices should be selectable by the user.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOnly old and metallic ones are available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEvery device. I.E. iPhone 7"
