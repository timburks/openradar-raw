    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen embedding images via `cid` received via an Apple Mail Client, the images break layouts in small preview panes when the image is larger then what is actually displayed (a.k.a. Retina Images which are twice the size of the display dimensions).\r\n\r\nWhen serving images remotely, this does not occur.\r\n\r\nPlease see screenshots attach to my StackOverflow Post where I provide a simplified example, too:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45347978/bug-in-apple-mails-embedded-retina-image-handling-or-my-source\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend a mail with embedded images e.g. 500x50px which are going to be display at 250x25px (via css). When the preview pane is smaller than 500x50px the layout is broken when the image is embedded, as Apple Mail still uses the real dimension to calculate the layout instead of the display dimensions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo display differenced between embedded and remotely served images.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe layout is broken, i.e. the image overflows the surrounding table.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6"
