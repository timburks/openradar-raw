    description: "Using a 3D Touch to switch to a background app, followed by a swipe from left to right to go back the view stack, leaves a persistent, cropped overlay of the view navigating to.\r\n\r\nI have been able to reproduce the steps that show the visual glitch and potentially the cropping at the x,y.\r\nI have not been able to reproduce the actual cropped, persistent overlay. A screenshot has been attached that demonstrates what it looks like.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen WWDC app under the \"Schedule\" tab (or any other app with a navigation controller as the root)\r\nPush one view into the stack\r\nOpen Messages\r\nSelect the option to attach/take a photo from the camera\r\n3D Touch swipe from left to right to switch to the WWDC app\r\nSwipe to go back to the root of the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSee attached video followed by the screenshot of \"that one time\" that lead to the cropped overlay.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo not have a persistent cropped overlay of the view.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is a cropped overlay of the view (see IMG_1297.png) that is persistent while navigating between the other views in the tabbar.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the screenshot, the \"Videos\" tab is selected. The cropped, persistent overlay of the view under the \"Schedule\" tab at the time of the \"swipe left to right to go back\" is also visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2 (14F89)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zwft8lrtnsehqbk/IMG_1297.png?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/huuctwu2vcuoog6/1297.mp4?dl=0"
