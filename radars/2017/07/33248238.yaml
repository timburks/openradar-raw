    description: "Running any XCUI tests on device crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 9.0 beta 3.\r\n2. Create a new single-view iOS application project. Be sure to include UI tests.\r\n3. Run the testExample UI test on a device.\r\n4. Observe that the UI test runner crashes in -[XCTRunnerIDESession initWithTransport:]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI tests should run successfully and exit cleanly on the device.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe runner crashes reliably.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 3 (9M174d)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis looks like a method call on an invalid pointer, because the crash isn't often the same between two separate runs. Sometimes it invokes unknown selectors, sometimes it calls random functions, etc. As requested, I attached the session crash log, but this should be easily repeatable.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have seen this issue on an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.3.2 (14F89)."
