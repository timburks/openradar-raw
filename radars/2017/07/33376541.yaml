    description: "Summary:\r\nNSToolbarItem should conform to NSUserInterfaceItemIdentification. At the moment writing actions is made more difficult by having to handle NSToolbarItem identifiers separately. Instead currently NSToolbarItem has it's own \"itemIdentifier\" property.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to write an @IBAction that can be triggered with sender conforming to NSUserInterfaceItemIdentification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSToolbarItem can use the action\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNSToolbarItem cannot use the action because it does not conform to NSUserInterfaceItemIdentification"
