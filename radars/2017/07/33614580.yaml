    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dragging a link from a web view or text view, the drag preview is shown centred on the centre of the touch. This means your finger can cover much of the dragged item making it hard to read. It’s nice to be able to read the URL of a dragged link so you know what you’re dropping. You could also long press to get the action sheet and see where the link goes, then drag it but that’s more work.\n\nIn most cases the drag preview looks the same as the original view being dragged, so it’s not desirable to ensure it appears above the finger because (1) you don’t want to move the drag preview relative to the touch because it should feel like direct interaction and (2) the dragged item might be big. These are not the case for links because the drag preview has a completely different appearance from the link in the source view and is of a limited number of lines so the height is somewhat constrained.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a web page in Safari.\n2. Start dragging a link on the page or the address in the bar at the top\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLink text and URL should be visible above finger\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLink text and URL are obscured by finger\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
