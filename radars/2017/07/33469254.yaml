    description: "Area:\r\nWorkout\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRecently, I've noticed that swimming workouts, almost immediately after initiation, will have some distance already \"measured\". This distance seems to be around 1-2K yards and will mess up the pace calculation as well. Other than this, distance is accumulated correctly throughout the workout (i.e. the distance value will be correct other than the fact that it is offset by a (constant) couple thousand yards). Upon completion the distance shown in the summary will be the correct value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a swimming workout.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe distance value starts from 0.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe distance value already has a value that's in the range of a couple thousand yards.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport Series 2 running watchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)"
