    description: "When a generic class is used in an app the init method above returns a path to the App's bundle with '/Frameworks' appended which means the generic class is unable to load any assets that are included in the framework where that generic class is defined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample project that has two classes in a framework called 'Example'. The two classes return an image loaded out of the Example framework's bundle.\r\nNotice that the generic class returns an unexpected bundle that doesn't exist.\r\nNotice the non generic class works as expected and correctly gets the Example framework's bundle and is able to load the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should get the correct bundle for a given generic class when using it from a different framework or app.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app's bundle plus '/Frameworks' appended is return as the bundle's path. In this example Bundle(for: type(of: self)):\r\n\r\nFor generic classes, returns a bundle that points to 'BundleBug.app/Frameworks'.\r\nFor non generic classes, returns a bundle that points correctly to 'Example.framework'.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 Beta 3, 15A5318g\r\n\r\nSample project:\r\nhttps://github.com/gspiers/radar_33450609"
