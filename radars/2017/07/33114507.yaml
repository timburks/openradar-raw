    description: "iOS 11 beta 2, iPad Pro 10.5\" Simulator, landscape orientation.\r\n\r\nWhen presenting a view controller modally with the formSheet presentation style, the presented view's frame does not update to reflect the formSheet's vertical keyboard-avoiding motion in the UIKeyboardWillShow notification. It does reflect the change in Y during the UIKeyboardDidShow notification.\r\n\r\nThis means that it is not possible to keyboard avoidance in sync with the keyboard presentation. \r\n\r\nI'd expect for the presented view's frame to reflect its new position in the UIKeyboardWillShow callback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see the attached sample project for a reproduction. Run it on the iPad Pro 10.5\" iOS 11 Simulator in LANDSCAPE orientation. Tap the buttons and view the console output to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nformSheet's frame excludes change in Y.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nformSheet's frame should reflect change in Y during UIKeyboardWillShow notification.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2\r\nXcode 9 beta 2\r\niOS 11 simulator, iPad Pro 10.5\" Landscape"
