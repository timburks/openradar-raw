    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen installing a configuration profile that has a .der type Organisational CA as a certificate payload, a message appears during the installation process advising the installation failed as the certificate appears to be invalid.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Apple Configurator 2\r\nPlug iPad in\r\nSelect iPad in Apple Configurator 2\r\nDrag the mobileconfig profile onto the iPad in Apple Configurator 2 to install the profile.\r\nOn the iPad, go through the onscreen steps to install the profile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven though the certificate is a SHA1 type, the profile with the Organisational CA should be installed as per https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207459\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe profile is not installed, an error message appears advising that the certificate \"file.der\" appears to be invalid.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11/15A5304i\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not occur for an iOS device running iOS 10.x.x using the same profile.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note - this issue also occurs in macOS 10.13, it is _very_ likely that SHA1 certificates are now deprecated in iOS 11 and macOS 10.13"
