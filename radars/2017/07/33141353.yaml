    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's Open Quickly, when invoked while the documentation window is open, usually does not show project-specific results (i.e. it only includes frameworks). In Xcode 9, however, it will mix in results from the last viewed project as well. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project.\r\n2. Open the Documentation and API Reference window.\r\n3. Invoke Open Quicklyâ€¦\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe results are only from the standard library and frameworks.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe results include matches from the project.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)/macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
