    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #28260275\n\nMaking apps for macOS is currently quite a bit harder than making apps for iOS, mainly because AppKit has a lot of limitations and intricacies caused by its old age.\r\n\r\nRecently I've been investigating UXKit (a private framework used by the Photos app on macOS, and also by the Pricing app). It looks like a really good compatibility layer between UIKit's APIs and AppKit's. I think any iOS developer would feel at home using it.\r\n\r\nI have detailed my findings and the reasoning behind these thoughts on this article: https://medium.com/@guilhermerambo/why-uikit-for-macos-is-important-ff4e74a82cf0#.xsycfej4e\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen, the framework is really stable and its API is quite good, I don't see any reason why it couldn't be made public. This would allow more iOS developers to write macOS apps and bring more innovation and quality to the platform.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCompare the work required to write an iOS app and a similar macOS app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaking apps for macOS should be as easy as making apps for iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMaking apps for macOS is extremely difficult for those who are only used to writing iOS apps, mainly because of AppKit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:"
