    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are an MDM vendor and some education customers are confused with 0-touch Apple tv deployment - when they activate the device, it asks to pair the remote, which stops auto advance setup.\n\nIt would be nice to make it clear in the documentation that the remote should not be paired at this point to benefit from the 0-touch setup.\n\nSee “Education Deployment Guide” on iTunes:\n\n“Zero-touch Apple TV deployment\nNow it’s easy to deploy Apple TV with MDM and fully configure it by simply plugging in power and an Ethernet connection. This is helpful for setting up Apple TV in classrooms, conference rooms, and registration desks without any user action. MDM can set the name of the Apple TV and install configuration profiles to fully configure it.”\n\nExcerpt From: Apple Education. “Education Deployment Guide.” Apple Inc. - Education, 2016. iBooks. https://itun.es/fr/fTEibb.l\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nbetter description \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEducation Deployment guid\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDiscussed with Alexandre Morin (alexmorin@apple.com)"
