    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a webpage updates its title dynamically, this is not reflected on its Safari tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a web page that has no <title> tag and updates its title dynamically using <script>document.title = \"Test\";</script> or with a dynamic counter, and have the page refresh itself using setTimeout(location.reload, 10000) or so.\r\n2. Save a bookmark to this page and call it \"Demo\".\r\n3. Open a new tab with this bookmark.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tab label should read \"Test\".\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe tab label reads \"Demo\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 11.0 (13604.1.25.3.3)\r\nmacOS High Sierra Developer Beta 2 Update 1 (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease take a look at the attachment where the number of items in the list was 7 when the page loaded and is now 4 only. The tab title still says \"7 in work\" though."
