    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running XCUITest tests, if you look in Console on macOS, you will see a bunch of errors like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSomeone is calling _accessibilityChildren recursively. That's just asking for trouble.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with XCUITests\r\n2. Add some code to search for a UI element\r\n3. Open Console.app and look at the logs for the simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are no warnings from XCUITest\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXCUITest warns seemingly every time it searches for an element.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screenshot of the log"
