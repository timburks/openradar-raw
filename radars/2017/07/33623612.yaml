    description: "Area:\r\nSecurity Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBasically I have a unit test which encounters some logic accessing the keychain. \r\nThe unit test is testing an embedded framework.\r\nNormally from my understanding the -34018 error is fixed by adding the \"keychain sharing\" entitlement, but since in my case the test is run without an application, there is no way to add this entitlement to the unit test target or to the framework target\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a framework with unit tests.\r\n\r\nCreate logic in the framework which accesses the keychain\r\n\r\nCreate a unit test which runs through the keychain logic (and have some sort of expectation from the keychain)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeychain should function normally\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nYou will get -34018 error on the keychain\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3 or 11 (beta)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
