    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUIViewPropertyAnimator currently can be animated only until specific position (end, or start if reversed), or have its fractionCompletion manually set, it would be a great improvement if it would be possible to animate the animator to specific fraction point.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate UIViewProperty animator, configure it, later at some point try to call 'continueAnimation' method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to decide until what fractionCompletion point animation should continue to.\r\ne.g. current fraction of my animation is 0 and I want to animate it only till halfway - animator.continueAnimation(withTimingParameters: nil, durationFactor: 1, untilCompletionFraction: 0.5)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCurrently the method allows only to set the timing parameter and duration factor."
