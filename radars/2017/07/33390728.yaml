    description: "Area:\r\nPerformance (slow, hung)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nmacOS doesn't seem to swap memory very well when a lot of applications are open. Often, it will swap in large amounts of data and overload the RAM and cause slowdowns and freezes. Attached is a sysdiagnose of this happening in a milder case (I couldn't get a sysdiagnose to complete if it's more severe since it freezes the computer).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a lot of apps and windows so that macOS starts swapping out.\r\n2. Work for a while.\r\n3. Wait for kernel_task to pull from the swap, saturate all available RAM, and hang the computer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwapping in is done only when necessary and at appropriate times.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSwapping gigabytes of data in is done for seemingly no reason and causes the computer to lag or freeze.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A306f)"
