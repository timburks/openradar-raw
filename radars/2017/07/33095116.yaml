Press hard on the left edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current app or Home Screen should transition to the App Switcher.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. iOS treats me like a stranger accosting it on the street. It won't even make eye contact.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nObserved always since iOS 11 beta 1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
