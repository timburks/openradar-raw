    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nProgrammatically moving the accessibility focus to accessibility elements does not work if the elements are text fields or dimmed buttons, although the property has been successfully set to YES.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached project.\r\n- Start VoiceOver.\r\n- Run the project.\r\n- In the console you will see which element has been programmatically selected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should cycle through all three elements (the disabled prevViewButton, the enabled nextViewButton and the multilineLabel), three times with one second between each switch, as specified in the code.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nVoiceOver only selects the enabled nextViewButton.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way of programmatically selecting the multilineLabel is by setting the accessibilityElement property of both buttons to NO, so the label is the only available element.\r\n\r\nBeing able to select the label programmatically is important, because labels can contain important information, while the buttons may just say \"Agree\" or \"Cancel\", which without context only confuses the user.\r\n\r\nThe attached file can be downloaded here:\r\nhttps://peporal.de/bugs/Accessibility%20Focus.zip"
