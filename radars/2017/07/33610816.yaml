    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33583836\n\nCurrently if you have a custom control that requires a font be set, and you include it from a storyboard, there is no good way to customize the font using IBInspectables.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIView subclass, and add this property:\n\n```\n@IBInspectable var font: UIFont!\n```\n\n2. Add a view of your class, and attempt to set this property\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get a font picker for the property just like when you're customizing the font of a UILabel\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis property isn't customizable using interface builder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe're currently working around this by making multiple properties for the font name and the font size, and then, based on the string, building the font in code. This is obviously a lot more overhead and is much more error prone."
