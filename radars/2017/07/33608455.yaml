    description: PHAssetCollectionSubtype is one of the ways in which PHAssetCollection fetches can be set up. As of iOS 11 beta 4, however, which the enum has a `.smartAlbumDepthEffect` case, it does not contain a `.smartAlbumDepthData` case. Depth effect and depth data can both exist independent of each other, so the former cannot serve as a proxy for the latter either.
