    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's Quick Help sidebar doesn't \"expand\" to show the full documentation for dropFirst()â€“instead, it's cut off at the bottom. You can \"scroll\" the text by selecting it and moving the cursor down, however. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move the cursor to a dropFirst() while Quick Help is open.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe entire space is used.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOnly a fraction of the space is used.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)/macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
