    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the iOS simulator (Xcode 9 beta 2), significant rendering issues are commonly observed. Initially, I believed this was related to errors in an application I building. However, Iâ€™ve been able to observe the issues in system apps (most easily observed in Photos).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Launch iOS simulator from Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator menu item\r\n- Launch Photos app (occurs in system apps as well as third-party apps)\r\n- Scroll around randomly; observe flickers and glitches in screen rendering\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Screen should never draw inaccurately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Frequent screen glitches and flickers are observed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nModel Name:\tMacBook Pro\r\n  Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro13,3\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i7\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.7 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t8 MB\r\n  Memory:\t16 GB\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tMBP133.0226.B23\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t2.38f7\r\n\r\n\r\n  System Version:\tmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n  Kernel Version:\tDarwin 16.6.0\r\n  Boot Volume:\tMacintosh HD"
