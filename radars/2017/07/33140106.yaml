    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently it's impossible to do custom rotation or scaling animations for the lifting preview using dragInteraction(_:willAnimateLiftWith:session:) because both UIDragPreviewTarget.transform and view.transform are ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Try lifting.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPreview does some rotation and scaling animations during lifting.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!BbYD0bQC!5278UttAEdueEuixoJkeqN0VITZnJWAJajeZ2NTJgu4"
