    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn order to provide a smoother user experience, we would like to display our own prompt (suppressing the system \"Restore 'Maps'?\" prompt when the user has \"uninstalled/hidden\" Apple Maps in iOS 10 or later, and our app tries to launch Apple Maps.  We have tried calling `UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(\"http://maps.apple.com\")`, but this always returns `true` regardless of whether the user has Apple Maps installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Uninstall Apple Maps by long pressing \"Maps\" app on home screen and tapping top left \"X\" button.\r\n2) Call `UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(\"http://maps.apple.com\")` from any app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect `UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(\"http://maps.apple.com\")` to return `false` because Apple Maps cannot be launched immediately.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n`UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(\"http://maps.apple.com\")` returns `true`.  When I subsequently call `UIApplication.shared.open(\"http://maps.apple.com\", options: [:], completionHandler: nil)`, the attached system alert is presented rather than giving the developer a hook to handle the case where Apple Maps is not installed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 and later."
