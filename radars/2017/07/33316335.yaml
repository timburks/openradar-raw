    description: "Summary:\r\nUICollectionView offers a great way to build all sorts of custom layouts while at the same time being very memory and performance efficient by only loading the cells that are actually visible on screen.\n\nThere is one scenario where all this awesomeness goes south, though: When you need to embed a collection view in a scroll view (e.g. to be able to zoom a collection view) the collection view always loads all cells because its size is equal to the containing scroll viewâ€™s content size.\n\nThere should be support for this kind of scenario from UIKit.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the attached sample\n1. Check out ViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe locations marked with FIXME should work the way I noted it there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a quite ugly work around required to get it working which has the caveat to break flow layout as well as cell prefetching.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33316167. We also know that Apple needs and uses this internal and found SPI for it. Please make this available in iOS 11."
