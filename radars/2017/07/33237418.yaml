    description: "Summary:\r\nI totally get why beta users shouldn't be able to rate apps on the store, the issue mainly being that people will not understand that crashes and inconsistencies might be related to their choice of trying out an unfinished release of an operating system and not pertain to the innocent 3rd party app.\n\nWhat if I want to help out a fantastic app and give it the five ✨ it obviously deserves? Can't do so. But what if the dev isn't getting a lot of reviews and mine would totally make their day? No dice. But isn't submitting great reviews what making the App Store great again is all about?!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n❤️"
