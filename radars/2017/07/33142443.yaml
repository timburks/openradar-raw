    description: "Summary:\r\nThe PDF plugin highlights matches when searching, using an animation when doing so. However, it looks like the \"remove highlight\" function is broken since the highlight is never removed. This causes overly dark highlights that don't go away after searching is completed and that get darker after repeated searches. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a PDF.\r\n2. Search for something.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe highlight is yellow.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe highlight starts off as a light brown and transitions towards black as searching continues.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRelease 34 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 13604.1.27.0.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from Safari 10.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291m)"
