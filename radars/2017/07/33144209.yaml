    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33144063\n\nIt would be very, very useful to allow per-pixel smooth scroll in Terminal app. Currently, scrolling in terminal is line-by-line, which feels second-class and out of place with other macOS apps. Given certain editors (like Emacs) are nearly necessary for certain use cases (e.g. Proof General), it would be nice if they could scroll smoothly. Otherwise, it is difficult for eyes to track the position of the content as it scrolls.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScroll\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth, \"buttery\" per-pixel scrolling like in Safari, Finder, Calendar, Mail, Xcode, TextEdit, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClunky, jittery per-line scrolling that is nearly impossible to visually track\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions\r\n\r\nNotes:"
