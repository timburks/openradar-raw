    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33505938\r\n\r\nIf you open Maps.app (or an app that uses Google Maps) on the iOS simulator, the simulator performance seems to be just a few frames per second (around 1 or 2 frames per second). This was not the case in Xcode 9 beta 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Xcode 9 beta 4 simulator\r\n2. Launch Maps.app\r\n3. Pan around\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get somewhere between 30 and 60fps on your macOS machine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get about 1 or 2 fps.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This is not a problem in Xcode 9 beta 3\r\n- This is a huge problem for us because we can't use the simulator anymore to test our app."
