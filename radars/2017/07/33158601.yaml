    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nThe summary and text descriptions are pretty convoluted. Check out the attached gif to see what I'm seeing.\r\n\r\nWhen dragging the Gesture Recognizer icon around, when over a space in the table, the insertion indicator follows where the mouse is.\r\nWhen the dragging passes over the GR icon, the insertion point, instead of moving below the icon the mouse is over, it jumps to the icon one below that (like an off-by-one).  If I drag over the bottom GR icon, the insertion point moves to the top.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart drag a GR in the storyboard sidebar\r\nDrag over other GR icons\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe move-to-indicator is below the icon directly underneath the mouse pointer. It generally remains stable relative to the mouse location\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe move-to-indicator jumps around.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n10.12.5 (16F73)"
