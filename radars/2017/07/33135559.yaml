    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the new method to attach search bars by setting navigationItem.searchController, the search bar activation animation shortly reveals the containing UILayoutContainerView's background and the table view contentOffset is not animated to its new position.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the dismiss animation doesn't animate the table view's contentOffset.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project and add one row using the + button. Reveal and tap into the search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe table view's content should animate towards the top. The first table view cell should stay attached to the search bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly when the search bar animation completes, the table view content offset is set to its new value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached screen grab movie, included in the sample project."
