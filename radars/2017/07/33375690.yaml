    description: "Summary:\r\nCBPeripheral has had an \"-identifier\" method since 10.10. Looks like CBPeripheral grew a base class CBPeer in 10.13, and -identifier moved to the base class. The base class's -identifier is now marked 10.13+, which I suppose makes sense, but calls to CBPeripheral's -identifier are now 10.13+ in the SDK, while CBPeripheral's -identifier really exists since 10.10.\r\n\r\nIn Chrome, we have code like\r\n\r\nNSUUID *GetId(CBPeripheral* p) {\r\n  if (@available(macos 10.10, *)) {\r\n    return [p identifier];\r\n  }\r\n  return nil;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis now incorrectly emits a -Wunguarded-availability warning with the 10.13 SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(see summary)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSnippet in summary should compile without issues.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNeedless -Wunguarded-availability warning is emitted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta / macOS 10.13 SDK"
