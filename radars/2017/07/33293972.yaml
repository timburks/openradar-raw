    description: In Xcode it would be really nice to be able to use 3D touch on supported trackpads to peek a symbol's definition and the pop to jump to it. Often times I just need a quick glimpse of the definition and find myself immediately going back to where I came from. Holding down âŒ˜ while doing the peek gesture could display the definition in a popover or some other UI container just like Mail does for links.
