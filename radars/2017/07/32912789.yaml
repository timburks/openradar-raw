    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a view controller in my app that places a UINavigationBar sized to the height of the system status bar in order to make sure the content scrolling beneath it doesn't conflict with the status bar.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 11 beta 1 and 2, when I set the frame of the UINavigationBar, even if I explicitly set the height to 20 points, the size of the navigation bar is much higher than that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a full-screen UIView to the screen, with the iOS status bar visible.\r\n2) Add a UINavigationBar sized to fit the frame of the status bar, by default 20 points high.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation bar and its subviews to align to the size of the frame. If the frame is set as 20 points high, the navigation bar should be 20 points.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe navigation bar appears to be twice as tall as it should be.\r\n\r\nLooking at the view breakout in Xcode, it looks like the frame of the UINavigationBar is being set properly, however the private subviews in it are not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooking at the view breakout in Xcode, it looks like the frame of the UINavigationBar is being set properly, however the private subviews in it are not."
