    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you define a custom class for a view in IB, if the class doesn't exist in runtime, a non-fatal exception is logged, but the app continues working, often without the correct UX since the custom class behavior isn't happening.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Add a label on screen\n3. Change the label's class to Foo\n4. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app crashes at runtime because the class `Foo` doesn't exist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error is logged, but the app continues to run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I think a opt-in error for this would also be acceptable, but either way this is a runtime error that shouldn't be avoidable.\n- Run the attached project for an example"
