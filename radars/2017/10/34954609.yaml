    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, iTunes opens immediately when you connect an iOS device through USB. This is annoying, since it breaks focus of whatever window or application you had open and potentially gives you a modal dialogue to handle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug iOS device in a macOS device with USB while iTunes is not running.\n2. Go to device settings in iTunes by clicking the iPhone icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter 1, iTunes doesn't start immediately.\nAfter 2, user can find the 'Open iTunes for this device' option, which can be checked or unchecked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter 1, iTunes starts and tries to connect to device.\nAfter 2, no option is found for 'Open iTunes for this device'.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.7.0.166\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis option used to be there and was great. Hoping to see it returned.\n\nRelated; rdar://34954553"
