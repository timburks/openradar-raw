    description: "Music on iOS could benefit heavily from support for Drag & Drop on iOS. \r\n\r\nWith Drag & Drop support, one could easily add many songs to the up next queue by dropping songs onto the now playing view controller.\r\n\r\nIn addition, one could drag and drop songs into a playlist with ease."
