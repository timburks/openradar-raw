    description: "Area:\r\nExternal Accessory Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen media apps are not in the foreground on the iOS device, the EA is unable to switch audio sources.\r\n\r\nCross-referencing issue 34128154 from another OEM. Will attach sysdiagnose shortly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up at least two SDL enabled apps from the app store. We're using Spotify and Slacker Radio.\r\n2. Plug the iOS device into a TDK or SDL enabled vehicle.\r\n3. Launch Spotify from the HMI, begin audio playback.\r\n4. Switch to Slacker Radio from the HMI, begin audio playback.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 3, playback from Spotify should begin. At step 4, playback from Slacker Radio should begin.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt step 3, audio from Spotify begins playing. At step 4, the HMI shows Slacker Radio playback beginning, but the actual audio source remains Spotify. HMI may show playback as paused after a short time, but Spotify audio continues playing.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11"
