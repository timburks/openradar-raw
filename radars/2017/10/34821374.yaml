    description: "Summary:\r\nSingle stepping (step over) in Xcode 9 during a debug session is slow, even on the simulator. Stepping to the next line usually takes a couple of seconds. This seems to wait on the stack trace pane reloading itself completely on every step.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into a debugging session on Xcode 9\n2. Single step with step over thru a function complete\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach step takes a normal amount of time, editor pane is never blocked\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Each step takes a few seconds, rendering single stepping a frustrating experience\n- the editor pane is hanging until the stack trace pane has updated itself\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was way faster in Xcode 8.  The whole UI seems to block until the stack trace pane has updated itself"
