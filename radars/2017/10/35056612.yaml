    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #35051500\n\nSpell checking feature do not work in the Xcode 9 editor. Regression with the editor rewrite as this works in Xcode 8.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode, write something that would be flagged by the spell checker, like ajkgkadga\n2. Press cmd-; or shift-cmd-; or access these commands from Edit > Format > Spelling and Grammar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncmd-; should underline the word in red\n\nshift-cmd-; should show the word not in spelling dictionary in the spelling panel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBeep plays for cmd-; — this command seems to be disabled.\n\nshift-cmd-; does show spelling panel but it is always empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe generate documentation from header files so it’s important to check spelling in these, and we normally edit them with Xcode."
