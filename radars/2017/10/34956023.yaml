    description: "Area:\r\nWallet\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen purchasing through an app with Apple Pay on an iPhone SE with iOS 11, the UI for Add Shipping Address is laid out incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to an app that allows you to pay with Apple Pay (like the ASOS app!)\r\n2. Go to the Apple Pay checkout\r\n3. Go to the Shipping Address options\r\n4. Select Add Shipping Address\r\n5. Observe layout/interaction issues\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo gap between status bar and search bar.\r\nTouches are not passed through to views underneath (z-axis) the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a gap (~44pt) between the navigation bar and the search bar.\r\nThere is no status bar.\r\nTapping the top half of the Cancel button takes you to a page where you can enter your address.\r\nTaps on the top half of the Back button from the address entry page are passed through to the form underneath, resulting in the text menu appearing.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0.2 (15A421)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE, en_GB"
