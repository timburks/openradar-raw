    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use Extract All Occurrences for the first part of a line that has a comment above it, the extracted portion includes the comment for some reason (the selected portion does not encompass the comment)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create some lines of code that include a common prefix\n2. Add a comment above each line.\n3. Select the common prefix and choose Refactor > Extract All Occurrences\n4. Enter any new name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe comment above the selected prefix should remain untouched and not be copied into the new refactored line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe comment is left alone on its original line, however, it is also placed in the code where the common prefix is extracted to. The code compiles as written, but it is very incorrect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor example, the following code:\n\n        // Disable auto update.\n        BITHockeyManager.shared().isUpdateManagerDisabled = true\n        \n        // Set Hockey App Delegate in order to get crash reports etc.\n        BITHockeyManager.shared().delegate = AppExtensionHockeyManagerDelegate.sharedInstance\n        \n        // Auto-send crash reports to Hockey App.\n        BITHockeyManager.shared().crashManager.crashManagerStatus = BITCrashManagerStatus.autoSend\n        \n        // Start Hockey App.\n        BITHockeyManager.shared().start()\n        \n        // Authenticate the hockey app installation\n        BITHockeyManager.shared().authenticator.authenticateInstallation()\n\nAlso see attached QuickTime recording."
