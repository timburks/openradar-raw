    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile performing some disk related operations (opening an app/a prompt to [save | open] a file [to | from] disk), most of applications will hang while the external hard drive is leaving leaving idle mode and kicking in. This HDD contain my Time Machine if relevant.\r\n\r\nThe reproducibility rate hit 100% with the page save prompt in Safari\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug a external HDD\r\n(2. Set up time machine on it?)\r\n3. Wait for the energy saving policy to kick in\r\n4. Make a operation requiring access from the UI to the eHDD\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHang only when the disk is actually required, and display a loading message instead of a hang\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplications hangs as a whole (can't do anything requiring IO meanwhile)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.10.0+\r\nReproductible on 14C68k\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem probably come from a Cocoa API, and the hang from the applications making those lengthy call in the main thread. However, it'd be great if the prompt could appear before the eHDD is fully started, and would only be grayed out while accelerating.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBPr with SSD\r\nExternal HDD is a 7200 rpm disk"
