    description: "Summary:\r\nSince I installed High Sierra on my Mac, Messages has been very unreliable. When a friend sends me a message I receive it immediately on my iPhone, but on the Mac it sometimes appears with a delay of up to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use iMessage on your Mac and iPhone\r\n2. The bug usually occurs when Messages on the Mac has not been used in a while, but is open in the background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessages on the Mac should immediately receive new messages as they arrive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages gets new messages delayed.\r\nI can speed up the process by \"waking up\" Messages by sending a message. Me and my friend agreed to send a \".\" to each other when Messages hangs.\r\n\r\nI created two sysdiagnoses (sysdiagnose Message, not just sysdiagnose). One while Messages was sitting idle, dreaming and not reloading Messages, while the chat continued on the iPhone and another sysdiagnose after I sent the \".\" message to wake it up.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 (17A365)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nrMBP early 2015"
