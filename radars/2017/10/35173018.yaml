    description: "Summary:\r\nCan we please have Markdown support (any flavor really) adder to Radar please ?\r\nCurrently it's super-cumbersome to add code or any formatting to the bug we are filling. Adding some kind of markup language handling just the basics (bold, italic, code) would be helpful both for writing and reading reports :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can easily include code examples to my tickets\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSad panda\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
