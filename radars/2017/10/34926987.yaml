    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an alarm created in the Clock app fires while completing a software update, the user cannot acknowledge the alarm, and has no means for snoozing, silencing, or stopping the alarm until completing post-update steps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an alarm in Clock that will go off within an hour (or enough time to complete an OS update)\n2. Perform an OS update from the Settings app, allowing OS to reboot\n3. Wait for scheduled alarm time to arrive\n4. Attempt to perform post-update steps (Configure iCloud, add cards to Apple Pay, etc.)\n5. Observe that alarm is inaccessible, but continues to play a sound and vibrate the phone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlarms should be accessible from within the post-upgrade utility in some fashion so they can be snoozed or stopped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlarms cannot be accessed prior to completing post-update activities, and continue to play while attempting to finish updates.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn iPhone 7/7s and newer hardware, the introduction to the new Home button experience was severely impacted by the constant vibration of the alarm firing. It was difficult to appreciate the differences in Home button feedback with the phone vibrating constantly."
