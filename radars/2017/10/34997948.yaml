    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34993189\n\nAs of Xcode 9 (including 9.1b2) we are no longer able to run Instruments on our project.It works with a small new project but not our existing, 7-year old codebase. This never happened before.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun for Profiling\nObserve https://twitter.com/steipete/status/918987004490207232\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstruments should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments fails to work\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe use ccache to speed up compile times. https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2015/ccache-for-fun-and-profit/\n\nUnsure how to provide more information or how to work around. This is seriously impacting the quality of our product. Instruments seems to work when I run the app on device and then attach it later, but thatâ€™s a pretty bad workaround."
