    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building with XCBuild after a fresh clean, I got some build failures where XCBuild was trying to ditto files using their path name prefixed with `./`. This resulted in a failure since the file didn't exist. Building again got past this failure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove the build directory for a project\r\n2. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build succeeds\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build failed immediately with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nditto: /Users/ksmiley/dev/re-lyft-ng/build/Intermediates.noindex/Lyft.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Models.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/./Place.dia: No such file or directory\r\nnote: /Users/ksmiley/dev/re-lyft-ng/build/Intermediates.noindex/Lyft.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Models.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/./Place.dia: No such file or directoryCommand Ditto failed with a nonzero exit code\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it was looking for `x86_64/./Place.dia`. I confirmed that at the time `x86_64/Place.dia` did exist.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Building again got past this error, but it failed on a few more targets with the same error\r\n- Attached is the log"
