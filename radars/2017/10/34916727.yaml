    description: "It’s really hard to distinguish Xcode versions, and we often need several installed (say, between WWDC and around October). I have made a `/AppleInternal` directory so that Xcode displays its build number in the icon, but that only works while the app is open. And it isn’t well-documented. And it has other side-effects. \r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nI’d like a way to easily, visually distinguish versions of Xcode I have installed. I’m open to ideas, but at a bare minimum I’d like the display-build-number-on-icon feature to be supported out of the box without any undocumented hacks. Thanks"
