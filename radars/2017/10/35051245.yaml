    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nTwo private properties: _hidesShadow and _shadowAlpha exist on UINavigationBar and work to control the border/shadow visible at the bottom of the UINavigationBar.\r\n\r\nBoth of these properties work perfectly (with the exception of _shadowAlpha in certain circumstances due to radar://35051117) and would be extremely helpful for developers looking to customise the look of their application further.\r\n\r\nI suggest that these properties are publicized so that the \"hack\" of setting the backgroundImage and shadowImage of the UINavigationBar to a blank image no longer be necessary on most occasions. A shadowTint property would also be a nice addition."
