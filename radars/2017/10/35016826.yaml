    description: "Summary:\r\nSystem Image Utility allows you to add unsigned packages to a NetInstall set. When you later boot from the NetInstall nbi and attempt to install macOS, the installer errors with the message \"This copy of the Install macOS High Sierra application is damaged, and can't be used to install macOS.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch System Image Utility.\r\nSelect \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" as a source.\r\nChoose to make a NetInstall nbi.\r\nAdd one or more unsigned packages to the install.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmacOS High Sierra and additional packages are installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstaller displays the error \"\"This copy of the Install macOS High Sierra application is damaged, and can't be used to install macOS.\" and will not proceed.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of adding unsigned packages, you add signed packages instead, the installer launches and runs successfully. (It does not, however, actually successfully install all the extra packages -- that is a different bug.)\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, SIU documentation should be updated to specify that signed packages are required here. Better would be for the Installer to provide a more informative error. Still better would be for SIU to reject unsigned packages and provide guidance at nbi build time.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 Build 17A405\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD"
