    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a standard Master-Detail app, if the navigation bar of the Detail Screen is set to non-translucent, a landscape orientation on a Compact device (iPhone 5x, iPhone 6x, iPhone 7 & 8) leaves a grey strip between the bar and the view.\r\nSee attached screenshot\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a standard new Master-Detail app in Xcode (sample attached)\r\n- Without touching any code, open the Main.storyboard\r\n- For the 2 UINavigationController scenes, select the navigation bar and uncheck the Translucent option\r\n- Run the app on an iOS 11 Simulator for a Compact device (for example, iPhone 8)\r\n- Create an entry, and select it to enter the Detail screen\r\n- Switch to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's no discontinuity between the navigation bar and the controller's view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's a 12 pixel high grey strip\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator\r\nComments"
