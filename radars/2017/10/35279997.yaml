    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9.1 was supposed to fix the OpenGL and Maps performance issues; unfortunately, it's a marginal improvement. Anything that uses OpenGL and or MapKit still takes up about 5 to 10 seconds to respond; Panning around in the Maps app lags behind.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Maps app on the iPhone X simulator in Xcode 9.1\n2. Pan around a bit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPanning is some what smooth\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen lags behind severely; UI performance drops all over the place\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTested on a Macbook Pro 2016 (TouchBar) with an UltraFine 5K monitor attached to it"
