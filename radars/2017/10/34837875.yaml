    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"Jump to Definition...\" command in Xcode (âŒ˜+click on symbol) on any symbol for which there are multiple implementations (i.e. protocol/implementation),  selecting any option after the first in the resulting list obscures the text of that selection. See screenshots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTrigger the \"Jump to Definition...\" command on any symbol for which there are multiple options. Arrow down or mouse over the resulting options in the resulting list. Observe that any selected row after the first is entirely blue and the text is not visible.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, to access a symbol with multiple options, build the Occlusion target in attached Xcode project (note that you must actually build the project. The command just jumps directly to the protocol definition otherwise). Then trigger the \"Jump to Definition...\" command on line 28 of ViewController.swift (the function on the instance of Foo, which is inside of viewDidLoad).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text of the highlighted line should be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text of the highlighted line is not visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe included attachment also contains 2 screenshots to demonstrate the bug."
