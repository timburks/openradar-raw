    description: "With Xcode 9, it is no longer possible to view any of the API Guides in the built-in documentation browser.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Table View Programming Guide for Mac, the Human Interface Guidelines, and the Swift Language Guide.\r\n\r\nThese are all essential resources that I often have open in the documentation browser.\r\n\r\nThough they are available on the web, I'd rather view them in the documentation browser alongside the API reference."
