    description: "Summary:\r\nYou can select an image literal from the autocomplete list, but the image displayed in Xcode is different from the one selected. Also, the image displayed in Xcode is different from the one indicated by the raw text in the source file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at the attached screenshots. I selected ProfileImage. Once the autocomplete popover goes away, it shows that I selected ProfileDefault instead. Also, although Xcode shows ProfileDefault, this is the text: \r\n        self.imageView.image = #imageLiteral(resourceName: \"ProfileImage\")\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo weirdness.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWeirdness.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe project has multiple targets and .xcassets files. In the example shown, ProfileImage is present in the same target as the .swift file. ProfileDefault is not part of that target."
