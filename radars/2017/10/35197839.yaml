    description: "Summary:\r\nLinks in UITextViews no longer respond to short taps. The link has been detected, but are only interactive with longer presses (of half a second or more).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAny text view with a link is able to reproduce this.\r\nFor example:\r\n1. Insert a URL into the proper field of an event in the Calendar app.\r\n2. When the event has been published, tap for less than half a second on the URL link.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith a short tap, the link opens and takes you to the proper place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\nUser a longer tap and the link opens as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11*\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is reproducible with every link in UITextViews on iOS 11."
