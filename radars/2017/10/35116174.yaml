    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using an MKMapView with \"safeAreaInsets\" or \"additionalSafeAreaInsets\" in a UIViewController, the \"Legal\" link at the bottom left, the scale bar at the top left, and the compass at the top right are NOT honoring these metrics.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd an MKMapView as a child view of a UIViewController, and set the \"additionalSafeAreaInsets\" property to be non-zero on the top, left, bottom and right. I've attached a sample project you can use to reproduce this issue (it's a very basic MKMapView in a UIViewController).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe MKMapView should inset the \"Legal\" link, scale bar, and compass appropriately for the insets provided.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Legal\" link, scale bar, and compass are ignoring the \"safeAreaInsets\" and \"additionalSafeAreaInsets\" properties entirely. It can be seen that the \"safeAreaInsets\" property is ignored on the iPhone X in the simulator, since the \"Legal\" link appears below the home indicator. I've attached a screenshot of the iPhone X simulator running iOS 11.0.1, and a screenshot of an iPhone 6 running iOS 11.0.3. I've also noticed this issue on an iPad Pro 9.7\" running iOS 11.1 beta 4.\r\n\r\niPhone X simulator screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/hxHSsrT.png\r\niPhone 6 device screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/nXYt7xZ.jpg\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nOccurs with Xcode 9.0.1 in any iOS 11 simulator, and occurs with Xcode 9.1 beta 2 in any iOS 11 simulator and on any 11.1 beta 4 device.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X simulator running iOS 11.0.1 and an iPhone 6 running iOS 11.0.3."
