    description: "Area:\r\nSpotlight\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSpotlight automatically suggests adult content on search. Even when Restrictions/Parental Controls are enabled(!). The bug happens on both iOS and macOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave an iPhone on iOS 11, set to Portuguese with a Brazilian locale. Swipe down on the home screen to activate Spotlight. I was going to search for \"contos infantis\" (something like \"kids bedtime stories\") and I stopped in the word \"contos\" (which would be the \"stories\" part). The suggestions Spotlight gave were of erotic stories, with thumbnails of naked women. The URL leads to a porn website. With Restrictions enabled, it still displays the suggestions, with adult thumbnails, but tapping the suggestion leads to an error (thankfully).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafe for children results, even with Restrictions/Parental Controls turned off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAdult results, almost always.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.0.3 (15A432)\r\nmacOS 10.13 (17A405)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 7 Plus set to Brazilian locale and Portuguese language.\r\nMacBook Pro set to Brazilian locale and Portuguese language."
