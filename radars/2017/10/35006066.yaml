    description: "Summary:\r\nNon-Breaking Space should automatically be replaced by an ordinary space character in Swift source code (except in Strings and comments).\r\n\r\nWhen typing an opening bracket (OPTION+8) followed by a space on a german keyboard, somehow, Xcode source editor often inserts a non-breaking space character (as typed with OPTION+SPACE) instead of just space. This causes the compiler to report an invalid character. For unknown reasons this mostly occurs when typing the else block of guard statements. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a german keyboard\r\nOpen a Swift file\r\nQuickly type a guard statement with ‚else‘ block starting with opening bracket + space\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo issue should arise, a space should be inserted after the bracket\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA non-breaking space is inserted after the bracket and compilation fails.\r\nA fix-it shows: „Invalid character in source file“\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1 beta (9B46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is happening throughout my team many times per day, so I think it is not only my clumsiness.\r\nThe resulting fix-it could be automatically be applied.\r\nOr it could be handled similar to the „While editing: Automatically trim trailing whitespaces“ setting"
