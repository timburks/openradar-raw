    description: "Summary:\r\nA photo taken on an iPhone (iOS 11.0.3) sometimes shows with a black rectangle in the middle of it when viewed in Photos on MacOS 10.13. This seems to be related to the size that the image is displayed at.\r\n\r\nWhen I view it in a window at a size of 703x936, the black band appears on the image. Scrolling forward/back shows the black band on this one image.\r\n\r\nWhen I maximize the window, the black band disappears. Restoring the window to its original size does not cause the black band to return, even scrolling left/right.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I quit and re-open photos then the black band reappears on the image.\r\n\r\nI also see the black band if I export the image at _some_ sizes. The black band shows when I set the export size to Medium, but not when I set it to Large or Full Size. (I experimented with quality settings but this doesn't seem to alter the behavior.)\r\n\r\nI'm attaching:\r\n - the original HEIC file\r\n - a screenshot of photos showing the black band on the image\r\n - a JPEG exported at Medium size, with the black band present\r\n - a JPEG exported at Large size, without the black band present\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Import the image into Photos.\r\n2. Size the Photos window to 1579 x 1086.\r\n3. Quit Photos.\r\n4. Open Photos, and scroll to the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImage never shows a black band.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage shows a black band when viewed at certain sizes.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nPhotos: Version 3.0 (3201.11.120)\r\nMacOS: macOS 10.13 (17A405)"
