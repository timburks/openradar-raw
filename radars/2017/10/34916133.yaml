    description: "Area:\r\nMedia Player Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI'm using the MPMusicPlayerController in an app to access the user's music library.\r\n\r\nIf I play some of a podcast episode in iTunes on my Mac, then sync with my iPhone, my app correctly displays the current playback position of the podcast.\r\n\r\nBut if I play some of the episode in my app, then sync with iTunes, the playback position is not updated in iTunes. And the playback position is reset in my app back to the value that iTunes last had.\r\n\r\nThis used to work in an earlier version of iOS but I'm not sure which version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm using the MPMusicPlayerController in an app to access the user's music library.\r\n\r\nIf I play some of a podcast episode in iTunes on my Mac, then sync with my iPhone, my app correctly displays the current playback position of the podcast.\r\n\r\nBut if I play some of the episode in my app, then sync with iTunes, the playback position is not updated in iTunes. And the playback position is reset in my app back to the value that iTunes last had.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playback position (bookmarkTime) should be synced to iTunes.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe playback position is not synced to iTunes, and gets overwritten, so users can't resume listening to the podcast episode where they left off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.2"
