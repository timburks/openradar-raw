    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to build a xib with ibtool, I've noticed that sometimes they fail to build the first time because \"Command CompileXIB failed with a nonzero exit code\". The logs around this don't have any reason for why they failed. If you either re-build the project, or copy the command and run it from the command line, they succeed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build a project with xibs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build succeeds\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the build fails only the first time\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached log for an example"
