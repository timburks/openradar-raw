    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nI recently attempted to install VirtualBox 5.2.0 on High Sierra, and the installation failed to complete due to Oracle America's kernel extension being blocked. Despite approving the .kext, repeated installations (accomplished by selecting the .dmg and adding a new installer device) even one minute later failed in exactly the same way.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I discovered was, after approving the .kext, to attempt another install from a previously mounted .dmg file. It appears that unpacked .dmg files are somehow different enough from each other that High Sierra's .kext detection fails to recognize them as the same across different mounting attempts.\r\n\r\nIdeally, unpacking the same .dmg repeatedly should only require a single approval of the .kext in question every 30 minutes, unless there is some additional security concern I'm not aware of."
