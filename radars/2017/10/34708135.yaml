    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary: Installation of High Sierra from the App Store fails. Download succeeds and restarts machine. Progress bar under grey apple appears for 5 minutes then the error 'macOS could not be installed on your computer (com.apple.DiskManagement error 0). Quit the installer and restart to try again.'\r\n\r\nRestarting the machine does the same thing. Reinstalling High Sierra from Recovery partition does the same thing, even after downloading a fresh install package from Apple.\r\n\r\nNo log can be attached due to not being able to get to a working OS.\r\n\r\nMachine is a 2011 iMac running 10.12.4. Serial number DGKHV0BYDHJW\r\n\r\nRunning First Aid from Disk Utility on recovery partition shows no problems with disk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Download High Sierra from App Store, follow prompts and restart machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: High Sierra installation should proceed as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: As above - installation gets stopped with com.apple.DiskManagement error 0, now stuck in restart loop. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Before running High Sierra installation, version was 10.12.4"
