    description: "Area:\r\nCallKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCallKit UI doesn't display customised name set by application in property \"localizedCallerName\" (of CXCallUpdate). Application overrides  localizedCallerName property with customised value but it doesn't respect customised value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRequirements: \r\nAddressBook has a contact for caller party (with local name, email and phone number ). Application also maintains contacts (called as PPM contact) fetched from network. So there is a PPM contact with LDAP name and with email and phone number matching to a contact from AddressBook.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\nApplication receives an incoming VoIP call and app displays CallKit UI. Check out caller party name on CallKit UI. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication retrieves best contact match for caller party using contacts (contacts from AddressBook + contacts fetched from network) to display matched contact's  name on CallKit UI. Network contacts gets priority over contacts from AddressBook. Therefore, application overrides \"localizedCallerName\" property to show best matched contact name on CallKit UI. In this case, best matched contact would be network contact and its display name should be displayed on CallKit UI when application sets customised value in localizedCallerName property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCallKit shows local name from AddressBook. It doesn't respect customised value set by application. \r\n\r\nIssue doesn't happen when application doesn't have contact in AddressBook.  CallKit displays customised name when application overrides localizedCallerName property on CXCallUpdate. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTried on iOS versions 10.2.1, 11.0 \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone6S plus"
