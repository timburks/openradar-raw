    description: "Summary:\r\nI commute daily on Amtrak, so I keep my monthly pass in Wallet. Because that’s the only pass I routinely use, whenever I launch Wallet from my dock, it’s already open. But the first time I launch from the dock with it already open, I have to scroll down to the barcode by swiping instead of scrolling with the crown\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an Amtrak pass to Apple Wallet (it will probably work the same as any other pass with a barcode)\r\n2. Launch the Wallet app on the watch (make sure it’s in the Dock if it’s not already)\r\n3. Select the Amtrak pass\r\n4. Scroll to the barcode with the crown (this works)\r\n5. Let an indeterminate amount of time go by, using other apps on the watch\r\n6. Launch Wallet from the dock. The Amtrak pass should still be open\r\n7. Spin the Digital Crown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pass scrolls down to the barcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. You need to swipe on the screen to expose the barcode\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
