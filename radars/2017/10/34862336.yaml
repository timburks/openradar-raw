    description: "Summary:\r\nUIActivityViewController is a system control and should not require NSPhotaoLibraryAddUsageDescription to store images.\n\nUsers know how the stock activity view controller looks and it’s very hard to fake. Yet, when the save to image action is involved, the app will crash, unless the above permission description is set in the Info.plist. This is extremely easy to miss and will cause many real-world crashers and surprises. It’s not obvious that an Apple-provided stock control needs user-provided permission settings. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nShare an image via UIActivityViewController in a sample app without NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription on iOS 11 and observe the crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither do not show the activity or green-light it. Crashing is bad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash, something like https://twitter.com/steipete/status/915977224523837440\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI filed a similar radar last year for iOS 10, without response. rdar://31148201\n\nPlease get this right. Crashers like this are very frustrating for users and easy to miss."
