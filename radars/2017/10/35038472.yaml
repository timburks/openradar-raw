    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA UICollectionView with a UICollectionViewFlowLayout should allow autolayout to allow for self-sizing cells. This works for static layouts, but when items are inserted or removed the cells resize to the estimated size before expanding again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee Sample project attached to rdar://23728611\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen inserting/removing items, the cells maintain their size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCells reset to their estimated size before expanding to their actual size.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: \r\niOS 11.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is still broken on iOS 11! It's forcing me to avoid using self-sizing cells, because I can't animate state changes! Is there a workaround?"
