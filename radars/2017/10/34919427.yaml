    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an app is moved to the background its view controllers are having their viewWillTransition:ToSize methods called. In fact, called twice. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason for either of these calls at this point in the lifecycle and leads to confusion if one's code where dependent on the view to be attached to a window, which it is not at this point in the method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild the attached sample project; run it; put the app in the background. Observe the logging output showing the method was called twice at that time after the app is in the background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo calls to the method - should be called only when the app is brought into the foreground and if the size actually changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMethod is called twice\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10, iOS 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI tested on an iPad, and iPad simulator."
