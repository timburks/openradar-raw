Open Xcode's Preferences\n3. Open the \"Components\" tab at the top\n4. Download the iOS 9.3 Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode starts downloading the simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode cannot download the simulator and displays the message:\n\nCould not download and install iOS 9.3 Simulator. The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “devimages.apple.com.edgekey.net” which could put your confidential information at risk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTweets of people having the same problem:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/yaypie/status/914350152072101888\nhttps://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/913763239279898624\nhttps://twitter.com/HD_intercepter/status/912995492723912705\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34793451"
