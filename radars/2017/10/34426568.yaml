    description: "-- Update: This is fixed as of Xcode 9.1 Beta / iOS 11.1 Beta --\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen embedding a child UIViewController into a parent UIViewController using UIContainerView in a Storyboard, the child view controller's `safeAreaInsets` and `safeAreaLayoutGuide` are only provided updates when the child is entirely contained on screen. If any portion of the child is off screen the safe area properties do not receive updates.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `safeAreaLayoutGuide` states:\r\nIf the view is not currently installed in a view hierarchy, or is not yet visible onscreen, the layout guide edges are equal to the edges of the view.\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/2891102-safearealayoutguide\r\n\r\nThis defect happens both when the safe area insets were equal to the edge of the screen (iPhone X - Portrait orientation) or when the safe area insets were inset from the edges of the screen (iPhone X - Landscape Orientation) prior to the child moving outside the bounds of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIViewController in Storyboard\r\nAdd UIContainerView to controller\r\nConstraints:\r\n container.leading = superview.leading\r\n container.bottom = superview.bottom constant: 1\r\n container.trailing = superview.trailing\r\n container.height = 200\r\nCreate UITableViewController in Storyboard\r\nCreate \"Embed\" segue from UIContainerView to UITableViewController\r\nAdd static cells to table for sample data\r\n\r\nBuild and Run on iPhone X Simulator (device not released yet)\r\nRotate to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nContentView of UITableViewCells should be inset by safeAreaInsets so content remains readable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nContentVIew of UITableViewCells is not inset, content runs behind obstructed areas of screen. Additionally, `viewSafeAreaInsetsDidChange()` is not called on childViewController.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11 - Xcode 9 GM (9A235) - iPhone X Simulator"
