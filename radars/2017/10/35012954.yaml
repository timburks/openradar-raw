    description: "Summary: When using Migration Assistant on macOS 10.13.0 Supplemental Update, an account migrated from a Mac OS X 10.6 migration source cannot log in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install Mac OS X 10.6 on a computer and apply all available updates.\r\n- Start the Mac OS X 10.6 computer in Target Disk Mode\r\n- Install macOS 10.13.0 Supplemental on a computer\r\n- Start the macOS 10.13.0 computer\r\n- Step through the Setup Assistant until the Migration Assistant is reached\r\n- Attach the Mac OS X 10.6 computer to the macOS 10.13 computer\r\n- Migrate everything from the Mac OS X 10.6 computer\r\n- Allow the migration to complete and the macOS 10.13 computer to restart\r\n- Attempt to log in as the migrated user\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The migrated user can log in\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The migrated user cannot log in\r\n\r\nIt appears the Mac OS X 10.6.8-provided SHA1 hash is no longer acceptable/importable to the now-absolutely-required-as-of-High Sierra salted SHA512 PBKDF2 password hash.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- Mac OS X 10.6.8 10K549, MacBookPro8,1\r\n- macOS 10.13.0 Supplemental Update 17A405, iMac9,1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\"resetpassword\" from Recovery is capable of (re)setting the password properly.  Beyond that if the original password is set with \"resetpassword\" that the automatic login (saved at /etc/kcpassword) is successful.\r\n\r\nI've attached a copy of the dslocal user record as it was copied by Migration Assistant to the macOS 10.13.0 Supplemental Update computer."
