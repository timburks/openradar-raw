    description: "Summary:\r\nIt’s easy to accidentally brush the escape key on the Touch Bar. This unintended input is often disruptive and sometimes even results in minor data loss.\n\nI remapped Caps Lock to escape and it turns out it’s a better escape key even than keyboards with physical escape keys in the top left, because it’s bigger and closer to other keys. (Getting rid of the annoying Caps Lock key is also a plus.)\n\nTherefore the escape key on the Touch Bar is something I never press deliberately but it can easily be pressed accidentally, so it seems reasonable to disable it. The strength of the Touch Bar is in customisation, so why does this stop at the escape key?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar with Caps Lock remapped to escape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo accidental input\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan easily trigger escape accidentally\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
