    description: "Summary:\r\nI was unable to get Split View to work on two different Macs. Regardless of method of invoking it, it just would not work. After much troubleshooting, I figured out the problem: Split View is disabled if the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" preference is NOT enabled in System Preferences > Mission Control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Click and hold on the green button in Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari will offer to enter split view mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing will happen at all if the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" preference is unchecked, regardless of how many displays are actually attached to that Mac. I tested on both a multi-display iMac and a Retina MacBook Pro using only its built-in display.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.3/15D21\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not happen if the pref is enabled. Happens 100% of the time if the pref is disabled."
