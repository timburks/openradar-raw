    description: "Summary:\r\nPopovers do not stay in the safe area, which can result in them being obscured by the sensor housing on iPhone X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project on iPhone X in landscape.\n2. Tap the + button closest to the sensor housing, depending on which way you rotated.\n\nWithout the sample project:\n1. Present a popover from a bar button item in the navigation bar on iPhone X in landscape.\n2. You need to implement the adaptive presentation controller delegate to force a popover presentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPopovers should stay within the presenting viewâ€™s safe area.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPopover appears partially obscured by the sensor housing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
