    description: "Summary:\r\nCertain photos vanish whenever I import them into my iCloud Photo Library. Some things are consistent:\r\n- This only ever happens with photos exported from VSCO Cam\r\n- It doesn't happen with all photos\r\n- When it has started happening with a specific photo, it will happen every time on that photo, whether it is re-exported from VSCO, or exported before it vanishes and then re-imported via another method.\r\n- Clearing the photo's metadata stops it from vanishing.\r\n- It seems to disappear once it syncs to my Mac, or if imported on the Mac's copy of the Photos library.\r\n- It does not disappear when imported to newly-created local library.\r\n- It does disappear when imported into a new instantiation of my iCloud library on macOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Try to import one of the problematic images.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Photo is in my iCloud Photo Library\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Photo appears in library briefly, but then soon vanishes, and cannot be found anywhere.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- Photos Version 3.0 (3231.11.210) â€“ macOS 10.13.1 Beta (17B46a)\r\n- Photos on iOS 11.1 Beta 3\r\n- The library is also synced to a version of Photos 2.0 on macOS 11.12.\r\n- This problem has been occurring for a number of months, with occasional exports from VSCO."
