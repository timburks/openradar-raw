    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur product supports PDFs with annotations/links. The borders are hidden when viewing the documents with page annotations (annotation.border.width = 0) settings. This is the same behavior used by QuickLook/Preview in iOS and macOS where annotation borders (with colors) are just hidden.\r\n\r\nWhen the user opts to share the document via Email, the preview is currently broken when the document has annotations with borders. The layout is just wrong with borders drawn everything in wrong locations. See the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nWe use standard MessageUI or document interactions to share the documents.\r\n\r\nNote this is an iOS (Mail/Preview) issue as everything looks OK in macOS Mail. Also note that PDFView is OK when drawing annotation borders, this is just an issue when showing previews.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached document using iOS and use MessageUI framework to share it. Even easier, just open the attached screenshot. The borders are drawn incorrectly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe annotation borders should be hidden (Preview) or drawn correctly (macOS Mail).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layout is drawn incorrectly when the document has annotations with borders.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.1 (15B93) but this is broken since the first 11 betas.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
