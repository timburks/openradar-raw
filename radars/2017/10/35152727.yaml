    description: "Summary:\r\nThe version of iconutil that ships with macOS High Sierra fails to include 16x16 pixel icons that are generated with the \"-c icns\" flag.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlace correctly named icons, including one named \"icon_16x16.png\" in a folder named \"source.iconset\". Run \"iconutil -c icns -o generated_on_10.13.icns source.iconset\". Check generated_on_10.13.icns in Preview.app. The 16x16 pixel icon is missing.\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly fine on 10.12 and I've also included a sample .icns file that was generated on 10.12 using the same invocation of iconutil.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 16x16 pixel icon should be included in the generated .icns file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 16x16 pixel icon is missing from the generated .icns file.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.1 Beta (17B45a)"
