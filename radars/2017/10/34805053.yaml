    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom Mail on iOS, you can inadvertently active the search controller without tapping the search bar. After activating the search controller manually, the search controller can be activated simply by canceling a back swipe gesture.\r\n\r\nSee attached video for details.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Mail.app\r\n2. Select any mailbox\r\n3. Pull down to reveal the search bar\r\n4. Use the back gesture to peek at the root view but don't commit to popping the current view controller. Allow current view controller to snap back (canceling the pop action)\r\n5. Select the search bar to active the search controller and present the keyboard\r\n6. Select Cancel\r\n7. Now repeat Step 4\r\n8. The search controller becomes active after canceling the swipe back gesture.\r\n9. This behavior persists for the app's lifetime\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search controller isn't activated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search controller is activated as if you tapped on the search bar\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1 beta 1\r\n\r\nThis issue was first introduced in iOS 11 betas.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 - iOS 11.1 beta 1"
