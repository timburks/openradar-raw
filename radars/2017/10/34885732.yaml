    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have a code with placeholders Tab key is used to navigate placeholders. That’s fine. Although if I want to increase indentation of another line of code, placeholders steal Tab keypresses and indentation is not increased.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open .m source file in Xcode\n2. Create a new method body or go to existing one\n3. Use some snippet to generate some code with placeholders. dispatch_after is just fine.\n4. Go to any line not affected by code generated in 3.\n5. Press Tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIndentation of the respective line increases.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor jumps to the first placeholder of the code generated in 3. This didn’t happen before Xcode 9, probably a regression introduced by the new code editor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
