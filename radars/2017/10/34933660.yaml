    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWKWebview does not correctly dismiss its long-press action sheets (e.g. link actions, image actions) on iOS 11+ when the web view is contained in a modally presented view controller. Immediately following the action sheet dismissal, the modally presented view controller containing the web view is also dismissed.\r\n\r\nChoosing \"Share...\" from the web view's long-press action sheet causes another sheet to be presented, but the app will crash when this second sheet is dismissed. As far as I can tell this is because WebKit internally keeps a reference to the original modally presented view controller which is no longer valid since the controller was dismissed along with the first action sheet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Present view controller modally containing a WKWebView\r\n2. Navigate WKWebview to any page with a tappable link\r\n3. Long-press any link in the web view\r\n4. Tap \"Share...\" in the action sheet\r\n5. Tap \"Cancel\" in the share sheet\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShare sheet is dismissed normally and modally presented view controller hierarchy (including web view) remains presented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nModally presented view controller hierarchy is dismissed when choosing \"Share\" and the app crashes after the share sheet is dismissed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nAll versions of iOS 11.0+ including 11.1 beta 2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAny iPhone model (untested on iPad)"
