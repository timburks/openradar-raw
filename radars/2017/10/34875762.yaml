    description: It would be really great if we could speed up unit test execution by parallelizing execution across simulators or processes. Most of my tests don't even touch globals like the main UIApplication or then key window, so it's definitely possible. Running a test suite on a non-complicated app right now can take minutes, but Apple has the ability to lower that time to mere seconds through aggressive caching and dependency resolution (to determine which tests can be run in parallel). Developers don't run tests when the test runs take too long, and the quality of their apps subsequently suffers. Apple has the opportunity to improve the developer experience and the quality of iOS software by drastically improving test run time.
