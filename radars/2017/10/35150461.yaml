    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nA developer can use runtime tools to load in a private framework and class to present an internal view controller that asks the user for their Apple ID information. And, method swizzling can be used to override the code that runs when the user clicks \"Sign-In\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project. Run the code, and notice the how the iCloud login screen can easily be presented. And, see GitHub page for an in-depth explanation: https://github.com/anthonya1999/iCloud-Phishing/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe framework or class in the project needs an entitlement for the view controller to be presented (no one should be able to present the view controller this easily).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller can easily be shown and modified to phish users.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 (reproducible back as far as iOS 10 as far as I can tell)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device"
