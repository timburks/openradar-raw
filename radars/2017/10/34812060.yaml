    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary: Versions of the iOS simulator for anything other than 11.0 and 11.1 use GMT instead of the macOS time zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Launch the iOS simulator for a release older than 11.0 on High Sierra 10.13.0 or 10.13.1 (17B25c).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: It expected that the iOS simulator will use the time zone of the macOS environment where it is running.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Except for the iOS 11.0 and 11.1 simulators, the simulator time zone is GMT. This only occurs on High Sierra.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode Version 9.0 (9A235) and 9.1 (9B37)"
