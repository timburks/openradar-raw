    description: "I'm the author of \"Swiftify for Xcode\" Extension:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftify-for-xcode/id1183412116?mt=12\r\n\r\n\"Swiftify for Xcode\" was created to automate migrating Objective-C code to Swift, as covered in \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/Migration.html\r\n\r\nThis involves updating the Objective-C bridging header file (ProjectName-Bridging-Header.h).\r\n\r\nCurrently, users of \"Swiftify for Xcode\" have to manually update the Bridging Header file after converting a pair of Objective-C files to Swift.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: provide an API for Xcode Source Editor extensions to access and update any file included in the Xcode project."
