    description: "A test-on-save feature would greatly enhance the developer experience of writing unit-tested code. Please consider: the developer hits âŒ˜S and the file they're working on is saved. Xcode picks up on the change and runs the tests for that file. Maybe if \"ViewController.swift\" changed, then \"ViewControllerTests.swift\" will be run. Or we could be fancy and figure out the types in the changed file, and all the files that use that type, and queue up all those tests. \r\n\r\nThe point is: I'd like to automate the feedback cycle when writing unit tests."
