    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the default keyboard shortcut to invoke Refactor -> Rename... from the primary editor always opens the refactor UI in the Assistant editor. Even if the Assistant editor is closed when the command is invoked, it opens the UI in the Assistant editor. This is incongruent from invoking via ⌘+Click interface on a symbol, or right-click -> Refactor -> Rename... on a symbol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Xcode project. Single view app is fine. Go to default ViewController.swift file, place cursor on the ViewController symbol, and invoke the Rename command via the keyboard shortcut (⌥⌘R). Observe that the rename UI is opened in the assistant editor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRename UI should open in whatever editor the command is invoked from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRename UI always opens in Assistant editor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)"
