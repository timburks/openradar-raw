    description: "It would be really cool when running unit tests in Xcode, if there were a way to only run unit tests related to files that have been modified since the last git commit. Consider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- I've modified ViewController.swift (not tests)nand ModelTests.swift (tests).\r\n- Xcode discerns that only ViewControllerTests.swift ModelTests.swift should be run.\r\n\r\nThis would significantly decrease the amount of time developers spend waiting for feedback about the code that they've changed. Faster tests would lead to developers running tests more often, and would greatly improve the TDD red/green/refactor cycle."
