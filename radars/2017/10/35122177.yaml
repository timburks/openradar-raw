    description: "Summary:\r\nSummary:\r\nEver since High Sierra, now on High Sierra 10.13.1 beta 3, I am having immense trouble with retina MacBookPro 15\" early 2014 2.8Ghz. Several times a day, but often in conjunction with slightly more graphics intense tasks (Photos, Apple Motion, Xcode+Simulator, External Screen), the WindowServer (?) hangs increasingly until not usable any more. \r\n\r\nI identified following workarounds, that temporarily mitigate the issue, but sometimes only minutes later it starts again:\r\n- detaching or re-attaching external screen\r\n- changing screen resolution\r\n- force quitting window server\r\n- restarting the machine\r\n\r\nIn the following scenarios I also had visual corruption:\r\n- using Apple Motion\r\n- using apple TV as Airplay Display\r\n- using Xcode\r\n\r\nThis is critical, I cannot work like this, what should I do?\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Work with your mac as always, or\r\n- Start and close apple motion a few times, or\r\n- Browse through large Photos in Photos.app\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing should ever hang, Graphics should not be corrupted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt some point, It might start hanging, mouse mostly still moving, sometimes loses frames too. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.1 Beta (17B42a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo me this looks like some memory leak in the metal/graphics drivers\r\nI have the impression that 10.13.1 beta 2 was better than 10.13.0 and 10.13.1 beta 3, but not entirely sure."
