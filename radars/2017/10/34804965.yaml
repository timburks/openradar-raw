    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nLast week after we started to use APNS HTTP/2 API (originally we use their legacy API) to send notifications to Yahoo Mail, and some users started to complain that they cannot receive notification, even though we have successfully delivered the notification to APNS HTTP/2 and get 200 response. Looks like those devices are left in some odd state after we migrated the traffic from legacy API to HTTP/2 API. One workaround we figured out is to uninstall/reinstall the app to get a new APNS push token, but I'm not sure if this the right solution and if this can address all user's problem.\r\n\r\nThe apps I'm talking about are 'com.yahoo.Aerogram' and 'com.yahoo.Aerogram-dogfood'.\r\n\r\nOne specific example is for 'com.yahoo.Aerogram-dogfood', push token '6138bceff6041383d3f7df5c28261bcc6e786d89803e47cf681cd85405dd9614', we keep get 200 today from both the legacy APNS API and the new APNS HTTP/2 while the user get nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUser should continue to receive notification, or we should get a new token from App and get error from APNS when we keep sending notification to the old token.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe App still get the same token, when we send notification to APNS it also return success, while user get nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
