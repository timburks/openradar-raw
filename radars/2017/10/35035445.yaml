    description: "FWIW, this is the first bug I have filed on here. Copied and pasted my bug report from: https://bugreport.apple.com/web/?problemID=35035445\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe crash is taking place when I use the Xcode menu to take a screenshot of a connected device (Debug > View Debugging > Take Screenshot of [device]). Specifically, if you try to take consecutive screenshots. This happened with Hazel running and not running, so I don't think that is conflating the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a device and select it in Xcode\r\n2. On the device, choose the Notes, Mail, or Safari app so it appears on the device screen\r\n3. Go to Debug > View Debugging > and click \"Take Screenshot of [device]\"\r\n4. Repeat step 3\r\n5. Crash!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to take the second screenshot even though I took another screenshot right before it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes when I attempt to take the second screenshot. The second screenshot is never actually captured. I have not tested all apps, obviously, but this reproduces when the connected device is running the iOS Notes, Mail, and Safari apps, as well as when using the app I test (Circle by Swedish, and our related apps). It does not reproduce if I am running the App Store app though.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.1 (13531)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nModel: MacBookPro13,3, BootROM MBP133.0226.B25, 4 processors, Intel Core i7, 2.6 GHz, 16 GB, SMC 2.38f7\r\nGraphics: Radeon Pro 460, AMD Radeon Pro 460, PCIe, 4096 MB\r\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 530, Intel HD Graphics 530, Built-In\r\nMemory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 8 GB, LPDDR3, 2133 MHz, 0x80CE, 0x4B3445424533303445422D45474347202020\r\nMemory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 8 GB, LPDDR3, 2133 MHz, 0x80CE, 0x4B3445424533303445422D45474347202020\r\nAirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0x15A), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.21.171.130.1a1)\r\nBluetooth: Version 5.0.5f1, 3 services, 27 devices, 1 incoming serial ports\r\nNetwork Service: iPhone, Ethernet, en7\r\nNetwork Service: Wi-Fi, AirPort, en0\r\nUSB Device: USB 3.0 Bus\r\nUSB Device: iBridge\r\nUSB Device: USB2.0 Hub\r\nUSB Device: USB2.0 Hub\r\nUSB Device: USB2.0 Hub\r\nUSB Device: iPhone\r\nUSB Device: iPhone\r\nUSB Device: Nexus 7\r\nUSB Device: USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter\r\nUSB Device: USB3.0 Hub\r\nUSB Device: USB3.0 Hub\r\nUSB Device: USB3.0 Hub\r\nThunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 22.1\r\nThunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 22.1"
