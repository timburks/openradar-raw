    description: "The most common complaint I hear from developers who are resistant to using Interface Builder is that it makes merging difficult.\r\n\r\nOne thing that may improve this is adding a visual diff to the Interface Builder source control workflow.\r\n\r\nFor example, during a source control operation such as a merge or comparison the IBDesignables renderer could be used to produce both \"before\" and \"after\" images. An image-based diff like that provided by Kaleidoscope (https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com) would be shown in the source control window. This would highlight the *visual* changes between the previous revision of a given storyboard vs. the new revision."
