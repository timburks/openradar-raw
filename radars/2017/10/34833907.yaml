    description: "Summary:\r\nExporting pictures that are still loading fails (multiple bugs)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Downloading of the pictures never finished (waited 10 minutes, after app restart they were there)\n2) Dragged photo out, but never finished because of (1)\n3) Dragged out again because I got impatient. Same file, same location. However export action did not consolidate (really doesn’t make sense to queue up the exact same thing twice)\n4) Exiting the app showed a dialog where the counting was wrong. (“Exporting 0 items”)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ndownload should eventually complete (3 pictures on 300 MBit should not need 10 minutes, clearly a status update issue)\ndialog should label things correctly on running operations\noperations should be consolidated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee image and description\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.1b1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
