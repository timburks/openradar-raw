    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached. In my unit tests I create UserDataStorage which has\r\n`storage` property which is a UserDefaults.standard in the app and UserDefaults() in my unit tests. I have written this tests just today and I get the erroneous behaviour: the data does not get deleted. Please let me know what information I can gather to help investigating this. Hopefully my branch will always work even if I move from it for a while.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have preserved this issue in a dedicated branch. I just run the unit tests for my dynamic framework's unit tests. The issue reproduces no less than 5 of 10 test runs. It reproduces on both ways of creating User Defaults object: 1) UserDefaults.standard and 2) UserDefaults().\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce it on a standalone project and could not reproduce it unfortunately.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUserDefaults MUST delete the values!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUserDefaults DOES NOT delete the values in this case!\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
