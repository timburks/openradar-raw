    description: "Summary:\r\nWith an opaque navigation bar there is an unwanted scroll view bounds animation during navigation push/pop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a navigation controller with an opaque navigation bar.\r\n2. Push any view controller containing a top-aligned scroll view, e.g. a UITableViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUINavigationController should not animate scroll view bounds change during push/pop. That is, scroll view content should not move vertically during a horizontal push/pop animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWith UIScrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior set to UIScrollViewContentInsetAdjustmentAutomatic by default UIScrollView's content inset is adjusted to account for the safe area inset. With an opaque navigation bar it looks like it is calculated and set incorrectly, then adjusted correctly within a push/pop animation block.\r\nSetting UIScrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior to UIScrollViewContentInsetAdjustmentNever does help avoid the unwanted animation, but also disables bottom content inset adjustments required for iPhone X.\r\nPlease also see AppDelegate.m in the attached sample project demonstrating the problem.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe bug manifests itself only with an opaque navigation bar. Unless navigationBar.translucent is set to NO, the animation is flawless."
