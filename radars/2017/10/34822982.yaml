    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling WKInterfaceController.presentController(withName:context:) in the action of presentAlert(withTitle:message:preferredStyle:actions:) always fails with console output: Warning: Attempt to present <SPModalViewController: 0x7c1ad170> on <SPInterfaceViewController: 0x7cbe8800> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/jshier/AlertVsModal\n2. Run in watch simulator\n3. Click “Present with Alert” button.\n4. See alert, click “Okay” button.\n5. See warning in Xcode output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nController should be presented properly, as it did in watchOS 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo controller presented, warning printed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding a dispatch main around the controller presentation fixes it on watchOS 4. The demo project has a button demonstrating that."
