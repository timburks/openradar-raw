    description: "I have a more detailed post on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46826381/unified-logging-app-s-info-debug-messages-never-show-up-in-logarchive-file).\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen deploying an app to my iOS device, triggering log collection via _sysdiagnose_, then exploring log messages in `system_logs.logarchive` obtained from iTunes sync, my app has never shown Info / Debug log messages type.\r\n\r\nI am using [Paper Company (Swift)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Logging/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017510-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2) to illustrate my problem. I start to deploy the app to my iOS device running iOS 11.0.3 as-is. The scheme is using Debug Mode. In my case:\r\n\r\n- I always have “Include Info Messages” and “Include Debug Messages” on in Console.\r\n- When I **live stream** my log messages while my app is running tethered to Xcode, I continue to **see all log messages including Info and Debug types on Console**.\r\n- When I trigger **log collection via _sysdiagnose_** and read through `logarchive` file with Console, however, I **never see my app’s Info and Debug messages**. Other messages types, Default, Error, and Fault, continue to show up like when I live stream.\r\n\t- However, I **can still see Info and Debug messages that belong to other system processes**, but not my app’s process.\r\n\r\nPlease see accompanying screenshots. I also attached the sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nBecause of such puzzling behavior, I started to think that it might have to do with system’s configuration. In [Logging documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging):\r\n\r\n> Info-level messages are initially stored in memory buffers. Without a configuration change, they are not moved to the data store and are purged as memory buffers fill. **They are, however, captured in the data store when faults and, optionally, errors occur.** When info-level messages are added to the data store, they remain there until a storage quota is exceeded, at which point, the oldest messages are purged. Use this level to capture information that may be helpful, but isn’t essential, for troubleshooting errors.\r\n\r\nAfter reading that, I have also tried to change the Error type to Fault type, just for the sake of verifying that Info type messages will show up.\r\n\r\n```\r\nos_log(\"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-bomb \U0001F4A3!\", log: ViewController.ui_log, type: .fault)\t// previously .error\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I still don’t see any Info log messages in `logarchive` file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Paper Company (Swift) already uses the `ASSETCATALOG_COMPRESSION` Build Settings. See [Read logs using the new swift os_log api\r\n](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40272910/read-logs-using-the-new-swift-os-log-api)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and Open Paper Company (Swift) app\r\n2. Build and deploy as-is on an iOS 11.0.3 device. I use iPad Pro 2nd Gen.\r\n3. Open Console to Live Stream logs.\r\n4. Tap trees, logs, papers buttons a few times, then tap the bomb.\r\n5. Trigger sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlease see Summary above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlease see Summary above.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13, iOS 11.0.3. Please see screenshot for my MBP info."
