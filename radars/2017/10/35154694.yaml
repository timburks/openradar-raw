    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Xcode 9 simulators, you canâ€™t use the Option key to use two fingers to execute a multi-tap gesture, such as a two-finger triple-tap. This is a regression from Xcode 8.3.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project in Xcode 8.3.3.\r\n2. Run it in the iPhone 7 simulator (for example).\r\n3. Hold the Option key to get into two-touch mode.\r\n4. With the Option key held down, execute a triple-tap anywhere in the app.\r\n5. Observe that the label changes because the triple-tap was recognized.\r\n6. Quit Xcode 8.3.3 and its associated simulator.\r\n7. Open the attached sample project in Xcode 9.\r\n8. Run the project in the iPhone 7 simulator again.\r\n9. Hold the Option key to get into two-touch mode.\r\n10. With the Option key held down, execute a triple-tap anywhere in the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label changes because the two-finger triple tap was recognized.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label does not change because the tap is not recognized. Notice that the translucent circles representing the two fingers also disappear after the first click.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0.1 (9A1004) on macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReproduced in both of these configurations:\r\nXcode 9.0.1 (9A1004) on macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\nXcode 9.1 (9B46) on macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to work around this issue by both rapidly pressing and releasing the Option key, and moving the mouse slightly between clicks. This is tricky, because if you move it too much, it exceeds the minimum allowable movement threshold for the gesture and it is not recognized.\r\n\r\nThis gesture is important because our apps (and many other apps) use it to show a special debug menu in DEBUG builds.\r\n\r\nAttachment also posted at https://cl.ly/nGcc"
