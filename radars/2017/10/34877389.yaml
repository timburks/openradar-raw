    description: "Summary: You cannot find all RAW photos in a Photos library using a Smart Album, unless 100% of RAW+JPEG photos have been set to show their RAW version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a Photos library with two RAW+JPEG photos in it.\r\n2) Create a new smart album: Photo - is - RAW\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe smart album will contain two photos.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe smart album contains zero photos. To make a RAW photo show up, you must select it, edit it, and then set Photos to use RAW as original. It will then show in the album.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nPhotos 3.0 (3201.11.120)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMac OS High Sierra Supplemental Update, but this happens on any Mac running any version of Photos on any version of macOS that supports Photos."
