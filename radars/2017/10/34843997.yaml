    description: "Area:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nBLE Advertisement Events of type ADV_SCAN_IND (0x02) are non-connectable, yet MacOS reports them as connectable. Specifically, the advertisementData[CBAdvertisementDataIsConnectable] value is \"1\".\r\n\r\nAs per Bluetooth Core Specification 4.4.2, \"scannable undirected\" or (ADV_SCAN_IND), 0x02, is a non-connectable event.\r\nSee (https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nGiven any peripheral advertising event ADV_SCAN_IND (0x02), scan on a MacOS machine, handle the discovery and display the value of advertisementData[CBAdvertisementDataIsConnectable].\r\n\r\nCreating a peripheral device in this mode isn't trivial, and can't be done using iOS or MacOS code. If you promise to fix this bug, I will send you a $50 Nordic development kit with the requisite source code installed.\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet of the source code I use on a Nordic nrf51:\r\n\r\n      adv_params.type = BLE_GAP_ADV_TYPE_ADV_SCAN_IND;\r\n      err_code = sd_ble_gap_adv_start( &adv_params );\r\n\r\nYou can also verify this with Bluetooth Explorer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nUpon receipt of an advertising event of type ADV_SCAN_IND, the peripheral's connectability should be noted as FALSE (non-connectable)\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nOnly on receipt of ADV_NONCONN_IND events does MacOS report non-connectable. ADV_SCAN_IND is erroneously reported as connectable.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVerified MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 and HighSierra 10.13"
