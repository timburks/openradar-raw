    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of UISupportedInterfaceOrientations UIInterfaceOrientation can be used to specify the launching interface orientation.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of launch screen storyboard we can use the lack of landscape launch screen images to limit the launching interface orientation to portrait.\r\n\r\nNow with UISupportedInterfaceOrientations & launch screen storyboard, we lose the ability to specify launching interface orientation. It is bad for apps whose initial UI only supports portrait but later presented UI such as an image viewer may support landscape."
