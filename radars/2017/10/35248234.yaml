    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you add a UILabel to a view controller in Interface Builder, set its Lines property to 0, and then embed it in a UIStackView, the stackviews Height is set to 0 and its Width to 409,633.5. Interface Builder then complains that the label needs X position and Y position constraints—understandable, although technically it's the stackview that requires these, not the label. Adding leading and trailing constraints to the stackview, and then pinning it to the centre, vertically, of the superview compounds the issue rather than resolving it—the Y position of the stack view is set to -14,257 and the height 29,181.\r\n\r\nI have included two sample projects: 1 before, and 1 after.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Single View App project in Xcode 9.\r\n2. Open the storyboard and drag a UILabel onto the lone view controller.\r\n3. Add some long text to the UILabel, for example \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla sodales lacus mi. Nam eleifend at mauris eu cursus. Nunc iaculis hendrerit tristique. Praesent pharetra dui sed tincidunt rhoncus\".\r\n4. Set the labels Lines property to 0 in the Attributes Inspector.\r\n5. Select the label, and then click the Embed in Stack button found on the toolbar at the very bottom of Interface Builder.\r\n6. Select the stackview and use the Add New Constraints button to pin it to the leading and trailing edges of the superview.\r\n7. Use the Align button the pin the stackview to the vertical centre of the superview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe stackview should appear pinned to the vertical centre of the view controller and derive a proper height from the label, just as it did in Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe stackview does appear pinned to where it should be, but now has a height of 29,181 and a y position of -14,257, and the label doesn't display any text.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)\r\nXcode 9.1 beta (9B46)"
