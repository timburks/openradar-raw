    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter updating to iOS 11 I am forced to sign in with my Apple ID. Then I am confronted with four lengthy legal documents I have to agree to. Then I am forced to provide an iCloud Keychain Security Code. I have no idea what that is, and  can find no reference to it in Keychain Access. So I select \"I forgot\" and it says check your other devices, but I have three other devices and none of them say anything. So I think, maybe I need to set up two-factor authentication on these, but that leads to a morass of unhelpful error messages consuming my every device. Now I am stuck, and unable to use my test device. Thanks to Bug # 34456779 I also cannot use the simulator. That means I am pretty much unable to work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI went to iTunes and it said upgrade to iOS 11.0.1, but then I went to settings on the device, and it said upgrade to iOS 11.0.2, which seemed better, so I went with that.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade went great. The problem is the welcome experience. It's a nightmare that fails around the corner cases that become more likely the longer you've been around, punishing that loyalty.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the update was finished it used to feel like a good decision. The nascent operating system would play a song and a video that felt like it was welcoming us to the future, and we were excited to be a part of it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll the fun and legal tedium of going through a divorce, knowing your old life is gone, and hoping your new life at least includes most of your stuff.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.0.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 6 Plus"
