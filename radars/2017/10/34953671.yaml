    description: Wanted to clean out old completed reminders. Doing so caused Reminders to become non responsive for half an hour or more, using 99% of the CPU, and consuming upwards of 12 GBs of RAM. After completing, it only released a portion of this memory. It is now the next day, and Reminders is still showing memory use of 7.35 GBs.
