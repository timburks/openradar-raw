    description: "Summary:\r\nUser cannot drag images from Photos.app to a WebView component in any other application. This used to work, but was broken with a particular Photos or macOS 10.12.x update around April 2017. It's still not working as of macOS 10.13. Many popular applications built around WebViews are effected by this, e.g. HipChat, Slack or our own GarageSale (eBay listing composer). Also, websites that allow image drags cannot receive images from Photos.app via Drag&Drop when using Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download and built our example app from \r\nhttps://github.com/iwascoding/DragDropWebkit\r\n1. Open Photos.app\r\n2. Drag an image from Photos to the WebView in the provided example app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Host app receives drag notification \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Host app does not receive drag notification.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS X 10.13.0\r\nPhotos.app v 3.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
