    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the default address includes an S/MIME cert and the emails are signed by default, the email is still signed with the default cert even if an Outgoing rule changes the From address and thus makes the signature invalid.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure S/MIME email signing for the default From address.\nConfigure an outgoing rule that changes the From address if some criterion is met (e.g. a specific To-address).\nSend an email that is caught by the Outgoing rule.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app should remove the S/MIME signature if the new From address doesn't have an associated S/MIME cert. If it has a different S/MIME cert, it should sign the email based on that different cert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe signature based on the default From-address is kept. Because the From-address is changed, the signature doesn't correspond to the From-address and the recipient is alerted that the signature is invalid.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3 (3273)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
