    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen one attempts to use Refactor > Extract All Occurrences or Extract Variable\n\nand then changes one’s mind, it should be easier to cancel the proposed refactoring\n\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a piece of code to refactor.\n2. Select Refactor.\n3. Select either Extract Method, Extract Variable or Extract All Occurrences.\n4. Press Escape to abort the refactoring.\n\nXcode interprets this as accepting the default (or current) name of the new entity (which is nonsense because the name is horrible) and you need to Undo to get back to the previous state.\n\nAlternatively,\n4. Press ⌘Z to abort the refactor.\n\nIn this case, Xcode deletes the newly inserted entity, but leaves the original code still selected, so continuing to type causes you to create a reference to something that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPressing Escape when Xcode is asking you to name a new entity created via refactoring should abort the Refactoring step entirely and restore the original code. It should not be necessary to Undo anything.\n\nPressing ⌘Z while Xcode is asking you to name a new entity created via refactoring should only abort changes you made to the new entity’s name. I.e. changing `extractedFunc` to `blah` and then hitting ⌘Z should return you back to `extractedFunc`.\n\nBonus points: touch bar support during refactoring would help.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll kinds of bad stuff happens. when trying to cancel a refactor (as described above).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI additionally attempted to record a screen cast of Xcode’s behavior in this circumstance, but because QuickTime Player overtakes the touch bar, there’s no more Escape button for me to press while recording."
