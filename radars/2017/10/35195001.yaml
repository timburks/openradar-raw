    description: "I'm the author of \"Swiftify for Xcode\" Extension:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftify-for-xcode/id1183412116?mt=12\r\n\r\nObviously, after the Xcode extension converts Objective-C files (i.e. MyFile.h and MyFile.m) and creates a Swift file (MyFile.swift), we need to remove Objective-C files from the current target and add a Swift file to the target instead.\r\n\r\nCurrently, users of \"Swiftify for Xcode\" have to manually create a new output Swift file, then remove Objective-C files from the project and add Swift files to the project.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: provide an API for Xcode Source Editor extensions to:\r\n1) Add a file (that already exists) to the target currently selected in the Xcode UI;\r\n2) Remove a specified file from the currently selected target, or from all targets (without deleting the physical file)."
