    description: "Although it has not been explicitly mentioned anywhere in the documentation (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging?language=objc) or the WWDC talk (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/721/), it seems that Console doesn't contain the file and line number information when viewing log messages on it.\r\n\r\nAs discussed here in Apple Dev Forum (https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/69113), an Apple forum staff Eskimo explicitly said that he/she doesn't know how to view file / line number from Console.\r\n\r\nI'm glad that terminal's live streaming can now display the file and line number. I don't see why it shouldn't do the same when live streaming through the console.\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding this information to the console too. Thanks!"
