    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a drag hovers over a UIPageController that's configured to scroll horizontally, it will randomly scroll, often into blank space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen and run the attached project\r\nDrag the view a little (the bug does not trigger if the page controller has never been scrolled)\r\nSelect the text in the text-field\r\nHold it do start a drag\r\nWiggle the drag over the screen for a few seconds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page-controller should not respond to the hovering drag.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page-controller rapidly scrolls by some offset - often the page width, sometimes less. This often takes it into blank space.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)\r\niOS SDK 11.0"
