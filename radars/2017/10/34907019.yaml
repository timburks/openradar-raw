    description: "Summary:\r\nOur customers report that after an in-app purchase of a renewable subscription, the subscription is not visible/active. \nThe subscription is not visible/active even after \"[[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] restoreCompletedTransactions]\" is called.\nInspecting the receipt of the App shows that no in-app purchases are stored in the receipt.\nOnly deleting the app and re-downloading it from the AppStore resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an app with an auto-renewing subscription.\n2. Buy a subscription in-app purchase - we've only seen this from customers in the production environment.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReceipt on the customer's device should contain the subscription.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReceipt does not renew, app does not see that the subscription was purchased. Even after \"restoring purchases\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Version 10.13 (Build 17A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe haven't noticed a pattern, yet. Our customers can send us debugging informations and this includes the receipts so we know for sure that the renewed subscriptions are not in the receipt files. See the attached receipt."
