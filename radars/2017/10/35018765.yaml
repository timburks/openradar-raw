    description: "Summary:\r\nAdditional package's RestartAction is ignored when the package is installed as part of a NetInstall workflow that also installs macOS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch System Image Utility.\r\nSelect \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" as a source.\r\nChoose to make a NetInstall nbi.\r\nAdd a signed package that requires a restart to the install.\r\nCopy the resulting nbi to a NetBoot server\r\nBoot a client from the nbi and Install macOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmacOS should be installed, the additional package should be installed, and the machine should restart.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmacOS is installed and the additional package is installed, but the machine is not restarted.\r\n\r\nThe package I used for this contains some LaunchDaemons that would normally be loaded at restart. Since the machine is not restarted, the LaunchDaemons are not loaded. The user goes through Setup Assistant and creates an account and logs in and the expected LaunchDaemons are not running.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 Build 17A405\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD"
