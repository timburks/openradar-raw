    description: "Summary:\r\nThe cat emoji should offer common coat colors and patterns the same way it offers human skin / hair / eye color patterns. This same idea applies to other animals, but also objects like the \"hot beverage\" icon, whose tone should reflect for example the addition of milk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be grateful for skin tones that better match what you are trying to express.\r\n2. Expect similar variations for other things you are trying describe.\r\n3. Talk about it on social media a bunch (optional)\r\n4. File a radar like good engineer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReally, it works exactly the same way. For each object on the emoji keyboard, the variants should be available as easily as an accented vowel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApparently people in Cupertino only drink their coffee black.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAnything that shows emoji.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPeople love emoji. Apple's emoji are the best. Let's keep that competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAnything that shows emoji."
