    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, when I attach my two displays to my MacBook macOS becomes totally unresponsive for around a minute. You can still move the cursor, but nothing can be interacted with in the system. The system is just beachballing, and the beach ball is really laggy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attach two external displays to a MacBook.\r\n2. The bug may appear after the system switches the display mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAttaching displays should not cause my system to hang for about a minute.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system does hang for a minute.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra (17A362a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nrMBP (early 2015) 13\", i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached a video showing the issue and a sysdiagnose that has been started right when the issue happened. The issue happened around 10:40pm."
