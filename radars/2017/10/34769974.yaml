    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUpgrade to iOS11 resets application's permissions to access Photo Library. As a result, application will try to request permissions again during background activities. \r\nHowever, requesting permissions while in background lacks context since permission request for the application can be displayed while user is in completely different application or on springboard screens. This increases chances of users dismissing access to Photo library for an application therefore suppressing background functionality and as result decreasing utility of the application until user runs application in foreground to restore an access. For certain classes of applications like media backup applications it means decreased usage and negative user comments in stores.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall any application requiring access to Photo Library and enable access on earlier iOS version. Upgrade device to iOS 11 version. Inspect in iOS settings for this application that it now does not have an access to Photo Library. Launch application and notice that it requests access to Photos again. If application has background functionality accessing Photo Library, access permission to access Photos is being shown to the users outside of context (while other application is in use, or user is on springboard screens - see attached screenshot), which increases likelihood of user denying access for an application to Photo Library.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccess to Photos Library should not be removed during upgrade. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccess to Photos Library reset during upgrade.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device upgrading from earlier iOS versions to iOS11"
