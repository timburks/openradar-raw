    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Music app on watchOS has two ‘sessions’ or targets. One where it has the infos from the iPhone and it works similar to a remote, one where it has the Watch’s local session.\n\nNow that the Watch becomes more and more of a stand alone device, especially with the cellular model being available now, this is somewhat confusing. As a user, I want to choose the music I listen to from my Watch. The fact that it uses the phone as an optimization when it is in range is awesome, but it is confusing that I need to think about this. What I would prefer (and I think it would be much easier to understand, yet I understand the technical problem) is that I use the Watch to select songs. If the iPhone is in reach it uses it and my headphones are connected to my iPhone. As soon as the Watch and/or the headphones loose connection to my iPhone, the Watch should take over, using WiFi if possible. If I then also loose connection to WiFi the Watch should switch to LTE and continue playing.\n\nI think it would be okay if the music stopped for a bit when switching connections, or even if it would stop completely and I needed to tap play again. But what currently happens is that it stops and then when you hit play it starts playing something different because it switched over to the Watch and this has its own queue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.1b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
