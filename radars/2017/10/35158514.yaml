    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n~1-pixel gray border around video shows up on iPhone 6/6s/7/8 Plus devices physically but not SE, or non-Plus 6/6s/7/8. If you take a screenshot of it, resulting screenshots will not have the gray border. Suspect it's a scaling factor because Plus devices have nativeScale that is not the same as scale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInsert a UIView with an AVPlayerLayer into a VC or use AVPlayerViewController and contain the VC + use the view. Don't use same frame as parent view (i.e. fixed size video in middle of view) Attached Zip has a reproduction program split in two tabs, one being the AVPlayerViewController the other being AVPlayerLayer. Included videos at 2x and 3x are both just plain white, to demonstrate the bug more clearly. Launch sample app on a Plus device.\r\n\r\nChanging playerLayer's shadowOpacity does nothing. Changing playerLayer's videoGravity does nothing. Changing playerLayer's borderColor to UIColor.clear.cgColor does nothing. Changing playerLayer's borderWidth to 0 does nothing. Forcing playerLayer's contentsScale to match UIScreen.main.scale does nothing. Etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo border around playing video.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBorder around playing video. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nKnown: iOS 11.0.2 15A421, 11.0.3 15A432, and I've seen it on iOS 10\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 7 Plus,  iOS 11.0.3 15A432"
