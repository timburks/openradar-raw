    description: "Summary:\r\nI made a mistake in my types and rather than getting useful compiler errors, I started getting Segmentation Fault: 11 errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI had much more code but the following snipped illustrates the issue\r\n\r\n    func badTypes() {\r\n\r\n        let sequence:AnySequence  = AnySequence() { AnyIterator() { [3] }}\r\n        let array = [Int](sequence)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI was trying to create an array out of Sequence but had mixed up my types and sequence was actually a sequence of [Int] rather than Int.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second line should generate a compiler error something along the lines of \"The type [Int] can't be converted to type Int\" or \"AnySequence  can't be converted to AnySequence \"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSeg Fault: 11\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXCode Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13"
