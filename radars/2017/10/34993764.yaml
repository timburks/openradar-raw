    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nWhen using an iPad with a hardware keyboard (like the Smart Keyboard), it's difficult to use keyboard shortcuts in multi-tasking environment.\r\n\r\nWhen I have two apps side-by-side in split view (or slide over), only the app that last received keyboard input has keyboard focus (only on that app I can press, say, Cmd+N to trigger some action).\r\n\r\nTo move that keyboard shortcut focus to the other app, it's necessary to first trigger the keyboard on that app.\r\n\r\n**It should be possible to just tap the other app wherever to move the focus, so I can use keyboard shortcuts on it**.\r\n\r\nThis would make productive work on iPad much better."
