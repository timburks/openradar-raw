    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce a user grants an app access to your camera, it can\r\n- access both the front and the back camera\r\n- record you at any time the app is in the foreground\r\n- take pictures and videos without telling you\r\n- upload the pictures/videos it takes immediately\r\n- run real-time face recognition to detect facial features or expressions\r\n\r\nWithout telling the user when doing so.\r\n\r\nFull blog post available on https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-watchuser-access-both-iphone-cameras-any-time-your-app-is-running\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an app that requests camera access and then access the camera any time without telling the user, see sample project https://github.com/KrauseFx/watch.user for the most up to date code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should have control over when the camera is recoding.\r\n\r\nSome ways to fix this:\r\n- Offer a way to grant temporary access to the camera (e.g. to take and share one picture with a friend on a messaging app), related to detect.location.\r\n- Show an icon in the status bar that the camera is active, and force the status bar to be visible whenever an app accesses the camera\r\n- Add an LED to the iPhone’s camera (both sides) that can’t be worked around by sandboxed apps, which is the elegant solution that the MacBook uses\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app can record the user any time the app is in the foreground\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
