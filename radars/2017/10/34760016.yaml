    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating tabs or using the new Show All Tabs feature in 10.13's Terminal, the window shrinks by a few rows each time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new Terminal window.\r\n2. Press Command-I or otherwise turn on display of the Terminal's rows.\r\n3. Press Command-T to open a new tab.\r\n4. Observe the number of rows.\r\n5. Press Command-Shift-\\ repeatedly to toggle Show All Tabs. \r\n6. Observe the number of rows.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The number of rows does not change.\r\n2. Ideally if the window starts against the bottom edge of a screen, it would grow toward the top of the screen when adding a tab bar, to avoid the window displaying partially off the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The number of rows shrinks by a few when the tab bar shows.\r\n2. The number of rows shrinks by a few for every invocation of Show All Tabs, until the terminal is 1 row high.\r\n3. There are also several obvious cosmetic issues with Show All Tabs (e.g. the tab bar animation is not smooth, \"popping\" a few pixels at the end; title bar shading changes; window corners are squared off)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTerminal 2.8/400\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is a regression from 10.12's Terminal (2.7.3/388.1.1) when displaying the tab bar; 10.12's Terminal did not have the Show All Tabs feature.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://sabi.net/temp/34760016/shrinking%20Terminal.mov"
