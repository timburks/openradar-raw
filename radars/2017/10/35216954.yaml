    description: "Clustering in MKMapView works perfectly first time when you add annotations but if you try to remove all the annotations and add the same annotations again you can see some NOT clustered annotations overlapping cluster annotations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add annotations with defined clusteringIdentifier to MKMapView -> The annotations are displayed clustered, all is ok\r\n2. Remove the annotations and add them again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome annotations are displayed over the cluster annotations, some annotations are intersected with cluster annotations, a lot of glitches with displaying of the annotations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo overlapping and intersecting annotations like on first render\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXCode Version 9.0.1 (9A1004)\r\niOS version 11.0.3 (15A432)"
