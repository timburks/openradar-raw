    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFinder context menu function \"Compress...\" does not work when in a MacOS package. The malfunction was first found when trying to compress dSYMs inside xcarchive, later found to be reproducible in other kinds of packages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go inside some kind of MacOS package through \"Show package contents\". Tested with \"xcarchive\" and \"app\".\r\n2. Select any content inside the package, folder(s), set of files, or a single file like \"Info.plist\".\r\n3. Select context menu function \"Compress...\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProgress dialog appears briefly, zip file is created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProgress dialog appears indefinitely, per attached screenshot. No progress is happening, zip is not produced.\r\n\r\nNOTE 1: step 1 *probably* has to be a 3rd party software, or a created package like xcarchive. The bug is NOT reproducible (i.e. compress works) in MacOS's default app packages, like Mail or Safari.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2: equivalent commandline 'zip' in the same folder works normally."
