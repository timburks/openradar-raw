    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the system has been hibernated, restoring from the sleep image file fails, or may prompt for the FileVault key on a system using FileVault disk encryption, even with the \"DestroyFVKeyOnStandby\" pmset option set to 0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0) set the pmset option \"hibernatemode\" to 15 (non-essential, but allows faster testing)\r\n1) close the lid, use the \"Sleep\" option in the Apple Menu, or wait for the sleep timeout\r\n2) allow time for the system to write to /var/vm/sleepimage and power down / go to sleep\r\n3) wake the computer from hibernation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe computer should resume from the sleep image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter waking the computer, it will either:\r\na) fail to restore from the sleep image and proceed with a cold boot\r\nb) prompt for the FileVault key before restoring from the sleep image\r\n\r\nAfter restoring from the sleep image in case b), Wi-Fi will require a power cycle to restore network connectivity.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.1 Beta (17B42a). This behaviour was also observed in a previous (Beta 2) build of 10.13.1.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2016 MacBook Pro 15\". Using the APFS filesystem with FileVault enabled."
