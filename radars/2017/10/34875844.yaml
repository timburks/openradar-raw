    description: "When writing tests, I often have to create \"mocks\" of classes within my app. Mocking is a really common technique used in the Ruby and JavaScript communities but isn't used much in Swift or Objective-C. The most popular mocking library is open source: http://ocmock.org\r\n\r\nSo here's what I want from Xcode, out of the box: I want to be able to create mocks of a test subject's dependencies and use dependency injection to give them to the subject. Then I can run the code on the subject and assert that the mock received certain messages. It's cumbersome to describe a hypothetical syntax, so let me provide you with a few tests from a Ruby codebase I maintain.\r\n\r\nit \"handles swiftlint not being installed\" do\r\n  allow_any_instance_of(Swiftlint).to receive(:is_installed?).and_return(false)\r\n  expect { @swiftlint.lint_files }.to raise_error(\"swiftlint is not installed\")\r\nend\r\n\r\nit 'default config is nil, unspecified' do\r\n  allow(@swiftlint.git).to receive(:added_files).and_return([])\r\n  allow(@swiftlint.git).to receive(:modified_files).and_return([\r\n    'spec/fixtures/SwiftFile.swift',\r\n  ])\r\n\r\n  expect_any_instance_of(Swiftlint).to receive(:lint)\r\n    .with(hash_including(:config => nil), '')\r\n    .once\r\n    .and_return(@swiftlint_response)\r\n\r\n  @swiftlint.lint_files\r\nend\r\n\r\nEquivalent tests written in vanilla XCTest are cumbersome, involve extensive subclassing and a tonne of boilerplate. The sad truth is: most developers don't write enough unit tests, and the lack of a decent, first-party mocking library would go a long way to improve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe static nature of Swift, and to some extent of Objective-C, make creating mocks a challenge. But I know you're up to it."
