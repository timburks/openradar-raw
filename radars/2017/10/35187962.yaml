    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary: A renewed certificate, when deployed to a Cisco 802.1x wireless network, is not trusted correctly. The device pinwheels for a time, then prompts for \"Incorrect username/password\". Re-entering the user's credentials brings up another \"Trust Certificate\" prompt, after accepting this the process loops. The only way to reconnect is to completely \"Forget\" the network, and re-join from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Replace Wi-Fi certificate on 802.1x WPA2 Enterprise secured network. Attempt to connect.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Device to prompt for trust of new certificate, then connect to network.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Device prompts to trust new certificate. Pinwheel. Device prompts user for Incorrect Username/Password. Pinwheel. Device prompts to trust new certificate. Process continues to loop.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11 (Any version). Does NOT occur on iOS 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Cisco WLC/ISE. iOS 11 iPhones and iPads (various versions)."
