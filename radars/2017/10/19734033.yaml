    description: "[Closed as duplicate of bug 17373486]\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the Photos Beta, there's no way to sort the Photos view in reverse chronological order. Every time you launch the app, you have to scroll through thousands of images to see the newest ones.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Photos.\r\n2) Attempt to sort in reverse chronological order.\r\n3) Pound head on table in frustration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA program designed to organize one's photos should provide an easy way to get to the most recently taken photos, which are (usually) of more relevance than photos that may literally be 20 years old. Hence, the ability to sort in reverse chronological order is important.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't sort in reverse chronological order.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.0  (203.38.0)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Use iPhoto or Aperture.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs, because the feature is missing."
