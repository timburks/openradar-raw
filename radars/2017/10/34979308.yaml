    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 11, trying to install a configuration profile through MDM will fail when the \"com.apple.applicationaccess\" payload contains \"com.apple.weather\" as a blacklisted application. It will fail to install on an iPad, even though the iPad does not (visibly) have the Weather app.\r\n\r\nThis used to work just fine in iOS 10 or earlier.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this bug is that MDM customers will have existing configuration profiles that are assigned through automated rules, which will now (after upgrading their devices to iOS 11) all of a sudden fail to install, causing their provisioning or configuration workflows to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- try to install the enclosed configuration profile \"Disallow weather app only.mobileconfig\" on a supervised iPad running iOS 11\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the profile only contains a restrictions payload, which only contains the \"blacklistedAppBundleIDs\" value, which only blacklists a single app (namely \"com.apple.weather\") and that app is not even visible on the device, installation of the profile should succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstallation of the profiles fails with the following error:\r\nThe profile “Disallow weather app only” is invalid.The payload “Disallow weather app only” is invalid.The field “blacklistedAppBundleIDs” contains the invalid value “com.apple.weather”.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0.2 (16A421)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOnly happens on iOS 11, works fine on iOS 10 or earlier, so this appears to be a regression in iOS 11."
