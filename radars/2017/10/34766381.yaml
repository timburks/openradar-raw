    description: "Area:\r\nCalendar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCalendar.app does not allow to change the color of an Office 365 calendar for which the user has delegation access to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in with an Office 365 account on https://portal.office.com/ (let's call it \"Delegator User\").\r\n2. Open the Calendar web app.\r\n3. Click the \"Share\" button and grant one of the available access rights except \"Can view when I'm busy\" to another Office 365 account (let's call it \"Delegate User\"). Please see attached \"Delegation levels.png\" for a list of available access rights levels.\r\n4. On a Mac configure the Delegate User account as an Exchange account and enable Calendar synchronisation.\r\n5. Open Calendar.app --> Preferencesâ€¦ --> Accounts and select the \"Delegate Account\" account.\r\n6. Open the Delegation tab and add (+ button) the Delegator User account.\r\n7. Tick the \"Show\" checkbox of the Delegator User entry.\r\n8. A new Delegates section should appear in Calendar's left sidebar with a calendar nested into an item named like the Delegator User (see attached screenshot \"Delegates tree.png\" for an example).\r\n9. Select the delegated calendar and open Edit --> Get Info.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to change the color of the delegated calendar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to change the color of the delegated calendar because the dropdown menu to change the color is dimmed (see attached screenshot \"Calendar Get Info.png\").\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13 (17A365)\r\nCalendar.app 10.0 (2194)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Changing the color of the delegated calendar should change the color only into the Delegate User's Calendar.app (i.e. the change should not reflect on the Office 365 servers, even if Delegate User has read and write access to the delegated calendar)."
