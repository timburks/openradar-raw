    description: "Summary:\r\nA bot produced an iOS app archive, which I’d like to save to my local Xcode Organizer, but it times out every time I try\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run a bot on a remote machine, set to Archive, exporting “Installable Product & Thinned Variants”\r\n2. Locally, after the bot completes, click the Save button for the Archive result, and choose either Save or Show in Organizer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive downloads, and shows in the Organizer\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress bar stalls immediately, and eventually I got a warning dialog that reads “The request timed out.” with no other text\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLocal and remote Xcode’s are both 9.0.1, and I’ve reproduced this from multiple local machines. All Macs are on 10.12.6. I’ve restarted Xcode locally, and restarted the entire remote Mac, with no difference"
