    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen composing a new mail on iOS 11, after attaching a new PDF file of moderate size (~500KB) Mail displays a preview of said PDF, resulting in several seconds lags between keystrokes.\nThis makes writing the mail near impossible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail\n2. Compose a new mail\n3. Attach a PDF of moderate size (around 500KB does the trick for me)\n4. Try typing text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTyping is smooth, each keystroke makes the letter appear on screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTyping is super slow, Mail hangs between each keystroke\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.1 (15A402)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems related to Mail displaying the preview of the PDF. For large PDFs (~20MB) Mail does not display a preview inline, and typing is smooth.\n\nAttached is a PDF which Mail always struggles with."
