    description: "My iCloud Photo library is 120GB.\r\n\r\nMy 256GB iPhone 7 has 132GB of iCloud Photo data on it, I have it set to download originals (I don't want to use the optimize option).\r\n\r\nMy iPhone 7 has plenty of space free still, at 26GB free.\r\n\r\nDespite this every time I get down to around 26GB free iOS warns me that there isn't enough space to download and store originals. I have to them delete other data to free up space.\r\n\r\nThis effectively means I can't use that remaining 26GB of space on my phone for anything, I'm required by iOS to keep it permanently empty. iOS should let me use more of that space for iCloud Photo data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFill iCloud Photos with enough data to leave ~26GB free on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS continues to use the remaining space.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\niOS refuses to use the remaining 26GB for anything useful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect iOS is doing something like trying to keep 10% of space free. Maybe it needs to scale rather that using a fixed percentage.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, 256GB"
