    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you're beta testing an app with TestFlight, and you push an update, your users have find out about the update and then manually go to TestFlight to install the new build. It would be great if, like the App Store, users could enable auto updates for TestFlight, so when a new build was released, they wouldn't have to manually install it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Test a build in TestFlight\n2. Push a new build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new build is installed automatically with the same criteria as the App Store\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new build has to be manually installed, leading many users to not test the newest build, especially if you send multiple testing builds in a week.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\nNotes:"
