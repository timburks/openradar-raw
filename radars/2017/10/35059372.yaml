    description: "Summary:\r\nSecondary screens presented from Control Center icons are not dismissed in the same way control center itself is. The inconsistency can be confusing, because some screens are dismissed by tapping on non-control areas of the UI or pressing the Home button, whereas Control Center is dismissed by swiping down (as hinted by the chevron at the top of the screen)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Display Control Center by swiping up from Springboard\n2. Force-press on an icon (for example, the Airplane icon for Airplane Mode)\n3. Tap on the outer area of the view to dismiss the network controls and observe the view dismiss and return back to Control Center.\n4. Attempt to tap in the same area on Control Center and observe it is not dismissed. It must be dismissed with a swipe gesture.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither:\n1. Swipe gestures should dismiss secondary Control Center screens\n-or-\n2. Tap gestures should dismiss the main Control Center screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe two levels of Control Center screens have different dismiss gestures\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
