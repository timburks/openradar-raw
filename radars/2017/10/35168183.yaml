    description: "Area:\r\nAV Playback\r\n\r\nCurrently the tvOS SDK provides no way of changing the output resolution or mode. Instead, tvOS upscales everything to the systemwide resolution and mode. \r\n\r\nThis works ok in some cases, but there are other cases (depending on the content) that do not work as well. When running into those cases, video looks harsh, highlights are clipped and so on... \r\n\r\nSome users use High-End TV Sets that provide a load of customization options to adjust the upscaling to the users liking. Using the Apple TV 4k defeats the purpose however, because it does the upscaling.\r\n\r\nFor power users it would be great to provide an an API that allows apps to switch the output resolution. This way, apps would be able to output the resolution that is natively available in the source file / stream. \r\n\r\nThis would provide a great quality improvement for users with High-End TV sets. Without this option, the Apple TV 4K is basically not usable for a lot of users, because the output looks noticeably worse that other streaming boxes."
