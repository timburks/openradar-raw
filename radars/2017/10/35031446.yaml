    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode uses the word 'Blame' in its user interface in multiple places. Blame is a word with a strong negative connotation, essentially accusing all people who write code using Xcode of “responsibility for a fault or wrong”.\r\n\r\nThis seems out of place with the usual Apple style of inclusiveness, achievement and encouragement. It also seems out of step with Apple using Xcode in an educational environment to build apps with programs like Everyone Can Code.\r\n\r\nPlease see:  http://jamesdempsey.net/2017/10/17/xcode-whos-to-blame for more explanation regarding reasons why a change of terminology should be considered.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be to use the word 'Author' instead of 'Blame', since it indicates the authorship of code without using a disparaging term.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Xcode project and leave 'Create a git repository'\r\nThere is now a 'Blame view' and 'Show Blame For Line' menu item in the code editor contextual menu and Editor menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would not expect disparaging terms in the interface of an app from Apple. (Even if the term is a meant in an ironic way in the underlying tool git)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode indicates that every line of code is worthy of blame.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0.1 (9A1004)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)"
