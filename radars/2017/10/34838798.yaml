    description: "Summary:\r\nThe same Keychain API calls fail when run in the Simulator in Xcode 9 in unhosted unit tests, but succeed in hosted unit tests, and they succeed in both cases on Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install both Xcode 8.3.3 and Xcode 9.0.\r\n- Clone repository from https://github.com/apontious/Secrets.\r\n- Download and install iOS 9.0, 9.2, 10.0, and 10.2 SDKs.\r\n- Open Xcode 8.3.3.\r\n- Open Secrets project and test (Cmd-U) on all downloaded SDK versions. All tests succeed on all SDK versions.\r\n- Close Xcode 8.3.3 and the 8.3.3 Simulator.\r\n- Open Xcode 9.\r\n- Open Secrets project and test (Cmd-U) on all downloaded SDK versions, and on the iOS 11 SDK included with Xcode 9.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- All tests succeed on all SDK versions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Despite being exactly the same test running on exactly the same downloaded Simulators, only the tests on the iOS 9.* SDKs and the hosted tests on iOS 10 and 11 SDKs succeed under Xcode 9.\r\n\r\nUnder Xcode 9, the iOS 10.* SDKs with the unhosted tests fail with the error -34018Â (\"A required entitlement isn't present\").\r\n\r\nUnder Xcode 9, the iOS 11 SDK with the unhosted tests fail with the error -50 (\"One or more parameters passed to a function were not valid\").\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.0 with iOS 9.*, 10.*, and 11 SDKs.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6"
