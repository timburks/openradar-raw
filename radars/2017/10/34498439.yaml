    description: "Summary: Autocomplete when writing swift code fails most of the time. It simply doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis makes it practically impossible to work in swift.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, Xcode works correctly (and quickly) with Objective-C.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Clean. Build. Work for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Autocomplete continues to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Autocomplete does not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Apple requested logging in two different responses to my ticket, which I provided; subsequently it was then closed as dupe.)"
