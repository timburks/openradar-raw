    description: "I'm the author of \"Swiftify for Xcode\" Extension:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftify-for-xcode/id1183412116?mt=12\r\n\r\nObviously, the Xcode extension that helps to convert Objective-C code to Swift needs to access both header and source files simultaneously to provide a usable output.\r\nCurrently, Xcode Source Editor extensions are limited to accessing a single source file, so the users of the extension have to manually copy contents of .h and .m files into a single file before invoking the extension.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: provide an API to access \"Counterparts\" of the currently edited text, similarly to the \"Counterparts\" button in the Xcode Source Editor toolbar.\r\nFor example, if \"MyViewController.h\" is selected, provide an API to access:\r\n* MyViewController.h\r\n* MyViewController.m\r\n* MyViewController.mm\r\n* MyViewController.swift\r\n\r\nIn addition to \"Swiftify for Xcode\", a lot of Xcode Extensions (such as SwiftLint), as well as former Xcode plugins (not yet converted to extensions, ex. \"Auto-Importer-For-Xcode\"), will benefit from this feature."
