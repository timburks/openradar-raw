    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes displays a dialog box (image attached) asking me to “Sign in to iCloud with your Apple ID” multiple times per day. If this request goes unanswered, say on the Mac mini that I have running iTunes unattended as a “server” source for sharing media to family computers and Apple TVs in the house, the requests queue up such that when I do attend that Mac mini (usually because iTunes has stopped sharing to the Apple TV), I am asked to enter my password again and again and again in successive dialog boxes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWait for iTunes to ask me to sign in. In some cases, let the dialog sit unanswered for a day (because the Mac mini iTunes runs on does pretty much only that, for Home Sharing to Apple TV, and is not a machine that gets interacted with on a regular basis).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI sign in once, and this dialog goes away at least until I reboot the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am asked again and again, with a dialog that blocks iTunes from performing its sharing duties to my Apple TV. So many dialogs pop up in a row that sometimes I have to force quit iTunes to avoid having to keep entering my password over and over for hours.\r\n\r\nOne the one occasion I have tried to actually keep entering my password (2017-10-01), eventually I got a pop-up that my Apple ID had been locked for security reasons. This is an unacceptable response to my attempt to respond to iTunes’ constant demand for my password.\r\n\r\nLest you think that this is the result of entering my password wrong too many times: I am using a password manager, and pasting the correct password into the field each time. When iTunes told me my ID was locked, I logged on the the website with the *same exact, correct password* and your website unlocked my ID again. My password is correct.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.7.0.166, but this behavior has plagued me since many previous versions.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
