    description: "Summary:\r\nSKStoreReviewController doesnâ€™t prevent multiple requests for review from producing multiple presentations of the alert dialog.\r\n\r\nIn the (contrived) example attached, an application opts to present the review prompt after a process has completed, such as posting a photo or refreshing a timeline. Another process completes momentarily that also results in the application requesting a review. If the first prompt is still on screen, the second prompt will be displayed over it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Request a review with SKStoreReviewController.requestReview\r\n2. Shortly after, request a review again\r\n3. Observe multiple dialogs are displayed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe system should track if it is already presenting a review prompt and not display multiple instances of the prompt. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultiple instances of the review prompt are instantiated when multiple requests for review are sent to StoreKit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBased on reading the SKStoreReviewController.requestReview() documentation, this issue may be limited to ad-hoc and developer-signed builds.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview\r\n\r\nSee the attached project for an example that demonstrates this behavior in the iOS 11 simulator. This behavior is also observed in Adhoc builds. It has not been tested with App Store builds."
