    description: "Summary:\r\nI want to scale the `UITabBar` to 50%. Everything seems fine, but when I rotate the device `UITabBar` goes back to its original scale. It looks like iOS 11 is ignoring the `transform` property that was set on `UITabBar` before rotation. The problem does not apply to regular `UIView`. The problem does not occur on iOS 10.3.1.\r\n\r\nSee demo project in the attachment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the app on iOS 11 device.\r\n2. Tap \"Button\" button.\r\n3. Rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`UITabBar` keeps its previous scale. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`UITabBar` goes back to its original scale.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
