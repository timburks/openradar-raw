    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, when connecting a locked iPhone to macOS, iTunes immediately starts and prompts you with a '… could not connect…' modal dialogue. This breaks the focus on whatever window the user was currently working on, and often leaves them hunting for the 'Cancel' button.\n\nInstead, it would be great if iTunes would show an iPhone icon for the locked device, and only tries to connect properly when the user clicks that icon to access their iPhone settings through iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect locked iPhone to computer with macOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* If iTunes is running; shows icon for inaccessible iPhone and does not prompt for a failed connection.\n* If iTunes is not running; nothing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* If iTunes is running, puts iTunes in focus and immediately prompts a `… could not connect…` modal dialogue. If the user chooses 'Cancel', no icon for the device is shown.\n* if iTunes is not running; iTunes starts immediately and then shows the same signs as above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.7.0.166\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a developer, I frequently use Xcode. Since they're somehow linked (still can't update Xcode without closing iTunes), maybe the fact that Xcode is running has something to do with this issue."
