    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you edit settings in the \"Workspace Settings...\" menu, the only setting you can share across multiple user's machines is the \"Build System\" setting. It would be great if all of these settings could be shared. That way you could check in things like \"Show all issues\" to all developers on a team.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Workspace Settings\r\n2. Change to \"Show all issues\"\r\n3. Attempt to have this setting set for all developers on a team\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's some way to check in the \"Show all issues\" and others settings to the workspace's settings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach developer has to individually enable this setting.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith Xcode 8 I tried manually editing the XML hoping that Xcode would pick it up if it was there, but that doesn't seem to be the case either."
