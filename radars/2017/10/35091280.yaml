    description: "Summary:\r\nIn our app we have a custom control conforming to UIKeyInput. It is impossible to make this work with XCUITest's -typeText:, because the control doesn't return the private UIAccessibilityTraitTextEntry / UIAccessibilityTraitIsEditing traits, like UITextField is doing.\n\nBy making all UIAccessibilityTraits public, app developers can provide the same top notch accessibility as UIKit's control do.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Try to make a control have the same traits as UITextField\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- is possible with public API\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Impossible: UITextField uses private traits\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
