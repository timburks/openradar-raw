    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you play a sound in the iOS simulator, the audio session also activates the microphone. This has the side effect of changing the input source from whatever it was previously set to, to the microphone on any connected bluetooth headphones, and often decreasing sound quality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a pair of AirPods to your computer\n2. Start playing some music\n3. Play a sound on the iOS simulator using an AVAudioPlayer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe music keeps playing at the same quality, and the sound plays temporarily over it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe microphone is activated, which leads to worse sound quality of the music that's currently playing.\n\nYou can also see that the microphone is activated using one of these tools:\n\nhttps://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html\nhttps://www.obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated:\n\n- https://discussions.apple.com/message/31255072#31255072\n- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/282705/airpods-extremely-poor-mic-quality-on-mac"
