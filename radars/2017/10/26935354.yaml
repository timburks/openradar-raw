    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode will autocomplete image literals from .xcassets files that are not included in the same target as the source file currently being edited. \r\n\r\nNote the attached screenshot. Only one of those completions is in the same target as the source file. The others will autocomplete and build without error, but will crash at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1"
