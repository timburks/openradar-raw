    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing a UIButton's properties in a Storyboard, Xcode shows stepper boxes under the Size Inspector to edit the `titleEdgeInsets`, `imageEdgeInsets` and `contentEdgeInsets` properties of the button.\n\nWhile these properties allow negative values for their members, it is impossible to input such values directly in the stepper boxes. Having a minus \"-\" sign in the text field will be considered as invalid by Xcode, and one cannot \"tab out\" of the field.\n\nHowever, negative values can be set, using the down arrow button on the right of the field. The negative value is then accepted. So this bug only apply to typing negative values in the field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Storyboard in Xcode\n2. Add a UIButton to a view\n3. Click on the UIButton and navigate to the Size Inspector panel on the right of the window\n4. Input some negative value in one of the fields under \"Button\" (either one of the 12 fields here will behave the same way)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe negative value is accepted, and the inset is set accordingly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value is rejected, Xcode produces an \"error\" sound, and it's impossible to end the field editing with the negative value set\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screen cap of the behavior.\nWhen using the keyboard to enter the value and tabbing away, the focus stay on the field, and the value is never set. When using the steeper buttons, it works as expected."
