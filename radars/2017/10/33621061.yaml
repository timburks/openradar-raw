    description: "I tested switching back and forth between those 2 modes for the numbers 2^X, where X is between 0 and 32, and it ONLY shows up for 2^6\r\n\r\nI made sure to clear the result between each one.\r\n\r\nI'm on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro 15\", but I doubt it's a hardware problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf you enter 2^6 in basic mode in the calculator, you'll be greeted with the correct answer, 64.\r\n\r\nIf you then switch to programmer mode, it will change to 63.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe correct result, 64.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe result is off by 1, negatively."
