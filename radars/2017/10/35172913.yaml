    description: "Summary:\r\nThis happened a few time since I started using Named Colors [1] in my Storyboard in Xcode 9: I make modifications, tweak colors here and there (using named colors) and save. When opening the .storyboard file after that, Xcode prompts a warning dialog saying it found some inconsistency in the file.\n\nEach time its \"Multiple resources have the same name: <Color name here> (See attached screenshot).\n\nAnd checking in a text editor, the file do have the namedColor tag for the color duplicated. Here a diff after Xcode \"repaired\" the storyboard file:\n\n    --- a/EMR/Views/Patient Record/Consultation/Prescription/Prescription.storyboard\n    +++ b/EMR/Views/Patient Record/Consultation/Prescription/Prescription.storyboard\n    @@ -1898,9 +1898,6 @@\n             <namedColor name=\"Lighter Grey\">\n                 <color red=\"0.94901960784313721\" green=\"0.94901960784313721\" blue=\"0.94901960784313721\" alpha=\"1\" colorSpace=\"custom\" customColorSpace=\"displayP3\"/>\n             </namedColor>\n    -        <namedColor name=\"Lighter Grey\">\n    -            <color red=\"0.94901960784313721\" green=\"0.94901960784313721\" blue=\"0.94901960784313721\" alpha=\"1\" colorSpace=\"custom\" customColorSpace=\"displayP3\"/>\n    -        </namedColor>\n             <namedColor name=\"Tonic Orange\">\n                 <color red=\"0.92941176470588238\" green=\"0.47058823529411764\" blue=\"0.23921568627450981\" alpha=\"1\" colorSpace=\"custom\" customColorSpace=\"displayP3\"/>\n             </namedColor>\n\nYou can see the color \"Lighter Grey\" was represented twice in the same file hence the error.\n\n[1] http://martiancraft.com/blog/2017/06/xcode9-assets/#color-assets\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI actually have no idea why this occurs, this seems random but happened a few times since I started using Xcode 9 / Named Colors.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode saves the Named Colors reference just once per color in the .storyboard file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode saves the same colors multiple times in the same file, making it complain the next time it'll parse the file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0.1 (9A1004), macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are a screenshot of the error, and one of the storyboards affected (not the most lightweight of my app, sorry ^^).\n\nAlso, I'm sure it's not caused by a SCM operation, I'm currently working alone on this project and never had a merge on the branch I got the error on :)"
