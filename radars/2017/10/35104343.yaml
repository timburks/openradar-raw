    description: "Ability to detect if a user has enabled DnD on their Mac.  My Org has a very large fleet of Macs that the team I work on manages.   We would like to provide the best possible end user experience possible.   Currently there seems to be no consistent way to detect with code if a user has enabled DnD.   There is a way to detect if it is enabled but it seems to be inconsistent.   Example:\r\n\r\n$ defaults -currentHost read com.apple.notificationcenterui\r\n{\r\n    doNotDisturb = 1;\r\n    doNotDisturbDate = \"2017-10-20 22:01:03 +0000\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n$ defaults -currentHost read com.apple.notificationcenterui\r\n{\r\n    doNotDisturb = 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis works if I manually switch the DnD on in Notification Center.   What doesn't seem to be written to this file is all the options you can set DnD for.   Scheduled DnD time, if a Mac goes into mirrored screen mode on a projector/Apple TV, if an Application goes into Fullscreen mode, etc.    It also doesn't seem consistent across all versions of macOS.\r\n\r\nThere also does not seem to be a native Apple API for this looking through the dev documentation.    \r\n\r\nThe business case for this feature would be the following:\r\n1 - ensure that we never disturb a stakeholder with automation from IT if they have switched on DnD\r\n2 - Mitigate all instances of creating a bad user experience if a user wishes to not be disturbed\r\n3 - Mitigate any failure rates of our workflows where we may depend on an active user session being a dependent.\r\n4 - Allow compliance to the rules the stakeholder sets.   Since there are options in the DnD settings to allow certain notifications through, we would expect those to be respected as the stakeholder sees fit.  We would need to be able to read in what options they have set.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request, and not a bug."
