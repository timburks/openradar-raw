    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34876469\n\nOften, when writing unit tests, developers will introduce bugs into their tests by running code that modifies global mutable state, such as UserDefaults. It would be nice if test files or even individual tests were run in separate processes to make sure a failure to tear down one test doesn't lead to a false positive or false negative in a subsequent test. Randomizing the order of tests runs helps with this, too. See rdar://34873492\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:"
