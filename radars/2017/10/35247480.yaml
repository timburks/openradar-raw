    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nApplication uses tel url scheme and uses \"openURL: options: completionHandler\"  API on UIApplication to open resource(tel://1234) and iOS launches native dialler app to make cellular call. \r\n\r\nIn doing so, first of all iOS shows system UIAlertView to confirm number to be dialled with two buttons \"Cancel\"  and \"Call\".  Call action launches native dialler app and cancel action results in dismissing UIAlertView.  \r\n\r\niOS doesn't provide way to determine what action user has initiated on that system UIAlertView. In case of our application, we would like to decide whether to generate call log entry or not based on user action (Cancel or Call)."
