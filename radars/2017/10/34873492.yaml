    description: "Unit tests should be able to be run based on a random order, to prevent application state from leaking between tests. Ideally, the tests could be run with a seed that is logged, and can be re-used to generate the same order. This isn’t possible in Xcode but it’s pretty integral to the way that developers in Ruby and JavaScript test their code.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider two tests that test code that reads and writes UserDefaults. If the tests are always run in the same order, it’s possible to get false positives order get different results when running only a single test."
