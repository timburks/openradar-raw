    description: "Summary:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/simjp/status/916076963571286016\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI only noticed this happening after replacing the OpenGLES.framework from Xcode 9 beta 2 (I think) to the location for Xcode 9.0 final. Not sure if itâ€™s related though. Also unsure how to trigger the problem from a clean slate. Stopped happening after a few minutes with no configuration changes other than light Tweetbot, Slack and web browser usage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo red bar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRed bar\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niPhone 8 Plus Simulator running iOS 11.0 from Xcode 9.0 (official release)."
