    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter running UI tests from command line using xcodebuild, directory ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Build/ProfileData/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX contains several NNNNN.profraw. All but one of them have a size of zero bytes. The one with non-empty size corresponds to the test runner itself (file name matches with PID of the test runner and `llvm-cov show` shows that code belonging to test runner was executed). The rest have names that match with PID's of the runs of the SUT.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: force saving code coverage by calling __llvm_profile_dump() in the SUT at the end of the test.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project from 'Single View App' template, with UI tests, but without Unit Tests. Language - Objective-C\r\n2. Observe that there is a single scheme named in the same way as a project and the main app target.\r\n3. Enable code coverage in the scheme settings for the 'Test' action.\r\n4. Run UI tests in Xcode\r\n5. Observe that code coverage information is shown in the Xcode\r\n6. Check contents of the folder ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Build/ProfileData/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/\r\n7. Observe that there are two .profraw files, both having non-zero size\r\n8. Remove that folder\r\n9. Run UI tests from the command line, using xcodebuild. With or without '-enableCodeCoverage YES' arguments.\r\n10. Observe that removed folder is created again and contains two .profraw files, but one of them has a size of zero bytes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRunning UI tests from command line should produce code coverage\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.profraw files created by runs of SUT have zero sizes. Coverage.profdata contains information only about test runner, but not about SUT itself.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.0\r\nBuild version 9A235\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nClosed as duplicate of rdar://29653052"
