    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if XCBuild cannot delete a \"stale file\" because it doesn't exist, it throws a warning in the build log. It seems like, since the file doesn't exist already, this shouldn't be a warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build a project where XCBuild is attempting to remove stale build files\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are no warnings if they don't exist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEven though the files are already gone, XCBuild warns that they cannot be deleted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached build log for an example"
