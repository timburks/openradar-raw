    description: "Area:\r\nCore Animation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt turns out the CATiledLayer class doesn't support the Display P3 colorspace yet. While rendering content, it always creates a sRGB graphics context.\r\nNow display P3 colorspace support becomes more common and CATiledLayer is often used for displaying large images on screen, this is quite a problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a view with a CATiledLayer backing layer and render a P3 image from the draw(_ rect:) method. When running on a device that supports wide color gammut, printing the context's colorspace still indicates sRGB and the image is displayed in sRGB on screen. Using a CALayer backing layer works just fine.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached code example.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nCATiledLayer should internally create a graphics context that matches the device screen, just like UIGraphicsRenderer.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCATiledLayer always creates a sRGB graphics context. P3 images drawn from draw(_ rect:) are rendered in sRGB.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested iOS version is iOS 11.0.3 (15A432), on iPhone 8 (Model A1863, A1905, A1906, A1907).\r\nNot tested on earlier versions of iOS, or macOS."
