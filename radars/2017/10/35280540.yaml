    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a `UITableView` is in editing mode and the user taps the red delete circle on the left a row it makes the row show the \"Delete\" confirmation button.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 10 the `UITableViewCell` would receive `willTransition(to:)` and `didTransition(to:)` calls at that point telling the cell that it has moved into a state including `UITableViewCellStateMask.showingDeleteConfirmationMask`.\r\n\r\nThose calls are not made on iOS 11 for that transition, or for the transition back when deletion confirmation mode is exited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Build and run the attached minimal Xcode project\r\n2) Tap the Edit button on the navigation bar to put the table in editing mode\r\n3) Tap the red delete circle on the left of a row\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cell should update to show a tick after \"Showing Delete Confirmation\". This is what happens on iOS 10.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell does not update on iOS 11 because its `willTransition(to:)` and `didTransition(to:)` methods are not called. That can be verified by putting breakpoints on those methods (in TableViewController.swift).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0.3 (15A432) on iPhone 7 Plus A1784 NN4M2ZD/A\r\niOS 11.0.1 and 10.3.1 simulators in Xcode 9.0.1"
