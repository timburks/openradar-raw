    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Andyroid Mac application bundles malware, as is shown in this VirusTotal report: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/f67940a8f5138decafc9d487b29f129e9676f4e380e717361b2fe16f71231248/detection\r\n\r\nThe Andyroid Mac application should have its signature revoked because of this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the Andyroid DMG file from http://andyroid.net.\r\n2. Verify that the file is signed with a valid Apple Developer ID, either by attempting to open it by double-clicking it (so long as App Store and Identified Developers is chosen in the General tab of the Security & Privacy preference pane) or by running \"codesign -dvvv /Volumes/Installer/Installer.app\" in the Terminal with the DMG file mounted. You can also get this information from VirusTotal.\r\n3. Run the downloaded file through VirusTotal (https://virustotal.net).\r\n4. You should see that a number of antimalware engines, including BitDefender and Kaspersky, detect the DMG file as malignant.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile is downloaded, and upon attempting to open the Installer app within, the system displays any message found at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491 under \"Gatekeeper messages\" and the bullet point \"Gatekeeper options set to \"Mac App Store and identified developers\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFile is downloaded and the app within opens without any fuss from the system, meaning the signature is valid even though the app in question is bundled with malware.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion tested was 46.16_48. My system is running High Sierra 10.13."
