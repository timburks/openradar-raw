    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34885659\n\niOS asks the user for their iTunes password for many reasons, the most common ones are recently installed iOS operating system updates, or iOS app that are stuck while installing them.\r\n\r\nAs a result, users are trained to just enter their Apple ID password whenever iOS prompts you to do so. However, those popups are not only shown on the lock screen, and the spring board, but also inside random apps, e.g. when they want to access iCloud, GameCenter or In-App-Purchases.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be abused by any app, just by showing an `UIAlertController`, that looks exactly like the system dialog.\r\n\r\nEven users who know a lot about technology, have a hard time detecting that those alerts are phishing attacks.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCheck out the project at https://github.com/KrauseFx/steal.password, in particular the README, and the project itself in `M2GlobalState.m:222`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nModern web browsers already do an excellent job protecting users from phishing attacks. Phishing within mobile apps is a rather new concept, and therefore still pretty unexplored.\r\n\r\n- System dialogs should be indicated as such\r\n- Dialogs from apps could contain the app icon on the top right of the dialog, to indicate the app is asking you\r\n- When asking for the Apple ID from the user, instead of asking for the password directly, open the Settings app\r\n- Fix the root of the problem, users shouldn't constantly be asked for their credentials. It doesn't affect all users, but I myself had this issue for many months, until it randomly disappeared.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog looks exactly like the system dialog, and users have no good way to check whether they're being phished. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
