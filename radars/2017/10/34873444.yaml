    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you have a project with an empty static framework, and you add Foundation to its \"Link Binary With Libraries\" phase, XCBuild emits a warning in the build log about it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project (and switch to XCBuild)\r\n2. Add a framework target, and change it's Mach-O type to \"Static Library\"\r\n3. Add Foundation to its \"Link Binary With Libraries\" phase\r\n4. Build the static framework target\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are no build warnings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXCBuild emits a warning in the build log that says:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: Target StaticFramework product StaticFramework cannot link framework Foundation.framework\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 beta (9B37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis could be the intended behavior and previously we were just doing this wrong? Also note that this warning isn't emitted for static library targets. See the attached project for an example."
