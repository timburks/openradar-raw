    description: "Summary:\r\nScenes in the Home app should be able to be configured such that enabling a scene can affect the enabled/disabled status of automations.\n\nThis is convenient for situations where a motion sensor triggers lights to come on in a bedroom, but not after the bedtime scene has been set to prevent moving around in bed at night from triggering the motion sensor and the lights coming on.\n\nAn alternative option is the ability to turn off sensors, which would actually be nicer but probably requires manufacturer software updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
