    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen animating status bar appearance using a UIViewPropertyAnimator, if you start a subsequent animation while the first one is still animating, UIStatusBarItemView crashes when trying to set a nil key on CALayer\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project on an iOS 10.3 simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status bar animates multiple times in a row\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt crashes after a little while with:\n\n```\n2017-10-03 01:16:04.481 StatusBarAnimationCrash[94054:1174550] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[CALayer valueForKey:]: attempt to retrieve a value for a nil key'```\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce this on iOS 11, but I'm not sure if it's fixed or not since it's intermittent even on iOS 10.\n\nThis can be worked around if the status bar animation isn't performed in a nested UIView.animate block"
