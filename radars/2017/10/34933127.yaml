    description: "safeAreaLayoutGuide is currently only available via the UILayoutAnchor API introduced in iOS 9.\r\nApps that are also supporting iOS versions prior to iOS 9 often use the visual format language because it's very expressive. Unfortunately it's not possible to use the safeArea API there. \r\nI would like to see any possibility that changes this like adding a new symbol that represents the safeArea anchor instead of the superviews anchor. It could be an addition to | like <| for trailing/bottom-anchors."
