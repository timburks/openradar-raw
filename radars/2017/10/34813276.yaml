    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen one has multiple annotation views that completely overlap, panning the map view will cause a severe flicker of said annotation views. It appears to be limited to iPhones running iOS 11.0.1; it does not appear to happen on an iPad Pro 10.5 device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload, build, and run the project in MapMarkerTest.zip - then just pan around the screen. For reference, the annotations are placed in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo flicker\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLots of flicker - see the \"BadApple AnnotationViews.mov\" to see what I mean.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0.1 (15A402)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus"
