    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen ordering video layers with AVVideoCompositionInstruction's layerInstructions property in a Swift Playground, the live preview does not show the layers correctly. Applying a non-identity affine transform to a layer seems to \"fix\" the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached LayerBug playground and run.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo of animals is displayed above \"instruments\" promo video.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo video of animals is visible :(\r\n(Uncommenting line 72 makes it visible by adding a tiny transform to the instruments video.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\nmacOS 10.13.1 Beta (17B35a)"
