    description: "We are using custom font in our app. In order to write UI from code in Playground we have to copy custom fonts to Playground `Resources` folder and load them manually. This workflow is working as long as Playground name has similar case of letters as reference in `contents.xcworkspacedata` in Xcode workspace. If case of letters in file name and reference is different - then custom font is missed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open attached sample app.\r\n2. Open workspace `PlaygroundTests.xcworkspace`. Build and run playground page named `View-CustomFontLabel`.\r\n3. Open workspace `PlaygroundTests-Failure.xcworkspace`. Build and run playground page named `View-CustomFontLabel`.\r\n\r\nNote: The difference between `PlaygroundTests-Failure.xcworkspace` and `PlaygroundTests.xcworkspace` in one line (one letter):\r\n\r\nPlaygroundTests.xcworkspace: location = \"group:Playground.playground\">\r\nPlaygroundTests-Failure.xcworkspace: location = \"group:playground.playground\">\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPlayground page named `View-CustomFontLabel` working on steps #2 and #3. Custom font is loaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nError `fatal error: Font with name `OpenSans-Bold` is not found.: file /_EDITED_/SharedUI/Font.swift, line 41` observed while running playground page named `View-CustomFontLabel`.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 (9A235)\r\niOS Simulator: iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.0 (15A372), Model: iPhone2017-B\r\n\r\nLink to sample app GitHub repo: https://github.com/vgorloff/Radar34829352"
