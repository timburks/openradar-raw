    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen releasing an AVPlayerItem that is playing and that has an AVAudioMix with an audio tap processor, the processing callback can get called after the finalize callback. This can cause the processing callback and AVFoundation to access memory that has been freed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on a real device. Press the button multiple times. Try to time it so that you press it just after audio starts playing. At some point the Address Sanitizer will stop the execution for \"Use of deallocated memory\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe finalize callback should be the last call to any of the MTAudioProcessingTapCallbacks and (as the finalize callback is called on another thread than the AudioTapCallbackProcess thread) should be done after all calls to the processing callback have returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp can crash.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0\r\nDid not appear on prior versions of iOS (probably because they did not correctly call the finalize callback unless the audioTapProcessor fields were manually nilled).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11.0 on a real device"
