    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith the new Activity Sharing feature in iOS, there may be times where you want to use a different email, (like when using iMessage, Find my Friends, or iCloud Screen sharing) than just your plain Apple ID. Currently, however, you can't choose the email used to add others and for others to add you in Activity Sharing. This can lead to issues, especially in the case where your Apple ID is also an iCloud sign in, and you can't change your Apple Id that you might want to keep private.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Activity Sharing\r\n2. Have friends add you from an alias iCloud ID/or from your Phone number\r\n3. Friends see your primary Apple ID as the sharing method rather than the phone number or email you actually want them to see. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeing able to choose, similar to how iMessage works and how digital touch used to work, what Apple ID is publicly shown would be awesome. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy private Apple ID that I want to keep private is now shown to others. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 64 GB, T-Mobile"
