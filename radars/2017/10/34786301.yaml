    description: "3rd party apps can abuse UNNotificationSettings and nag the user to turn on notifications (or nag the user to specifically modify notification settings).\r\n\r\nOne of the common examples is Facebook Messenger, which displays in-app alerts and \"errors\" until you explicitly turn on \"Show as Banners\".\r\n\r\nCould there be an additional option in Notifications to \"Prevent application from seeing fine-grained notification information\". It would default to off, but when on, would report all most/all UNNotificationSettings as on/always."
