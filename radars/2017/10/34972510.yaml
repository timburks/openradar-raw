    description: "Login Issues on macOS Clients bound to Active Directory (AD)\r\n\r\nUsers can not log on on a macOS client that is bound to AD if the AD home folder path contains a dollar sign ‘$’.\r\n\r\n- Bind your machine to AD. See Note ‘ad_config_fail.txt’ for the exact configuration.\r\n- Log in with an AD user that has never logged in to this machine before.\r\n- That user has a dollar sign ‘$’  in its AD home folder path.\r\n- Example of such a path as shown in AD: \\\\mycorp.com\\home$\\myuser\r\n- The user will not be able to log on but will see a prompt: “You are unable to log in to the user account “myuser” at this time. Logging in to the account failed because an error occurred.”\r\n\r\n- The dollar sign should be escaped correctly.\r\n- The user should be able to sign in.\r\n\r\nLog entries show the following message:\r\nauthorizationhost: (HomeDirMechanism) ERROR | -[HomeDirMounter mountNetworkHomeWithURL:attributes:dirPath:username:] | PremountHomeDirectoryWithAuthentication( url=smb://mycorp.com/home%%24/myuser, homedir=/home/myuser, name=myuser ) returned 2\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nIf the AD home folder is not mounted, the user can log on. This can be achieved by setting\r\n “Use Windows UNC path for home  = Disabled”\r\n\r\n\r\nad_config_fail.txt\r\nActive Directory Forest          = myforest.com\r\nActive Directory Domain          = myforest.com\r\nComputer Account                 = my-host$\r\n\r\nAdvanced Options - User Experience\r\n  Create mobile account at login = Enabled\r\n     Require confirmation        = Disabled\r\n  Force home to startup disk     = Enabled\r\n     Mount home as sharepoint    = Enabled\r\n  Use Windows UNC path for home  = Enabled\r\n     Network protocol to be used = smb\r\n  Default user Shell             = /bin/bash\r\n\r\nAdvanced Options - Mappings\r\n  Mapping UID to attribute       = uidNumber\r\n  Mapping user GID to attribute  = gidNumber\r\n  Mapping group GID to attribute = gidNumber\r\n  Generate Kerberos authority    = Enabled\r\n\r\nAdvanced Options - Administrative\r\n  Preferred Domain controller    = not set\r\n  Allowed admin groups           = myadmins\r\n  Authentication from any domain = Enabled\r\n  Packet signing                 = allow\r\n  Packet encryption              = allow\r\n  Password change interval       = 0\r\n  Restrict Dynamic DNS updates   = not set\r\n  Namespace mode                 = domain"
