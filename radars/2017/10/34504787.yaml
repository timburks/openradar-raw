    description: "Summary:\r\nMy iOS 10 app had some significant issues displaying its search bar—the scope buttons would appear behind the search bar. I was able to solve most of these issues by building with the iOS 11 SDK and using the new navigationItem.searchController property. There's still one significant issue though: if the device is rotated while the scope buttons are showing, the end up behind the search bar. The result is a visual mess and the scope buttons can't be used in this state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode 9.\r\n2. Run the project.\r\n3. Pull down to reveal the search bar, and tap on the search field. The scope buttons should appear.\r\n4. Rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scope buttons should continue to display below the search field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scope buttons are now behind the search bar—they occupy the same space, making the scope buttons inaccessible. A screenshot is attached showing what this looks like.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.0 (9A235) and iOS 11 GM (15A372)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe attached project is just the Master/Detail template with four lines of code to add the search controller and scope buttons. It's an incomplete setup but I'm able to reproduce the same issue in my finished app.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the bug exists on any iPhone or iPad, both device and simulator. I tested on iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in the simulator, as well as iPhone 7 and iPad Pro 10.5 on device."
