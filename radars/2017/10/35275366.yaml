    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently CLLocationManager provides a delegate callback when authorization status changes. However, as the documentation points out, whether or not that gets called is hard to predict. This was manageable in iOS 10 when you could check if the authorizationStatus was notDetermined. However now the rules have changed to be able to upgrade authorization from when in use to always, and the rules around when you get a callback and when you donâ€™t have gotten much more complicated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Request authorization using requestAlwaysAuthorization.\n2. Wait for delegate callback.\n3. Wait forever.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nrequestAlwaysAuthorization() and requestWhenInUseAuthorization() should include a callback that is always called, regardless of current permission state or if an prompt is shown to the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way to know for sure when the prompt is done.\n\nPractically speaking this leads apps to not wait for the prompt, which can degrade the UI experience.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
