    description: "Area:\r\nPDFKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen adding a highlight annotation, it seems like two highlights are added over the text.  When scrolling away from the page and back then the highlight works fine\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a PDFKit annotation with type highlight\r\n(See sample code: button1Clicked)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHighlights are added to the PDF and the text underneath is visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks like two highlights are added and the text underneath is not visible\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 (17A365)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nSample code: \r\nI included a basic PDFView that adds Highlights to the PDF document. \r\nWhen Tapping on \"Add Red\" it adds a red highlight to page 10. Notice that the text underneath the highlight is not visible. When two-three pages away from the highlight and then back then highlight looks fine. \r\nSame with the blue button.\r\nWhen Adding a red/blue highlight and tapping on the \"Hack\" button the highlights work fine. The \"Hack\" button just scrolls away from the page and back to the current page"
