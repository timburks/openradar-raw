    description: 'When someone who is not in your contacts messages you and includes their name iMessage assigns the conversation a handy title like "Maybe: Jenny Appleseed". This is very useful but when one goes to create a contact for this person the new contact page is not pre-populated at all. It would be a beautiful feature through-and-through if these guesses pre-populated the contact creation view or better yet there was some sort of 3D Touch option to immediately add that person to your contacts with the predicted name.'
