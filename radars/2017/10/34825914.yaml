    description: "As far as I can tell, HEIC/HEIF is not supported in Safari on iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, even on devices with hardware support to decode the format.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to add support for these new high-efficiency formats, since the source of a lot of bloat on web pages is images. It would be also great to be able to support some of the more advanced features of HEIF, such as image sequences and Live Photos."
