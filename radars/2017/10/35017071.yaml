    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA System Image Utility-created NetInstall nbi that contains more than one additional signed packages to install does not properly stage all additional packages for install. This is similar to bug 34979397. After the first reboot after the macOS install environment is set up, the installer stops with the error \"The path /System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg appears to be missing or damaged.\" and tells you to restart and try again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch System Image Utility.\r\nSelect \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" as a source.\r\nChoose to make a NetInstall nbi.\r\nAdd multiple signed packages to the install.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmacOS High Sierra and additional packages are installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstaller displays the error \"\"This copy of the Install macOS High Sierra application is damaged, and can't be used to install macOS.\" and will not proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n You can reboot into an alternate startup disk and examine the (previous) target disk:\r\n\r\nThe paths for all given packages are added to macOS Install Data/InstallInfo.plist under the \"Additional Installs\" key, but not all are actually copied to the paths indicated. For example:\r\n\r\n\t Additional Installers \r\n\t \r\n\t\t DA_adminaccount.pkg \r\n\t\t SuppressSetupAssistant.pkg \r\n\t\t munkitools.pkg \r\n\t\t munki_kickstart.pkg \r\n\t \r\n\r\nbut the macOS Install Data directory contains only SuppressSetupAssistant.pkg  and munki_kickstart.pkg; the other two packages are MIA.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13 Build 17A405\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD"
