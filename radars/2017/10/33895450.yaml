    description: "Area:\r\nCore Data\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince iOS 11, my application can no longer open core data binary stores with UIColors stored in Transformable attributes.\r\n\r\nThis only seems to affect Binary stores, I tested with SQLLite store and the problem did not occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project twice\r\n\r\nThe project is a clean new project built in Objective C with Core Data added.  \r\nThe persistent store lazy property was changed such that a Binary datastore is created instead of the default SQLLite\r\nIn addition on startup, an entity is created if not present, and accessed if it is.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application does not crash\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe application does crash with trace : \r\n\r\nCoreDataTransformableAttribBug.binary, NSUnderlyingException=value for key 'NS.objects' was of unexpected class 'UIColor'. Allowed classes are '{(\\n    NSData,\\n    NSNumber,\\n    NSOrderedSet,\\n    NSDate,\\n    NSArray,\\n    NSDictionaryMapNode,\\n    NSString,\\n    NSUUID,\\n    NSSet,\\n    NSDictionary,\\n    NSURL,\\n    NSDecimalNumber,\\n    NSNull\\n)}'.}\";\r\n    NSUnderlyingException = \"Can't read binary data from file\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 with XCode Version 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOnly occurs when NSBinaryStoreType type is used for Core Data persistent store.\r\n\r\nOpenRadar extra\r\n(Attached project to original, but project is on gitHub showing how to reproduce the bug here : https://github.com/seriouscyrus/CoreDataTransformableAttribBug ) .  The bug is also present on MacOS"
