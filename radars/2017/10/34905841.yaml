    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34465226\n\nWhen pushing a view controller that contains a scroll or tableView onto a navigation controller with an opaque navBar, the content of the scroll or tableView is visibly adjusted during the transition. It starts out about 20 points too low, and moves up 20 points during the transition. The final position of the content is correct.\r\nIf the navBar is translucent, the behavior doesn't occur.\r\nIf UIScrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior is set to .never, the behavior doesn't occur.\r\nI verified this in the simulator as well as a physical device.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached projects and videos.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent should not move inside scroll or tableView during transition.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent moves up about 20 points during transition, and ends up in the correct place.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9 GM, iOS 11 Simulator, iOS 11 GM\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
