    description: "Summary:\r\nVery often my Mac goes into a state I cannot really reproduce. Whenever I type on my keyboard the text gets also typed into the LaunchPad search field. When I type into the LaunchPad search field itself, it repeats every keystroke so instead of test I type tteesstt.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I don't know, I'll send you my Mac to test this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should never happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis happens three times per week for me, at least. To fix this, I have to killall Dock, which is super annoying.\r\n\r\nStrangely this behavior does not occur when I type into password fields, so at least this security concern is not there. But I still think, that this is a security issue. I may type a secret note into 1Password, close it, someone else comes to my Mac and reads it from the search field in LaunchPad. This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nNow, what is even more annoying about this bug, is that when I type something short and press return it will launch the first matching app in the LaunchPad search, e.g. when I type \"1\" in Xcode, press return it will launch 1Password and throw me out of my current app. It is infuriating.\r\n\r\nNow, I have to say this, this bug has been my worst experience with macOS ever. This bug has started with Yosemite and I have reported it back in February on my internal Apple account kai_engelhardt@apple.com (or kaiengelhardt@apple.com) when I was an intern at Apple. The bug was duped to another one, which was marked as very important. Guess what, the issue is still there in macOS High Sierra, Developer Beta 9 (17A360a). I know you guys at Apple are hard at work and constantly busy, but this issue has been there for more than a year now and nothing has happened since then - at least that's what I see on my end. The bug still occurs very often for me.\r\n\r\nI know this issue is hard to reproduce. I don't know what to tell you to do to reproduce it. Maybe you can remote debug my MacBook to see what's going on?\r\n\r\nI don't know to whom this bug will be routed to, but from what I remember from the bug report on my internal account, the bug was routed to Bill Ryan Jr.. If this is you, Bill, please do something. I put my hopes into your hands to fix this aggravating issue for me. Thank you!\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra, Developer Beta 9 (17A360a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nrMBP early 2015, 13\", i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached a video to my internal bug report, so I won't record it again. Please find the other bug report, to see the issue.\r\nI hope my sysdiagnose can help in finding the issue.\r\nIf there is anything else I can do, please let me know. Please don't let this bug report fall into the black hole where I don't hear anything at all."
