    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting an external LG Ultrafine 5K display, USB devices attached to the display sometimes do not connect to the system. The devices need unplugging and reattaching before being recognised. I contacted LG support who said this is an issue with macOS and has apparently been reported to Apple. Apple support had no ability to help with this. Other users experience this issue in the discussions (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7806327). My display firmware is up to date. sysdiagnose attached captured when the display was connected with USB devices connected that were not recognised by macOS. This is not a hardware issue â€“ both MBP and display have been replaced and have the same issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect LG ultrafine 5k display with USB devices attached\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUSB devices function immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUSB devices do not function until after reconnection"
