    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an Xcode project contains image assets whose names begin with \"in\", Xcode likes to begin offering image literals as completion suggestions when typing the \"in\" keyword that is required in swift after the parameter names of a closure. The most annoying part about this is that you usually type <enter> after `in` to begin the body of the closure, which adds the image literal from the autocomplete suggestions instead, which is a syntax error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the attached project, open `ViewController.swift`\n2. Erase the `in` keyword from the closure passed to `somethingWithCompletion`\n3. Begin typing `in` again\n4. Xcode will offer \"intro_group\" from xcassets as an autocomplete result\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 3, Xcode should offer no autocomplete suggestions, or only offer a suggestion to complete the keyword in a way that is syntactically valid\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode tries to insert an image literal, causing a syntax error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy current workaround is to build muscle memory to type a space after the `in` keyword, which dismisses the suggestions, before hitting enter to begin the closure body. Thankfully, Xcode also has an option to trim trailing whitespace on save so that the extra space I entered gets removed."
