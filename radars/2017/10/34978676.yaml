    description: "Summary:\r\nIt’s too easy to force quit apps on iOS 11. On my iPad where I use the app switcher a lot, I sometimes kill apps accidentally when trying to tap them.\n\nIt should be really hard to force quit apps because otherwise some people do it routinely, wasting their time and battery. Best article about this with links to other sources is https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/you_should_not_force_quit_apps\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iPad, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to show the app switcher\n2. Tap on an app rectangle, but move the touch upwards ever so slightly on hitting the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither app should come to foreground or maybe if the touch moved up a bit too much it should move up a little then bounce back into place.\n\nIt should be really hard to force quit apps.\n\n(I don’t think swiping up even a great deal should force quit the app because of the routine serial killing some people do, but this radar is just about accidental triggering.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp flies upwards and is force quit. Risk of data loss. I have to go and find it on the home screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression: I didn’t trigger this accidentally on iOS 10. I suppose it required slightly more upwards motion.\n\nIn theory this happens on iPhone but I haven’t triggered it accidentally there. I just use the app switcher a lot less there so that might explain it."
