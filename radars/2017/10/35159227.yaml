    description: "As a user/developer I want to be able to define what apps are registered as the default handler for certain types of events. This is a common feature of Windows, Android, Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I want to be able to over-ride the default handlers for maps, email, and browser (though others may also be beneficial).\r\n\r\nAs a user, I choose to use Google Maps or Waze, Nine email and Brave for those three functions, yet iOS currently does not allow me to specify them as the handler for default functions.\r\n\r\nFor regular users these should be defaulted to the Apple apps (and removing the 3rd party app should reset the default to expected behavior), but as a 'power user'  I should have the ability to select my own preference, and as a developer I should be able to allow my app to prompt the user to become the default handler for a given function (at install/first run, or via a settings option during normal operation)\r\nComments"
