    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet Siri to the British Ask Siri to schedule a reminder for a specific date and time. (Example: \"Remind me at seven to file a bug report.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nSiri should confirm the reminder with the correct date and time, not reciting the full date if not contextually relevant. (Example: \"OK, I'll remind you at 7.\" -or- \"OK, I'll remind you today, the fifth of October, at 7.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nSiri schedules the reminder correctly, and displays the full date of the reminder correctly for the locale, but reads it per convention of another locale, saying the wrong month and day. (Example: Reminder is correctly scheduled for 2017/10/5 7:00PM. Text on screen is displayed as \"OK, I added it for today at 10/5/17 7 PM\", which is correct per the locale but awkward and needlessly specific. Siri *incorrectly* speaks the confirmation as \"Okay, I added for today the tenth of May two thousand and seventeen at 7 pm.\", conflating the day and month.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: \r\n11.0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSiri Language: English (U.S.)\r\niOS Language: English\r\n\r\nSiri Voice: Australian (Female) -OR-\r\nSiri Voice: British (Female)\r\n\r\niOS Region: United States -OR-\r\niOS Region: United Kingdom -OR-\r\niOS Region: Australia\r\n\r\niOS Calendar: Gregorian"
