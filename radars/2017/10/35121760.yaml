    description: "Chrome, Edge, and Firefox (as of version 57) all provide an option to duplicate the current tab, which includes the address history. There does not seem to be any reason to omit this in Safari, especially as this functionality cannot be replicated with an extension.\r\n\r\nBrowsers variously provide this functionality in a menu option; in the tab contextual menu; and through dragging the tab while holding down a modifier key (similar to duplicating a file in the Finder by dragging and holding Option). The Edge keyboard shortcut for this is Control + K."
