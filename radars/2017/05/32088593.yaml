Wait for a carrier settings update to appear. If you know one is available, but it hasn't popped up, go to Settings → General → About, and wait for it to appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text in the popup box is consistent with the style guide of the rest of iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe text in the popup has two spaces after the period, which is inconsistent with the rest of iOS:\r\n\r\nCarrier Settings Update\r\nNew settings are available.
