    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you're creating your own IBInspectable attributes, then you've definitely notice that using 13 letters as an attribute name would cause it to get truncated.\r\nTry to increase the width of the attributes inspector by stretching it, and only the 'values' fields will be stretched :/\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you can stretch the attributes inspector a little bit to get rid of that truncated attribute name!\r\n\r\nThere's this trick that you guys used in on of UITableViewCell attributes (Editing Accessory).\r\nThe workaround was to name it \"Editing Acc.\", but that isn't feasible currently, since it means that your property name should end with a '.' which generates a compiler error at build time!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Create a new class called \"CustomLabel\" that is a subclass of \"UILabel\"\r\n2- Create an IBInspectable property called veryLongAttribute of type NSString\r\n3- Drag a UILabel to your Main.storyboard\r\n4- Set its class to \"CustomLabel\"\r\n5- Check the attribute inspector for the new attribute \"Very Long Attribute\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the full attribute name \"Very Long Attribute\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe attribute name is truncated no matter what how you stretch the attributes inspector to increase the width :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.1 (8E1000a)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)"
