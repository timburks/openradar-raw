    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I connect multiple monitors my windows move around and many times they go off screen.\r\n\r\nI cannot find the window when I click on the app and usually end up closing and re-opening.\r\n\r\nNow I discovered these windows are appearing on monitor #1 (2 external), but they are essentially all offscreen except for the top left corner and close button.\r\n\r\nThis is a very poor user experience, since clicking on the app doesn't bring a window to the foreground (that I can see), because it's only 20x20 pixels from it's top left corner.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Work on editing something with TextMate (or any app) with single external monitor. (You probably need to have a lot of windows open with Safari, Chrome, Terminal, Xcode, Things, Marked2, and Textmate.\r\n2. Then connect a 2nd monitor\r\n3. Watch windows reposition\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. My windows should not shift offscreen on multiple monitors. \r\n2. Ideally they would keep the same positions, or at least would stay on a screen so I could see them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Windows are 99% offscreen for some apps, and it's very hard to find things\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI keep losing windows for apps, which is frustrating. It's like a search for a needle in a hay stack.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time using three monitors, which I'm not sure if that's the reason it's so confusing. At home I connect to a single display (UltraFine 5k), at work I connect to two cheap 1080p monitors.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" 2016\r\n1-2 external monitors\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MacBook Pro 2016 - 2 external monitors.spx' and 'MultipleMonitorWindowsOffscreen.png' were successfully uploaded."
