    description: "Area:\r\nMedia Player Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n[MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] doesn't work at all when Music app deleted from the device. Also it causes crashes when valid selectors are called, specifically it doesn't respond to 'skipToNextItem' and 'skipToPreviousItem' selectors. But if Music app installed, [[MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] respondsToSelector:@selector(skipToNextItem)] always returns NO, although we can call these methods successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sync some songs to the device through iTunes\r\n2. Uninstall Music app\r\n3. Run attached sample project that demonstrates this issue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt least [MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] should work even if Music app uninstalled and should not crash when we're calling valid selectors\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n[MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] doesn't work at all when Music app uninstalled and crashes when calling 'skipToNextItem' and 'skipToPreviousItem' selectors\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3"
