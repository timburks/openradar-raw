    description: "Summary:\r\npkgbuild's default filter is both not correctly documented in the man page and doesn't know it's a regular expression.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Stage files to be in a package including a file named `chg`\r\n2) Use `pkgbuild` without specifying `--filter` to make the package\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy `chg` file is in the package.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n`chg` is not in the package.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEvery version of 10.11 and 10.12 I've tried, including the related Xcode tools. I'm submitting a patch to work around this in hg shortly, and you'll be able to observe an hg test failure soon with that patch un-done.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe man page only mentions CVS and .svn directories, but .git and .hg are experimentally also in the default filter. So there are two bugs here:"
