    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApple Mail has access to APIs in the Notification Center that aren’t available to third-party developers.\r\n\r\nWhen Apple Mail shows a new email notification, it has the very handy ‘Trash’ and ‘Reply’ buttons in the alert.\r\n\r\nHitting the ‘Trash’ button will send that email straight to the trash, and whichever application is front most, stays at the front.\r\n\r\n3rd-party developers don’t have the ability to mimic this behaviour. Clicking on a similar ‘Trash’ button brings the application to the front.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Mail.\r\n2. Switch to another application (or even just hide Apple Mail).\r\n3. Wait for new emails to arrive (or send them to yourself from another device).\r\n4. See new email notifications come in.\r\n5. Note the ‘Trash’ button in the notification.\r\n6. Click on the ‘Trash’ button.\r\n7. Note that Apple Mail stays in the background.\r\n\r\nThis action isn’t available to third-party apps. You can see the difference with MailMate.\r\n\r\nBefore you begin you will need a Mac that either has Apple Mail configured, or a test IMAP email account.\r\n\r\n1. Download (https://freron.com/download/), install and set up MailMate (the Apple Mail import is really handy).\r\n2. Update MM to a beta version (as of writing, this may have made it into a public release), you can update to a beta release by opening MM’s preferences, switching to the ‘Software Update’ tab, hold the option key and click on ‘Check Now’.\r\n3. Once MM has been updated, quit it.\r\n4. Enter the defaults write command here: https://freron.lighthouseapp.com/projects/58672/tickets/1738-feature-request-customisable-notification-alerts#ticket-1738-3\r\n5. Relaunch MM.\r\n6. Switch to another application.\r\n7. Wait for new emails or send yourself some new email.\r\n8. See the new email notification come in.\r\n9. Note the new ‘Delete’ button.\r\n10. Click the ‘Delete’ button.\r\n11. Note that MailMate is brought forward.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMailMate should stay in the background (or hidden if it was hidden).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMailMate is brought forward.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n15G1421\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated bug: 32072797"
