    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I launch System Image Utility there is a basic assistant to guide through NetInstall image creation. It assumes install macOS Sierra.app is present in /Application. It would cool if I coud drag&drop installer from custom filesystem location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch System Image Utility\r\n2. Try to specify source of  install macOS Sierra.app other than /Applications \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to drag & drop install macOS Sierra.app installer from custom location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am unable to specify  install macOS Sierra.app installer from custom location. Installer is detected only in /Applications\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.5/16F73\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCreating symlink or Finder alias in /Applications pointing to install macOS Sierra.app in other location does not work."
