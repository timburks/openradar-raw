    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no easy way to copy a entire Diagnostics and Usage Data entry to clipboard, because you have to manually drag the selection markers to include all text.\r\n\r\nHaving \"Select All\" for text selection would be a huge improvement. \r\n\r\nA share-button in the upper right corner would also be nice. This could bring up a share sheet for the entire entry skipping the text selection part entirely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings app\r\n2. Enter Privacy > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostics & Usage Data\r\n3. Pick some entry\r\n4. Long tap text to open text selection menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ntext selection popup should have \"Select All\" and \"Copy\" actions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntext selection is missing \"Select All\" but has \"Copy\" action\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 (14B100)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis missing \"Select All\" has been a problem on iOS 9 as well, really as long as I can remember."
