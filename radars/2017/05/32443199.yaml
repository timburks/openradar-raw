    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's well known that IBInspectable only supports the following types:\r\nInt\r\nCGFloat\r\nDouble\r\nString\r\nBool\r\nCGPoint\r\nCGSize\r\nCGRect\r\nUIColor\r\nUIImage\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if we can have support for enum as well :/ \r\nThis is important as the only possible workarounds are messy and bad, really bad. (Ex: using NSInteger or NSString)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Create a class called \"CustomLabel\"\r\n\r\n2- Create an enum called \"DateFormat\" and set three options (Short, Medium, Full)\r\nenum DateFormat: Int {\r\n case Short // 05/27/2017\r\n case Medium // May 27,2017\r\n case Full // May 27, 2017 9:10 AM\r\n}\r\n\r\n3- Create a var called format, a DateFromat enum with IBInspectable capability\r\n class CustomLabel: UILabel {\r\n   @IBInspectable\r\n   var format: DateFormat = .Short {\r\n     didSet {\r\n       // update label\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n4- Go to your storyboard\r\n5- Drag a UILabel to your view controller\r\n6- Set its class to CustomLabel from the attribute inspector\r\n7- Look for the new attribute \"format\" in the label's attribute inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee an attribute called \"format\" that is an enum with three options (Short, Medium, Full)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo new attributes for CustomLabel were added. Enums are not yet supported as IBInspectable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.1 (8E1000a)\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)"
