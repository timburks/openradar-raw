    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have two apps presenting as main view a UITableViewController with a UISearchController which does NOT use its own searchResultsController. Rather the apps use the original table view controller containing the search bar and searchable contents, i.e. searchController.searchResultsController is set to nil. \r\n\r\nPeek and Pop work perfectly when the search controller is not active, however, as soon as you activate the search by touching the search text field, peek and pop stop working.   \r\n\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that 3D touches are somehow sent to searchController.searchResultsController, which is nil and therefore cannot handle 3d touch events. Apple should change this behaviour: if searchController.searchResultsController is nil the 3d touches must be handled by the original table view in lieu of the not existing searchResultsController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAny table view (enabled for peek and pop, i.e. with \"self.previewingContext = [self registerForPreviewingWithDelegate:self sourceView:self.view]\") which handles search results by itself, i.e. with searchController.searchResultsController == nil.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3D touches should be handled by original table view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3 D touches are not processed if search controller is active and  searchController.searchResultsController == nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 128 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
