    description: "Summary:\r\nThe libtrace project contains the source code for the /usr/lib/system/libsystem_trace.dylib source code that implements the new os_log family of functions introduced in macOS 10.12. Lots of open source projects depend on these functions, as well as third-party programs and their sources.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit opensource.apple.com/source/libtrace\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA page containing the source code for different versions of libtrace should be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such page as the project is not open source."
