    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “Open Quickly…” feature from the “File > “ dropdown in the toolbar rarely finds the file that you search for. However, using the filtered search field in the file navigator in the left pane always works, without fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Either go File > Open Quickly.. or type shift+command+O\n2. Type in a swift filename that is included in your project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file is found and appears in the search results list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften, no results are found or some completely unrelated bridging header is at the top of the result list\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.*\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a very frustrating experience"
