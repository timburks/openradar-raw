    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTake a look at the two attached screenshots. One shows an iPhone keyboard; the other, an iPad keyboard. Both are running iOS 10, and both are in the Notes app.\r\n\r\nIf you look carefully, you’ll see that the iPhone’s curly quotes are arranged in the order you’d use them (e.g. opening ‘ and closing ’). The iPad’s, on the other hand, are reversed: ’ followed by ‘.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency makes no sense to me. I believe the order of the curly quotes should be the same regardless of device, and the most logical order is opening followed by closing. This precise ordering is necessary because — while I love the San Francisco typeface overall — the quotation marks are barely distinct."
