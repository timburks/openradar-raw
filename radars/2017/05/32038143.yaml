    description: "Area: Siri\r\n\r\nSummary: In 10.3.1 (14E304) the ability to dictate disappears and cannot be re-enabled because the Settings app does not include any mention of either Siri nor Dictation (in the Keyboards subsection) \r\n\r\nI cannot identify exactly why but all mention of dictation disappeared from my phone after I experimentally enabled and then shortly after disabled Restrictions.\r\n\r\nNo restrictions are enabled currently, and I have checked location services, and scored settings as much as I can and there is no way to re-enable it. \r\n\r\nI have even tried asking Siri to show me Siri settings- my app switches to Settings but only to the main screen... No ability to change settings (because the Siri settings also appear to have disappeared).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: (not certain this is the cause...)\r\n\r\n1. Enable restrictions \r\n2. Disable restrictions \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Dictation should be available in the same way as before restrictions were enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results: Dictation is missing completely\r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 10.3.1 (14E304)\r\n\r\nNotes: Am attaching screenshot of Keyvoards section in Settings, scrolled all the way to bottom - no mention of Dictation!\r\n\r\nConfiguration: IPhone 6 NG4H2ZD/A"
