    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSyncing an exchange account gives remote wipe capability to the server admin without any management profile being installed or without any warning or confirmation from the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup an Exchange account on iOS\r\n2. Use the Exchange server to remote-wipe the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSetting up the Exchange account should not give full remote-wipe capability. The remote wipe should only affect the data that was synced by Exchange. Or at a minimum, the user should be prompted while setting up the Exchange account to grant remote wipe privileges instead of it happening automatically and silently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Exchange server can remote wipe your data, without ever showing a warning about this to the end-user.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
