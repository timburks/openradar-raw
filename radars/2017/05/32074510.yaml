    description: "Area:\r\nQuickLook Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe've received a bug report from a user that some files cause the QLPreviewController to re-display the contents in a loop, like opening the file over and over. We were able to confirm the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is the error shown in the log output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[default] View service did terminate with error: Error Domain=_UIViewServiceInterfaceErrorDomain Code=3 \"(null)\" UserInfo={Message=Service Connection Interrupted} #Remote\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find the bug report here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/85\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached DocInteraction project (it's Apple's DocInteraction sample project, only with one small change: Replaced \"PDF Document.pdf\" with PDF test file that exemplary causes the issue)\r\n2. Run project on current iPhone or iPad (issue doesn't seem to appear in iOS Simulator)\r\n3. Select \"PDF Document.pdf\" in the app in order to open it via QLPreviewController\r\n4. Scroll through the file until you've hit the aforementioned error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling through the sample file's preview should work normally and shouldn't \"hang up\" with an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile scrolling through the sample file, eventually the preview stops displaying and shows a white screen for a short time. After that, the document is re-loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1 [14E304]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 128GB & iPad Pro 9.7\" 128GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DocInteraction.zip' was successfully uploaded."
