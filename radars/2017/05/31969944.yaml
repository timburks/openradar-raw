    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a scenario whereas I need to add a VC as a childViewController to the app that has a UITabBarController as its rootViewController. Without getting into too much detail about why, think \"tooltip\" or \"overlay\".\r\n\r\nIf that UITabBarController happens to have 5 tabs, the viewWillTransition:to:with: method of the childViewController does not called on various rotations of the device - if the device is an iPad Air 2 and the split screen is setup as 2/3.\r\n\r\nI created an example project that demonstrates this problem. The green rectangle should maintain a width that follows the width of the window. After several rotations the landscape mode will not have the transition method called.\r\n\r\nThis only happens on 2/3 split (in landscape)\r\n\r\n\"Initial Screen.png\" - show the example at just after I start the app\r\n\"Bad.png\" - shows the app in a bad state after a few rotations\r\n\"After Some Rotation.png\" - this screenshot shows that the 5th tab is now the \"more\" button which is incorrectly being shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. uncompress the example project\r\n2. build the example project\r\n3. run the example app\r\n4. setup the 2/3 split\r\n5. start rotating the app a few times\r\n6. stop on the second time you get to landscape mode \r\n7. observe the size of the green rectangle is wrong.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nviewWillTransition:to:for should be called all the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nviewWillTransition:to:for not getting called when there are 5 tabs in the UITabBarController AND rotated several times in 2/3 split mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 Simulator and iOS 10.3.1 device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 (2/3 split)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BAD.png', 'TestTabControllerTransition.zip', 'After Some Rotation.png' and 'Initial Screen.png' were successfully uploaded."
