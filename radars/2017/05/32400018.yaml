    description: "Summary:\r\nOur iOS Application (PDF Viewer) recently added iCloud Drive support. We set up the `NSUbiquitousContainers` property adding the `NSUbiquitousContainerIsDocumentScopePublic` option. We also configured our code to write an empty file into the container during initialization. Despite this, we are getting occasional reports from our users, who can't see the PDF Viewer folder listed in their iCloud Drive folder in Finder on macOS. The folder is visible on other iOS devices, but not on macOS. For the vast majority of our users this works without issues. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown. We could not reproduce it on any of our machines. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application specific iCloud folder would always be visible in the iCloud Drive folder.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn some cases the application specific iCloud folder is only present in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/, but not also visible in the iCloud Drive folder in F inder. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73), iOS 10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are suggesting that affected users try copying files into the iCloud drive folder on other devices and have put up a FAQ with troubleshooting tips (http://faq.pdfviewer.io/pdf-viewer-for-ios/troubleshooting-and-feedback/troubleshooting-icloud-drive), however that does not seem to resolve the issue for some users. They claim to see the documents in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~pspdfkit~viewer/Documents` and that directory also reflects document changes, but it is not visible in the iCloud Drive folder. We also got reports that some affected users are seeing other third party app folders in `~/Library/Mobile Documents/` but not in their iCloud drive folder."
