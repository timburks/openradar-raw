    description: The computer locks completely. After a few seconds, it automatically restarts and reopens all windows. No error message is displayed before or after. This occurs in a clean installation with no other software installed. Most importantly, it occurs only when the integrated video card is in use (Intel HD Graphics 530). When you turn off the option "Automatic graphics switching", the computer never locks. It also seems to be related to the default resolution (1680x1050).
