    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI used different credit cards at different merchants, often based upon the rewards that card offers for that particular type of merchant. When I am at a merchant and change which credit card Pay should use iOS should remember that card for that merchant based upon geolocation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Wallet.app\r\n2. Select a credit card other than the default\r\n3. Pay with Pay\r\n4. iOS should remember which card I used based on geolocation and make that the default card next time I return to this location/merchant\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect when I change which credit card to use and complete and Pay transaction my iPhone/Watch should remember that choice for future purchases at that location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is only one default credit card and it applies to everywhere regardless of location.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Pay compatible device that can determine location"
