    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen tapping an address in Mail, you're presented with an address, and the two buttons Create New Contact and Add to Existing Contact at the end of the screen. While this distinction seems useful at first, it means you have to actually _know_ whether or not this contact already exists.\r\n\r\nRather, this should be merged into a single UI, letting you both create a new contact _and_ suggest possible existing contacts based on the already filled form.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap the sender of an e-mail\r\n2. In the contact draft that appears, scroll down\r\n3. Notice how Create New Contact and Add to Existing Contact are distinct options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe two shouldn't be separate, because if I pick Create New, I risk creating a duplicate, and if I pick Add to Existing, I risk there not being an existing to pick from.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe two are separate. The phone knows which contacts exist, and shouldn't place the burden of having to know that on the user."
