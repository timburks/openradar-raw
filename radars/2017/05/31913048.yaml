    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Xcode playgrounds, sending simple AppleScript commands to Xcode results causes the playground to stop functioning\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a playground (e.g. the attached MyPlayground.playground).\r\n2. Use the playground as usual.\r\n3. Send AppleScript commands to Xcode, e.g.\r\n\r\ntell application \"Xcode\"\r\n\tget file of front document whose name is \"MyPlayground.playground\"\r\nend tell\r\n\r\n(see CrashPlayground.scpt).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playground should continue to function as usual.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe playground immediately shows an error message \"Failed to launch process. The operation couldn't be completed. (Mach error -308 - ipc/mig server died)\r\n\r\nAfter a while, modifying the playground does show updated results again, so I suspect that the connection does recover at some point. However, it should not crash in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe attachment includes log messages and a screenshot of the error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem has also been reported by other users: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43072267/playgrounds-broken-in-xcode-8-3. In particular, http://stackoverflow.com/a/43627985 refers to the app Timing which works by sending AppleScript commands to applications.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2012 Retina MacBook Pro, running macOS Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://timingapp.com/download/CrashPlayground.zip"
