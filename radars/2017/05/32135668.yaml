    description: "Area:\r\nScreen Saver & desktop\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI came back to my MacBook Pro and my Apple Watch unlocked the screen (Which I previously has put to Sleep before my lunch).\r\n\r\nTwo of my external displays are still displaying the blurred out login screen, and I cannot interact with any windows.\r\n\r\nIf I show Desktop I can see my desktop, but the blurred background is masking all other Windows on my Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put MacBook Pro 15\" 2016 to Sleep from the menu bar (Apple).\r\n2. Unlock system with Apple Watch / TouchID / Password (I think I did Apple Watch, but it's hard to remember)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. All login blur screens should disappear and I should be able to use all external monitors\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Two of my external monitors are unusable because the background is on top of them.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" 2016\r\n1-2 external monitors\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MacBook Pro 2016 - PaulSolt.spx', 'UnlockBugExternalMonitor (3).png', 'UnlockBugExternalMonitor.png' and 'UnlockBugExternalMonitor (2).png' were successfully uploaded."
