    description: "Area:\r\nCellular Service (Calls / Data)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere should be a global switch somewhere in Settings to tell iOS I have an unlimited 4G plan, and not force me to use WiFi for updated.\r\nMy home wifi is 8Mbps.\r\nMy work wifi is 5Mbps.\r\nIn both places, I have a stable 40Mbps, unlimited 4G connectivity.\r\nWhy should I be forced to download iOS and app updates on wifi? I understand limited plans need this feature, but in my case it's a burden.\r\nOh, and we're a whole country like that (every customer of Free Mobile in France has unlimited 4G).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse an unlimited 4G plan, and try to download any large app update (like Facebook does every week or so), or an iOS/watchOS update.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should not be forced to use my slow, crappy WiFi.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI am forced to use my slow, crappy WiFi.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS version since ages."
