    description: "Area:\r\nWorkout\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you have an app that starts a workout on Apple Watch from iPhone, and you attempt to start a workout while the watch is still installing the app, starting the workout fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iPhone app that starts a workout on Apple Watch using HKHealthStore’s startWatchApp(with:completion:) method.\r\n2. Start a workout immediately after installing the iPhone app, while it’s still installing the app on the watch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app will finish installing and then begin the workout.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app “opens” to a blank screen with the app title in the status bar, then closes after a few seconds. The workout never starts."
