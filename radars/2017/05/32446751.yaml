    description: "Summary:\r\nI had a messed up UTI for com.adobe.pdf which caused UIDocumentMenuViewController to fail to show any document provider locations. Since there is no facility to reset the UTI database to what is defined by the system plus installed apps, I tried to reset and restore my iPhone. But the restore caused the problem to reappear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI suspect that you can corrupt the com.adobe.pdf UTI by having an app define another UTI that has no conformance to any parent types. Then this UTI declaration will be restored from an iCloud backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRestoring an iCloud backup should restore the UTI database to what is defined by the OS plus only what is defined by installed apps.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nRestoring an iCloud backup restored a faulty UTI which overrode the com.adobe.pdf UTI defined by the system.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease refer to my blog post https://www.cocoanetics.com/2017/05/document-menu-view-controller-not-showing-locations/ for details about the defunct UTI and the problem this caused."
