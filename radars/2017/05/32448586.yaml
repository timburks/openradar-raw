    description: "A common use case for using the CoreSpotlight API is to index documents. Currently, this requires that all the text inside the document be stored in one CSSearchableItemAttributeSet, irrespective of what page they are on.\r\nHowever, this method does not work well when dealing with large documents â€” the document can only ever be opened to the first page, since once does not get enough metadata when a search result is tapped.\r\nThe current workaround is to create separate CSSearchableItems for each page, but this would result in unnecessary bloat in the index from the metadata (especially the thumbnails).\r\nThe API has a nice separation of concerns between an item and its attributes set, so t would be great to be able to specify a \"common\" attribute set instance, and then add more specific attribute sets for each page."
