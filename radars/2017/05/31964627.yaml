    description: "Summary:\r\nSelect Apple application (e.g. Safari, Xcode) print dialogs are not loading APDialogExtensions as other applications do when using macOS Sierra. Without plugins loaded, this leads to a change or loss in functionality with some printers as required options may not be visible or may have changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a printer using a PPD that loads plugins using APDialogExtensions\r\n2. Using an affected Apple application (e.g. Safari, Xcode), open the Print dialog\r\n3. Click \"Show Details\"\r\n4. Click the printer options/PDE dropdown menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll options for that printer driver would be visible in the options dropdown. For example, color, finishing, or billing options.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly \"Printer Features,\" as defined using OpenGroup commands in the PPD, is visible. Menus that would have appeared as part of APDialogExtensions plugins are not visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRicoh MP C6004, Ricoh Aficio MP 2550B, Ricoh MP 3055 HP LaserJet P3010 Series\r\n10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Create a preset with the required settings using an application that loads all options. Select this preset in an affected application. Prints complete as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not occur in macOS 10.12.1, 10.12.2; OS X El Capitan"
