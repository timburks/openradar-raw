    description: "Create swift source code containing an identifier containing the soft hyphen character. This is an invisible character in most editors. \r\n\r\nIt will confuse users because the same sequence of characters without the soft hyphen will look the same, but not match.\r\n\r\nThe soft hyphen is documented as a legal character in this page:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/LexicalStructure.html \r\n\r\nidentifier-head → U+00A8, U+00AA, U+00AD, U+00AF, U+00B2–U+00B5, or U+00B7–U+00BA\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nrun this code in a Swift playground:\r\n\r\n if let u = UnicodeScalar(0x00ad) { // U+00AD is a legal character\r\n     let c : Character = Character(u)\r\n     print(\"import Foundation\\n\\nvar invisible\\(c)hypen = 12\\n\")\r\n }\r\n\r\ncopy the output into the same playground or another one.\r\n\r\nthe variable looks like \"invisiblehyphen\" but contains the invisible hyphen character.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI thing this character should not be allowed in identifiers, and the Swift compiler should issue an invalid character error message if the soft hyphen character is in an identifier or anywhere other than a string (and maybe not then?)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncompiler fails to recognize \"invisiblehyphen\" (with no U+00AD character) as the same identifier as the one copied from the output that does contain U+00AD."

    title: Swift allows U+00AD as a character in identifiers. This is the "soft hyphen" and is normally invisible.
