    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Settings > Privacy > Analytics there is a setting to “Share iPhone Analytics” (with Apple) and a second to “Share With App Developers”. If I recall correctly, users are asked about this on the initial device setup and after an OS upgrade.\r\n\r\nIt would be very valuable for developers that want to respect users’ privacy to have read access to that setting so they can disable any tracking if the user has not opted into it. You could even enforce that in App Store Guidelines, but I won’t go there ;)"
