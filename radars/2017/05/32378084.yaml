    description: "Summary:\r\nI have unit test code that simulates various error conditions, including unreachable directories. With the latest Xcode and macOS (I upgraded both simultaneously), a file copy operation that has always failed (correctly), still fails, but reports success via a YES return value and a nil NSError.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and test the attached project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe unit test passes, indicating a failure to copy a file into a readonly directory, correctly reported as a failure via the API\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe unit test fails, because YES is returned from -[NSFileManager copyItemAtPath:toPath:error:]. No NSError value is returned either\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was working for many prior versions of macOS/Xcode"
