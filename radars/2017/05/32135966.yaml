    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition when presenting/dismissing UITabBarController tabs results in inconsistent behavior when relying on selectedIndex{ didSet { â€¦  } } for functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting a different tab programmatically (i.e. `selectedIndex = 1`), the selectedIndex property is given a new value. In addition, when tapping a different tab (not programmatic), the delegate method (tabBarController(_ tabBarController: UITabBarController, didSelect viewController: UIViewController)) is called.\r\n\r\nHowever, when calling cancel() on a UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition, neither the delegate method or property setter is triggered, but the selectedIndex property *is* reset to it's initial value.\r\n\r\nFor my use case, it would be nice to rely on the set/didSet to be called whenever a tab is changed. It doesn't seem right that the underlying state of the tab bar should change without causing any (observable) change to the public properties.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch included sample app\r\n2. Begin the interactive gesture by panning from top to bottom\r\n3. Cancel the gesture by releasing your tap close to the tap origin (the threshold for a cancel is 50% progress)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe latest log line should read \"Selected Index: 0\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe latest log line still reads \"Selected Index: 1\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1 [14E304]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can verify that the selectedIndex has indeed been changed to it's initial value by tapping the \"Log selectedIndex\" button on the first view controller.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Tab Cancel.zip' was successfully uploaded."
