    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating too many background tasks overloads Springboard and crashes it, or makes the whole OS act weird / no longer opens apps, causes resprings and so on. See https://twitter.com/steipete/status/869822321216933889 for a video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached Sample and run on device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCreating excessive background tasks should not impact Springboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpringboard (and thus, objectively the whole OS) gets sluggish.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe ran into this bug with https://pdfviewer.io/ only after releasing the update and got a ton of 1-star reviews and were multiple days in emergency mode before we found the cause.\n\nWe wrapped all access to file coordination into background tasks, which caused the excessive creation (not as excessive as in this example, but still enough to cause crashes). We got reports of whole resprings with the Apple logo but mostly observed the issues in the video of my tweet: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/869822321216933889\n\nOther people (OvercastFM) ran into this as well. This is more widespread and many people do not know about this edge case.\n\nWe wrapped the coordination calls because older documentation (iOS 7) stated that this is a requirement, before the documentation was silently updated to state that file coordinators take care of creating background tasks directly."
