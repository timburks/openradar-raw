    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac App Store, when updating, will quit apps that are currently running. This is done without warning and can be unexpected, especially if it occurs during use of the app. While it general does not cause the loss of saved work, this is the kind of behavior I'd expect from Windows, not macOS. I'd really like to see an option to delay or cancel an update when an app that is in use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use an app\r\n2. Wait for an update for the app from the App Store\r\n3. Update will automatically install and quit the app without asking\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the app is open, App Store will ask before quitting and give the option to delay or cancel (like the system software update dialog)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app quits unexpectedly\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G8c)"
