    description: "Summary:\r\nA while ago Objective-C got literals and a shorthand for boxing. This works for integers, enums and for any struct that declares the __attribute__((objc_boxable)) - this was all built and there are even tests in Clang that test this. However the declarations in CoreGraphics have never been updated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to compile this: (or see sample code)\n\n    CGRect rect = (CGRect){};\n    NSValue *boxed1 = @(rect);\n    NSLog(@\"Value: %@\", boxed1);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould compile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nerror: illegal type 'CGRect' (aka 'struct CGRect') used in a boxed expression\n    NSValue *boxed1 = @(rect);\n                      ^~~~~~~\n1 error generated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would probably take less than an hour to add everywhere. Doesnâ€™t break any legacy code, makes syntax nicer for everyone. Fully backwards compatible. A total win!\n\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/clang/blob/master/test/CodeGenObjC/Inputs/nsvalue-boxed-expressions-support.h"

    title: Wrapping CGRect in ObjC via @(rect) should be possible. __attribute__((objc_boxable)) is missing
