    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `--set` option in `xcrun simctl` isn't documented anywhere but an Apple employee in the forums described as \"will let you choose a path other than ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices as the set of devices that you want to manage\" (https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/13208). This sounds really interesting for continuous integration servers with multiple executors on the same build node, and the option works great for managing simulators, the problem is that xcodebuild doesn't allow to change the default set \"~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices\" to anything else.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the destination specifier would allow a set option so we can have more isolation in shared continuous integration environments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n# Create a simulator using the set option:\r\n$ xcrun simctl --set \"/Users/renzo.crisostomo/Documents/XING/monorepi\" create iPhone5s 'iPhone 5s' '10.3'\r\n8E58E0D6-5050-4BAD-82E7-3CDA085F6F82\r\n# Attempt to run tests using that identifier as a destination\r\n$ xcodebuild test-without-building -workspace XING.xcworkspace -scheme XNGFoundation -destination \"id=8E58E0D6-5050-4BAD-82E7-3CDA085F6F82\"\r\n# Error:\r\nxcodebuild: error: Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier:\r\n\t\t{ id:8E58E0D6-5050-4BAD-82E7-3CDA085F6F82 }\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be great if the destination argument would accept something like:\r\n$ xcodebuild test-without-building -workspace XING.xcworkspace -scheme XNGFoundation -destination \"id=8E58E0D6-5050-4BAD-82E7-3CDA085F6F82,set=/path/to/set\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently it's not possible to pass the set as part of the destination argument.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.3.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.4"
