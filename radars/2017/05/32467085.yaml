    description: There should be a way to override the maximumIntervalBetweenSuccessiveTaps field in UITapGestureRecognizer if we'd like the delay between taps to be shorter/longer to be recognized as a double tap. Currently, there is no way to do so because this field is a private field. Writing custom UIGestureRecognizers to simulate a custom delay is very tricky and not perfect. We'd like all the logic from UITapGestureRecognizer to be the same but just be able to modify the delay between taps.
