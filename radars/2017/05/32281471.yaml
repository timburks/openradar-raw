    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nStarting with 10.12.4 SIP in MacOS prevents unloading of any LaunchD item from `/System`. While this is generally a good idea, for testing systems there are a number of items there that either pop up unexpectedly (sometimes breaking GUI scripting) or cause jitters that mess with performance numbers. A couple of examples would be `com.apple.notificationcenterui` and `com.apple.apsd`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the `launchctl unload` command has been updated, and gives a descriptive error message, but the `launchctl disable` command does not seem to work for these and does not give any error message.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n`sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist`\r\nor\r\n`sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.notificationcenterui`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat that process goes away, and does not come back on a reboot (the latter is not strictly required for my purposes).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe first version has a descriptive error message, the latter does not. Neither shuts down the service.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nStarting in 10.12.4. I have confirmed that 10.12.3 does not have this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI could switch off SIP, but that would make my testing less valid.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
