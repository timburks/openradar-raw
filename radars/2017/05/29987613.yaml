    description: "Summary:\r\nStatus bar orientation and interface orientation and window bounds don't change on device rotation if main thread is busy processing layout caused by previous orientation change.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project in landscape (usleep(2ull * USEC_PER_SEC) in viewDidLayoutSubviews).\r\nRotate the device to portrait and then without waiting rotate back to landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEventually the app UI and status bar should display correctly (the same as when the app was first started) after two device rotations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app UI, including iOS status bar doesn't extend to the whole screen width, staying the way it would be in portrait orientation.\r\nSee the attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nIf you log current orientations to the console, the results would be following:\r\ninterfaceOrientation = 1, statusBarOrientation = 1, deviceOrientation = 3, window.bounds = {{0, 0}, {1024, 1366}}\r\n\r\nInterface orientation and status bar orientation and window bounds do not match current device orientation."
