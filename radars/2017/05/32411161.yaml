    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAt this time, there is no way to detect which MVPD the user tapped on in the Apple MVPD picker list.  It would be great if a notification was fired when a supported MVPD was selected from the list for analytics reporting purposes.\r\n\r\n(I don't know if this ticket should be reported to you or Adobe, so I'm reporting it as an enhancement here first)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Present the VSViewServiceHostViewController\r\n2. Tap on an Apple SSO supported MVPD\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProvide a callback or notification with information on the MVPD the user selected\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo MVPD information is provided.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.x and above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
