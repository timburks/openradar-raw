    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter typing a URL in the URL bar and hitting Enter Safari just sits there and doesn't nothing for 10-20 seconds. After that the page loads normally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have IPv6 auto configured, but the network not support it\r\n2. Type a URL that hasn't been locally cached in the Safari URL bar\r\n3. Press the Enter key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPage loads more or less immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's a 10-20 second delay before the page loads.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTurning off IPv6 seems to solve the problem:\r\n\r\n$ networksetup -setv6off \"Wi-Fi\"\r\n\r\nI've tried clearing Safari caches completely, and the obvious reboots, but that didn't change anything.\r\n\r\nI'm on a Unifi Wi-Fi network, with a Comcast Business internet connection. Other browsers, like Chrome and Firefox do not exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, 4 Thunderbolt 3 Ports)"
