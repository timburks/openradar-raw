    description: "A webpage made with a certain quantity of JS is very slow to be loaded (about 40 seconds) with UIWebView when it takes only 4 seconds with WKWebView. \r\nAlso, during the UIWebView loading, we've seen that a request is made to pancake.apple.com and takes about 31 seconds. Is this linked to the issue ?"
