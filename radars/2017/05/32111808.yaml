    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Connect tells users who have received a metadata rejection that they should update the metadata and resubmit, rather than replying directly to the metadata rejection. This causes the app to be kicked to the back of the review line, causing unnecessary wasted time when the only change has been a metadata update specifically requested by App Review. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get email indicating you need to visit resolution center in iTC. \r\n2. Click link in email, see message in “Actual Results”\r\n3. Perform steps to update metadata as outlined in message in “Actual Results”\r\n4. Have app kicked to the back of app review line\r\n5. Spend a day talking product people off the ledge because the app is still Waiting For Review. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should go directly back into review. If one replies directly to the message BEFORE updating the metadata, the app will go back into review. If one updates the metadata first, as outlined by the steps in the instructions, the app will get kicked to the back of the review line. \r\n\r\nEither the messaging should be changed or the underlying functionality for a resubmission with only updated metadata after a metadata rejection should put the app back into review at the front of the queue. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessage from ITC between the tick marks: \r\n\r\n```\r\nFrom Apple\r\n2. 1 Performance: App Completeness\r\nGuideline 2.1 - Information Needed\r\n\r\n[information which is being requested]\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\n\r\nTo help us proceed with the review of your app, please provide us with a link to a demo video in the App Review Information section of iTunes Connect and reply to this message in Resolution Center.\r\n\r\nTo provide a link to a demo video:\r\n\r\n- Log in to iTunes Connect\r\n- Click on \"My Apps\"\r\n- Select your app\r\n- Click on the app version on the left side of the screen\r\n- Scroll down to \"App Review Information\"\r\n- Provide demo video access details in the \"Notes\" section\r\n- Click \"Save\"\r\n- Once you've completed all changes, click the \"Submit for Review\" button at the top of the App Version Information page.\r\n\r\nOnce this information is available, we can continue with the review of your app.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have encountered this issue for at least a year, I just blanked on it yesterday and followed the instructions, leading to my POs having a giant freakout, so I’m getting off my ass and filing a Radar about it now.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe fact that the instructions lead to an unnecessary boot to the back of the line makes a frustrating situation positively rage-inducing. Please update the boilerplate which is attached to metadata rejections to indicate that said information can be provided directly to the reviewers by replying rather than editing the input and resubmitting. \r\n\r\nThank you!"
