    description: "Summary:\r\nBefore Xcode 8.0, when you did a merge with a scm command line tool  and conflicts happened, when you opened the corresponding project in Xcode, a little \"c\" icons was appearing ( like the \"a\" or the \"m\" when a file is added or modified since the last commit). Since Xcode 8.0, nothing appears on the conflicted files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 8.x (reproductible on xcode from 8.0 to 8.3.2)\r\n2. Open a project under version control\r\n3. Do a merge from another branch which cause conflicts on certain files from the terminal\r\n4. Look for file status on the navigator pane\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA little \"c\" should appear in the navigator panel  near each file containing conflicts indicating the file has conflicts. Those files should appear when the filter \"show only files with source control status\" is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe little \"c\" icon doesn't show-up for conflicted files, instead no status is shown for those file making impossible to identify conflicted files like before\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
