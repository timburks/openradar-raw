Fill out the \"Configuration\" field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConfigurations need to be manually typed in\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere would be a way to fill out the Configuration field with previously saved configurations\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSimilar to rdar://problem/26997685\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Beta (16G8c)"
