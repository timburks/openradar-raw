    description: "We use Automatic code signing for all of our projects which works very well in development.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately automatic code signing does not work well with our CI infrastructure which rebuilds the app for each publisher using their team's code signing, for ad-hoc and app-store.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this has forced us to resort to patching the project.pbxproj file on the fly on the CI server to remove the DevelopmentTeam and ProvisioningStyle Target Attributes before calling xcodebuild with manual code signing params.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would like a means of telling xcodebuild to ignore automatic provisioning without modifying the project file.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Take project with automatic signing enabled\r\n2. Call xcodebuild with DEVELOPMENT_TEAM, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY and PROVISIONING_PROFILE overrides on CLI\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe build to succeed using the manual code signing parameters\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBuild fails with:\r\n\r\nCheck dependencies\r\nProject has conflicting provisioning settings. Project is automatically signed, but provisioning profile xxxx has been manually specified. Set the provisioning profile value to \"Automatic\" in the build settings editor, or switch to manual signing in the project editor."
