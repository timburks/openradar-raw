    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an app supports content-available push notifications, the configuration shown in the attached screenshot should—but does not—allow silent updating of the app. (In lieu of screenshot for Open Radar, turn on \"Allow notifications\", but turn off Show in Notification Center, Sounds, Badge App Icon, Show on Lock Screen, and set Alert Style to None)\r\n\r\nThe attached configuration should function as expected. There are many apps, e.g. Wallet or podcast players to name two categories, where it would be desirable to have updates initiated by push notification but without requiring the on-screen clutter of other notification UI such as banners, badges, or entries in Notification Center. I don't need to know that my Starbucks card was updated after I make a purchase, but I do need to know the correct balance when I'm _about_ to make a new purchase. Likewise, I don't need to know that a new episode of my favorite podcast is out, but I do need to have it ready and waiting for me when I launch Overcast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Notifications preferences for Wallet as shown in the screenshot\r\n2. Configure a pass with automatic updates. For my example, I used a Starbucks card\r\n3. Make a purchase with the pass.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStarbucks card balance updates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStarbucks card balance does not update.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTurning on _any_ of the other options such as Badge App Icon, Banners, Alerts, Show in Notification Center, or Show on Lock Screen allows the balance to update."
