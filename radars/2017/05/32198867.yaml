    description: "Summary:\r\nAt WWDC16, during session 409 \"Advanced Testing and Continuous Integration\", `build-for-testing` and `test-without-building` were introduced. Since then, it has been possible to build test in one computer and move over the build products to run those tests in a different computer.\r\n\r\nFor testing iOS apps, the procedure is straightforward as the test bundle, frameworks, and other dependencies, are contained within the application bundle, so it's easy to identify the right build product and move it to a different computer.\r\n\r\nFor frameworks this isn't the case. The produced xctest bundle doesn't know anything about it's dependencies so it's up to the user to find the right frameworks and put them in the build directory so they're found while running the tests.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem if derived data is shared between many framework targets, as looking for \"all framework in build directory\" could be potentially expensive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing the latest Xcode version (8.3.2 at the time of writing)\r\n1. Run test_framework.sh\r\n\r\nFrameworkZ is a completely unrelated build product, but following that procedure (best one I could came up with) would incorrectly \"stash it\" as a dependency of the tests.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally everything necessary to run the unit tests should be contained in \"something\" (ideally the xctest bundle) so moving a directory between computers becomes feasible. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSharing derived data becomes really hard and for complex setups, build-for-testing and test-without-building are not helpful by themselves. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.3.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'XING.zip' was successfully uploaded."
