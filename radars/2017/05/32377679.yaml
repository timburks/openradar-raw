    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe TouchBar is incredibly frustrating because it keeps given me all these false positives (unintended touches).\r\n\r\nI don't really like it, because too many times I'm working on a document or editing a spreadsheet and it's changing modes without me realizing... and then all of a sudden in Numbers I'm bulk editing values, when I just want to edit a single entry.\r\n\r\nThe tips of my fingers on the number keys or the backspace key should not create a touch. It's a very poor user experience.\r\n\r\nPlease try the document and watch the video to see how much I have to constantly undo actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Numbers \"ExampleSpreadsheet\" on a MacBook Pro 2016 with TouchBar\r\n2. Start typing without looking at keyboard\r\n3. Try to add numbers and work on different cells for some kind of data\r\n4. Add new rows, add new dates\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Touch typing on the keyboard should be pleasant and you should not have to make corrections from accidental touches on the TouchBar\r\n2. Behavior should match the experience on a MacBook Pro without TouchBar\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n1. Throughout the day as I'm typing all kinds of strange things happen\r\n2. In Numbers about 50 times a day when I'm filling out my spreadsheets or task tracking, it's going into \"Auto Fill\" mode\r\n3. If I'm typing a document in Pages or Multimarkdown and I press backspace, it's turning on/off Siri (or what ever button I have above the Delete key ... now mute... was show desktop... was lock ... all of those got very annoying very quickly because it created massive interruptions)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is no \"palm rejection\" for the TouchBar, and there should be. Too many times, since I'm typing quickly on a real keyboard my fingers aren't always in the same alignment.\r\n\r\nThis means that I'm going to have a lot of accidental touches on the top bar, because my fingers are fat and sometimes uncoordinated. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this issue, it's really frustrating to use this keyboard. I love almost everything else about the laptop, except this feature.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 TouchBar"
