        Summary:
        When a breakpoint is set on the assistant editor (two files opened side by side). Every time Xcode hits that a breakpoint it will take the content from the right pane and put it into the left pane. This is very annoying for obvious reasons.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open 2 files side by side using assistant editor mode
        - Set a breakpoint on the right pane

        Expected Results:
        When the breakpoint hits, the content of both panes should remain the same

        Actual Results:
        Left pane is replaced and both left and right panes show the same content
