    description: "Summary:\r\nNormally with UIStoryboards, a scene that contains a UIViewController whose view is empty will load the view for that UIViewController from a XIB that matches its name. This allows us to have \"placeholder\" Storyboard scenes with the views for those defined elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when the \"elsewhere\" is a different module. Since UIViewController's loadView only searches the main app bundle for a XIB with a matching name, it fails to load the view correctly in multi-module projects. It's worth noting that this behaviour is explicitly as-documented but likely unintended since its implementation predates dynamic frameworks on iOS. Additionally, macOS currently already handles this correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Main.storyboard of a new Xcode project (A), remove the view from the initial UIViewController's scene.\r\n2. Add the Xcode project to a workspace. Add another Xcode project (B) to that workspace that builds a framework target MyModule.\r\n3. In Xcode project B, create a UIViewController subclass MyViewController and a matching MyViewController.xib file.\r\n4. In Xcode project A’s Main.storyboard, set the class of the initial view controller to MyViewController (and observe Module changing to MyModule).\r\n5. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app runs, the Storyboard loads MyViewController’s view from MyViewController.xib and displays it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app runs, but the Storyboard loads an empty UIView for MyViewController, resulting in a crash if MyViewController connects any IBOutlets from the XIB."
