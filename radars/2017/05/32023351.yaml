    description: "Developers should be able to set a device into \"software update lockdown\", where they would get fewer notices to update their iOS and are prevented from doing so inadvertently.\r\n\r\nFor example, our company supports our apps on any of iOS 8, 9 and 10 devices.  We need to have devices available to test our apps against those iOS.  The devices are checked out and shared, and are sometimes mistakenly updated to the latest iOS because of automated mechanisms and notifications.  This is not desirable.  These devices can not be downgraded, and therefore, their usefulness for testing diminishes if they are updated to latest iOS version that we already have.\r\n\r\nThe preferred mechanism for accomplishing this goal could be a switch under the Developer settings that will lock down all iOS updates.  A user trying to update will then be directed to turn that switch off, and try again, if they really want to update the device."
