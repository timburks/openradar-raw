    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Swift compilation phase would also produce an indication in a status bar: of how many files are being compiled and what is a progress.\r\n\r\nThe example is the same as of Objective-C compilation phase:\r\n\r\n\"Compiling Swift source files (43 of 300)\"\r\n\r\nThis feature has been missing since 2014 until now especially given Swift compiler is still much slower than Objective-C compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3.2 (8E2002) and all versions with Swift since 2014.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis feature is especially nice to have on large projects with >100000 lines of code.\r\n\r\nP.S. https://github.com/stanislaw/Xcode-Major-Bugs"
