    description: "Summary:\nAfter pairing (automatically via iCloud) AirPods to Apple Watch (Series 2, SS 42mm), watch is unable to maintain solid connection to heart rate monitors anymore. Connection lasts for 1-2 seconds and then drops displaying \"Not Connected\" Bluetooth Settings. Attempt to reconnect heart rate monitor to watch after this is extremely hard unless HRM device goes to sleep. After waking up, watch might connect to device for only few seconds again. Forcing watch to forget/re-pair device yields same result. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Pair AirPods to any iCloud connected device.\n2. Pair HRM to Apple Watch\n3. Start Workout (alternately goto to Bluetooth Settings and look and connection status)\n\nExpected Results:\nWatch should maintain connections to HRM on reasonable distance.\n\nActual Results:\nWatch drops connection to HRM decide within 1 to 2 seconds.\n\nRegression:\nBefore AirPods got paired, this functionality did work as expected. It is hard to verify since WatchOS version also did change after AirPods got introduced.\n\nNotes:\nTested with Wahoo TICKR X and Topeak PanoBike HRM. Both yield same results."
