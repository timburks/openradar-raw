    description: "Summary:\r\nThis error appeared in Xcode when trying to open a storyboard that my colleagues had been working on. I have no idea how it happened, or why.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAn Xcode restart seems to have cleared up the problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIB to show me my storyboard\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIB only shows wireframes of my views, and asks me to submit this bug report.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not sure what to say about this. Xcode asked me to send the attached documents. I had just checked the project out of git.\r\n\r\nI restarted Xcode, did a clean, and everything seems to be ok now. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt's only occurred once. The Xcode project uses Cocoapods, so it's an .xcworkspace, with .xcodeproj files for both the Pods, and the project itself.\r\n\r\nAll the storyboards have some IBDesignable views, if that's relevant.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IB-agent-diagnostics_2017-05-10_13-54-00_866000.zip' was successfully uploaded."
