    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 will not switch configurations based on the current build scheme. I have build configurations that need to compile with different entitlements files. These configurations are driven by different build schemes. When switching from one build scheme to another and attempting to archive, Xcode always reads the same configuration. It then fails to compile when it checks dependencies, because it always reads from the same scheme, and throws an error message that the current entitlements file does not match the group id I am trying to use for App Groups.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new project.\r\n2. Deactivate \"Automatically manage signing\" in the \"General\" tab.\r\n3. Add multiple configurations to the project.\r\n4. Define all configurations to use a different bundle ID.\r\n5. Add the app groups entitlements.\r\n6. Specify a different entitlements file for each configuration.\r\n7. Use a different app group ID in each entitlement file (e.g. \"group.<bundleID>.AppName\")\r\n8. Try selecting a provisioning profile for each configuration. At least one will show an error.\r\n9. Attempt to archive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nArchive succeeds\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe build will throw a dependency error, stating the entitlements file does not support the app idâ€™s App Group bundle id. The capabilities tab does not allow switching between the active scheme.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 8.3.2 / 8E2002\r\nmacOS: 10.12.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny"
