        Summary:
        While Apple Enterprise Connect (a Professional Services product) can be managed via MDM, MDM vendors handle it via their individual methods for custom payloads.  This state increases the Enterprise Connect adoption cost.

        Please expand the MDM protocol on macOS to explicitly support Enterprise Connect payloads.  Similar to MDM management of Mail, AirPrint printers, or binding to Active Directory, this addition makes it easier to validate and deploy a consistent behavior within the enterprise.
