    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8.3+ Continuous Integration on macOS Server (5.3) has become all but unusable. Within a few minutes of a restart, there are 1-2 100% node processes owned by the _xcsd user.\r\n\r\nRemote connections via the built-in Xcode bot views rarely succeed, and even then they take a long time and show out-of-date or incomplete data about bots and integrations. Remote and local instances of Server.app also rarely successfully load the Xcode service panel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable Xcode service with Xcode 8.3.2 on Server.app 5.3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIntegrations should succeed, Server.app and Xcode should be able to interact with the continuous integration functionality. No excessive CPU use while idle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIntegrations rarely succeed, Server.app and Xcode cannot interact with the continuous integration functionality. Multiple cores are completely used by _xcsd processes to the point of thermal throttling in system console logs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nServer.app 5.3, Xcode 8.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2014 Mac Mini, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (system report attached)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'd20170424-78884-1u2xguh.xcsdiagnose.tgz' and 'Mac mini.spx' were successfully uploaded."
