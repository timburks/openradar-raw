    description: It would be great if, besides the existing "Remove at build time" option for constraints, there would be an "Add at build time" option too, which would make sure the respective constraint is only taken into consideration at run time, and not in Interface Builder. This way, you could easily create 2 constraints that automatically gets swapped at run time, useful for designing UIScrollViews for example.
