    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are stock prices from certain exchanges that are found by the search box, including a current price, but a refresh then causes a red triangle to appear, claiming that there is no security by that symbol\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a new blank sheet, insert Stock Quote\r\n2. Search for BUWOG, select the BWO.VI one (vienna stock exchange, the home for this security)\r\n3. Insert a second Stock Quote in another cell: Search for RBI.VI\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- For both securities a current stock price is retrieved and added to the spread sheet.\r\n- Every now and then I expect to have these prices be updated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- At first the current stock price shows\r\n- But after a short while the stock price is replaced with a red triangle\r\n- The red triangle claims \"There is no security named \"RBI.VI\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c), Numbers version 4.1 (4328)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found that if you do that on a second sheet with the first one showing the red triangles you first get the red triangles to be correctly replaced with a stock price, but then after a while the triangles are back, on all sheets.\r\n\r\nOther users seem to experience the same issue with some other specific stock exchanges, see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7905514?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Mid 2014\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
