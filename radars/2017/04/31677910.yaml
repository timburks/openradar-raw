    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt should be possible to copy the iOS version and build number from the About pane in the Settings app.\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to copy some informations from this table (such as IMEI, serial number, SEID, MEID) by long pressing on the table row but such interaction is not enabled for the version row.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Settings app\r\n2. Navigate to General > About\r\n3. Long press the Version row\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA menu controller with a 'Copy' item should be displayed above the row, allowing the user to copy the iOS version and build number to the general pasteboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLong pressing the row has no effect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.2 build 14F5080a (\U0001F448 manually recopied)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would greatly improve the process of inputting the build number in bug reports.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEvery time, everywhere, every device"
