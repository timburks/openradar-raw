    description: "Area:\r\niTunes\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAttached you'll find an MP3, one of many I have, with 32 kHz audio that exhibits annoying artifacts when playing back in native macOS players, including iTunes.\r\n\r\nThe first couple of minutes of this file don't have many artifacts. But starting around 2:25, when you hear a loud trombone start to play, the glitches become much more frequent and loud.\r\n\r\nThe glitches do NOT appear in players that don't use macOS native playback, like VLC. Using VLC (on macOS or any other) to reÃ«ncode the file at 44.1 kHz yields a file exhibiting no glitches when played in iTunes.\r\n\r\nIn QuickTime Player, instead of the glitches having their own distorted sound like they do in iTunes, they appear as very short silences in the track.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlay certain 32 kHz MP3s in iTunes, QuickTime Player, or other native macOS audio players\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou hear the song as the composer intended\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou hear the song with glitchy artifacts or silences, depending on which player you chose\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2\r\n1.7 GHz Core i7\r\n8 GB RAM\r\n\r\nSafari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34)\r\niTunes 12.6.0.100"
