    description: "Example gist: https://gist.github.com/dylanslewis/a6da1117cfc23bf99047ecfd48d52cc3\r\n\r\nIf a label is created with an attributed string that has two attributes (kerning and a paragraph style with line spacing) and the text for that label has one line, there is extra space added to the bottom of the label. This issue does not occur when the label has two lines, or when the kerning attribute is removed from the attributed string.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open the playground in the attached file (see top of description for GitHub gist link)\r\n2. Open the counterparts view to see the label\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nThe label's frame's height extends to the bottom of the descenders of the text.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nThe label's frame's height extends beyond the descenders of the text (roughly 10px)\r\n\r\niPhone SE, iPhone 7 Plus, iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)\r\n\r\n10.3, macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nThe space that is added to the label is not influenced by changing the values of either the kerning or line spacing, or by changing the font used."
