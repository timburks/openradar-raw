    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a new SpriteKit project in Xcode with a hyphen in the name, then attempt to run it without modification, it will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to File > Newâ€¦ > Project\r\n2. Select \"Game\" Under Application and hit Next\r\n3. Set \"Project Name\" to a name with a hyphen\r\n4. Make sure \"Game Technology\" is set to \"SpriteKit\"\r\n5. Make sure \"Integrate GameplayKit\" is checked\r\n6. Hit Next, then Create\r\n7. Go to Product > Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject starts and displays \"Hello, World!\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode returns \"signal SIGABRT\" error in Thread 1 with description \"Could not cast value of type 'SKScene' (0x10949c530) to '<projectname_withunderscore>.GameScene' (0x10878e700).\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3.1 (8E1000a)\r\nmacOS Version 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA project exhibiting this problem is also attached. Explicitly setting \"Module\" to \"withahyphen_ios\" for the \"Scene\" node in \"GameScene.sks\" fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nGoing to \"GameScene.sks\" and explicitly setting the \"Module\" field in the Custom Class Inspector of the \"Scene\" node to the project name with the hyphen replaced with a underscore resolves the issue. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'withahyphen-ios.zip' was successfully uploaded."
