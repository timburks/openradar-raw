    description: "Summary:\r\nThere appears to be no way to cause an Archive action failure by returning an error from a Pre-action script. Output to stderr is ignored, as are non-zero exit values.\r\nThis is highly undesirable because any script failure is very difficult to notice/find.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a new Run Script Action under the Archive action's \"Pre-actions\" section. The script can be as simple as \"exit 1\". For fun, echo some text to stderr.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA non-zero exit code from a Pre-action script should cause the Archive action to fail. Output to stderr (or even stdout) should be shown in the build log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe failure is completely ignored. No output is shown in the build log."
