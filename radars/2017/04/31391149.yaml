    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI noticed that when I resize the piano roll, and playback is happening, looped clips sometimes get non-looped drawing, but only for part of the clip.  If I scroll, you can see a clip with partially correct shading.  Resizing the piano roll again causes things to draw correctly.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to describe, so see the attached movie. I'll attach the project once this uploads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLogic Pro X 10.3.1\r\n10.11.6 (15G1217) [my machine cannot run 10.12 legitimately)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI first noticed this with 10.3.1, but doesn't mean it hasn't been in there before.  This piece, which will be my 87 minute ode to Philip Glass, is the first megalooped project I've done before.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'resizing drawing floobages.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
