        Summary:
        When searching thru the AddressBar (setup to search with Google), sometimes - but often to be very annoying - searches will take 5 to 20 seconds to load. Sometimes it's needed to tap on enter twice to actual start the search (might be that it is hanging?). THIS IS NOT A NETWORK PROBLEM, other browsers run perfectly fine.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to Safari
        2. Enter a non-cached search term
        3. Tap enter.

        Expected Results:
        4. Google loads within a second with the results for the entered search term

        Actual Results:
        - Loading takes 5 to 20 seconds
        - Sometimes an additional enter press is needed

        Regression:
        This started to happen after the update to macOS 10.12.4
