    description: "Summary:\r\nBuilding a complex project with Xcode 8.3 reliably crashes the Swift compiler in a particular source file.  I have been able to reduce the project to a relatively small sample project that crashes the compiler in the same way.  The crash occurred in each of Xcode 8.3, 8.3.1, and 8.3.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 8.3.x (x = 0, 1, 2)\r\n2. Open and build the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project build should complete (possibly with compiler errors) without the Swift compiler crashing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Swift compiler crashes when trying to compile the file \"main.swift\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\nApple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)"
