    description: "Summary:\r\nThe USBC Ports on the LG 5K UltraFine fail to start. It doesn't detect that things are connected.\r\n\r\nI can't plug a USB mouse into my UltraFine without unplugging and replugging either the mouse into the UltraFine (which is a huge pain in the neck getting behind it), or by unplugging and replugging the USBC connector into my MacBook Pro 2016\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug any USBC device into the 5K UltraFine\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The device should work like any other USB2 or USB3 device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The device doesn't work\r\n2. The OS doesn't detect it.\r\n3. I can't use the device without unplugging and replugging multiple times\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUSBC support on the LG UltraFine is a joke. It's so buggy and doesn't work. This is very frustrating. Did you test this product at all?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n5K LG UltraFine and MacBook Pro and USBC Apple cable to lighting + Magic Trackpad, Magic Keyboard, Logitech USB G502 mouse\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2017.04.26_07-51-10-0400_43817.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded."
