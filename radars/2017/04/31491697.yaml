    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a new version of Xcode is announced, it’s available immediately from the Mac App Store, but it takes a while to make its way to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/. They should appear at the same time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Check developer news RSS feed (who uses RSS any more, anyway?) and see that a new version of Xcode has been released.\r\n2. Don’t use the Mac App Store to download and install Xcode, because it makes it harder to keep multiple versions of Xcode installed concurrently. This is necessary for people working in agencies or people who have to support multiple development versions of apps.\r\n3. Try to download new Xcode update from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe update is available on the dev center at the same time that it’s available in the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dev center downloads page lags behind the App Store, sometimes for only a short while, but sometimes significantly. For example, today’s Xcode 8.3.1 update was posted to the dev center RSS feed (https://developer.apple.com/news/rss/news.rss) at Thu, 06 Apr 2017 14:00:00 PDT. It is now Thu, 06 Apr 2017 18:00:00 PDT (four hours later), and still no update.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI seem to recall either Xcode 8.2.1 or 8.3 appearing quickly, but most of the updates for the last year or two (since I started installing from the dev center instead of the App Store) have been very laggy, sometimes not appearing since the next day."
