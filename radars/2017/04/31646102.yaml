    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI want to be able to schedule multiple timed local notifications in advance, and each one should replace the previous one (to avoid clogging up the user's notifications with outdated information if they don't dismiss each one).\r\n\r\nThis isn't currently possible because the mechanism for replacing a previous notification is to use the same identifier, but if the previous notification with that identifier has only been scheduled and not delivered yet, then adding the second notification replaces the first one in the schedule and the first one is never delivered.\r\n\r\nAn example where this enhancement would be useful would be a workout app that runs a pre-determined interval workout plan and uses notifications to inform the user at the set times when they should adjust workout intensity.\r\n\r\nA simple API for this would be to add a parameter to UNNotificationRequest called something like 'replacesNotificationWithIdentifier', or a slightly more elaborate API would be to give notification requests an optional second identifier called the 'replacementIdentifier', and have delivery of notifications with one of those replace all others with the same 'replaceIdentifier' that have been delivered."
