    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nXcode will deadlock if you switch the console output to use Terminal. This happens after a few code/build/run phases when I'm doing my unit tests, and it's a huge time waster.\r\n\r\nIn the video I uploaded it all happens within the first minute, but it can be hard to reproduce. I was unable to reproduce in the remainder of the video. There's some kind of deadlock potential and I'm not sure what. In the video you can see that no Terminal output appears for the failing test, instead Xcode has somehow got itself stuck.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to Force Quit Xcode.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample unit test project using Google Mock that I did for fun, and it demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nYou can't stop the process with Terminal through Xcode. Closing the windows doesn't seem to help, maybe I have to force quit some Terminal process... not really sure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Switch from Console to Terminal in Schemes/Debug\r\n2. Write unit test/code\r\n3. Build and run\r\n4. Repeat 2-100 times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Code should compile and run\r\n2. Output should be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Xcode deadlocks running the Terminal process\r\n2. I cannot write new code\r\n3. I have to Force Quit Xcode to get anything to respond\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing Terminal for output is currently useless at this point. It's too buggy and deadlock prone to be productive.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Deadlock bug scheme setup Terminal.png', 'XcodeExternalTerminalDeadlock_GMock_UnitTest.mp4', 'sysdiagnose_2017.04.26_08-29-07-0400_57055.tar.gz' and 'SampleXcodeProject.zip' were successfully uploaded."
