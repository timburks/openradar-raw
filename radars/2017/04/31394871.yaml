    description: "Summary:\r\nThere does not appear to be any API to get or set the size of a Playground's liveView; Swift Playgrounds appears to stretch (Playground) or crop (PlaygroundBook) the view. It would be great if there was a way to get the size of this view, so that it could be taken into account when creating the liveView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assign a view to a Playground's liveView\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere would be a way to get the size of the frame\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere isn't one\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSwift Playgrounds 1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c)"
