    description: "Summary:\r\nwatchOS seems to have a thing where it hides the time in the status bar by default if it doesn't fit (see the first attached screenshot). Once the screen is tapped, it will show the time by truncating the title (second screenshot). I'd like to suggest that the second behavior be enabled at all times in the Workouts app; I find it much more important to know what the time is than the actual workout I'm doing (it's obvious what workout I'm doing; I'm in the middle of it!); in addition, it can occasionally be difficult or dangerous to tap the screen to see the timeâ€“for example, when biking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a workout with a long name (for example, \"Outdoor cycle\")\r\n2. Try to check the time by twisting your wrist to show the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe time is always shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time is only shown after tapping the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2.2 (14V5480a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport Series 2 running watchOS 3.2.2 (14V5480a)"
