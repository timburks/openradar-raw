    description: "Area:\r\nCore Animation\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn a 2x device, rendering a CALayer with shadowRadius = r and shadowOffset = (x, y) in a manually created CGContext using CALayer.render(in:) produces a shadow with shadowRadius = r/2 and shadowOffset = (x/2, -y/2), as if transformation matrix is not set up and still in the initial state even though it is already correctly set up.\r\n\r\nIf the context is set up using UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions the result is correct.\r\n\r\nEven if I create my own context based on the context created with UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions the result is still wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap Render button.\r\n3. Check saved images in Photos app.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode:\r\nhttps://cloudup.com/cZZBSCTbDJy"
