        Summary:
        My typical work setup involves having two Xcode windows open with two different workspaces/projects open. I display one window per monitor (one external, one my MacBook Pro screen). When scrolling in one window, typically the external display, if I scroll fast enough to have inertia, the inertia will happen in the other window and not the one I scrolled in initially.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an Xcode project and display it via an external display.
        2. Open a second Xcode project and display it on another screen, such as the MacBook Pro’s screen.
        3. Scroll in the project on the external display.

        Expected Results:
        When scrolling enough to produce inertia, the document I’m scrolling should complete scrolling there.

        Actual Results:
        The document I’m scrolling suddenly stops scrolling, and the inertia is acted on by the other Xcode window.
