    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning workouts have the nifty feature that they can be set to auto-pause when you're standing still. I'd like to see this feature in other types of workouts, like cycling (stoplights are for everyone, not just runners!).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a cycling workout.\r\n2. Stop moving.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe workout would auto-pause (if the appropriate setting in the Watch app is enabled, of course)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe workout continues running, running the clock and messing with the average pace calculation\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2.2 (14V5480a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport Series 2 running watchOS 3.2.2 (14V5480a)"
