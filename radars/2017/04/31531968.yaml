        Summary:
        When deleting (or archiving, moving, etc) a message in the iOS and macOS Mail apps there is no option to return the current view to the message list.  This is extremely frustrating because it is forcing the ever-so-important-and-time-contrained user to read the next message in the list.  More often and not, this particular grumpy user is made more grumpy because I don't want to read any other message aside from the one that I just read.  In such cases (which is 98% of the time) I then need to click the flag icon, select Mark as Unread, then select the back button to return to the message list.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Open a mail message, either from the Mail app or from a notification
        2) Delete that message, because it's not important

        Expected Results:
        I expected to be taken back to the message list, or at least have the option to do so

        Actual Results:
        I'm taken to the next message in my inbox, which I'm not prepared to handle either emotionally or professionally.  Now that message is marked as "read" and the sender probably knows that it was opened using some NSA-designed tracking system (or an img tag) which could be considered a destructive operation.

        Regression:
        This has occurred since Mail.app 1.0 iOS.  Mail.app for macOS/OS X also does it but thankfully has the ability to only show a message list window, which provides a mostly satisfactory workaround.
