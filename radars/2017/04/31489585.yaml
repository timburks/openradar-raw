    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the 'Open With/Other' prompt in Finder and setting a new default application, Gatekeeper says the file can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Finder.\r\n2. Click on a file.\r\n3. Open the File menu for that file.\r\n4. Click 'Open With,' then 'Other.'\r\n5. Choose an application, then mark the 'Always Open With' checkmark\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file will open with the specified application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA Gatekeeper dialog appears stating that the file is from an unknown developer thus it could not be opened. A screenshot of the dialog box is attached.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12, 16A323\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe dialog box attached says that QuickTime player created that file. That is false. Another app created that file. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not occur if you simply choose an application pre-listed in the 'Open With' submenu. This also does not occur if you do not mark the checkbox entitled 'Always Open With.'\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-04-06 at 6.45.32 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
