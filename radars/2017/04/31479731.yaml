    description: "I notice that I am often resting my palm on the upper left corner of the trackpad because this is the nature position for my left hand when I am switching between typing and trackpad. And whenever I try to do a 3 finger swipe with my left palm resting on the trackpad the 3 finger swipe does not work. I hope they can fix this issue because it would feel so much more natural if the palm rejection worked properly in this case. I wouldn't have to swipe a couple times before I realize my palm on the trackpad is the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Use any application that uses the 3 finger swipe gesture.\r\n2) Rest palm on upper left corner with thumb on space key as if you are typing\r\n3) Try to do 3 finger swipe in any direction\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the palm rejection would recognize my palm and still perform the action associated with the 3 finger swipe gesture. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. Does not register the gesture.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacbook Pro 2016 15 inch, A1707 (EMC 3072). MacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis was not a problem with my previous Macbook Pro 2009 15 inch although the trackpad is smaller in that model."
