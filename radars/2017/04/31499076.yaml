    description: "Summary:\r\nOur iOS CI Server needs to verify distribution certificates before using them to sign a build. This worked perfectly fine for years with the following command:\r\n\r\nsecurity verify-cert -p codeSign -c ios_distribution.cer\r\n\r\nIn case the cert could be successfully verified, the output was: \"...certificate verification successful.\" (Exit Code 0)\r\n\r\nIf it could not be verified, e.g. because it has been revoked, the output looked like: \"Cert Verify Result: CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED\" (and Non-Zero Exit Code).\r\n\r\nAfter installing macos Sierra, this stopped working. Calling security verify-cert with revoked certificates always produces the output \"...certificate verification successful.\" and a zero exit code. I've tested this with several certs from different accounts on several machines. Some of the certs were revoked for over 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new developer or distribution certificate on developer.apple.com/membercenter\r\n2. Download this cert on a 10.12.* machine\r\n3. Revoke the certificate on developer.apple.com/membercenter\r\n4. verify the cert with: security verify-cert -p codeSign -c ios_distribution.cer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n/usr/bin/security should return a non-zero exit code and the string \"Cert Verify Result: CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n/usr/bin/security returns a zero exit code and the string \"...certificate verification successful.\""
