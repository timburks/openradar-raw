    description: "***New Bug Reporter***\r\n\r\nSummary: When copying the text of a bug report and then pasting it elsewhere, the line breaks in the original report are changed into spaces.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar with old or new RadarWeb - it doesn't matter which one.\r\n2. Open that radar for viewing on the new RadarWeb at https://bugreport.apple.com/beta/.\r\n3. Select all the text of the radar so that you can share it with someone.\r\n4. Copy the selected text.\r\n5. Go to a text editor, chat app, or the Open Radar website.\r\n6. Paste.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The text pastes exactly as it looked in RadarWeb.\r\n\r\nObserved Results: All newlines in the copied text are converted to spaces.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression: this worked correctly in the old RadarWeb.
