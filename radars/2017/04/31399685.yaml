    description: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWe are trying to submit a new version of our app to review on iTunesConnect, but are getting the below error \r\n\r\nInvalid sdk value. The value provided for the sdk portion of LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS in Cleartrip.app/PlugIns/Cleartrip WatchKit Extension.appex/Cleartrip WatchKit App.app/Cleartrip WatchKit App is 8.2 which is greater than the maximum allowed value of 10.3.\r\n\r\nIt looks like its a wide spread issue and a lot of developers are stuck at this stage. Kindly let us know if this issue will be fixed or if there is any workaround for it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. From Xcode 8.2.1, archive the app that contains WatchKit extension and app (Watch OS 1).\r\n2. Upload app to iTunesConnect using Application Loader app or via Xcode Organizer.\r\n3. Wait for the app to get processed and once processing is complete. Try submitting the app to review.\r\n4. Alternatively, try submitting the app for beta testing using TestFlight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA successfully processed app/build is expected to be accepted for review or beta testing via iTunesConnect\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunesConnect throws an error that says - \r\n\r\nInvalid sdk value. The value provided for the sdk portion of LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS in Cleartrip.app/PlugIns/Cleartrip WatchKit Extension.appex/Cleartrip WatchKit App.app/Cleartrip WatchKit App is 8.2 which is greater than the maximum allowed value of 10.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue apparently does not occur if the application does not contain watchkit support."
