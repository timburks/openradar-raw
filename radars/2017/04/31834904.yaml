    description: "Summary:\r\nI am unable to charge any of my Magic Trackpad or Magic Keyboards from the USB ports on the LG UltraFine.\r\n\r\nI've connected my keyboard, and nothing happens. The battery continues to drain, I plugged it in overnight, and nothing happened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug in USBC of 5K UltraFine\r\n2. Plug in USBC cable for lighting\r\n3. Plug in Magic Keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The Keyboard/trackpad should charge\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The keyboard/trackpad does not charge\r\n2. There is no indication what is happening, and the expected behavior is totally different\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 15\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhat's the point of having USBC ports on this monitor if they can't do anything? Why isn't there thunderbolt pass through? This LG 5K UltraFine is a terrible product compared to the Thunderbolt display, an it's a terrible collaboration (aside from the resolution) between Apple and LG. I'm very disappointed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2017.04.26_07-51-10-0400_43817.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded."
