    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Swift.print() to log a string which includes emoji characters, sometimes the characters will be corrupted when displayed in the Xcode debug console (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a fresh iOS app and simply call `print(\"◽️\")` many times. Run on an iOS device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe emoji character should be represented correctly without escape sequences, one character per line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome lines appear with multiple of the character, some with escape sequences showing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 (8E2002), macOS 10.12.4 (16E195). Same problem occurred on Xcode 8.3.1.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIn my testing this only occurs when running on an iOS device, not in the simulator, or in a macOS app. I tested it on an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.3.1 (14E304)."
