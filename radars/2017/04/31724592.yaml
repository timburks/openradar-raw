    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iTunes Store emails about subscription renewals, the app icon and the name of the in-app purchase are shown, but the name of the app is not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to an in-app subscription for an app. In the attached screenshot, it's a premium subscription to Sleep Cycle, a sleep tracker.\r\n2. A year later, get an email confirming your subscription renewal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's clear what the renewal is for, because the app icon has the app name near or below it just like on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email doesn't have the app name at all. It has the name of the in-app purchase next to the icon, which forms an incorrect association. My wife and I were both momentarily confused because we thought it was indicating an app with an orange icon with a picture of an alarm clock, with the app name of \"Premium\". Even though we see that icon above the text \"Sleep Cycle\" every day, it's when we're going to sleep, so we're not at our most alert, and the formatting of the email encourages incorrect interpretation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached screenshot is also uploaded at https://cl.ly/k4om\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nScreenshot is from Mail 10.3 (3273) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)."
