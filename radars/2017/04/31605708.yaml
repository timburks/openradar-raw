    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd like the have the option to share a .crash file directly from iOS in the Settings > Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data menu. Or, when selecting the text from a particular log, a \"Select All\" action would be useful in addition to the current \"Copy, Look Up, Share\" actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings on iOS\r\n2. Navigate to Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a list view of the analytics data/crash logs (which there currently is). Tapping one of the rows should take you into the text view (which it currently does). However, there should be a Share button in the top right corner in the navigation bar. Tapping that should share a .crash file directly. Conversely, it could still just share all the text.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, tapping and selecting a bit of text should show \"Select All, Copy, Share...\" actions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is currently no Share button from within the crash log/data view. Tapping and selecting a bit of text doesn't provide a \"Select All\" action. Crash logs are particularly long so this means you need to scroll bit by bit to copy the entirety of the crash log.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever the text is created, you have to create a .crash file yourself by creating a new document and renaming the file extension to .crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt MIGHT not be possible to send a .crash file directly because there is different kinds of analytics data in there. The goal of this feature request is to make it easier to share crashes in general, so even just sharing as raw text would be preferable to the current implementation."
