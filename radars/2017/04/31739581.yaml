    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith an app using the Notification Service Extension (NSE), notifications mirrored to the Apple Watch do not use content from the NSE when displayed as pop-ups.  Notifications displayed in the Apple Watch's notification center, however, do contain notifications with properly mutated content from the NSE.\r\n\r\nSee the attached notifs-inconsistent.JPG for a photo showing the notification on the device using mutated content but the notification mirrored to the watch is using original content.\r\nSee the attached watch-notif-center.JPG for a photo showing the notification on the watch in notification center properly using mutated content.\r\nSee the attached sysdiagnose_2017.04.20_11-52-54-0700.tar.gz for a sysdiagnose trace captured with the Continuity Debugging profiled installed.  Repro time was right before the sysdiagnose capture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an Apple Watch paired with a device\r\n2. Create an app with an NSE\r\n3. Have the NSE always mutate content in some fixed way (ex: always prefix the alert body with a fixed string)\r\n4. Turn the device display off and ensure the watch display is on\r\n5. Send a notification to the app/device targeting the NSE (mutable-content flag set and non-empty alert body)\r\n6. Observe the notification content on the watch and the device\r\n7. Observe the notification content in the watch's notification center\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. The notification on both the device and the watch should be displayed with mutated content\r\n7. The notification content in the watch's notification center is using the proper mutated content\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. The notification on the device uses the content mutated by the NSE, but the notification mirrored to the watch pop-up notification does not.\r\n7. The notification content in the watch's notification center is using the proper mutated content\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1"
