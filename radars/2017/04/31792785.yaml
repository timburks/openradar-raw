    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAutocorrect gets confused when correcting my text. It will mark correct statements (that it previously fixed) as incorrect with the underline.\r\n\r\nIt has done this for 2-3 versions or more of OS X, and it's still doing it and is very annoying.\r\n\r\nThe text is fixed, yet it underlines it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. type mistakes in Pages/Web text fields/etc.\r\n2. let autocorrect do it's thing without interrupting \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Corrections should be fixed and no longer marked as typos\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Corrections are marked as typos and the fixes are to revert back to the spelling mistakes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 and MacBook Pro 2012\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Autocomplete marks autocorrected words as spelling mistakes.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
