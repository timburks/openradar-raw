    description: "It would be cool if Server.app could get Let's Encrypt TLS certificate via one click checkbox/button.\r\n\r\nOfficial Let's encrypt client is droping macOS support. There are certbot packages in MacPorts and HomeBrew or other ACME clients. \r\n\r\nIntegrating Let's Encrypt client into Server.app would allow casual users to easily get trusted certs.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's quite hard to automatically manage Let's Encrypt certificates on macOS Server.
