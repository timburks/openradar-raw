    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting with Xcode 8.3, entitlements files with variables that need to be resolved with a configuration's build settings, pulls the values of the variables from the Debug configuration instead of from the active configuration, resulting in the wrong values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project\r\n2. Add an entitlements file with the app groups entitlement\r\n3. Edit the entitlements file to read $(SOME_VAR) to define the app group suite name\r\n4. Define SOME_VAR in Xcode, but make it different between the Debug and Release configuration\r\n5. Build the project from the command line with `xcodebuild -configuration Release`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`SOME_VAR` is referenced from the Release configuration\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`SOME_VAR` is referenced from the Debug configuration\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3 (8E162)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- See the attached example project and logs for an example\r\n- Build it with `xcodebuild -configuration Release` (you may have to change the bundle ID first\r\n- Also see `releasebuildsettings.txt` which was generated via `xcodebuild -configuration Release -showBuildSettings`. This has the correct value for `SOME_VAR`\r\n- See `output.log` to see the output from running the above command. As you can see, the incorrect value is substituted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/keith/radars/tree/master/EntitlementsFileSubstitution\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n\r\n- Don't upgrade to Xcode 8.3\r\n- Remove all configurations except the one you're trying to build before building. This can be scripted with [xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/xcodeproj/)\r\n- Duplicate your entitlements files across every config and don't use variables in them\r\n- Pass the variables from the command line, instead of the build settings"
