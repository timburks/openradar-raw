    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an Apple Watch paired to my phone and when I speak \"Where's my watch?\" to my phone it should help me find it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lose your Apple Watch.\r\n2. Speak \"Where's my watch?\" to Siri\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should open \"Find my Phone\" and target the watch among the paired devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt responds with a sly quip about how I should consider buying an Apple Watch (!?), and lists a number of nearby retailers and jewelers who I presume Yelp associates with watches.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.1 14E304\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'C8pvTmSWAAI7C4F.jpg-large.jpeg' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n(For OpenRadar, the image is available on Twitter: https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/849613868028620802)"
