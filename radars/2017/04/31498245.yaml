    description: "Since updating from 10.12.3 to 10.12.4, \"Keychain Access\" prompts for TouchID authorization every couple seconds, even for things like simply browsing the list of login items.\r\n\r\nI would expect it to prompt only for things like revealing a password, or in other words, cases where there was a traditional authorization dialog before."
