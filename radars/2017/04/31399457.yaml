    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Time Profiler instrument hangs when \"Top functions\" and \"\"Hide system libraries\" checkboxes are both selected (from \"Call Tree\" menu). \r\nIt seems to happen regardless of other checkboxes being selected. I didn't check all possible combinations, though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Profile an iOS application.\r\n2. Select Time Profiler\r\n3. Start recording\r\n4. Select \"Top functions\" and \"Hide system libraries\" checkboxes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Profiler continues to work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments app hangs\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3 (8E162)\r\nmacOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt happens also when running Time Profiler Instrument in \"deferred mode\".\r\nThese two options are very useful when trying to solve performance issues in our apps. So it's important for us to have them both working at the same time.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproduced by profiling Xcode application created from \"Single View application\" template.  Devices: iPhone 6S / iOS 10.3 and iPhone 5C / iOS 9.3"
