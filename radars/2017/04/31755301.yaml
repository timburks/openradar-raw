        Summary:
        I am having a problem with my AirPods every time I connect to my Mac or any other mac. I don’t have this issue when using iPhone or iPad. When listening to music and I open Skype I get the audio quality changing to a louder tinny sound. This also happens if I go into the iPhone Simulator when using Xcode and interact with the software keyboard as it gives audio feedback. This can also be reproduced when going to System Preferences and clicking on the input tab within Sound.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Connect AirPods to the Mac
        - Play Music through iTunes
        - Open the iPhone Simulator whilst listening to music
        - Use reminders App on the iPhone Simulator
        - Use the software keyboard to enter some text (whilst listening to music)
        - The music will go louder and tinny
        - Then quit the iPhone simulator and the music quality with go back to normal.

        Expected Results:
        I expect the music quality not to be affected when using Skype (not talking just messaging) or using the iPhone simulator. When using Apple’s wired EarPods I do not get any issues like this so I expect the AirPods not to be the same.

        Actual Results:
        see steps to reproduce

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I have had the AirPods replaced and this is still a problem. It happens on both my home Mac and my work Mac so it appears this is an issue with macOS.

        Also if I have this audio problem happen and I pause the music I’ll start get a flickering sound in each AirPod and I expect silence when the music stops.

        Thanks :-)
