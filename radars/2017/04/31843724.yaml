    description: "Summary:\r\nIn watchOS 3, if you ask Siri, \"where is my phone\", the response will tell you to swipe up from your watch face and \"find the Settings Glance\". Since watchOS 3, Glances no longer exist, and swiping up from the watch face opens Control Center (which luckily still contains the \"ping iPhone\" button).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Own an Apple Watch running watchOS 3\r\n2. Activate Siri\r\n3. Say, \"Where is my phone?\"\r\n4. Observe the response\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe response should accurately describe how to ping your phone (or even better, ping it for youâ€¦?)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe response talks about Glances, which no longer exist.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2 (14V249)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 0, iPhone 7"
