    description: "Paul Solt24-Apr-2017 12:12 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSpotlight\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI cannot search for anything on my MacBook Pro 2016, I cannot start any apps, I cannot switch apps, I can't do anything because Spotlight has decided to (again) not accept text input.\r\n\r\nI was using my Mac, switching between apps, being productive, and then a bug with Spotlight (which there are numerous bugs in Sierra) has now blocked me from doing any work.\r\n\r\nI cannot type text into Spotlight, it's a blank input text area, even though I can type this bug report, or into a text mate window, I cannot type text into Spotlight.\r\n\r\nThis is so frustrating. This has happened 3-5 times in the past and is a very annoying bug as it blocks me from using my Mac to open/switch applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use MacBook Pro 2016 with Sierra\r\n2. Type \"iTunes\" and a lot of other gibberish \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Text should appear in Spotlight text area: \"iTunes\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. No text\r\n2. Nothing. I can't search or use Spotlight, it's now useless\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSierra 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has happened a few times already, and I think I have just tried to either restart or reset spotlight. I will first try a restart and comment on what worked/didn't work after I submit this bug report.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 15\" \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Spotlight keyboard issue with Macbook Pro 2016 Touchbar 15in.mp4' and 'sysdiagnose_2017.04.24_12-02-50-0400_3457.tar.gz' were successfully uploaded."
