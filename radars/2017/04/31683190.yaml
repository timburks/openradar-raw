    description: "***New Bug Reporter***\r\n\r\nSummary: On the new beta RadarWeb at https://bugreport.apple.com/beta, dates are shown in an abbreviated form. This makes it hard to copy absolute dates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar at bugreport.apple.com.\r\n2. Cross-post it to Open Radar (http://openradar.me) because it’s the only way for others in the community to see it. Of course, only do this for material that is not under NDA.\r\n3. Get an update from Apple about the bug, e.g. that it’s been closed or that it is a duplicate.\r\n4. Go to Open Radar to update the report with the new information from Apple.\r\n5. Notice that there is a date field on Open Radar to log the date and time that the bug was closed.\r\n6. Go back to RadarWeb to copy the date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The date and time are on the screen in a format that is easily selectable and copyable. On the old RadarWeb, it would show up in a format like this: 17-Apr-2017 01:03 AM\r\n\r\nObserved Results: The new dates are displayed either in a relative form (“a day ago”) or at least shortened to omit the time (“06 Apr 2017”). The full date is available in a popup on mouseover, but it disappears when you move the mouse cursor up to select the text.  It would be nice if the popup stayed on screen so that you could copy the text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\nNotes: Regression: old RadarWeb showed the dates in a selectable, copyable way.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Safari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nAttachment also uploaded at https://cl.ly/k4Ee"
