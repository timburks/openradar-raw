    description: "Apple Search Ads manager UI has several usability issues:\n\n1) Active (running) campaigns should be on the top in the campaign list, ordered by Spend column (currently order seems completely random).\n\n2) All keywords tab in the Ad goups list - default order should be by Spend or by Impressions (currently - random). The same is true for Serach terms tab and basically everywhere else.\n\n3) When clicked on the column with numeric values (e.g. Impressions) first option should be descending order (currently - ascending). Ascending (alphabetic) order make sense only for string values.\n\n4) Current login timeouts are set too short, cause need for continious logging in, default timeout should be 1-2 hours (e.g. Google Ads does remember your credentials and don’t ask them again unless you explicitly logged out) \n\n5) Ticking [Remember me] in the login screen does nothing at least as far as I can tell.\n\n6) Column widths are unnecessary wide - should be wide enough to display values completely/fit column title but not more (makes it hard to use when on notebook screen)\n\n7) Interface itself is very slow when changed ordering/navigating between screens\n\n8) Discoverability of “Exact match” option in the keyword adding screen is very poor (you have to mouse over to added keyword, only then option box appears), In the dialog there is enough room to show “Match type” column with current value."
