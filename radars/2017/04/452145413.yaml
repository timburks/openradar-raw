    description: "We would like to be capable of changing the app icon while its on background or closed using, for example, silent notification.\r\n\r\nThis is important because we could change the app icon without having the user to open it up, telling them that something on the app changed and he should check it out.\r\n\r\nIts more important for apps that have this as one of the main features, like calendar or clock application that could change the icon based on the time information."
