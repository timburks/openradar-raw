    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Notification Service Extension (NSE) with an app, the system sometimes gets into a state where push notifications for the app stop appearing altogether.  Upon closer inspection via logs and debugging, the NSE is not invoked for an incoming push notification, and the push notification is not otherwise shown to the user.  The only fix is to reboot the device, after which the NSE is correctly invoked on incoming push notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with an NSE\r\n2. Send NSE-compatible push notifications to the app (non-empty body and the mutable-content flag set)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSE is consistently and reliably invoked for compatible notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system sometimes gets into a state where push notifications for the app stop appearing altogether.  Upon closer inspection via logs and debugging, the NSE is not invoked for an incoming push notification, and the push notification is not otherwise shown to the user.  The only fix is to reboot the device, after which the NSE is correctly invoked on incoming push notifications.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.X, as recent as 10.3"
