        Summary:

        While creating a universal app using storyboards, I get the following warning:

        “Constraint referencing items turned off in current configuration. Turn off this constraint in the current configuration”

        The warning references my main storyboard. Inside the storyboard or when clicking on the warning, I cannot find the constraint that is the culprit because the UI doesn’t identify it properly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        -

        Expected Results:
        The UI should show me which constraint is the problem.

        Actual Results:
        I get a warning that I cannot get rid off.

        Regression:
        -
