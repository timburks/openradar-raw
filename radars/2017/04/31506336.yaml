    description: "Summary:\r\nThe previous method of using smart cards on OS X via tokens (either via smartcardservices or OpenSC) would translate smartcard certificates into keychain items.\r\n\r\nThis allowed applications such as: Microsoft Outlook (2011/2016), Cisco AnyConnect VPN, and Adobe Acrobat to access the certificates on the card for the purpose of email signing encryption / vpn login / and PDF signing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a mac with OS X 10.12.4\r\n2. Configure an /etc/Smartcardconfig.plist appropriate for your directory service & card configuration\r\n3. Connect a support smartcard reader and insert card.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Smartcard account login should function at loginwindow.app\r\n2. Login to card-aware websites via Safari.app should work\r\n3. A keychain corresponding to the smart card should appear in keychain access.app\r\n4. Authentication should function in AnyConnect/Email Encryption in Outlook 2016\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Smartcard login DOES work at loginwindow.app (thank you, that's awesome.)\r\n2. Login to card-aware websites via Safari.app DOES work (thank you, that's awesome.)\r\n3. No Keychain corresponding to the smart card appears in Keychain Access.app\r\n4. Due to #3, no certificates are available for AnyConnect/Outlook 2016\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4/16E195\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThank you for considering this bug report/feature request. I understand that \"the right way\" for our vendors to handle the change to crypto kit is to update their apps to utilize this new method (and I anticipate at least Microsoft will as they've been good about keeping up with OS changes recently.) \r\n\r\nHowever, i might ask that it be considered to provide the expected behavior in the interim.\r\n\r\nIt appears at https://developer.apple.com/reference/cryptotokenkit/tktokenkeychaincertificate that the keychain translation is included in cryptokit but not implemented currently in pivtoken - so it may be possible to implement this without needing to fall back to pcscd/CDSA?\r\n\r\nThis request, while coming from an individual developer account is intended for support of [Redacted], of which there are approximately 5000-8000 at [Redacted] alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 bound properly to active directory. Smartcards verified to function by installing OpenSC (then uninstall OpenSC for test)"
