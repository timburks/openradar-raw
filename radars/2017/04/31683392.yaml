    description: "***New Bug Reporter***\r\n\r\nSummary: If you create a draft bug in the new beta RadarWeb, you can't delete it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://bugreport.apple.com/beta/.\r\n2. Click the \"Report a new bug\" button.\r\n3. Type some text into any field. I typed \"asdfasdf\" into the Title field.\r\n4. Click the \"Save\" button at the bottom.\r\n5. Click the new \"Delete Draft\" button at the bottom.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The draft is deleted, probably after a confirmation dialog like on old RadarWeb.\r\n\r\nObserved Results: The button shows a pressed state, but nothing else happens. You also can't delete the radar from the main screen. However, you can delete it if, from the end of the \"Steps to Reproduce\" listed above, you click the Back button at the the bottom of the page, and then choose \"Delete Draft\" from the resulting dialog box.\r\n\r\nVersion: Beta\r\n\r\nNotes: Regression. Deleting drafts was easy in Old Radar.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Safari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)"
