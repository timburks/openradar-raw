    description: "If there is any app primarily based on Metal Performance Shaders framework, it would run properly on all the devices ranging from iPhone 6 and later. But this framework isn't supported on iPhone5S since it uses processor A7. As a result, the app would be meaningless if it ran on 5s. Also, devices like iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3 and iPad Air 1 do have metal but do not support Metal Performance Shaders.\r\n\r\nSo I want to restrict App Store availability in such a way that app is available only for devices iPhone 6 and above, i.e Processor A8 or later as there is no point in getting the app installed on non-supported devices.\r\n\r\nI found a way to restrict devices iPhone 5 and below using the key UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in Info.plist but couldn't find any key where I could differentiate iPhone 5s with other latest devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add code integrated with Metal Performance Shaders Framework\r\n2. Run the project on a iPhone5S/iPad Mini2 or Mini3/iPad Air\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities should include a key so that it is not allowed to install the app on non-supported devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app runs on the non-supported devices and it gives a warning saying Metal Performance Shaders not supported on this device"
