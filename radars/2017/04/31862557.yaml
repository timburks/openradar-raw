    description: "Summary:\r\nURLSession data tasks always buffer the first 512 bytes before calling either dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler or dataTask:didReceiveData.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake a request to an endpoint that slowly streams some data and dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler and dataTask:didReceiveData will only be called once at least 512 bytes of data has been received.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ndataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler gets called as soon as response headers are received and as soon as any data is received dataTask:didReceiveData gets called, unless some sort of flush interval is desired.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither dataTask:didReceiveResponse:completionHandler or dataTask:didReceiveData gets called until at least 512 bytes of data are received.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe current behaviour would be understandable as a default but there doesnâ€™t seem to be any way to indicate that you want to be informed as soon as any data is received. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 running iOS Simulator (10.3.2) with Xcode 8.3.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
