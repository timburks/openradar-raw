    description: "Summary:\r\nMy Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard never get charged with my UltraFine 5k Display because I'm on the go. Even though I leave them plugged in, they don't charge because of another bug where USBC don't work on first plugin to the MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nThis leaves me in a situation where all my peripherals are in this very low battery charge state because my fancy display doesn't behave like a power source, even though it's plugged into the wall.\r\n\r\nIt's frustrating, and I don't know what the behavior of the Thunderbolt is off the top of my head... but that always seems to just work, and this LG UltraFine feels like an expensive piece of crap.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plugin Macbook to LG UltraFine 5K\r\n2. Unplug computer\r\n3. Plugin MacBook to UltraFine (day later, 8+ hours later)\r\n4. Use Trackpad\r\n5. See power is low in TrackPad\r\n6. Plugin USBC to lighting into UltraFine and Magic TrackPad\r\n7. Work for a bit (small charge)\r\n8. Leave for work and unplug MacBook USBC to UltraFine\r\n9. Come back (day later, 8+ hours later)\r\n10. Plug in USBC from UltraFine 5k\r\n11. Tap Magic Trackpad to wake\r\n12. Look at bluetooth settings (Menu Bar)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Magic Trackpad/Keyboard should be fully charged\r\n2. Magic Trackpad/Keyboard should be charging if still not fully charged\r\n3. USBC connection should be working to the Magic Trackpad/Keyboard or any other USBC device/dongle\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. USBC on UltraFine is not working\r\n2. Magic Keyboard/Trackpad is not charged (22%)\r\n3. Does this even charge when my computer sleeps? Do these things shut all power off?\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacbook Pro 2016 15\", LG UltraFine 5K, macOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll of these little details were well thought out on a Mac or the Thunderbolt, but they just add up and show how inferior LG is when it comes to designing a usable product.\r\n\r\nWhen I plug a USB device in my MacBook Pro 2012 and then close the lid it will continue to charge a device. However if I plug a USB device into my MacBook Pro 2012 when it's closed and not connected to any monitor (sleep), then it will not charge.\r\n\r\nThat is the behavior I'm expecting from my devices.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMagic Trackpad, USBC to lighting cable for Magic Trackpad, USBC to Lightning UltraFine\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UltraFine USBC Ports Dont Work Without Unplugging.mp4' and 'sysdiagnose_2017.04.24_12-02-50-0400_3457.tar.gz' were successfully uploaded."
