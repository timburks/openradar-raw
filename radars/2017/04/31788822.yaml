    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn high latency connections, it is possible to get the sign in view controller for an MVPD to be presented without an option to dismiss/go back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using an application that integrates with Adobe AccessEnabler, get into a scenario where the delegate method `func presentTvProviderDialog(_ viewController: UIViewController?)` is called and present the Apple MVPD view controller.\r\n2. Select a supported and whitelisted MVPD from the Apple list.\r\n3. Before the MVPD detail/sign in view controller can load, quickly go back to the main list of MVPDs\r\n4. Observe the MVPD detail/sign in view controller is presented, but the user cannot cancel or go back.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screen shot and video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be able to cancel out of the MVPD sign in flow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe MVPD detail/sign in view controller is presented, but the user cannot cancel or go back.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, 128gb, Verizon LTE\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-04-24 at 12.19.51 PM.png' and 'apple_sso_bug.mov' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nVideo: https://youtu.be/yLaBmUkbyGg\r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://imgur.com/MPpF3a1"
