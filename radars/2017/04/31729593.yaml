    description: "There's no way to remove an (unintentionally) created Ad Group from a campaign. This is embarrassing and inconvenient. Users should always be able to undo their actions. If really not possible (such as formatting a disk volume), a big, red warning should be displayed!\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAd an ad group to a campaign. Then try to delete it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a delete option.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is no delete option."
