        Summary:
        When a profile with a restrictions payload requiring a minimum 5-character passcode is pushed to the device, the device pops up a window for passcode input. This window prompts for a 6-character passcode.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Push a profile to a device that does not already have a passcode configured that meets the requirements.

        Expected Results:
        UI should correctly request a 5-character or more passcode.

        Actual Results:
        UI requests a 6-character or more passcode. UI still allows a 5-character passcode.

        Regression:
