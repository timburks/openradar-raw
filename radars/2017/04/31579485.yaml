    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for HKWorkoutSession is inconsistent about how a workout session contributes to exercise rings. Under “Filling the Rings,” section 1:\r\n\r\n“An exercise minute is generated for each minute of the workout session, and calories are accumulated at a rate no lower than a brisk walk. Calories may be higher, based on data from Apple Watch’s sensors.”\r\n\r\nUnder section 2:\r\n\r\n“The system updates the exercise ring based on the amount of time the user spent actually exerting themselves during the session, as calculated by the watch’s sensors.”\r\n\r\nThese seem to contradict one another. If I have a 30-minute workout session on the Apple Watch, is it guaranteed to contribute 30 exercise minutes to the user’s rings, or does that happen only for minutes in the exercise where the user exerted him or herself?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHKWorkoutSession\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit/hkworkoutsession"
