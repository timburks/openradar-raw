    description: "Area:\r\nDevice Management / Profiles\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe new device management options for tvOS are awesome! My MDM vendor, Jamf, added support for prestage enrollments and locking tvOS to conference room mode, which allows for quick setup of a new Apple TV solely for AirPlay. However, after an hour, the Apple TV goes to sleep, as that setting is unable to be managed via MDM. Would it be possible to add support for disabling sleep via configuration profile? Thanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add your 4th generation Apple TV (running tvOS 10.2) to DEP.\r\n2. Create a prestage enrollment for the Apple TV.\r\n3. Create a configuration profile for the Apple TV that forces \"conference room mode\" only and apply it to the Apple TV.\r\n4. Turn on the Apple TV.\r\n5. Go through the setup assistant.\r\n6. Observe as the Apple TV drops into conference room mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n7. The Apple TV remains in conference room mode, available for devices to connect via AirPlay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7. After an hour, the Apple TV goes to sleep, and can only be woken up by the remote (if paired prior to setup assistant).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI submitted a feature request to Jamf, and they mentioned that sleep settings are not in the MDM spec. It sounds like if support is added for MDM management of this setting, Jamf would be open to implementing it. https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/feature-requests/5936/please-allow-configuring-tvos-sleep-settings\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 4, tvOS 10.2, connected to ethernet\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
