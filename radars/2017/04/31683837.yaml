    description: "***New Bug Reporter***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen dragging an attachment into the new bug reporter, the thin lavender highlight around the edge is not a clear enough signal that the drag operation is working.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new bug report at https://bugreport.apple.com/beta/.\r\n2. Drag an attachment onto the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window changes significantly, indicating that the attachment drag operation is going to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe window gets a faint lavender highlight, which is not obvious enough to indicate that the drag operation will work. This is especially problematic on large displays with large browser windows.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screen recording also uploaded to https://cl.ly/k42u\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
