    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOnce the voice over is turned on, map view(MKMapView instance) will have memory leak. Even after the voice over is turned off, the leak is still existing. Eventually it will cause app crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple app that has two screens with navigation controller. One contains a MKMapView instance. One has a button that will segue to show the map screen.\r\n2. Navigate between the two screens and the memory status is normal (memory got released after navigate away from the map view).\r\n3. Turn on voice over and then turn off. Repeat step 2, and the memory that used for map is never released.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see memory get released once the view controller is released.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMemory for the map view is never released.\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10, didn't test other version."
