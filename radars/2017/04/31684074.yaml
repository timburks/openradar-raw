    description: "***New Bug Reporter***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen viewing an existing radar or draft radar with the sidebar visible, dragging in new files to attach can lead to unexpected and potentially misleading results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar, or save a draft radar.\r\n2. Go back to the new Bug Reporter home page at https://bugreport.apple.com/beta/.\r\n3. Select the radar from step 1 in the left sidebar.\r\n4. Decide you want to attach a file to that radar.\r\n5. Start dragging the file from your desktop.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe whole screen is a drop zone for this radar, or at least it doesn't lead to confusing results.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWhen dragging over the appropriate region (the radar detail view on the right), the drop zone isn't very obvious (see rdar://31683837). If you move the cursor over the left sidebar, it changes to the arrow-with-green-plus-sign cursor, which an experienced user will know means that it's going to open the file locally in the Safari window, navigating away from the current page. However, to a novice user, this may appear to be the action that they want. The large, inviting green âž• symbol seems like it means \"add this file to the thing under the cursor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached video also uploaded at https://cl.ly/k4c3\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
