    description: "Area:\r\nAV Playback\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAt the moment it is possible to set some custom metadata to instances of AVPlayerItem. This information is at the end presented on the \"Info\" tab bar when swiping down on an instance of AVPlayerViewController.\r\n\r\nThe following are some examples of customizable metadata:\r\n\r\nAVMetadataCommonIdentifierTitle: To add title metadata\r\nAVMetadataCommonIdentifierDescription: To add a description metadata\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a not customizable Duration label shown in the same view, between Title and Description.\r\n\r\n(Please check the attached image for clarification.)\r\nhttps://imagebin.ca/v/3JphMqeY4VNv\r\n\r\nThere is no documentation about this duration field, but attending to the talk \"AVKit on tvOS\" from WWDC 2016, this information is inferred automatically from the stream.\r\n\r\nThis inference does not work properly for live streams, in which the value that is shown is the size of the event stream instead of the duration of the showing event.\r\n\r\nHaving a new editable metadata AVMetadataCommonIdentifierDuration to customize the duration label would allow setting the right program duration when needed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to edit the duration label shown on the Info tab bar presented by an instance of AVPlayerViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHaving a new editable metadata AVMetadataCommonIdentifierDuration to customize the duration label would allow setting the right program duration when needed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe duration label is showing an inferred value from the stream, which is inferring a wrong for live events.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTv 4th Generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'avplayerMetadata.png' was successfully uploaded."
