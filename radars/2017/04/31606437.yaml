    description: "Area:\r\nMDM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAccessory firmware prompt can interrupt app when AppLock profile applied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install AppLock profile to device via MDM\r\n2. Attach Lightning device which needs firmware update (such as Lightning to USB3 adapter)\r\n3. Reboot device\r\n4. Observe prompt to apply firmware on screen\r\n\r\nAlternate reproduction steps\r\n1. Start with iOS 10.3 device\r\n2. Attach Lightning to USB3 adapter\r\n3. Send ScheduleOSUpdate MDM command\r\n4. Install AppLock profile to device via MDM\r\n5. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf AppLock profile is installed, no OS prompts are expected. AppLock profiles are used in numerous single purpose scenarios, sometimes with no user interaction available. Requiring user touch input to proceed is not ideal. Either applying a timeout on the firmware update offer prompt, or better yet providing MDM control of the firmware update would improve this. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccessory firmware update prompt is displayed and kept on screen interrupting the application under AppLock. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3"
