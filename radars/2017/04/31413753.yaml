    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen TouchID is enabled on a supported 13\" MacBook Pro, and the device is connected to an external display, and the lid is closed, sometimes when waking the machine or exiting screensaver, There is no input field for the password until you start typing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- setup TouchID in initial setup\r\n- sleep display or computer with external display attached and laptop lid closed\r\n- wake\r\n- attempt to click on username and/or icon, no password box\r\n- Start typing password, password box shows up and is populated as I type.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nif the lid is closed, the password box should show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npassword box does not show up.\r\n\r\nI attempted to troubleshoot by removing my finger print and trying again. When I re-added my finger print I was able to see the password box. The only difference in situations is that I added this fingerprint while connected to an external display, the original was not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
