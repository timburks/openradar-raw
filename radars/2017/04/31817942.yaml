    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of the most common annoyances I have with Xcode, without the critical lack of refactoring tools worthy of the name (think ReSharper), is that it does not restrict you from typing invalid characters into the code.\r\n\r\nThis should be an amazingly easy thing to fix, but has been in Xcode for a very long time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any Swift file in Xcode\r\n2. Anywhere, type e.g. Alt+Space\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Xcode to ignore the alt key when typing, if it cannot handle the result.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Alt+Enter char is entered into the text editor. Swift now complains about \"Invalid character in source file\". The code won't compile.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.2 (8E2002) and earlier"
