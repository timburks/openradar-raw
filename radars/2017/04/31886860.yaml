    description: "Area:\r\nCore Location\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe're using region monitoring to detect when a beacon with a known proximity UUID is within range of the iOS device. When the device enters the region, CLLocationManager is instructed to start ranging beacons in the region. The delegate method  locationManager(_:didRangeBeacons:in:): provides an empty beacon array shortly after ranging begins, despite being inside the beacon region.\r\n\r\nTurning Bluetooth off and on via Control Center results in ranging correctly providing beacons.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to pin this down to a specific device or iOS version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Begin region monitoring with a known UUID\r\n* Await locationManager(_:didEnterRegion:): or request state of region\r\n* Begin ranging when device enters region (or is already inside region)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe delegate method locationManager(_:didRangeBeacons:in:): should provides an array containing at least one beacon, since the device must inside the region to trigger ranging.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice enters (or is inside region) and the delegate method  locationManager(_:didRangeBeacons:in:): provides an empty array.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1"
