    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe interface in System Preferences for setting up a Power Schedule does not indicate that the actual shutdown time will be 10 minutes AFTER the specified time. As a result, when you specify a shutdown time of, e.g. 08:50, the machine will actually shut down at about 09:00 or moments after.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious problem if a schedule start up is within that 10 minute period after a scheduled shutdown, e.g. shutdown 08:50 startup 09:00. Since the shutdown won't have actually happened by 09:00 (or, it will be in progress) then the corresponding scheduled startup is ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule... > Startup 08:50\r\n2. System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule... > Shut Down 09:00\r\n3. Wait until 09:00 the following morning... the Mac Mini will not start up, because it will not have finished shutting down\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause the scheduled shutdown procedure includes a 10 minute grace period with a dialog box, then this should actually appear 10 minutes BEFORE the scheduled shutdown time (e.g. 08:40 in the example given above). This way, the actual shutdown occurs nearly at the configured time (08:50).\r\n\r\nEither that, or a warning should appear in the System Preferences interface that this configuration is unlikely to work due to the 10 minute grace period (which would be an inferior solution to actually using the correct shutdown time).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual shutdown occurs at 09:00, therefore missing the scheduled startup time at 09:00.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nConfirmed on MacBookPro11,3 / Macmini7,1 running Mac OS X 10.12.4\r\nConfirmed power schedule is in place using pmset command line (also appears in .spx report)"
