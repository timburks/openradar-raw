    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm trying to schedule a couple local notifications in a loop (see attached project). Each notification (which triggers immediately) is intended to increment the app's badge number. However, running this does not seem to increment it properly; if I schedule 5 notifications the badge becomes \"1\", not \"5\". The issue appears to be that there is a delay in the updating applicationIconBadgeNumber; putting any sort of delay (for example, a sleep or a breakpoint) will resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(Faulty results)\r\n1. Run the attached code.\r\n2. Simulate a background fetch (select it from Xcode's \"Debug\" menu)\r\n3. View the badge number.\r\n\r\n(Expected results)\r\n4. Navigate to application(_:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:) in AppDelegate.swift.\r\n5. Find the usleep line.\r\n6. Uncomment it.\r\n7. Run the steps 1-3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application badge icon will increase by 1 each time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application badge icon will end up as 1 (or some other small number).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 [14E269]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI apologize for the use of UINotification; I was too lazy to figure out how UserNotifications worked. I set the deployment target to 9.3 to get rid of the warnings.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
