    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Darwin operating system consists of the source code for key low-level macOS projects. DiskImages is a project consisting of tools, frameworks and kernel extensions relating to the management of disk\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit opensource.apple.com/source/DiskImages/.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe source code for various versions of the DiskImages project should be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is currently no source code for the DiskImages project available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe source code for the DiskImages would be a great addition to the Darwin operating system, used by many people such as security researchers, open-source developers, and groups such as the PureDarwin team. The source code would allow for groups like PureDarwin to create working installers, or - even better - live CDs which could help more users try out Darwin and create more interest for the project.\r\nAlso, some of the tools in DiskImages would allow us to build Darwin projects with darwinbuild and create installation images of Darwin in an existing Darwin environment, which would be very beneficial to our development workflow.\r\nMay I also add, that since the release of Windows 10, Microsoft has their own implementation of a disk image system, and Linux has its loopback mount, meaning that if any code were open-sourced, it would be of little value to Apple's competitors, and there is now less strategic value in keeping this project out of Darwin."
