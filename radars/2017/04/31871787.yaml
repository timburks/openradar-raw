    description: "Summary:\r\nSuppose a view in a nib (or storyboard) has an outlet. Further suppose that another view in same nib (or in within the same view controller scene in the storyboard) conforms to the type of the outlet. There seems to be no way to connect the outlet to the second view within Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download, unzip, and open the attached Xcode project. \n2. View Main.storyboard in Xcode.\n3. Select “Delegate Seeking View” in the IB sidebar.\n4. Reveal the Connections Inspector.\n5. Drag from the viewDelegate outlet to Other View in the IB sidebar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOutlet is connected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOutlet cannot be connected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve tried every combination of drag source, drag destination, and modifier keys to no avail. If I get any response at all, it’s a HUD to select constraints."
