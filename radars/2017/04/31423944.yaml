        Summary:
        I have a worksheet in Numbers with a date column. Since Numbers 4.1, the date format suddenly changed to a US-style format, with no way to override it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use a sheet added in an older version of Numbers which has a column with dates formatted as d-m-yyyy (automatically)
        2. Update to Numbers 4.1
        3. Enter a date as (31-3-2017)

        Expected Results:
        - Value entered stays as-is: 31-3-2017, inline with all older dates that were entered previously

        Actual Results:
        - Numbers converts it to a US-style format: 31-3-17

        Regression:
        This happens since Numbers 4.1
