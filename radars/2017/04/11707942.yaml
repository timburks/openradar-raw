    description: "There should be a REST API for the Bug Reporter. (may I suggest looking into ERRest, it makes adding REST to WebObjects apps really easy.)\r\n\r\nI'd like the API to expose:\r\n\r\n1. The list of radars that the currently logged in user can see, including the properties of them that you can see on the web page (status, the duplicated number, etc)\r\n2. The list of related radars that now shows up for each radar\r\n3. The ability to file a new radar by POSTing a new object\r\n\r\nThis could be very useful to allow enterprising developers to make solutions that help us all manage our bug reports much more easily. More bug reports is definitely in Apple's interest!\r\n\r\n(P.S., if you end up talking to the WebObjects team, do nag them to do another public release!)"
