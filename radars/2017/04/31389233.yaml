    description: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI just uploaded a new build for Marquee (which is almost the same as previous one), but I can't submit it to the review, because of the error \"Invalid sdk value. The value provided for the sdk portion of LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS in Marquee.app/PlugIns/Marquee WatchKit Extension.appex/Marquee WatchKit App.app/Marquee WatchKit App is 8.2 which is greater than the maximum allowed value of 10.3\". It looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/q/43105469/2432781\r\n\r\nThe build I'm trying to upload contains an urgent fix. Please fix the issue ASAP!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex"
