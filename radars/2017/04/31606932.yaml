        An SKProduct should expose not only its identifier, but also the group identifier for auto renewable subscriptions. It is more important than the actual product identifier as for a group of subscription items, usually you don’t care about which exact item a user bought.

        Usually I care about what group(s) the user is currently subscribed to (i.e. what features to unlock) and when they expire. What product the user used to unlock a group is not useful to know except for tracking; at least for a very large group of apps that don’t want to limit the features the user get based on what subscription plan they are on.

        The fact that this is not available through StoreKit means that the grouping needs to be done on the client side with hardcoded product identifiers. This means there is no longer a single source of truth (i.e. iTunes Connect) but instead the app only works with a very specific configuration on iTunes connect. If all I need for my logic is the group id, it would be very great to be able to add and modify items in that group without the need for the app to change any logic.
