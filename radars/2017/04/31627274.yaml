    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the \"Manage your keywords\" page of https://app.searchads.apple.com when changing the sort criterion by tapping on a column title such as \"Impression\", \"Taps\" etc., it sorts in ascending order by default. This is almost always not what the user wants. In a typical use case there are many keywords that have 0 impressions. The user is usually not interested in these but in the keywords that do produce impressions, taps, conversions etc. \r\n\r\nI always have to click twice in order to get meaningful results. This takes a long time because loading the list of keywords is very slow.\r\n\r\nSo when changing the sort column, please sort in *descending* order by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in at https://app.searchads.apple.com\r\n2. Click on a campaign name to open its details\r\n3. Click on an ad group name with a lot of keywords to open its details\r\n4. Click on the \"Impressions\" (or \"Taps\", or \"TTR\", or \"CR\" etc.) column header\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to see the keyword with the most impressions/tabs/TTR/CR at the top of the list. \r\n\r\nThe list should be sorted in descending order.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead I see the keyword with the least amount of impressions at the top of the list.\r\n\r\nThe list is sorted in ascending order."
