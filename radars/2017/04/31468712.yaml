    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working on a C++ project, it's a good idea to avoid usage of\r\n\r\n  using namespace Foo;\r\n\r\nin implementation files. Instead, it's better practice to wrap the appropriate code inside a\r\n\r\n    namespace Foo {\r\n\r\n    // unindented code\r\n\r\n    } // namespace Foo\r\n\r\nblock. That allows for a finer and clearer control of which objects you are accessing, specially when accessing objects form different namespaces within the same file.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I feel that not-indenting the code inside namespaces it's the best approach, because indenting namespace contents would makes deeply nested namespaces hierarchies to waste a lot of horizontal space.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Xcode indents namespaces contents automatically, and there's no way of disable namespace content auto-indentation without also disabling the (correct) auto-indentation after a other instances of code following an opening bracket (functions, if-loops).\r\n\r\nI feel that if you ask C++ developers, they would prefer for Xcode to not indent namespace contents, hence I suggest that Xcode either:\r\n\r\na) Changes its behavior to not indent namespace contents (while still indenting other opening bracket cases).\r\n\r\nb) Provides this as an option.\r\n\r\nNote that, for example, clang-format provides this distinction (so you can disable namespace contents indentation, will keeping auto-indentation for other opening bracket usages), which should be proof that this is a pretty important setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode and write: 'namespace LS {'\r\n2. Press enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Xcode should not indent the new line.\r\n\r\n(Or there should be an option to configure this).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Xcode indents the new line."
