    description: "Summary:\r\nAs part of the macOS / Darwin boot process, the program launchd is required to launch background tasks and daemons. From early releases of macOS, up until (and including) OS X 10.9, this has been released as an open source project. Since OS X 10.10, launchd has been rewritten and moved into the closed-source libxpc project. The Darwin operating system now has no replacement for launchd, and past versions cannot be used, due to their dependencies on libxpc. It would be great if libxpc could be open-sourced, as it would greatly benefit many open-source groups.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit opensource.apple.com/source/libxpc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be different folders for each version of libxpc that corresponds to a macOS release, each containing the source code to libxpc (and thus launchd).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA 404 error occurs, as libxpc is not open-source."
