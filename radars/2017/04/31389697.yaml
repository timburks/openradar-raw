        Summary:
        Playgrounds fail to display views in the assistant editor

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a playground with this code:
        import UIKit
        import PlaygroundSupport

        let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 700)

        let container = UIView(frame: frame)
        container.backgroundColor = .red

        let inner = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 100, y: 100, width: 20, height: 40))

        inner.backgroundColor = .blue
        container.addSubview(inner)

        PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = container
        PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

        2. Open the assistant editor and run the playground

        Expected Results:
        Show the view in the assistant editor window

        Actual Results:
        Doesn't show.

        Regression:
        Quitting Xcode and starting it again shows the view correctly.

        Notes:
        Thought it might have to do with the simulator, but quitting the simulator doesn't solve the issue.
