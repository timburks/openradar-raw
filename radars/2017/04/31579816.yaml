    description: "Summary:\r\nThe sample code for HKWorkoutSession has inline code listings for creating workout sessions, saving their data into HKWorkout samples, etc. This code has not been updated for watchOS 3 and Swift 3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy the code from the documentation to an Xcode 8.3.1 watchOS project using Swift 3.\r\n2. Build the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app compiles.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are several compilation errors, from renamed methods and enums from the Swift 3 naming conversion to deprecated methods, like obtaining the activity type directly from the workout session.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHKWorkoutSession\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit/hkworkoutsession"
