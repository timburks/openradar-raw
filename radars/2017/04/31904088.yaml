    description: "Summary:\r\nThe TouchBar is a bigger source of incorrect input that being helpful for me.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there's no \"press\" to it, makes a lot of unwanted input happen, unlike the palm cancelation on the TrackPad.\r\n\r\nEverytime I'm typing, editing Numbers documents, or trying to press numbers/backspace the tips of my fingers resting on the top row of real keys is pressing buttons that I don't even see on my keyboard.\r\n\r\nI don't like it, it's frustrating when I have to correct some strange autofill behavior because it's in Numbers when I'm typing numbers near 3.\r\n\r\nI used to have the show desktop button next to the Touchbar, but that got real annoying, since the only way to cancel seemed to be the same button, so it broke my flow.\r\n\r\nNow i changed it to volume off, and I keep hitting it when I press backspace, so that it's turning on/off volume, which is just as an abrupt distraction.\r\n\r\nI'd really like some extra spacers \"no buttons\" that I can put near the TouchID button, that way I don't keep pressing it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use keyboard and type with the top row (without looking at keyboard)\r\n2. Try to use different apps that have customized the TouchBar\r\n3. Try to use backspace when writing documents or bug reports\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. TouchID buttons should only press with a real touch, not these tops of my fingers on buttons below\r\n2. TouchID buttons should have some kind of cancelation or additional buffer for fat fingers\r\n3. TouchID should not be annoying for someone who doesn't stare at the keys and touch types\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Random buttons I don't see keep getting pressed\r\n2. My flow is interrupted as Siri turns on, volume turns off, or desktop shows, or worse... I add the \"lock screen\" and then computer locks all while trying to type backspace.\r\n3. It's very unproductive and annoying to use, I'd much prefer the normal keyboard F12 keys, this is a step back in it's current form.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBook Pro 2016 15\" with TouchBar, 10.12.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't like the touchbar, it causes more interruptions and is really not very useful. There's a very few set of situations where it has been cool, but the indirect looking at it, touching it, and keeping it in my periferals is really a poor user experience. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't behave like an iOS device, and doesn't give me any kind of mechanical feedback or way to cancel a press, unlike an iOS button which lets me drag off, and really captures intent.\r\n\r\nThere is no intent captured with Touchbar, it's just an instant button press without the ability to hover.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro 2016\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
