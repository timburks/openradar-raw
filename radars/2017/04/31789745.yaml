    description: "Summary:\r\nVariable in AppleScripts that get their values from a “do JavaScript” statement that involves jQuery now get “missing value”. This worked in all prior versions of Safari\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile and run attached script\r\n2. Look at script output (and events/replies)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n“var_name” is an array of strings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error declaring that var_name is undefined\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked in all prior versions of Safari. It didn’t break because of a macOS update, since my mac running El Capitan with Safari 10.1 is also similarly broken.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is obviously a condensed and simplified version of a more complicated script I actually use"
