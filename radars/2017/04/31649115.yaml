    description: "There is no audio when you choose some higher resolutions of a given camera.\r\n\r\nTest this on iPad Pro 9.7\".\r\n\r\n1. Setup a video camera application CIFunHouse, for example, to record videos with one of the following cameras or resolutions\r\n\r\nFRONT CAMERA: 960p @ 30 or 60 fps or\r\nBACK CAMERA 4032x3024 at 30 fps\r\n\r\nYou will see that there is no audio.\r\n\r\ncaptureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: is never called for audio connections.\r\n\r\nIf you store the output to a file, you will end with a video file without sound.\r\n\r\nI expect all allowed formats to have sound. This is not a matter of CPU load, because the front camera shooting at 960p results on a picture that is way smaller to 4032x3024 and there is still no sound."
