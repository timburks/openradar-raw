    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a XIB file, a subview of an NSTableCellView can have one of its bindings bound to the table view's delegate, and it will work.\r\n\r\nIn a storyboard, this will cause ibtoold to rapidly eat all of system's available RAM and swap space, eventually completely taking down the system.\r\n\r\nI have attached a spindump, a sample project, and a video that demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached project.\r\n\r\n2. Try to compile the attached project.\r\n\r\n3. Cancel the compilation when it hangs.\r\n\r\n4. Wait a while.\r\n\r\n5. Hard-reboot your Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomething other than a complete OS lockup\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nibtoold eventually consumes all the available RAM and swap space on the machine, resulting in a complete OS lockup.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/n5p3bcw\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/l8nk3em"
