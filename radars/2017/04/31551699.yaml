    description: "Summary:\r\nIf your app supports all orientations, presents modally a view controller that uses a specific orientation (using  'supportedInterfaceOrientations'), records the screen and presents ReplayKit's preview controller, then after this point, the application won't respond to the device's orientation changes anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the project from Xcode, on a real device (since ReplayKit doesn't work in the simulator).\r\n2. Try to rotate your device : the root controller rotates and supports all orientations\r\n3. Tap the 'Present modally' button\r\n4. Try to rotate your device : the recording controller only supports landscape\r\n5. Tap the 'Start recording' button\r\n6. Wait for the recording to start, and the 'Stop recording' button to appear\r\n7. Tap the 'Stop recording' button\r\n8. Wait for the RPPreviewViewController controller to be presented\r\n9. Tap the 'Cancel' button on the top left\r\n10. Tap the 'Dismiss' button on the recording controller\r\n11. Try to rotate your device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe root controller, that originally supported all orientations, should rotate according to the device's orientation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe root controller, that originally supported all orientations, is locked in whichever orientation it was when the recording controller was presented for the first time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3 (14E277)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project uses Swift 3.1 and compiles with Xcode 8.3.1 \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128Gb\r\n\r\nSample project : https://puu.sh/vgwYu/c233bc4634.zip"
