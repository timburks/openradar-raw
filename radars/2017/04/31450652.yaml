    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen adding UI tests, there is an option in the scheme to add a Test Location. This is given to the app correctly when testing from Xcode but not when using xcodebuild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Add UI tests to a project that requires a location\r\n* Provide a Test Location in the scheme in the Test section\r\n* Run the UI tests with xcodebuild on the command line\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTests complete and succeed in exactly the same way as they do using Xcode to perform the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTests fail because no location is received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have attached a test project which has a basic setup, but similar tests to the app Iâ€™m trying to run tests on.
