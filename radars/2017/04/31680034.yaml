    description: "Summary:\r\nThe docs contain this sentence regarding to UIApplication.canOpenURL:\n\n> When this method returns true, iOS guarantees that subsequent calls to the openURL(_:) method with the same URL will successfully launch an app that can handle that URL.\n\nIf however the user has Maps.app \"uninstalled\" (as in hidden) a subsequent call to open a URL that should open in Maps will result in nothing happening.\n\nHere's some example code:\n\nif UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(URL(string: \"http://maps.apple.com/?q=Dresden\")!) {\n            print(\"✅\")\n            UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"http://maps.apple.com/?q=Dresden\")!, completionHandler: nil)\n        } else {\n            print(\"\U0001F4A5\")\n        }\n\nIf Maps.app is hidden a ✅will be printed and nothing else happens. This has the same results if querying for the \"maps://\" url scheme or if trying to open Maps via the MKMapItem API call instead of a URL.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSorry, I just threw it all into the description fiel above.\t\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither return false on the call to canOpenURL() (which would be the correct behavior based on the docs) or prompt the user to re\"install\" Maps.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSilence :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
