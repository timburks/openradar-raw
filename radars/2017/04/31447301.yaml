    description: "Area:\r\niCloud\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you open the new Device Info page in the Settings.app you will see a list of all your devices (see attached list.png screenshot). Then when you click on a device you will see the detail page for the device (see image1.png). In this page you will see the incorrect label \"Last iCloud backup: Never\" while if you enter in the \"iCloud Backup\" option (see image2.png) you can see that the backup has been actually done. NOTE: this issue is happening on iPhones only, while for iPad the \"Last iCloud backup:\" information is correct (see image3.png)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. on an iPhone open the Settings.app\r\n2. open the new iOS 10.3 function \"<Your Name> Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store...\" \r\n3. scroll to see the list of devices associated to your iCloud account (attachment: list.png)\r\n4. select one iPhone from the list \r\n5. ensure that \"iCloud Backup\" list item shows \"On\" and see the \"Last iCloud Backup\" label at the bottom.  (attachment: image1.png)\r\n6. you will notice that this label shows \"Never\" \r\n7. enter into the \"iCloud Backup\" function\r\n8. note that in this page \"Last Backup\" shows a correct information (attachment: image2.png)\r\n9. go back to the devices list\r\n10. now select an iPad\r\n11. you will see the \"Last iCloud Backup\" here is correct (image3.png)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the \"Last iCloud Backup\" label shows the effective last backup date and not a \"Never\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Last iCloud Backup\" label shows only \"Never\" for iPhones.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 (14E277) and iOS 10.3.1(14E304)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S and iPhone 5SE"
