    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUntil macOS Sierra 10.12.3 the installers would always allow for a FileVault authenticated reboot to be performed as part of the installation process. With the installer for 10.12.4 this seems to no longer be the case. When the installation is triggered via the startosinstall binary included with Install macOS Sierra.app (v12.4.06), the machine is prepped via the installer as usual but when the reboot is triggered the end user is prompted to authenticate at the FileVault login screen.\r\n\r\nThis creates a major issue for organizations that need to automate upgrades of hundreds and even thousands of macOS devices in their environments in a non-destructive manner.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. macOS devices with previous OS installed (I used 10.11.5)\r\n2. Enable FileVault, Reboot\r\n3. Allow Encryption to fully Complete.\r\n4. Copy/Download \"Install macOS Sierra.app\" (v12.4.06)\r\n5. Launch Terminal\r\n6. Run \"sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app --nointeraction\"\r\n\r\nProcess completes as normal, but at reboot user is prompted for FileVault login credentials.\r\n\r\nLogs and startosinstall output attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem would reboot into the installer volume and begin the upgrade process without any user intervention.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem stops at the FileVault login window and requires a user to unlock the drive before continuing to boot into the installer volume to begin the upgrade process.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRunning OS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\nInstalling macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air (11-inch, Early 2015) - MacBookAir7,1\r\n1.6GHz Intel Core i5\r\n4GB 1600 MHz DDR3"
