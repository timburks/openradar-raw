    description: "Area:\r\nAV Playback\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is no way to know if the top menu (the one to select audio and subtitles) is currently presented on the screen.\r\n\r\nWe have a custom click gesture for an AVPlayerViewController to show a supplemental view controller. We would like to prevent this gesture from being invoked when the AVPlayerViewController top menu is shown.\r\n\r\nWhen the AVPlayerViewController top menu is shown, gestures to the player view controller is still being received. \r\n\r\nOur current work around is to detect if there is a TabBars in the view hierarchy. But, it would be nice to have a more developer friendly api for this scenario.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere isn't an API to detect if the AVPlayerViewController top menu is presented.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is an API to detect if the AVPlayerViewController top menu is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere isn't an API to detect if the AVPlayerViewController top menu is visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTv 4th Generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
