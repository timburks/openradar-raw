    description: "Area:\r\nAV Playback\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is not possible to just hide the progress bar in an instance of AVPlayerViewController.\r\n\r\nThe only documented API is setting showsPlaybackControls to false but it also hides the top bar menu and it also disables all the interactive gestures of AVPlayerViewController.\r\n\r\nIt would beneficial to allow hiding of just the player controls of an AVPlayer, i.e. progress bar, but keep the top menu which shows the external metadata.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an AVPlayerViewController\r\n2) set showsPlaybackControls to false\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe player's playback controls are not visible but the user can still interact with the top menu which display the external metadata.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll player playback controls are hidden, no top menu is accessible, and interactive gestures are disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTv 4th Generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
