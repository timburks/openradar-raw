    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease see the attached videos of the issue. Essentially, on a retina display, switching Spaces while dragging will cause the drag preview image to be substituted with a low resolution (non-Retina) replacement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select something (a file in Finder, some text in Safari, etc.) and begin dragging it so that a preview appears near the cursor.\r\n2. Begin dragging it.\r\n3. With the mouse button held down, begin switching Spaces (with a three finger swipe sideways)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preview remains sharp\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image becomes pixellated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't remember seeing this on my old MacBook Pro, which didn't have a Retina Display.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c)"
