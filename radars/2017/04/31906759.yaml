    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen presenting a SFSafariViewController from a WKWebView using 3D Touch, I'm getting a warning (\"-[UIPreviewItemController stopInteraction] called more than once after startInteraction. This is unexpected, please file a radar.\") in the console telling me to file a radar. Please see attached sample project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached project.\r\n2. 3D Touch the link to peek, then press harder to pop.\r\n3. Observe the console; \"-[UIPreviewItemController stopInteraction] called more than once after startInteraction. This is unexpected, please file a radar.\" will show up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo output in the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-[UIPreviewItemController stopInteraction] called more than once after startInteraction. This is unexpected, please file a radar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 (14E5269)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther than the warning, everything else seems to work as expected (though there a bunch of \"if we're in the real pre-commit handler we can't actually add any new fences due to CA restriction\" messages as well)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
