It was generated by taking an EPUB and running it through Calibre's (https://calibre-ebook.com) PDF converter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run mdimport on the attached file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpotlight will import it quickly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPDF.mdimporter spams \"failed to parse embedded CMap.\" hundreds of thousands of times and is killed since it takes too long\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F54b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running"
