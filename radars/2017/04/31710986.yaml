        Summary:
        The refactor tool doesnâ€™t like it when you ignore it. Canceling the process crashes the app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Right click on a property in a header you own and start the refactor process
        2. Wait a couple seconds while you think of a new property name
        3. Hit escape to cancel the refactor

        Expected Results:
        Refactor is cancelled, no changes are made.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode crashes.

        Regression:
        None known.

        Notes:
        This happened in 8.3.1 as well.
