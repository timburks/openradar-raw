    description: "Summary:\r\nYou can't see the values that you entered for Classification and Reproducibility for bugs that you have already filed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to bugreport.apple.com to file a bug.\r\n2. Open a new bug.\r\n3. If you're on the old RadarWeb, fill in the Classification and Reproducibility fields. If you're on the new RadarWeb, under \"What kind of issue are you reporting?\", choose \"Bug\", and then below that, fill in the \"What type of bug are you reporting?\" and \"How often are you able to reproduce this issue?\" fields.\r\n4. Continue filling out the bug.\r\n5. File the bug.\r\n6. Go back to look at your filed bug, and try to figure out what values you entered for those two fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe values for classification and reproducibility are listed on the bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe values for classification and reproducibility are not listed on the bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot a regression. This was a problem in old RadarWeb, and continues to be a problem in new RadarWeb.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34) on macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
