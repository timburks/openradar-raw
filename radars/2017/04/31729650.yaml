    description: "It should be easy to extend a campaign to new regions by simply duplicating it or even better by just adding additional regions to an existing campaign.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to create a completely new campaign and have to create a (dummy) Ad Group first. Then I can duplicate my existing Ad Groups to the new campaign. This means I'm left with the dummy Ad Group that I can't delete (rdar://31729593)."
