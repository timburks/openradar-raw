    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile iOS is attempting to connect to a WiFi hotspot (either because it is configured to connect to all, or because it's one that it has previously connected to), but it has not yet established a reliable connection to the Internet, the status bar will not display a WiFi icon. However, iOS will still attempt to route traffic over this non-functioning connection in preference to cellular data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure the device has good cellular and WiFi connectivity.\r\n2. Launch an application which is heavily network-dependent, such as Snapchat or Messenger.\r\n3. Move just outside of the range of the WiFi network, such that the WiFi indicator in the status bar will be hidden.\r\n4. Compose and attempt to send a message, or perform some similar network action (e.g., browsing a website)\r\n5. Note that the connection will stall, and the WiFi indicator is still not present in the status bar.\r\n6. Swipe up to display Control Center and disable WiFi.\r\n7. The network activity in the application will immediately become unblocked.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhile a connection via WiFi has not been fully established, this network interface would remain invisible to applications and no user traffic would be routed through it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTraffic attempts to be routed through the WiFi interface even though the OS is aware that reliable connectivity is not (yet) available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1 [14E304]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis does not appear to be a recent regression â€” it's existed throughout iOS 10, and possibly earlier releases.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB, Three UK & WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
