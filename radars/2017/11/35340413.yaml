    description: "Summary:\r\nXCUITest allows us to launch apps given their bundle identifier. In some occasions, we would like to launch the Preferences app to adjust some settings. We do so with the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet settingsApp = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: \"com.apple.Preferences\")\r\nsettingsApp.launch()\r\n_ = settingsApp.wait(for: .runningForeground, timeout: 10)\r\nsettingsApp.staticTexts[\"General\"].firstMatch.tap()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes, the settings app fails to launch, and although line 3 above executes correctly, the test immediately fails on line 4.\r\n\r\nAttached are the screenshots of the UI as it fails. As you an see, the preferences app appears to start loading but instead you get a black screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun a UI test where you open the preferences app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preferences app will open always\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn occasion, the preferences app will not open.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11, simulator\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2017 macbook pro, also happens on CI machines (I don't know what type of hardware they are)."
