    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #34462751\n\nPlease add an accessibility setting for the iPhone X to allow me to open Control Center by swiping from the top left corner, instead of the top right corner (and open Notification Center by swiping from the middle or top right corner).\r\n\r\nI'm left handed, and use my iPhone with my left hand. I currently have an iPhone 7, and already find it hard to reach the top right corner of the screen. Since the iPhone X has an even larger screen, I suspect that I will also have difficultly reaching the top right corner. It is much easier for me to reach the top left and middle of the screen. However, swiping from either of these performs the same action on iPhone X. It would be helpful for my accessibility to make Control Center easier to reach by allowing it to be opened from the top left.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:"
