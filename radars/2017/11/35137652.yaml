    description: "We receive a lot of crash reports on gpus_ReturnGuiltyForHardwareRestart. \r\nHere are the crash stacktrace\r\n\r\n0\tlibGPUSupportMercury.dylib 0x00000001a1131f1c gpus_ReturnGuiltyForHardwareRestart + 8\r\n1\tlibGPUSupportMercury.dylib 0x00000001a1132edc gpusSubmitDataBuffers + 172\r\n2\tAGXGLDriver 0x00000001a51f8734 0x00000001a51d1000 + 161588\r\n\r\nIt happens when we are rending images with opengl. Somehow I don't even have a line number on the stacktrace so I don't know specifically which API caused this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot constantly reproducible.\r\n\r\nThe bug exists and is one of our top crashes in prod. It happens on both iphone 6,6s, and 7, and only for IOS 11.\r\n\r\nFYI the crash happens NOT on main thread. We have an image process queue that runs on it's own thread.\r\n\r\nCurrently we call glFlush() every time after deleting frame buffer and textures so that does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe crash only happens on 5s, 6, 6+. It never happens on iphone 6s and 7."
