    description: "I have an Apple TV 4K running tvOS 11.2 beta. The Apple TV is in the UK, where most native video content is 50hz. As such, I have set the Apple TV default video display mode to HDR 50HZ.\r\n\r\nI also have an app which only supports SDR, so I added UIAppSupportsHDR=FALSE to the app's Info.plist.\r\n\r\nWhen I launch the app, I would expect the display mode to change to 50HZ SDR.\r\n\r\nHowever, the app switches to 60HZ SDR, even though my default display mode is set to 50HZ."
