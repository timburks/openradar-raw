    description: "iOS 11’s screenshot editor an acknowledgement that quickly marking up and immediately sharing is a common use case for screenshots.\r\n\r\nThis radar proposes some improvements to reduce friction for this use case of immediately sharing screenshots.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot editor’s swipe-to-dismiss UI makes it incompatible with drag and drop. As a result of this, for more fine-grained sharing (e.g.: Placing an image at an exact position in a note or an email draft) the workflow requires either expanding the overlay, opening the share sheet, and selecting the Copy action, or using the import interface provided by the app which requires browsing through your library.\r\n\r\nThis friction can be reduced significantly by instead just copying screenshots to the clipboard directly. A simple, system standard long-press > Paste would allow for then using that image in any text field."
