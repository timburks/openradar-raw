    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOutside of the US, number separators are often swapped: numbers are grouped with a \".\" and use \",\" for the decimal. When setting a baseline in an xctest performance test the \"Baseline\" textfield doesn't respect this, and parses numbers that use a , for the decimal as 0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGo to System Preferences > Language & Region > Advanced and set the grouping to , and the decimal to \".\". Create a new performance test in Xcode, run it, click in the gutter to open up the test result popover, click Edit, Accept and Save. Open the test result popover again, and the value is now 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe baseline value should have used an API for parsing numbers that respects the user's locale, or at least show an error when it can't parse the number, not silently fail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe baseline value is 0.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9.1 (app store).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
