    description: "Summary:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-bundles/ states \"App bundles also support Complete My Bundle. Complete My Bundle credits customers for any apps they’ve already purchased within a bundle, so that they only pay the balance for the remaining apps.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not a correct characterization of current behavior, as described in Steps to Reproduce below.\r\n\r\nPer Dev Program Case 100223923023, Engineering have clarified that this in fact expected behaviour, but I would suggest that it's not at all clear to end customers (or me) why this should be the case.\r\n\r\nI would expect that having paid for two of three apps in any bundle, whatever I had paid would be credited toward completion of the bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Imagine I have two apps “A\" and “B\" and a Bundle “1” which contains apps “A” and “B”. A customer either buys “A” or “B” and then \"completes my bundle”  by purchasing the remaining app, or they simply purchase Bundle “1” outright. So far so good.\r\n- Now, at a later date, I add a new app “C” and a new Bundle “2”, containing apps “A”, “B” and “C”. (I can’t add “C” to Bundle “1”, because bundle app assignments can’t be changed.). A customer wishes to add app “C”, and expects to benefit from the \"complete my bundle” pricing available for Bundle “2”, as they already have purchased apps “A” and “B”.\r\n- It appears that some or possibly all customers in this situation are not offered CMB pricing for App “C”/Bundle “2\". It’s as if their purchases of “A” and “B” are tied to Bundle “1” and therefore they are offered Bundle “2” at full price, even though they already own “A” and “B”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCustomer should be offered CMB pricing\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCustomer is not offered CMB pricing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease also see Dev Program case reference 100223923023."
