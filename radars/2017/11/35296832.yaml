    description: "Summary:\r\nPrevious to iOS 11, a user could manage their locations: after an initial browsing of a desired location, they would select that location with a switch control to add it to the initial provider list that is presented. This essentially removes a extra step as the user would not need to browse again for a commonly selected location. Instead, it would be added to beneath Cloud and Photo Library in the initial list.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this functionality has been removed in iOS 11. The user must always browse from the initial list of locations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to add a extension location as a \"favorite\" after browsing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs with iOS 10, the user should be able to add location (such as with a switch control) as a \"favorite\" so that they do not need to consistently browse for commonly used locations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo selection mechanism possible."
