    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the user changes the network from cellular to WiFi or wifi to cellular, the AVPlayer stops loading further data from the AVPlayerItem's URL resource. This results in an empty buffer which leads to stopping the playback even though there is a perfectly working network connection established. This behavior only occurs on iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* iPhone / iOS 11\r\n* iPhone is connected to WiFi and mobile cellular network. \r\n* Start AVQueuePlayer with AVPlayerItem (URL source)\r\n* AVPlayer is buffering\r\n* Playback starts\r\n* Turn off WiFi\r\n* iPhone switch to cellular data -> connection established\r\n* AVPlayer keypath observing of \"currentItem.playbackBufferEmpty\" detects empty buffer after several seconds.\r\n* AVPlayer stops playback\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* On iOS 10 a network change does not prevent the player of buffering further data when the new connection is established.\r\n* On iOS 11 the AVPlayer should do the same: Start buffering after the network change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* On iOS 11 after a network change the AVPlayer is not buffering further data and stops playing when the buffer is empty.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0.3 / 15A432\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n* iPhone 6s\r\n* iOS 11.0.3\r\n* cellular data\r\n* wifi"
