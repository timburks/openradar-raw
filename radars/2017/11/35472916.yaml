    description: "Summary:\r\nI have attached a small sample project. When a multiline UILabel is placed in a UIStackView, Interface Builder does not render it correctly.  It will either not display at all or produce an \"Interface Builder does not support UILabel sizes larger than 10,000 by 10,000\" error.  It does display correctly when ran, with no ambiguous or conflicts with constraints. \r\n\r\nThe stack view's width is defined by its constraints to the safe area, so the multiline label should be able to determine its size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached UIStackViewBug Xcode project.  \r\n2. Run the project and notice that the label displays correctly.\r\n3. Open Main.storyboard and observe that Interface Builder does not display it correctly.\r\n4. Open the Preview assistant editor and observe that it does not display it correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInterface Builder should display the screen correctly.\r\nThe Preview assistant editor should display the screen correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither Interface Builder nor Preview Assistant Editor displays the label correctly.\r\nSometimes when you open the project in Xcode, it will show a window that states: The document \"Main.storyboard\" had 2 internal inconsistencies that were found and repaired.  However it will quickly go back to not displaying correctly in IB if you edit anything.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode version 9.2 beta (9C34b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2015 Macbook Pro 15\""
