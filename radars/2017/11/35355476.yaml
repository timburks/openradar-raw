    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is very difficult for left-handed users to invoke Control Center on the iPhone X. One way to improve this would be to always include Control Center as the right-most item in the multitasking “app switcher”, as portrayed in this video: https://twitter.com/_inside/status/899778395776499713\n\nThis is just one suggestion for how to improve this issue. There are many alternatives that would also help, which I am also filing radars for (including: allowing a “swipe down” on the home indicator to bring up Control Center instead of Reachability, or allowing Control Center to be swiped down from the left side of the status bar instead of the right side).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the multitasking app switcher on the iPhone X by swiping up from the home indicator and pausing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nControl Center would be accessible from the bottom of the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nControl Center is not accessible from the bottom of the screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
