    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Markdown syntax uses two or more spaces at the end of a line to indicate a newline. (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\r\n\r\nIf the 'trim trailing whitespace' pref is turned on in Xcode, these meaningful whitespace characters are trimmed from Markdown documents.\r\n\r\nIt is not particularly useful to have to remember to turn that preference off when editing a Markdown document in Xcode, and then turn it back on when you are finished.\r\n\r\nCategorized as data loss since this preference strips meaningful formatting data from the Markdown document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Make sure the 'trim trailing whitespace' pref is turned on\r\n  (Preferences > Text Editing > Editing)\r\n- Edit a Markdown document in Xcode.\r\n- Attempt to type a line with two space characters at the end and hit return\r\n- The meaningful spaces at the end of the line are removed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to be able to edit Markdown in Xcode without being hampered by a preference that makes sense in source code files, but does not make sense in a Markdown file.\r\n\r\nWould be great if Xcode considered those two trailing spaces to be meaningful (since they are in Markdown) and not strip them, even when the preference is turned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEither have to keep turning preference on and off depending on what type of file I am editing. Or can't use Xcode to edit Markdown.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2016 15\" Touch Bar MacBook Pro"
