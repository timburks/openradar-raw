    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a `SLComposeServiceViewController` with `SLComposeSheetConfigurationItem`s are presented over dark content (e.g. a dark website or photo during sharing) it can be difficult to read the value of the configuration item. The configuration item caret also appears to blur differently than the adjacent text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- On an iOS 11 device, open a webpage with a dark background on Safari e.g. https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/13-how-to-cook-turkey\r\n- Share the web page with a share extension that uses SLComposeServiceViewController with a SLComposeSheetConfigurationItem (e.g. Reminders or Slack)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The value of the configuration item should be easy to read\r\n- The colour of the configuration item should match the table row caret image\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee attached image of Reminder share extension.\r\n- The value of the configuration item (\"Inbox\") is not easy to read\r\n- The colour of the configuration item doesn't match the table row caret image\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1.2\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n- It would be useful to expose more styling control of the SLComposeServiceViewController to do things such as disable the blur effect (like the Notes extension) and to adjust text colours and fonts on the various elements."
