    description: "Presenting a UIActivityViewController from a UIViewController in a UIWindow at the .alert UIWindowLevel (or even a bit lower) prevents the iMessage sharing extension from rending correctly and prevents sharing. It also, oddly, messes with the status bar.\r\n\r\nI've created a project for quickly and easily demoing this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/warpling/ShareSheetFromAlertWindow\r\n\r\nTo start run the project. From the grey screen (the base UIWindow) you can tap to open a share sheet and see the iMessage share extension working normally. Dismiss it and then present a UIWindow at .normal level and repeat; it should work the same. Dismiss it and then present a UIWindow at .alert level; attempt to share via iMessage and observe the missing text field and status bar.\r\n\r\nThis was tested in both iOS 11.1 and 11.2 (15C110b)."
