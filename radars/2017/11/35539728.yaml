    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nOn iOS 11 currently up to 11.2 Beta 3, remote notifications to a foregrounded application are not delivered when the MDM-enrolled device is locked into autonomous Single App Mode. When Single App Mode is disabled, messages are immediately delivered to the application. \r\n\r\nBased on the logs of our APNs-based Pushy.me SDK, it can be inferred that the messages are received by the device, but the notification handler is simply never invoked. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get iOS 11 device enrolled into MDM\r\n2. Run application with notifications enabled/allowed, app in foreground, not in single app mode\r\n3. Receive a message successfully.\r\n4. Enable Single App Mode (we do this via VMware Airwatch portal)\r\n5. Verify in single app mode by hitting home button, if it doesn't leave to springboard, you are in single app mode\r\n6. Send a message to the app - it will NOT invoke the notification handler.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification will be received regardless of whether or not Single App mode is enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification is not received in Single App Mode. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 (tested: 11, 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2 beta 3)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe following messages have been sent and no variations work when single app mode is on. All work with it off. \r\n1. \r\n{\r\n\t\"data\":{...snip...}\r\n\t\"to\":\"device_token\",\r\n\t\"content_available\":true,\r\n\t\"time_to_live\":604800,\r\n\t\"notification\":{\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"sound\": \"ping.aiff\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. \r\n{\r\n\t\"data\":{...snip...}\r\n\t\"to\":\"device_token\",\r\n\t\"content_available\":true,\r\n         \"mutable_content\":true,\r\n\t\"time_to_live\":604800,\r\n\t\"notification\":{\r\n\t\t\"title\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"description\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"sound\": \"ping.aiff\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n3.\r\n{\r\n\t\"data\":{...snip...}\r\n\t\"to\":\"device_token\",\r\n\t\"content_available\":true,\r\n\t\"time_to_live\":604800\r\n}"
