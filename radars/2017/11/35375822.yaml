All I/O should be stopped or paused prior to deactivating the audio session.\r\n\r\nThis error per se is not a big deal because the method call still takes effect: the session is deactivated and other apps resumes playing music.\r\n\r\nHowever, this error causes this method to take abnormally long time that it blocks the main thread and users can obviously perceive the freeze. \r\n\r\nIn comparison, dismissing AVPlayerViewController by tapping X button doesn't have this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap play.\r\n3. Interactively dismiss player.\r\n4. Read abnormal console logs.\r\n5. Tap play.\r\n6. Dismiss player by tapping X button.\r\n7. Read normal console logs.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!IDJ03TLb!oNTsFfhIe2oUBbx54NXQ8dGUGrhjh8U9sX7N30ena6E"
