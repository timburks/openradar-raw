    description: "Summary:\r\nUIAccessibilityCustomAction is a very important class to enhance Accessibility Support of our app. In our current self-implemented Document Picker we added custom actions to allow for easy renaming, duplication, moving and deletion of documents. \n\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController however neither has support for custom actions out of the box, nor allows to add them on our own.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any UIDocumentBrowser-based App, e.g. Pages.app\n2. Enable VoiceOver on the Device\n3. Put the VoiceOver Cursor on a document\n4. Swipe up/down to select custom actions\n\ncontrast this to what happens with the same steps in Files.app (which has custom actions)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController provides the same accessibility actions as the Files app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Files app has UIAccessibilityCustomActions to edit/rename/delete/… files, but UIDocumentBrowser-based apps don’t\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1/2 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI originally filed this as rdar://32922733, which was mistakenly closed (My bug report wasn’t about those actions missing in Files.app, but in UIDocumentBrowserViewController-based apps)"
