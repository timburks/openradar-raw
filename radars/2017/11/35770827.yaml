    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPad with ext keyboard, Spotlight allows you to open an app very quickly, by pressing ⌘space, name of the app, return.\n\nHowever, it’s not as simple to open the app from Spotlight in split view above the currently opened app — long-press gesture is necessary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a keyboard shortcut, for power users, for example:\n\n- Enter just opens the app in full screen\n- ⇧Enter/Cmd+Enter opens the app in split view\n- OR ^Left, ^Right open the selected app in left/right split view, while ^up opens it in slide over.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
