    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nWhen an emoji with skin modifiers is selected for the first time, the user is prompted to select which skin modifier to use for that emoji. This must be done each time an emoji that can have a skin modifier applied to it, is selected for the first time.\r\n\r\nAn option to specify the default skin modifier should be available to the user in Settings > General > Keyboard so that the user does not need to make this choice each time an emoji is used for the first time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when this setting is applied, the emoji keyboard should reflect this change by showing emoji with skin modifiers in the selected skin modifier colour.\r\nUsers should still be able to select an alternative skin modifier by either the tap and hold method, or a 3D touch pop over."
