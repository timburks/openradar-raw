    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Camera flash setting keeps turning itself back to \"auto\" every day or two.\r\n\r\nI turn Camera flash OFF. I wait a day or two. I try to take a picture in a dark room. The flash setting has re-set to \"AUTO\" and I mistakenly flash the entire room with bright light.\r\n\r\nI'm a \"never use flash\" photographer. This iOS 11 flash re-setting is seriously messing with my ability to use the camera on my iPhone. I'm now in constant fear that I'm going to illuminate the entire dark room when I mean to take a quick photo.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"Preserve Settings\" preference for Flash in iOS Camera Settings. There *are* similar preferences for Live Photos and other Camera features.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\niOS 11\r\nTurn Camera Flash OFF\r\nWait a day or two\r\nTake a picture in a dark room.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCamera flash should still be OFF, like I set it.\r\n\r\niOS has always preserved the flash settings.\r\n\r\nIf resetting to auto is now expected behavior in iOS 11, the \"Preserve Settings\" area of camera settings SHOULD have a \"Preserve Flash\" option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCamera flash has reset to \"AUTO\" in the last day or two since I last set it to OFF.\r\n\r\nIt's dark, so \"auto\" means \"on\". I mistakenly illuminate the entire room with bright light and annoy everyone.\r\n\r\nThe \"Preserve Settings\" area of camera settings does NOT have a \"Preserve Flash\" option.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.1 / iPhone 7\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
