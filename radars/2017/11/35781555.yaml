    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode there is an undocumented build setting called HIDE_BITCODE_SYMBOLS, this setting translates later to LD_HIDE_BITCODE_SYMBOLS, and eventually causes `-Xlinker -bitcode_hide_symbols` to be passed to the compiler in some cases.\r\n\r\nOne example case of this is if you create a framework bundle where the MACH_O_TYPE is mh_object (or \"Relocatable Object File\").\r\n\r\nPassing these arguments to the linker results in the final binary's bitcode to have all its symbols replaced with `__hidden` symbols instead. This makes crash reports extremely difficult to debug.\r\n\r\nNeither of the above build settings are surfaced in the Build Settings tab of Xcode either, so I assume many projects where this behavior applies, aren't doing it intentionally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project with type \"Cocoa Touch Framework\"\r\n2. Change the MACH_O_TYPE build setting to be mh_object (Relocatable Object File in the UI)\r\n3. Archive the project for \"Generic iOS Device\"\r\n4. Check the \"Link\" step in the build log\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`-Xlinker -bitcode_hide_symbols` should not be passed by default. Instead the `HIDE_BITCODE_SYMBOLS` Build Setting should be surfaced in Xcode and NO by default\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn this case `-Xlinker -bitcode_hide_symbols` is passed unless you set `HIDE_BITCODE_SYMBOLS` to `NO` as a user defined setting\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This setting doesn't seem to be used for either dynamic frameworks nor static libraries\r\n- To see an example of this in the wild download GoogleMaps 2.5.0 https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/6e5f7d9da3112ca6/GoogleMaps-2.5.0.tar.gz and extract the bitcode from it.\r\n\r\nTo extract the bitcode run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd GoogleMaps.framework\r\n$ lipo -thin arm64 -output slice GoogleMaps\r\n$ segedit slice -extract __LLVM __bundle slice.arm64.xar\r\n$ xar -xf slice.arm64.xar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `nm` on any of the created numbered files in the same directory. You will see output like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nm 001 | grep __hidden\r\n---------------- t __hidden#0_\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese __hidden symbols eventually make it into crash reports in Xcode like the one attached."
