    description: "With the release of 10.13 appleseed/developer beta1 a new featured, SKEL (ultimately USKEL) was announced and a Technical Note was issued here: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2459/_index.html\r\n\r\nWith the release of 10.13.2 appleseed/developer beta1, there are new features that will significantly impact MDM developers and macadmins, but these release notes were not part of the developer beta1 release notes. \r\n\r\nPlease add the following from the AppleSeed release notes to the Developer release notes, so macadmins can publicly discuss this in the developer forums. These crucial bits of information should not be gated behind AppleSeed.\r\n\r\nAnnouncements:\r\nFor increased security, macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Beta introduces the concept of “User Approved” MDM Enrollment. This optional enrollment type allows MDM management of certain security-sensitive settings. In order to use this new enrollment type, users must manually install an MDM enrollment profile using System Preferences. Using automation or even attempting to enroll a device remotely via screen sharing will not result in User Approved enrollment. Enrolling a device in MDM does not currently require User Approved MDM enrollment. The only configuration payload which presently requires User Approved MDM enrollment is the one to manage User Approved Kernel Extension Loading (com.apple.syspolicy.kernel- extension-policy). Be aware of the following:\r\n• All devices enrolled in the Device Enrollment Program (DEP) are considered to have been enrolled in MDM with User Approved enrollment.\r\n• All devices currently in MDM will behave as if they’d been enrolled with User Approved enrollment once they are upgraded to macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Beta and later. However, if they are subsequently removed and re-enrolled in MDM, they won’t automatically be enrolled with User Approved enrollment.\r\n• If you enroll your Mac in MDM without the User Approved option, and then wish to update its enrollment type to User Approved, you can do so in the Profiles System Preferences pane. Select your enrollment profile, click the Details button, and follow the prompts.\r\n• At this time, User Approved Kernel Extension Loading will be disabled for devices enrolled in MDM. It will be enabled (but managed) if you use User Approved enrollment and install a com.apple.syspolicy.kernel-extension-policy configuration payload which contains the AllowedKernelExtensions or AllowUserOverrides keys."
