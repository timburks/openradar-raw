    description: "Hi!\r\n\r\nIf I have a view selected in the view debugger, it's not obvious how to show it in the navigator. There's a ton of use for this feature, in particular to see where in the view/view controller hierarchy it is.\r\n\r\nThe functionality exists via command-shift-D.  This was a mystery to me, and I figured ya'll just forgot about it until someone in a slack channel mentioned it. Now when I say \"there's this magic keystroke that'll show the view in the navigator\", minds are blown and I get all sorts of accolades.\r\n\r\nI'd like to exchange these accolades for a contextual menu :-)  that has \"show in the navigation view.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot showing the existing contextual menu.  Adding what's behind Navigate>Reveal in Debug Navigator to the contextual menu would be all kinds of wonderful."
