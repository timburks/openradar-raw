    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCreating a new NetInstall set using the 10.13.1 installer as a source.\r\n\r\nClients NetBoot successfully but remain on a screen with a grey gradient background and a mouse cursor. The mouse can move freely and the display will sleep after 10 minutes. There is little/no network activity. The installation does not start and the Mac remains in this state until hard powered-off via the power button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a NetInstall set using the macOS installer as a source, with the following settings:\r\n\r\nAutomation Settings:\r\n\r\nAutomatically install to: Macintosh HD\r\nErase target volume before installing\r\nSystem (Default) Language: English\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nClient should NetBoot successfully and automatically erase the \"Macintosh HD\" volume and install macOS.\r\n\r\nA NetInstall set created using a 10.12.6 installer as the source, with the same settings, works as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nClients NetBoot successfully but remain on a screen with a grey gradient background and a mouse cursor. The mouse can move freely and the display will sleep after 10 minutes. There is little/no network activity. The installation does not start and the Mac remains in this state until hard powered-off via the power button.\r\n\r\nI have tried this on 2 iMacs - a 12,1 and 14,1 and can replicate this issue every time.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS: 10.13.1 17B48\r\nSIU 2: 10.13 (820)\r\nmacOS installer: 13.1.05\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAll options in SIU are left as default, apart from the Automation Settings which are:\r\n\r\nAutomatically install to: Macintosh HD\r\nErase target volume before installing\r\nSystem (Default) Language: English"
