    description: "Summary:\r\nIt’s possible to D&D an app on the screen to open it in Slide Over, but currently, it will always open on the right side of the screen.\n\nIf I drop it on the left side of the screen, I expect it to open on the left side, not the right side.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app in full screen.\n2. Start dragging an app (e.g. from Dock) on the left side of the screen (but not at the very right corner)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I drop it, Slide Over opens from the LEFT side\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app will jump back to the RIGHT side\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe reason why this can be useful is e.g. when you’re already in *Split View* and have a narrow split view app on the LEFT side, and just want to quickly have *another* app as a reference, you want to use Slide Over, but you want to put it over the LEFT split view app as to not cover text in the right side main app.\n\nPS. I’ve posted A TON of other iPad bugs&enhancement requests — check them out. Also don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you want to see how serious iPad users work like and what are their needs."
