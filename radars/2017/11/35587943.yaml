    description: "Problem:\r\nWhile standing near a MacBook that has the \"Unlock with Apple Watch\" feature enabled, it is possible for another person to just open up the Mac and be able to use it. The vibration is a good feedback to the user, that the feature has been used, but sadly there is no possibility to undo the action.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nInstead of just displaying the \"Disable\"-Button with the notification, also provide a \"Lock again\"-Button - which enables the user to remotely lock the device again and maybe disable the feature until the password has been entered again."
