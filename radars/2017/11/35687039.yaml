    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to express simple auto layout options in the visual layout language when using the safe area.\r\n\r\nPossibly add a layout option that treats the vertical bar as the safe area instead of the superview. So \"H:|[myView]|\" and \"V:|[myView]|\" with a NSUsesSafeArea layout option would lay the view out in relation to the safe area and not the superview.\r\n\r\nOr possibly introduce a new character instead of the vertical bar that means 'safe area' instead of superview. Maybe an 'X'? \"X[myView]X\"\r\n\r\nOf the two suggestions, I think a layout option would probably work better, tweaking the meaning of the vertical bar."
