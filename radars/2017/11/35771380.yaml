    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ⌘Tab app switcher often breaks on iOS, especially when often ⌘Tabbing between apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use an iPad Pro w/ a Smart Keyboard for half an hour, use a lot of apps, use ⌘Tab to switch between apps\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll just works\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPretty often, you’ll find that the ⌘Tab switcher simply WILL NOT appear. Sometimes you have to kill an app for the switcher to appear in that particular app. Sometimes you have to press toe home button and get back to the app for it to work again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPS. I’ve posted A TON of other iPad bugs&enhancement requests — check them out. Also don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you want to see how serious iPad users work like and what are their needs."
