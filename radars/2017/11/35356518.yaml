    description: "Summary: Customers can simultaneously use separate Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes on iPhone. But two-factor authentication challenges are only sent for logins for iCloud Apple ID. iTunes logins with two-factor authentication enabled must fall back to SMS on iOS, which is less secure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Attempt to log into iTunes account on desktop. iPhone with same iTunes account will not display login if that Apple ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Desktop machines can be trusted devices for more than one Apple ID at a time. For example, iTunes and iCloud logins will both display challenges and login codes on the same desktop machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes two-factor notifications are never sent to iPhone. Only iCloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11.2\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: N/A"
