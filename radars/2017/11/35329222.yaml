    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, my iPhone 6s gets into a state where screen rotation happens in two steps. First, very soon after I rotate the device, it looks like a view that is the size of the screen rotates, so that you see black corners rotate, but the UI stays still. Then, a moment later, the content rotates. In apps that don’t support rotation, including the Home Screen and Lock Screen on an iPhone 6s, I still see the first part of the rotation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot sure what causes it, but restarting the phone always fixes it for a while (hours? days?).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen never has this two-step rotation issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen sometimes does weird two-step rotation. I’ve included two screen recordings. In each one, I rotate the phone twice on the home screen and twice in Mail.app. You can see the issue happen all four times in one video, and no times in the other video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1 (15B93)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screen recording also uploaded to https://cl.ly/nTGf\r\n\r\nRegression: introduced in iOS 11 betas, as far as I can tell."
