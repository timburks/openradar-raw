    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur lab iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) cannot boot anymore after updating from 10.13.1 Beta 3 to 10.13.2 (17C60c) Beta 1 because it gets stuck on the prohibitory symbol screen.\r\nThe internal mechanical disk drive contains various volumes with different major macOS versions and the High Sierra one is FileVault enabled.\r\nNow, after powering up the iMac and inserting a user password to unlock the volume, a progress bar is displayed under the user icon and after 30/60 seconds the prohibitory symbol appears, so it seems that it cannot find a valid System Folder to start up.\r\nWhen I start the Mac in Verbose Mode the output ends with (see screenshot \"Verbose Mode #1.png\")\r\n\r\n[LOG]\r\nHID: Legacy shlm 2\r\n[/LOG]\r\n\r\nand after 30/60 seconds the prohibitory symbol appears and corrupts the screen image (see screenshot \"Verbose Mode #2.png\").\r\nI tried to boot in Single User Mode with CMD + S but it freezed at the same four log lines. Booting from Recovery and unlocking the volume with Recovery's Disk Utility still works.\r\nSystemVersion.plist in /System/Library/CoreServices/ shows that macOS 10.13.2 has been installed.\r\nI'm attaching install.log and system.log(s) I copied using the shell while booted in Recovery mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to update to 10.13.2 (17C60c) Developer Beta 1 with the regular Mac App Store procedure.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe update should succeed and the system should reboot just fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn reboot the system gets stuck on the prohibitory symbol screen.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n– 10.13.2 (17C60c) Developer Beta 1 \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n– iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011)\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations\r\nNovember 11 2017, 11:38 AM\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:   Did the machine reboot automatically to a prohibitory symbol, or, did it have to be force rebooted using the power button?\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nNovember 11 2017, 3:02 PM\r\nThe machine rebooted automatically to a prohibitory symbol, I didn't have to force reboot using the power button. When I updated the machine I was doing some other things so I didn't stare at the process very much but I remember that at a certain point the screen was all black with only the pointer on it (I don't remember if an arrow pointer or a SBBOD one) but I didn't use the power button and when I checked again there was the usual user chooser screen to unlock the FileVault protected volume. The day after I started up the Mac with CMD+R and successfully reinstalled macOS from Recovery. The Recovery's \"High Sierra Beta\" app installed High Sierra 10.13.1 Beta 3 (17B42a) and now the MAS is offering me to update to macOS 10.13.2 Developer Beta 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 14 2017, 7:48 PM\r\nWe don't have enough information to investigate this issue.  It seems like the machine restarted before kextcache could finish updating, leading to the circle-slash icon upon boot. Unfortunately this is difficult to prove now that the machine has gone through a re-install. We’d really need a live reproduction that we can kernel debug.  Please update your bug report to let us know if this is still an issue for you, and provide any additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nNovember 15 2017, 12:56 AM\r\nI'm going to try to install macOS 10.13.2 Developer Beta 2, is there anything I should enable prior to updating the machine to help you identify the issue if the update would fail again?\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 16 2017, 4:42 PM\r\nThanks, we are working on the new information you provided. We appreciate your help!\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nNovember 16 2017, 5:15 PM\r\nI've installed macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 beta 3 (I suppose it's it, build number is 17C76a and on Italian MAS it appears as \"Aggiornamento macOS 10.13.2 Combo\" version 3) without issues, so I'm closing this ticket. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nNovember 16 2017, 5:15 PM\r\nThis issue has been verified by the developer as resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nDecember 18 2017, 11:41 AM\r\nI think I've found how to reproduce the issue. A couple of days ago I updated another iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) from macOS 10.13.1 to 10.13.2 using the downloadable 10.13.2 combo update and I got the aforementioned prohibitory symbol. Both Macs on which we got the problem (our lab iMac and this one) are FileVault encrypted and have been left unattended during the update. I think this is the culprit. During the first reboot of the update process there was no one to unlock the boot volume and let the installation proceed, so the iMac automatically shut itself down after a certain amount of time. I think this interrupts the installation so the next time the Mac is powered up it cannot complete booting and displays the prohibitory symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations\r\nJanuary 3 2018, 3:40 PM\r\nThank you for contacting us.  If this is still an issue for you on current releases, please file a new bug report."
