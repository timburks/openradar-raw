    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a single row of icons is showing in a folder or disk in icon view, the the window resize will put the icons ½ way off the top of the window's view region\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate folder\r\nEnsure it is in Icon View\r\nCreate 4 folders in the first folder, aligned horizontally\r\nDouble click the first folder's title bar to resize\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindow resizes based upon content boundaries, conserving all \"white space\" or dead areas of the folder on the right and on the bottom\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindow Resizes\r\nIcons are scrolled ½ way off the top of the window\r\n\r\nExpanding the window ever so slightly down using the mouse re-orients the icons\r\n\r\nSee video attached.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.1 (17B48)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB HD\r\n\r\nAdd Comment:\r\nNote in video, closing the folder also re-orientes the icons as does slightly resizing the folder.  \r\n\r\nAlso note that there is excess space left on the right side that is disproportionate to the space left at the bottom when resizing the window.   Also note that both white space areas left on the screen after the window is at it's Finder determined minimum size is disproportionate to the space remaining at the top and left."
