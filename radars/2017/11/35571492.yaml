    description: Throwing a NSError that has userInfo NSLocalizedDescriptionKey value longer than 240 characters, will crash the Xcode 9.1, if error propagation is disabled (try!). It happens with iOS and OSX projects, but not with Playgrounds. Since the crash log tells that this is a stack overflow and the same string will be displayed in the text editor if its shorter it should give a very good direction where to look.
