    description: "Summary:\r\nIn some situations my iPad seems to lose the connection to the keyboard. Two situations I noticed so far:\n\n- after ⌘↹'ing between apps,\n- when pulling down a iMessage notification to quickly reply\n\nWhen I disconnect the Smart Keyboard and re-attach it, it starts working again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open app with a text field \n- Activate text field so that you can type in there\n- ⌘↹ to a different app\n- ⌘↹ back to the original app\n- Try to type\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text field should automatically activate again and accept new inputs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI found no way to activate the keyboard without re-attaching it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm using an 10.5\" iPad with the Smart Keyboard with the US layout; iOS 11.1."
