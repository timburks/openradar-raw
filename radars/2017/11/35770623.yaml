    description: "Summary:\r\nIn share extensions built using iOS’s standard SLComposeServiceViewController (and containing the standard preview box), opening the share ext on some websites will cause enough memory consumption that the share extension will be killed by iOS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an article in the New York Times app (that’s one I’ve found to most predictably crash)\n2. Open a share extension of Nozbe, Google Keep, or other SLComposeServiceViewController-bsaed share extension\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preview box contains a snapshot of the website. The share extension memory usage is not more than 20-30MB (as it is when sharing literally anything else)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe share extension goes up to 70-80MB memory used, and in some cases, crashes after a few moments.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
