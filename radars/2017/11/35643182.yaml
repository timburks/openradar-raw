    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes UIDocumentBrowserViewController fails to load, leaving the app with a blank white screen. This seems to be a regression in iOS 11.2 b, at least I didnâ€™t notice it before. The console prints this error message:\n\n[DocumentManager] Failed to get the remote browser View Controller with error (Error Domain=NSExtensionErrorDomain Code=-1 \"Unable to initialize remote proxy for extension. The connection was interrupted.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Unable to initialize remote proxy for extension. The connection was interrupted.})\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart a UIDocumentBrowser-based app, for example PDF Viewer 2.1 or later (In beta current, see https://boarding-ios.pdfviewer.io/)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt always loads and displays the document browser\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it fails and displays a blank white screen (often enough on my iPhone 6S that it made me file this bug report)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.2b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther people report similar issues, for example see Radar #35587230. You can try this yourself via the public TestFlight beta of https://boarding-ios.pdfviewer.io . \n\nRadar Reviewer notes:\nThis can be reproduced with any sample project featuring the UIDocumentBrowser as well so I did not include yet another sample. If Apple has no internal sample, there are many open source samples available like https://github.com/amarron1/MyDocumentBased"
