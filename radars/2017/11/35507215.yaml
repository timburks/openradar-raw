    description: "Summary:\r\nS/MIME signing and encrypting seems to be incompatible with multiple From addresses. I can successfully sign and encrypt mails as long as there's only one From address defined in my mail account. As soon as I add another address, iOS Mail complains that it doesn't find a signing or encryption identity. Encryption is still possible in some weird cases but signing never works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an IMAP + SMTP Mail account with S/MIME signing. \n- Verify that signing and encryption works correctly. \n- Add a second From address to the account.\n- Reboot (just to be sure).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSigning and encryption should still work as long as the From address matching the cert is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSigning doesn't work (missing signing identity error), no matter what From address is selected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
