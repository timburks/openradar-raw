    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter selecting all the text in a UITextField, and then un-focusing it, you cannot re-focus the same field by tapping on the text unless selectedTextRange is programmatically set to nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(See sample project for a repro case)\n\n1. Create a new project with a single view controller. Add 2 text fields\n2. Hook up their editingDidBegin UIControlEvent to a function that calls selectAll(nil)\n3. Run the app, tap text field 1 to select it\n4. Tap text field 2\n5. Tap specifically the text of text field 1 again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText field 1 is focused, and the text is selected again\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText field 1 isn't selected, text field 2 remains selected. If you tap outside of the text, text field 1 is correctly selected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1 (15B93)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- You can workaround this issue by explicitly assigning selectedTextRange to nil when the editingDidEnd control event is called.\n- This happens regardless of whether or not the text is selected programmatically\n- See the attached project and video for an example"
