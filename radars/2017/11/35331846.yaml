    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 11 with opaque tab/navigation bars with `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars` set to `true` content of a scroll (table/collection) view is not properly inset to safe area. \r\n\r\nI include reproduction project, with screenshots showing proper behaviour on iOS 10, and incorrect on iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup tab and navigation bar with opaque bars\r\n2. In your view controller add its table view set constraints filling the view's safe area\r\n3. Set `extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars` to true, so that content goes below the bars when scrolling\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent scrolls below the bars but is inset accordingly so that user can see whole content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent has incorrect inset and e.g. table view's cell go below the tab bar.\r\nOn iOS 10 this works as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.0.1 (15A8401)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.0.1 (9A1004)"
