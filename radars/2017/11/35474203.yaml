    description: "Summary:\r\nmacOS 10.13 does not honor mobileconfig profiles using the new com.apple.screensaver PayloadType referenced at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010206-CH1-SW60\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-New install 10.13.1 (17B48)\n-Create new user manually named 'test' through SetupAssistant\n-SysPref (System Preferences) > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen Saver, change \"Start after:\" to 1 minute (from the default of 20)\n-Install com.apple.screensaver payload .mobileconfig for 10.13 devices which configures askForPassword key value to <true/>\n-Wait 1 minute so that screen saver engages\n-Wait 6 more min to ensure screen lock\n-Wake screen and confirm that password prompt is present\n-Unlock screen\n-SysPref > Profiles, uninstall profile\n-SysPref > Security & Privacy > General, use lock in corner to auth/unlock settings\n-Uncheck \"Require password\" and click \"Turn off screen lock\" in dialog\n-Close SysPref\n-Re-install com.apple.screensaver mobile config\n-Re-open SysPref > Security & Privacy > General and confirm that \"Require password\" is grayed out / not configurable\n-Close SysPref\n-Wait 1 min so screen saver engages\n-Wait 6 more min to ensure screen lock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be prompted for user password when moving mouse / trackpad / waking screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo password prompt, desktop is available. Computer is unsecured. We have no ability to remotely enforce the lock state of our devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.1 17B48\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDeleting the user's Local Items keychain while they're not logged in, causing them to generate a new one on login, appears to resolve the issue. This is not an acceptable workaround.\n\nSample minimal mobileconfig profile is attached.\n\nNumber of devices affected: 30,000+"
