    description: "Area:\r\nNetworking\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile downloading data over HTTPS using curl cause very high CPU utilization. This CPU utilization throttles download in local Gigabit Ethernet network. On macOS Sierra I was able to download data at speed around 100MB/s, but on macOS High Sierra I'm only able to reach 30MB/s. This issue doesn't exist when downloading over HTTP, or while using wget (both over HTTP and HTTPS).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload data over HTTPS in a local network or from the Internet, eg.\r\ncurl https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/downloads/xcode/simulators/com.apple.pkg.iPhoneSimulatorSDK11_0-11.0.1.1508875951.dmg\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nData should be downloaded at full speed. CPU utilization should be low.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVery high CPU utilization, around 100% for one core. The download is throttled to about 30MB/s.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra, 10.13.1 (17B48)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe issue is reproducible on all Mac with a fresh installation.\r\n\r\nI've attached two samples and Time Profiler trace for the curl application."
