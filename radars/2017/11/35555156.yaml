Rotate the device to landscape view.\r\n\r\n3. Rotate the device back to portrait view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter rotating  back to portrait view, the safe-area-inset-top should be 44px\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter rotating back to portrait view, the safe-area-inset-top is 0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nUIwebview iOS 11 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is fixed in WKWebView, possibly by this:,bug not fixed in UIWebViewã€‚"
