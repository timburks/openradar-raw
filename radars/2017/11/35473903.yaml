    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari Reader mode is offered for articles on theoutline.com, and displays the headline, subheading and even a pullquote correctly, but oddly hides some (yet not all) of the paragraphs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to an article such as https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters.\r\n2. Notice it has eight paragraphs of text. The first paragraph starts with \"Many social media sites\", and the last with \"Why does it matter\".\r\n3. Also notice that Safari offers Reader mode for this page.\r\n4. Enable Reader.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same paragraphs should show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the last three paragraphs show up.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n* I picked up this information from a tweet: https://twitter.com/0xabad1dea/status/928990012162629633\r\n* I have tried with another theoutline.com article, https://theoutline.com/post/2466/wonkette-the-blog-nobody-needs. The behavior here is similar. However, I cannot find any obvious reason in the markup that would cause this behavior."
