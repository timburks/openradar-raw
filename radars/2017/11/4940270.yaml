    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an un-enrolled Face ID device, biometryType reports as .typeFaceID. The same behavior is not the same with Touch ID. If Touch ID is un-enrolled the biometryType is .none making the developer think it is a device pre-Touch ID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a project where you check the LABiometryType of a device. Use a device that has Touch ID but not enrolled (no fingerprints). Run project and notice that biometryType is .none.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe biometryType should be .typeTouchID\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe biometryType is .none"
