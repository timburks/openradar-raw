    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you want to group 2 labels, each with a single line of text you can selected them and ‘embed in stack’. This will create a basic stack for these 2 labels. If you have a label with more than 1 line of text, embeding it within a stack view will throw interface builder into a fit. The stack views width will be set to be extraordinarily high (like 50,000), a warning will appear saying “interface builder does not support UIStackView sizes larger than 10,000 by 10,000”.\n\nYou can embed the label within a view and stack that however the stack view does not calculate it properly and it displays incorrectly at runtime.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-Create 2 labels in interface builder.\n-keep one named label.\n-In the second label enter some text (maybe a lore Epsom or simply 3-4 words of your choice.\n-Set the lines property of the label equal to 2 or more (from 1).\n-Resize the label so that the words drop down onto new lines.\n-Select both labels and embed them in a stack.\n-The bug occurs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 2 labels should be embedded in a stack view where properties can be set, and constraints/more stacks can be added.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe stackview/label width is set to an extreme value such as 50,000 and interface builder returns an error message in the debugger tool.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround I know of is to give the stack view a fixed width, this will create a warning in interface builder but at least the view will render at launch."
