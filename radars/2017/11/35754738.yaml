    description: "Often  Watch asks, \"Do you trust this computer?\"\r\nI do trust *this* computer in front of me, but what is *this* computer? Does it have a name? Does it have desires? How do I know it has my best interests in mind?\r\n\r\nBesides the problem that my watch has trust issues and asks this many times throughout any given month this has potential to be an UX security failure since the computer's name/identity is not mentioned."
