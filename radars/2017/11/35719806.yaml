    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: Setting the keyboard appearance of an UITextField to UIKeyboardAppearanceDark, then showing an UIPickerView as input view adds an extra layer which modifies the background color of the UIPickerView. This layer is added only if no other input view has been shown before.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Execute the attached sample project\r\n a) Tap on \"Activate Dark Keyboard\" button, then \"Next\" button. In the new View Controller, set focus on the text field.\r\n b) Restart the app. Set focus on the text field. Tap on \"Activate Dark Keyboard\" button, then \"Next\" button. In the new View Controller, set focus on the text field.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: In both a) and b) cases above, the UIPickerView should be shown with a blue background.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: In the a) case above, the UIPickerView is shown with a grey background. b) case is the expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11.1 (15B87)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Xcode Version 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: Attached you'll find two Xcode projects. BugTest is a simple test case for reproducing the bug. BugFix is the same project after applying a solution for the bug using a custom view to encapsulate the UIPickerView."
