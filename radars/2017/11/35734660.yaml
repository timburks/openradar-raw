    description: "(Please note this is not a bug report, but rather a request.)\r\n\r\nmacOS contains a security vulnerability wherein a user can authenticate as root by clicking “Unlock” a few times. The vulnerability was inadvisably reported on Twitter via this tweet: https://twitter.com/lemiorhan/status/935578694541770752 I won’t detail the obvious security implications, but it suffices to say that this is a serious problem.\r\n\r\nI request that Apple perform their retrospective in the open. I would like to see, publicly, a breakdown of how this bug was introduced, the code that was changed, the tests that weren’t written, the QA that wasn’t thorough enough, the product management practices that steered the team, the steps Apple is taking to make sure this doesn’t happen again.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Apple faces both a challenge and an opportunity: the company needs to regain the trust of its users, but can do so in a transparent way that helps our industry learn about security vulnerabilities while also helping us trust you again. Thank you for your consideration."
