    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, itâ€™s very confusing and takes a lot of steps to add a new line to a cell in a Numbers spreadsheet on iOS\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCurrently, you need to long press on a cell, open the context menu, go to second page of the menu (on iPhone), tap insert, tap insert new line\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nit should be much much easier.\n\nFor example, second keyboard page could have the return key. Or, there could be a key hovering above keyboard to go to next cell, while return would insert newline. Or, it would take two returns on a text cell to go to next cell. Or it could be configurable in Settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nlatest\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
