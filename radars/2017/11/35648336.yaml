    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a larger application that is written in Swift and has a preferences pane. After the migration to Xcode 9.1 and Swift 4 the preferences pane stopped working. I managed to reproduce the issue with a very small sample project. It is more or less the Xcode template for preferences panes with one class written in Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClone my repo https://github.com/klaas/QlaasSwiftPreferencesPane, build the sample preferences pane, install it and select it in System Preferences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preferences pane should show up. There should be no complain about non-Intel-compatibility.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error window is displayed: “Preferences Error - You can’t open QlaasSwiftPreferencesPane preferences pane because it doesn’t work on an Intel-based Mac.”. The pane does not open.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.2 (17C76a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same applies to screen savers written in Swift. See https://github.com/klaas/QlaasSwiftScreenSaver"
