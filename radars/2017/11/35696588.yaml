    description: "Summary:\r\nLooking at the ‘Recents’ tab in a UIDocumentBrowserViewController on an iPhone X shows a background gradient from white to gray and then the grey background suddenly stops resulting in a strange looking hard border that looks as if the content somehow only rendered half way and there should be something there.\n\nAlso all the other screen do not seem to have this grey background so it looks a bit out of place compared to the rest.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open an app that shows UIDocumentBrowserViewController\n- Go to recents\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFiles are displayed on a white background as in any other view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a gradient that abruptly ends at ~ 2/3 the screen size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
