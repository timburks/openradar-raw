    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary: Since upgrading to 10.13 I am experiencing frequent forced logouts, which appear to be due to WindowServer crashing.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDon't know.  It just happens, a lot when using this Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI shouldn't be suddenly logged out while using my Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am frequently and unexpectedly logged out when using my Mac.  When this happens the following things go wrong:\r\n1. Night Shift is off until I log in again.\r\n2. Upon login iTunes is unusable for 5 minutes as it verifies my library.\r\n3. All apps need to relaunch.\r\n4. Overall frustration.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: 10.13 (17A405)\r\n\r\nConfiguration: \r\n10.13 (17A405)\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)\r\n4 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nAMD Radeon R9 M395 2 GB\r\n\r\nI have included all of the crash logs."
