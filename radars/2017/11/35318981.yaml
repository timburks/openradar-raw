    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running tests via XCUITest on occasion, although fairly regularly, we receive an error from XCTest with the exception: 'NSInternalInconsisntencyException' and the message 'Activity cannot be used after its scope has completed'. This only seems to happen when running more than one test, and when in the `setUp` method of the test class we are launching the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun a UI test suite with a set of tests.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tests run and pass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app never finishes launching completely, so the test fails when trying to find the first element in the the test execution.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9, iPhone 8 simulator, but happens on other simulators as well."
