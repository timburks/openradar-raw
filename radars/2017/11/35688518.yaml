    description: "# Summary\r\n\r\nIn Xcode, unit-test targets cannot be created for the WatchOS platform. \r\n\r\n# Detail\r\n\r\nI've tried two ways to do this:\r\n1. Create a target, select WatchOS platform, then... no Unit Test template is available in the \"Choose a template\" dialog\r\n2. Create an *iOS* unit test target, then try to change its platform to WatchOS. The \"Target to be tested\" list view doesn't allow WatchOS targets to be selected\r\n\r\n# A workaround\r\n\r\nDevelopers get around this by creating an iOS framework which includes WatchOS source-code, then unit-testing that framework. This mostly works, but it's an extra target to maintain, and gets messy when there are API differences between WatchOS and iOS.\r\n\r\n# A plea\r\n\r\nApple loves code-quality and unit-testing as much as I do.\r\nWould you kindly consider allowing us to unit-test WatchOS targets?\r\nIt doesn't need to run tests on Watch hardware - I'd be happy to run a small test-suite on the Watch simulator."
