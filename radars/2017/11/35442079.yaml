    description: "On 10.13.2b1 Apple has introduced the idea of User Accepted MDM (UAMDM) enrollment profiles. These are different from enrollment profiles that have been installed via DEP while at Setup Assistant or via the DEP Nag (notification center) message. System administrators need a method to programmatically determine if a machine is in this UAMDM state.\r\n\r\nWith 10.13 Apple introduced the `profiles status -type enrollment` option which helps to determine if a machine is enrolled into MDM via a DEP method. With this new UAMDM option we need a third output message.\r\n\r\nCurrent output is:\r\nDEP - An enrollment profile is currently installed on this system\r\nNon-DEP - There is no enrollment profile installed on this system\r\n\r\nSuggested output:\r\nDEP - An enrollment profile is currently installed on this system\r\nNon-DEP - There is no enrollment profile installed on this system\r\nUAMDM - An enrollment profile is currently accepted on this system\r\n\r\nRealistically adding a verbose option that gives more details about the status of this enrollment profile would be extremely helpful. IE -\r\n\r\nMDM Profile installed: True\r\nDEP Enrolled: True\r\nUAMDM Profile accepted: True"
