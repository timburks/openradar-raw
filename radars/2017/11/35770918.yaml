    description: "Summary:\r\nIn any other place on iPad on iOS 11, it’s possible to D&D the app icon to drop it on the screen to open it in Split View or Slide Over with another app.\n\nIt should be possible to do the same thing from the ⌘Tab app switcher as it contains a number of previously opened apps — more than the dock’s right side\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press ⌘Tab on iPad, hold ⌘\n2. Press and hold one of the icons in the switcher\n3. Drop the icon on the side of the screen to open the previous app in Split View with the full screen app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe above is possible and the app opens in split view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnothing happens\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
