    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Music app, there’s a way to mark an entire playlist as available for offline use. When new songs are added on another device, Music will keep downloading the missing songs, so that the playlist is continuously kept available for offline use.\n\n—> The same thing ouhgt to be possible with iCloud Drive\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Long-press on a file or folder in the Files app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be possible to not just download the file/folder *NOW*, but also to mark it as available offline, such that if I change or add new files to a folder I specifically care about (e.g. folder with travel documents) on a different device, iOS will download those new files whenever it has a chance\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere’s no such option\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDropbox has it!"
