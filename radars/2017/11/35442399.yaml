    description: "In 10.13. Apple is introducing the idea of User Accepted MDM (UAMDM) enrollment.  Certain management functions can only be performed via a User Accepted MDM, and the management functions that require UAMDM is expected to grow over time.\r\n\r\nLarge organizations need a tool or API to determine if the machines they manage are enrolled in a User Approved MDM so they can take corrective follow-up action if they are not.\r\n\r\nThis tool should accurately report the current effective MDM enrollment state:\r\n\r\n1) Not enrolled in MDM\r\n2) MDM enrolled, but not User Approved\r\n3) User Approved MDM enrolled.\r\n\r\nThis last state should also be reported if a machine was enrolled in MDM before it was upgraded to 10.13.2 -- since Apple has indicated that such machines will be \"grandfathered\" in as UAMDM enrolled."
