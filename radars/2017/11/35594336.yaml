    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\n\nPlease consider the attached project. It contains two targets: a macOS app (“test”) and a macOS command line program (“cmdline”). The test app depends on the cmdline program.\n\nI build the project from the command line, then try to export a Developer ID signed app. Here’s my command line:\n\n    rm -rf build && xcodebuild -jobs 8 -scheme test -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build -archivePath build/test-1.xcarchive archive && xcodebuild -exportArchive -exportOptionsPlist options.plist -archivePath build/test-1.xcarchive -exportPath build\n\nThe exportArchive command fails with this error:\n\n    error: exportArchive: exportOptionsPlist error for key 'method': expected one of {}, but found developer-id\n\n    Error Domain=IDEFoundationErrorDomain Code=1 \"exportOptionsPlist error for key 'method': expected one of {}, but found developer-id\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=exportOptionsPlist error for key 'method': expected one of {}, but found developer-id}\n\nBut the problem is **not** my method setting. The problem is the file build/test-1.xcarchive/Products/usr/local/bin/cmdline.\n\nI can prevent the earlier archive command from creating this file by setting SKIP_INSTALL = NO for the cmdline target. If I do that, then the exportArchive command succeeds.\n\nPlease change the xcodebuild -exportArchive command to describe what part of the archive is preventing the export.\n\nThanks,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do that stuff I described above.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA helpful error message.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn unhelpful error message.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 (16G29) / Xcode 9.2 beta (9C34b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found some guidance in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2215/_index.html but the note doesn’t mention setting Skip Install for command-line targets, only for static libraries.  It would be great to update the note to also mention command-line targets, and then the exportArchive command could link to the note in its error message."
