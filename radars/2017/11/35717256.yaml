    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nGiven a UICollectionView that makes use of self-sizing cells, when items are inserted or removed, the cells resize to and render (!) at the estimated size before rendering at the correct size, causing flickers onscreen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a UICollectionView whose cells use Auto Layout and that override preferredLayoutAttributesFitting. Set an estimatedItemSize on the UICollectionViewFlowLayout, e.g. layout.estimatedItemSize = CGSize(width: 100, 1).\r\n\r\nInsert or delete (or both) items into the UICollectionView, e.g.\r\n\r\ncollectionView.performBatchUpdates({\r\n    self.collectionView.insertItems(at: indexPaths)\r\n}, completion: nil)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen inserting/deleting items, the cells maintain their size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCells reset to their estimated size before expanding back to their actual size, causing a loss of contentOffset and weird scrolling artefacts.\r\n\r\nExtra info:\r\nEven if I set CATransaction.setDisableActions(true) before the batch update, there is still a split second during which the cells are rendered at their estimatedSize, meaning there's a flicker on screen. This means there's no way to use self-sizing cells if insertion/deletion is required/desired.\r\n\r\nAttached you can find a demo project.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1.2"
