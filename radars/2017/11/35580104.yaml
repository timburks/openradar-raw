    description: "Area:\r\nCore Bluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCBCentralManager reports its state as \"powered off\" despite all other user-facing indications that it's powered on (iOS Settings → Bluetooth is enabled, and Control Center → Bluetooth icon is blue).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run the \"CentralStateBug\" app in the attached project on a hardware device. The app initializes a CBCentralManager instance with a delegate. The delegate implements centralManagerDidUpdateState(_:) which updates a label with a description of the current central state. Verify that it updates the label when bluetooth is toggled.\r\n2. Terminate the app.\r\n3. Open Control Center.\r\n4. Disable Bluetooth connections from Control Center.\r\n5. Enable Airplane mode from Control Center.\r\n6. Disable Airplaine mode from Control Center. Bluetooth connections are automatically re-enabled (or at least that's what the UI indicates).\r\n7. Dismiss Control Center.\r\n8. Launch the \"CentralStateBug\" app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe CBCentralManager state should be .poweredOn.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe CBCentralManager state is .poweredOff.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2 (15C5107a)\r\niOS 11.1.1 (15B150)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone SE iOS 11.2 (15C5107a)\r\niPhone X iOS 11.1.1 (15B150)\r\n\r\nThis issue has also been described in the dev forums:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/91664"
