    description: "There was a radar for this open in 2001, believe it or not, so it has been an issue for a very long time. I don't have the old radar number, because radars are private... or they were back then anyhow.\r\nMacOS should provide a global keyboard shortcut to open a context menu.\r\nOn Windows, it's Shift+F10. It would be optimal if the same shortcut was used, because many apps implemented it themselves, and that's the shortcut they mostly used.\r\nBack in 2008, I was told that the philosophy is that all commands should be accessible by other menus or shortcuts, so there's \"no need\" for a keyboard shortcut for context menu.\r\nIf that's the case, then, why is there a context menu available to mouse (right click) and trackpad (two-finger tap) users?\r\nAt best, this missing keyboard shortcut is annoying for power keyboard users - particularly those who have grown used to having a context menu at their fingertips in Windows apps.\r\nAt worst, this missing shortcut is discriminating against those who must use a keyboard or other discrete input device to operate a computer.\r\nIf you search the web, you will find that many people have asked for this. Some have installed keyboard-mapping software just to get around this problem.\r\nSo now I would like to reopen this issue for serious consideration."
