    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe transition of the tab bar is not correct on iPhone X when popping a view controller that have hidesBottomBarWhenPushed set to true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn a UITabBarController, pop from a view controller that have hidesBottomBarWhenPushed set to true on iPhone X.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe transition looks as on other iPhones, e.g. iPhone 7. That is, the tab bar follows the view controller the navigation controller is popping to - and as a result, the tab bar is behind the view controller that is being popped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe tab bar appears instantly on top of both the view controller the navigation controller is popping to and popping from.\r\n\r\nSee attached GIFs for comparison between the iPhone 7 and iPhone X simulators. Also see the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 9.2 beta (9C34b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
