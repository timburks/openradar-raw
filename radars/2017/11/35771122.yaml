    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UI for displaying keyboard shortcuts by long-pressing ⌘ key is nice when the app has 10 keyboard shortcuts or less.\n\nHowever, it is totally inadequate in the world of iPad Pro and serious productivity apps for iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open, say, the Nozbe app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The app, being a serious productivity apps has ALL the keyboard shortcuts the Mac counterpart does (it does!)\n2. The list of keyboard shortcuts is easy to understand — grouped in columns or otherwise presented such that a new power user can quickly grasp all the capabilities\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNope, the pane, while useful, is a mess. You need two pages of shortcuts to see ‘em all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPS. I’ve posted A TON of other iPad bugs&enhancement requests — check them out. Also don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you want to see how serious iPad users work like and what are their needs."
