    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, once you open an app in Slide Over, it will stay in split view until you open a different app in split view.\n\nWhen that is the case, there’s no reasonable way to open the app from Dock or ⌘Tab switcher *in full screen*\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open app A, and open app B in slide over.\n2. Slide away app B\n3. Forget about app B, go to some other app C\n4. Tap on the app B icon on Dock or by ⌘Tabbing into it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. There’s an indication on the Dock/Cmd+Tab that the app is currently in the Slide Over mode, and will not open in Full Screen\n2. After it opens in Slide over, I have an easy way to “remove” it from Slide Over and open it in full screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTo make the app forget the split view mode, I have:\n\n- either open some other app in slide over\n- or I have to slide down on the handle to put it in split view (wait a moment), then pull on the handle to put it in full screen. If I already have something else in split view, I will break my app arrangement, and have to get back to the previous main app, and D&D the secondary app to get back to my split view arrangement.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPS. I’ve posted A TON of other iPad bugs&enhancement requests — check them out. Also don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you want to see how serious iPad users work like and what are their needs."
