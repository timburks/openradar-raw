    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's preference to trim trailing white space fails frequently. Our CI system blocks source with trailing white space, and this is common practice in the industry, so this has cost the whole Apple development community a lot of time. This bug has been in Xcode since the feature's introduction, and has been reported frequently. Every other programmer's editor I have used gets this feature right.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure \"Automatically trim trailing white space fails most of the time\" and \"Including white space only lines\" are checked on.\r\n2. Add a white space to the end of any comment line\r\n3. Save\r\n4. Open file in BBEdit, turn on Show Invisibles\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo white space at the end of the edited line\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhite space at end of line.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode Version 8.3.2 (8E2002)\r\n10.12.4 (16E195)"
