    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI use CMake very often so it is often that I have Xcode opened with a project that I regenerate from CMake. It is very often that Xcode 9 crashes. Xcode generates crash report automatically but I thought I could open this report to provide a background for this crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have a CMake-based project\r\n- Generate Xcode target using CMake once\r\n- Open Xcode with a generated .xcodeproj\r\n- Generate Xcode target using CMake once again\r\n- Xcode crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode does not crash. Instead it has some smarter strategy to detect the project contents change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.0 (9A235)"
