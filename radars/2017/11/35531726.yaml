    description: "I have bought a lot of movies through iTunes. Apple TV does a terrible job of sorting movies from a series in order of release.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to:\r\n- Group movies together into a folder, similar to grouping apps in iOS\r\n- Be able to sort a folder in chronological order of movie release, instead of alphabetically\r\n\r\nYou could potentially try to do this automatically by movie series, but the flexibility of folders would let a user organize their collection however they wanted. (i.e. Maybe all Pixar movies in a folder, maybe all horror movies in a folder, etc.)\r\n\r\nAs it is, the Godfather trilogy sorts as:\r\nThe Godfather Part II\r\nThe Godfather Part III\r\nThe Godfather\r\n\r\nThe Harry Potter series sorts in this order:\r\n#2, #7 Part 2, #7 Part 1, #4, #6, #5, #3, #1\r\n\r\nThe James Bond collection is strewn throughout my movie collection, alphabetically. I would much rather have them all grouped together into a 'folder' that is one entry in the main movies menu, and then I might want to watch them chronologically, instead of alphabetically."
