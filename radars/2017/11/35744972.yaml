    description: "Summary:\r\nFacebookâ€™s FBSnapshotTestCase is a really excellent tool for testing iOS applications. https://github.com/facebookarchive/ios-snapshot-test-case. It works by recording a snapshot of a view, and then on subsequent runs comparing this recorded snapshot with a new snapshot of the view, and comparing the two images for any differences. This catches a lot of visual regression bugs, makes it easy to test views with different input parameters such as device language. It also provides a fast debug-test cycle because the library does a simple memcmp on the two images which means the tests run incredibly quickly. For a good set of examples check out the Kickstarter iOS repository https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss/tree/master/Screenshots/_64.\n\nFacebook has now deprecated the library, and a first party solution would be AMAZING. It would also allow better tooling to be built such as diff comparison built into Xcode. This idea was explored by Orta for Xcode 7 here https://github.com/orta/Snapshots\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n See description\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n See description\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9\r\n\r\nNotes:"
