    description: "Summary:\r\nThe current line of MacBookPro have a cursor block, with the left/right arrow keys individually having the same size as both up/down arrow keys combined, giving terrible (because no) haptic feedback to a user detecting which key is under his finger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse current MacBookPro and try (without looking at the keyboard) to enter long text and navigate through the text by using the cursor keys only.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMoving to the cursor keys without looking at it, the user moves his hand to the lower right keyboard area and can easily sense which keys are for up/down and left/right.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently it's way too hard to distinguish these important keys by touching them only. It takes additional time or the need to look at the keys to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMBP 2016+\r\n\r\nNotes:"
