    description: On the iPhones with 3D Touch capabilities (excluding the iPhone X), you can perform a 3D Touch on the left edge of the screen to launch the application switcher. You cannot do this, however, on the iPhone X. Rather, the only way to launch the app switcher is to swipe up and hold the application card in the center. If this feature were to be added to the iPhone X, it would remove the delay that is there when presenting the app switcher, and launching it would be only doing one step, instead of two (in other words, it would save time).
