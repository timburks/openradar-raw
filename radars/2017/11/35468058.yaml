    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using a UINavigationController/Bar with prefersLargeTitles enabled and a UITableView the bar is when the view is loaded by default on iOS 11.2. This was not the case on earlier versions (iOS 11.0.1 and iOS 11.1)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a viewController with a UITableView pinned to the superview\r\n2. Set your navigationController to prefersLargeTitles\r\n3. Set your viewController to .never for showsLargeTitles in IB\r\n4. Set your viewController to .always for showsLargeTitles in viewDidLoad (another bug for another day)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nLarge title would be displayed when the view appears as happened on previous builds of iOS 11.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLarge title is hidden until the UITableView or UIScrollView is scrolled up.\r\n\r\nScreenshot demonstrating this behaviour on iOS 11.0.1 and iOS 11.2 on iPhone X simulator attached.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2 (15C5092b)"
