    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nI have a set of photos that show out of chronological order in the Moments and Collections views in Photos for iOS. I ask that you please fix the code that groups photos into Moments to always show photos in chronological order as its first priority, and group them into Moments after that. (The chronology problems with the Collections view are more extensive, and I will not detail them here. But they are much worse and more extensive than the problems with Moments.)\r\n\r\nHere is how I created the problematic set of photos:\r\n1. I took several photos within a few minutes of each other (5:43 to 5:46 PM) at location A.\r\n2. I took another photo a little later (6:10 PM) at location B.\r\n3. I took more photos even later (6:56 to 7:04 PM) after having returned to location A.\r\n\r\nThe result is that all the photos from location A got grouped into one Moment. The single photo at location B shows up as a separate Moment. This makes it appear to have occurred later than all the photos in the first moment, which is not correct. See attached screenshot of these photos, which has been marked up to correspond to the numbers above (IMG_2795.png). For comparison, I have also attached a screenshot from Photos.app on macOS, in which the same photos (synced via iCloud Photo Library) appear in the correct chronological order and are grouped into one moment (Screen Shot 2017-11-02 at 9.31.30 AM.png)."
