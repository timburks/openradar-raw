    description: "Apple ID of the User: \r\n\r\nApple ID of the App:\r\n\r\nIn WWDC 2017, Apple announced auto-renewable subscription will provide server-to-server notification to developers' server to inform user's subscription status updates.\r\n\r\nTo setup is described in https://help.apple.com/itunes-connect/developer/#/dev0067a330b.\r\n\r\nHowever there is only ONE subscription URL for each app. If developer's server-side team needs to deploy a new version to development/test environment, it will just affect production environment since it's the same URL.\r\n\r\nIn my company, we use [production] as Production domain, and [uat] as UAT domain. If we point iTunes Connect to [production], then we can't test IAP on UAT. If we point iTunes Connect to [uat], it will just affect current App Store users.\r\n\r\nUse only one URL for both Production and sandbox make developer's server-side team hard to develop and test new integrations, since the same URL need to support dev/test and production environment.\r\n\r\nWe would like to suggest Apple to provide a separated URL setting for auto-renewable subscription notification for sandbox, alongside with current production URL."
