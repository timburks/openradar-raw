    description: "Summary:\r\nOpen https://web-preview.pspdfkit.com/standalone/1 and observe Safari Technology Preview crashing,\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Website. Wait. Observe repeated crash until you see A problem repeatedly occurred with <br> “https://web-preview.pspdfkit.com/standalone/1”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWebsite should render, WASM loads, PDF is rendered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash. I cannot figure out how to get a crash report for crashed tabs. There’s nothing in Console app and I can’t see any Apple documentation what to do specially. (https://webkit.org/getting-a-crash-log/ seems outdated, there’s no file in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter and there’s no Report Crash button)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRelease 43 (Safari 11.1, WebKit 13605.1.12)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWASM run works with ~latest few Safari (stable, including iOS 11 Mobile Safari), Mobile|Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Older browsers work as well, we fall back to asm.js so even IE 11 is happy :)\n\nWe had quite a few WASM crashes with Safari, mostly on iOS but also on macOS. Your team is always super responsive, thanks a lot! (Especially on the cascade of crashes we hit at WWDC with the ARM64 WASM compiler backend :) Would love to somehow add our renderer to your internal test suite, since it’s one of the first really large commercial WASM SDKs, and powers many companies/websites already. (peter@pspdfkit.com if you want to discuss this in more detail)\n\nhttps://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/webassembly-a-new-hope/\n(Heads up: The blog post embeds our renderer, so it crashes as well :)"
