    description: "In our Assistant application we want to let our clients \"connect\" their local calendar with our backend features.\r\n\r\nFor this we upload events to our backend and use participants' emails to attach tasks and decisions to them. Since email addresses are not available in public API, we have to either\r\n1. Parse URLs like `mailto:<email>` and extract emails from them or\r\n2. Parse description and extract email from a string\r\n\r\nWhile option 1 is more or less reliable, the URLs are not always presented in that format, they can also be a string like `/aMTM3NDA5MDM5MTEzNzQwOcsjhE2HGOLuDavSz3op5ZxdCkorMnPxQvMRdSC5JBw7/principal/`.\r\n\r\nMaking email addresses available in public API would help up make the app much more convenient and reliable for our clients. And since they explicitly allow the app to read their calendar, I believe, they should be expecting us to have access to the participants' emails.\r\n\r\nAnother use-case where participants' emails are useful for us is described in radar #35611572."
