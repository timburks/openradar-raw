    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApp Review is not reviewing any IAPs that I submit along with my app binary when releasing an update. I receive the attached message every time (\"Please upload a new binary for review and resubmit your in-app purchases with the binary so that we can continue the review.\"). There is no UI to \"attach\" the IAPs to the binary, so I simply edit the IAPs until they are in a \"Waiting for Review\" state, and then submit the binary as well. After review, the IAPs are returned and are not reviewed, and I receive the review notes attached. This is the 5th or 6th time this has occurred. Also see rdar://35212039.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add new IAPs.\r\n2. Edit IAPs until they are \"Waiting for Review\".\r\n3. Upload new app binary.\r\n4. Look for a way to \"attach\" IAPs to binary (does not appear in iTC, so skip).\r\n5. Submit binary.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIAPs are reviewed with binary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIAPs are not reviewed, and the attached message is received in iTunes Connect."
