    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn the iOS 11 SDK, the `textFieldDidBeginEditing` delegate method seems to perform inconsistently, which can cause UI components to become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nIn Time Profiler, `didBecomeFirstResponder` can take up a disproportionately large amount of CPU time causing apps to become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThe attached project has a UITextFieldDelegate calling `textField.selectAll` within `textFieldDidBeginEditing`. There may be similar inconsistent behaviour when calling other methods within `textFieldDidBeginEditing`, but `selectAll` seems to demonstrate this most clearly and consistently. \r\n\r\nThe project has two UITextField components for ease of demonstration â€” the same issue would be seen with just one UITextField component, and a UIButton to call `resignFirstResponder`. The issue will still occur if selection actions are disabled with `canPerformActions`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run project (Simulator or Device).\r\n2. Alternate taps between two UITextField components - Text A and Text B.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn every tap, the full text of each component is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. On the first (and every odd) tap of a text field, all text is selected, as expected.\r\n2. On the second (and every even) tap of that text field, all text is selected briefly, before being deselected.\r\n3. About 1 in 5 taps, selection will completely fail as the text field has become temporarily unresponsive.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 SDK\r\nConfirmed on iOS 9.3 - iOS 11.1 using Simulator\r\nConfirmed on iOS 11.0 - iOS 11.2 Beta 1 using iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.1, 9.2 Beta 1"
