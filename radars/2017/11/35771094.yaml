    description: "Summary:\r\nThere’s a way in which the list of keyboard shortcuts gets broken and won’t appear\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app, say Messages, in Slide Over, over a full screen app A\n2. Go to app B\n3. Long-press ⌘ (keyboard shortcuts will appear)\n4. Use ⌘Tab to open Messages (it will appear in Slide Over)\n5. Use the top handle to swipe away Messages. (App B is now full screen again)\n6. Long-press ⌘\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKbd shortcuts appear again\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey don’t, until I exit the app and come back again\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’m pretty sure those aren’t the only reproduction steps for this. The ⌘ kbd shortcut list AND the ⌘Tab switcher break ALL THE TIME.\n\nPS. I’ve posted A TON of other iPad bugs&enhancement requests — check them out. Also don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you want to see how serious iPad users work like and what are their needs."
