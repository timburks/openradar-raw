    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating a screen saver with Swift in macOS High Sierra, the screen saver displays the message:\r\n\r\n> You cannot use the ColorClockSaver screen saver with this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is because screen savers are NSBundle-style plugins. Each plugin links to its own Swift runtime which causes the screen saver to not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In High Sierra, create a new screen saver in Xcode from the template. Alternatively, download the source for a screen saver here: https://github.com/edwardloveall/colorclocksaver/\r\n2. Change the main view to a swift file, and set it as the Principal class in the info.plist.\r\n3. Build the screensaver plugin and install it in ~/Library/Screen Savers\r\n4. Open the screen saver preference pane in System Preferences and select the new screen saver\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe newly created screen saver displays.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis message appears:\r\nYou cannot use the ColorClockSaver screen saver with this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nI am running macOS 10.13.1 (17B48). This screen saver was most recently compiled with Xcode Version 9.1 (9B55).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with 16 GB of ram"
