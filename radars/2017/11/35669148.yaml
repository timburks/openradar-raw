    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is sometimes seen when looking at changes in the XML source view of large storyboard files, e.g. when reviewing changes before them checking in. The Version Editor may highlight a line where no changes are visible. The line that should have been highlighted appears one or two lines above the highlighted one.\r\n\r\nSee enclosed screen shot where the change is visible two lines above the highlight (height 44 -> 48).\r\n\r\nWhen multiple lines have been changed, then this effect is not seen on all lines. Highlighting may be correct for earlier changes, but incorrect for changes further down in the file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot easily reproducible, sorry. It is not clear under which condition this problem arises. Presumably, this is seen more in very large storyboard files, rather than small ones.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe highlight should be on the line that contains the change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe highlight is on a later line, typically two lines down from the changed line.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.1 (9B55)\r\nmacOS 10.13.1 (17B48)"
