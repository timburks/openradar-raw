    description: iOS 11.1 brought 70 new emojis, which is great but the keyboard is barely useable anymore when trying to find the emoji you're looking for. This makes it really hard to find the new emojis in the first place. I would suggest adding a search field to the keyboard in the way third party keyboards have done it already allowing you to search for the official Unicode emoji descriptions.
