    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen looking at an iCloud Drive folder in a UIDocumentBrowserViewController, there is information about the number of files in a folder and the available space on iCloud, however this line of text is hidden initially even though there are only a few files and this info could be displayed right away.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open an iCloud folder with only a handful of files in UIDocumentBrowserViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file info is visible as there is enough empty space at the end of the item list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou need to scroll down even though the scroll view doesnâ€™t looks like its scrollable at all (because it can easily fit all of its content) to see the space information.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
