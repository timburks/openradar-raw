It isn't always a consistent bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCarPlay view respects sort order chosen for songs list on iPhone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCarPlay view resets to sorting by Artist in the songs list\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2 Beta 2 (15C5097d)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X Silver 256GB Verizon"
