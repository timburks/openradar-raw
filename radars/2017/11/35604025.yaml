    description: "Summary: NSSets containing NSObjects which (in terms of their implementation of isEqual) are identical do not always evaluate isEqualToSet: as true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached trivial project on an iOS simulator in Xcode 9.1; observe the console output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrom the sets as built, one would expect equality to be determined as true every time through the loop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe determination of equality is inconsistent. It varies per run and fails an enormous majority of the time."
