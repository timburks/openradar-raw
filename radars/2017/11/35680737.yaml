    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom various sources on the internet one can figure out that an NS(Mutable)Array is anything but a usual array. It offers a lot of awesome features, especially when it comes to time complexity. Sadly though, this is completely undocumented. For example in many cases apparently adding or removing items from the front of an NSMutableArray take O(1) time instead of the usual O(n) of an array. This is an awesome feature and makes actual queues / linked lists obsolete for many use cases. Therefore this behavior should be documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
