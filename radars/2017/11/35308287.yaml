    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have multiple local versions of Xcode, and then use `open -a Xcode Foo.xcodeproj`, which copy of Xcode the project is opened in doesn't seem clear. This often opens a different version of Xcode, even if I already have one open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download a previous version of Xcode\n2. Download the current Mac App Store version of Xcode\n3. Wait until both Xcode.apps show up in your `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -dump`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`open` prefers the Xcode that's already open\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it opens a different version\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nResetting lsregister fixes it for a bit, but once the other version is indexed, the problem happens again."
