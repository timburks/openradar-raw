    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter adding an iOS app in iTunes Connect through the \"My App\" > \"+\" > \"New App\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGiven: I have no previous app in my app list\nAnd: I am an \"Admin\" role in iTunes Connect\nWhen: I add an app through the web interface\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should see this app in the app list in the web interface\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see a blank list in the web interface\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2nd Nov 2017\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I try again to add an app, I see that the web interface does not ask me for a Company name and does not give me the option to use the same app identifier as before. this leads me to believe the app has effectively been added *somewhere*, but it doesn't show up in the web interface.\n\nResolution: Submitting a build through Xcode Version 9.1 (9B55) made the app appear in the list after a few minutes."
