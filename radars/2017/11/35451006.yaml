    description: "I have an app which implements a custom video player using GLKView.\r\n\r\nI would like to take advantage of the new AVDisplayManager APIs in tvOS 11.2 to automatically switch the output framerate to match the video content.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are no public APIs available to create an AVDisplayCriteria given a framerate. The only way to retrieve an AVDisplayCriteria object is via AVAsset. However, I am not using AVPlayer so I don't have an AVAsset.\r\n\r\nPlease expose a public API to retrieve an AVDisplayCriteria for a given framerate and dynamic range.\r\n\r\n(For my purposes, I would only need access to two predefined AVDisplayCritera objects: 60hz/SDR and 50hz/SDR)"
