    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSee movie\r\nTo enter a new email address I copy the text from a tweet and edit this in the To: field. I do this all the time on platforms which don’t recognise email addresses.\r\nIt took me several flabbergasted tries before I recognised is as a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\npaste a blob of text in the To: field of a new email message, the email address is optional\r\nput your cursor somewhere in the middle and start pressing backspace.\r\nJust before deleting the last character, watch closely.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the text **after** the cursor to remain when I press BACKspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll text is deleted.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10”"
