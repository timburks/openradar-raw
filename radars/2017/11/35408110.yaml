    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you set a setting in an xcconfig where you scope the setting by a configuration (even if that is config=*), the resolved settings don't show the value, but the levels do.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Add an xcconfig and assign it to a configuration\n3. Add a setting like `FOO[config=*] = bar`\n4. Look at the Build Settings tab for the configuration you added it to\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should see the setting `bar` in the resolved settings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see nothing in the resolved settings, but if you look at the levels, you see the actual setting, and if you run the project the setting does apply.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached project and screenshots for an example."
