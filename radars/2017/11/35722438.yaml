    description: "Summary:\r\n/usr/bin/sfltool in previous versions of the OS offered a greater feature set than what is currently available in 10.13, specifically the ability to use sfltool to add custom bookmarks to a user's Connect to Server dialog via a script/CLI.\r\n\r\nWhen provisioning users without resulting to hacks such as editing the User Template, it is beneficial to be able to able to make changes such as this via script. Without these options, customization options are limited, to the detriment of the user experience. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAt the CLI, enter this command, replacing the generic values:\r\n/usr/bin/sfltool add-item -n \"Server Name” com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteServers \"//path/to/server\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn previous versions of the OS, the command would add a bookmark to the logged in user's Connect to Server (Finder > Go Menu > Connect to Server) dialog. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnder 10.13 (including 10.13.2 beta build 17C79a), the command is not run and the system returns the following usage error: “Usage: sfltool archive|list-info|list [options]”. The features present in older releases have been removed in 10.13.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.2 17C79a"
