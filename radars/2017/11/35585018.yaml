    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter nuking DerivedData, launching Xcode, waiting for indexing to finish and building my project; SourceKit begins to crash constantly. It appears to only happen when editing saving files while or after building.\r\n\r\nThe problem started with Xcode 9 and was also observed in 9.0.1 and 9.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clear derived data\r\n2. Wait for indexing to finish (optional?)\r\n3. Build the project\r\n4. Edit normally\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA functioning IDE\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEditor functionality limited\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are crash reports and Xcode's log obtained using: `SOURCEKIT_LOGGING=3 /Applications/Xcode-9.1.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode &> xcode.log`. The logging was started after clearing DerivedData. I waited for indexing to finish and then started a build. I stopped Xcode immediately after the first crash."
