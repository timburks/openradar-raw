    description: The App Store’s app version history page uses relative dates to indicate how long ago an update was released. In the case of months, it displays “2m”, which to many people would be interpreted as “2 minutes”. This creates confusion and, at least to me, initially seemed like a math error with the relative date logic. To remove this confusion, please consider changing it to an unambiguous abbreviation such as “mon”, or the full word “months”, or even just an absolute date when the time is greater than a month.
