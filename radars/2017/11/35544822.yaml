    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 11.1, when using an instance of MPMusicPlayerController, it sometimes won't call the completionHandler sent to prepareToPlayWithCompletionHandler: or set isPreparedToPlay to YES.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to affect one instance of MPMusicPlayerController more than the others. This has been reproduced using systemMusicPlayer, applicationMusicPlayer, and applicationQueuePlayer.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, calling [player play] produces unstable results. Sometimes it plays. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it plays an unexpected song, typically the last played song.\r\n\r\nThe sysdiagnose is attached. The issue was reproduced between 15:32 and 15:33.\r\n\r\nI've also attached a sample app that can reproduce this. When tapping the play button, it doesn't always play.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get an instance of MPMusicPlayerController (e.g., systemMusicPlayer)\r\n2. Queue a song ([player setQueueWithStoreIDs:@[@\"295757262\"]];)\r\n3. Prepare to play it ([player prepareToPlayWithCompletionHandler:block];)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nisPreparedToPlay == YES after a short period and the given completionHandler is called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nisPreparedToPlay == NO indefinitely and the given completionHandler is not called.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1 and 11.1.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X, iPhone 6 Plus"
