    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are implementing Single Sign On in our Mobile app and using SFAuthenticationSession to do the OAuth workflow. This is the main way that users will authenticate to the app.\n\nEvery single time we use the API, it shows the alert that says \"'App Name' Wants to Use 'domain.com' to Sign In\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse SFAuthenticationSession API.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert that says \"'App Name' Wants to Use 'domain.com' to Sign In\" will only be shown the FIRST time you use this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \"'App Name' Wants to Use 'domain.com' to Sign In\"  alert that says \"'App Name' Wants to Use 'domain.com' to Sign In\" is shown every single time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a very cumbersome user experience for apps that want to delegate their authentication to SSO providers. Maybe it could use some sort of cookie that lasts for a long time. Maybe it could be a toggle in the app preferences."
