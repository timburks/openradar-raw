    description: "Area:\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSince iOS11, cable based headsets sometimes generate spurious remote control events, without any button actually pressed on the remote. Happens with Apple and third party headsets likewise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect headset to iPhone, check remote control operation (works ok in the beginning), start listening podcast via Apple Podcasts app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReliable operation of the headset remote, and certainly no false button presses detected (even in case the CTL/Mic line on the TRRS had bad contact, which is not the case in my tests)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter ~5min average, podcast suddenly pauses/skips or activates Siri without any headset button touched. When this happens, actual button presses are not recognized any more by the iPhone.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting/reconnecting headset does not reset behaviour to normal.\r\nKilling and restarting the Podcasts app sometimes (not always) helps.\r\nSometimes, the only cure is give up listening and wait. After a while (minutes, hours, hard to say), the condition always recovers, without restarting the iPhone. Restarting the iPhone also recovers the situation, but only momentary - when starting a podcast again, often after ~5min the spurios headset events start happening again.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.0.2 and iOS11.1 likewise, iPhone 5S\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs an electrical engineer myself, my impression is that there is some adaptive measuring circuitry/algorithm phone-side for detecting the impedance changes caused by button presses. This mechanism's threshold seems to drift off, probably related to changes in power management - it seems the problem only starts after the iPhone was in sleep (dark screen) for some minutes (but is not recovered by waking the phone, see above)"
