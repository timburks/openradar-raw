    description: "In our Assistant application we want to let our clients \"connect\" their local calendar with our backend features.\r\n\r\nTo keep privacy on a high level we need some way to verify that person's calendar is coming from the same email which was used to register an account on our backend.\r\n\r\nThat's where making the emailAddress of EKSource (or EKCalendar) would be very handy.\r\n\r\nRight now we have to do the following:\r\nGo through events in the calendar, find event participants who have isCurrentUser == true and try to extract their email, either from url or from their description.\r\nThe downsides of such approach are:\r\n1. Email address is not always available in url and parsing description is unreliable.\r\n2. If calendar doesn't have any events right now, or all events are without attendees, then we aren't able to let clients sync this calendar."
