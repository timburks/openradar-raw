    description: "Summary:\r\nWith 10.13.2 beta my beloved magic mouse gestures, which were enabled by the app „BetterTouchTool“, no longer work. I heard there is a new entitlement com.apple.hid.multitouch.user-access which is not a available to mac app developers (yet?). Please make it, or something similar, available so we can have custom gestures back, or point to a way of alternatively implementing it. I absolutely loved the features provided by BetterTouchTool.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall BetterTouchTool, activate custom magic mouse gestures, example: two finger swipe up/down for app expose.\r\nUpdate to macOS 10.13.2 beta 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMagic Mouse Gestures (for example: two finger swipe up/down) should still work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMagic Mouse customizations are not working any more\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Beta (17C67b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated radar by the developer: 35334701\r\nRelated issue https://github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool/issues/1693"
