    description: "## Summary:\r\n\r\nOption \"Touch Bar shows: *App Controls with Control Strip*\" is set in\r\n`Preferences → Keyboard`.\r\n\r\nWhen the user invokes the system-wide shortcut to save a screenshot of a\r\nselected area to a file (default: `shift-cmd-4`), then additional screenshot\r\ncontrols are displayed on the Touch Bar. These settings are persisted and used\r\nas presets for the next invocation. This effectively overrides the default\r\nbehavior of the system-wide screenshot shortcuts.\r\n\r\nParticularly confusing when an option other than \"Touch Bar shows: *App\r\nControls with Control Strip*\" is selected (*Expanded Control Strip* or\r\n*App Controls*). Then the screenshot controls in the Touch Bar won't display at\r\nall, but the last-used settings are still in effect, without any feedback to the\r\nuser.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the user chose to copy the screenshot to the clipboard instead\r\nof saving to a file, then all the system-wide screenshot shortcuts will copy to\r\nclipboard---even for those shortcuts that should explicitly save to file (e.g.\r\n`shift-cmd-4`). Same applies to other screenshot settings selected on the Touch Bar.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In the terminal to set the screenshot storage location to the Desktop:\r\n        > defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop\r\n        > killall SystemUIServer\r\n\r\n2. Disable applications managing screenshots, such as Dropbox\r\n\r\n3. Restore defaults in `Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Screen Shots` and enable all shortcuts\r\n\r\n4. Press `shift-cmd-4` to invoke the \"Save picture of selected area as a file\" shortcut and take a screenshot of any part of the screen\r\n\r\n5. Verify that the screenshot was saved on the Desktop\r\n\r\n6. Select \"Touch Bar shows: *App Controls with Control Strip*\"\r\n\r\n7. Press `shift-cmd-4` to invoke the \"Save picture of selected area as a file\" shortcut (do not select an area of the screen yet)\r\n\r\n8. Select \"Selected Portion\" and \"Save to *Clipboard*\" in the screenshot controls on the Touch Bar\r\n\r\n9. Take a screenshot of any part of the screen\r\n\r\n10. Verify that the screenshot was indeed copied to the clipboard by pasting in a Rich Text document in TextEdit\r\n\r\n11. Select \"Touch Bar shows: *Expanded Control Strip*\"\r\n\r\n12. Now press `shift-cmd-4` to invoke the \"Save picture of selected area as a file\" shortcut, verify that there is no feedback on the Touch Bar and take a screenshot of any part of the screen\r\n\r\n13. Verify that no screenshot file was saved on the Desktop\r\n\r\n14. Verify that the screenshot was copied to the clipboard by pasting in a Rich Text document in TextEdit\r\n\r\n## Expected Results:\r\n\r\nLast screenshot should be saved to the Desktop (same as first shortcut). No options presented to the user hence default behavior applies.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results:\r\n\r\nLast screenshot was copied to the clipboard (as set in the Touch Bar\r\nscreenshot controls for the previous screenshot).\r\n\r\n## Version/Build:\r\n\r\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\n- macOS Sierra 10.12.6\r\n    - latest update for Sierra as of time of this writing (2017-11-07)"
