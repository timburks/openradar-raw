    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you set a class on a view in Interface Builder, and then delete the class, Interface Builder prints a log about the class missing, but there's no more aggressive way to surface this error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Add a view in IB\n3. Set that view to class Foo\n4. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's some way to stop on a custom breakpoint (similar to unsatisfiable constraints), or the app crashes because the class is missing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`Unknown class Foo in Interface Builder file.` is printed to the console, and the app continues to run (unless there are outlets missing, in which case it crashes).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
