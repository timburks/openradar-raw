    description: Methods [addConstraint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622523-addconstraint), [addConstraints](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622513-addconstraints), [removeConstraint](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622659-removeconstraint), and [removeConstraints](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622593-removeconstraints) all suggest calling instead the release `activate` methods if you are targeting iOS 8 or later. But the problem is these method are not marked as deprecated and many developers are actively using these methods targeting those later iOS versions. Apple has a history of keeping deprecated API's long after the initial deprecation specified and if these methods are needed to be preserved longer they can do the same.
