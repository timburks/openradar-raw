    description: "There is a lengthy thread stretching back to 2011 mentioning forgotten encrypted iPhone Backup passwords. I believe that part of the issue is that these passwords are stored for potentially long periods of time, causing users to forget which password they used. The password is not used frequently and is easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nBecause iCloud backups are now the primary form of backup for many iOS users, most Encrypted iPhone Backups through iTunes are likely to be manually performed prior to switching devices. It would be preferable to verify that the user remembers their encrypted password prior to creating the backup to ensure that users don't return to restore to their new device to discover they don't know what their password is."
