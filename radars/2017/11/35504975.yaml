    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf I have a view controller where prefersStatusBarHidden returns true and that view controller presents a Safari View Controller, that Safari View Controller will have a status bar as expected. If I dismiss that Safari View Controller by tapping \"Done\", the status bar will disappear as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I start to dismiss the Safari View Controller by swiping it to the right and then I abort that dismissal, the status bar will get into an odd state. I attached a sample project and a video demonstrating this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample project on an iPhone X.\r\n2. Tap \"Safari View Controller\".\r\n3. Start to dismiss the Safari View Controller by swiping it to the right, but then abort that dismissal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSince the Safari View Controller is still visible, I expect the status bar to be present and in its normal state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe status bar area looks very strange. See the attached video.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.1.1 (15B150)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nRun on an iPhone X (device)."
