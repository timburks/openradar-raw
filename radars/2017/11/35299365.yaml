    description: "Summary:\r\nUIImageViews rendered offscreen or not yet added to a window (or something else, I'm not really sure) aren't properly tinted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInitialize a UIImageView with a template image. Tint the UIImageView with a color that isn't black. Add it to a view then take a snapshot of the UIImageView and use that image in another (non-tinted) UIImageView. The 1st UIImageView will appear properly tinted while the 2nd one (the snapshot of the first before it was rendered on the screen) will be much darker.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth UIImageViews should look the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe one that was snapshotted before being drawn on the screen is much darker. This is the behaviour observed on iOS 11.1 and iOS 10.3\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.2 (15C5092b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached a sample project that shows the issue when ran in iOS 11.1 and  differently in iOS 11.1 and 11.2. And a screenshot where we can see an iOS 10.3 simulator without the issue and an iOS 11.2 simulator with the issue."
