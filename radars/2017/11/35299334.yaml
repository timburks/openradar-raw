    description: "When I'm building a deck, I have certain styles I like to adhere to. For example, a \"Title + Bullets\" slide will always build in the individual bullets one-by-one as separate clicks, with a 0.5 second animation.\r\n\r\nSadly, there is no way to specify this on Master slides. By default, when I add the \"Dissolve\" build-in animation, it defaults to \"all at once\" over 1 second. This means that I have to change every. single. textbox. to be my preferred animation style.\r\n\r\nIt would be FAR better if I could just go edit the master slide, specify the default animation, and have it \"just work\". (existing slides would get it if I Reapply Master to Slide/Selection)"
