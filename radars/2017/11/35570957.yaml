    description: "Summary:\r\napplicationMusicPlayer and applicationQueuePlayer can't be controlled from the Music app and are only accessible from the host app, not even in Control Center. However, when the app is closed either by the user, crash, or stopping it in Xcode, the song will continue playing. This creates a scenario where the user is unable to stop playback.\r\n\r\nAttached is the sysdiagnose. This was reproduced at 4:01 pm CST.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get an instance of MPMusicPlayerController.applicationMusicPlayer or .applicationQueuePlayer\r\n2. Queue and prepare to play a song (e.g., [player setQueueWithStoreIDs:@[@\"295757262\"]])\r\n3. [player play]\r\n4. Force close the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMusic stops\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMusic continues playing and the user cannot stop playback unless\r\n1. The song plays until the end\r\n2. The user plays a different song somewhere else\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1.1, 11.2 beta 3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone X"
