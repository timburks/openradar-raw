    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserVC allows to specify additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItems and additionalTrailingNavigationBarButtonItems, which show up in the UI. However, their accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint isn’t honored but they are simply read as “Button” by Voice Over, which is a serious Usability Problem for Voice Over Users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIDocumentBrowserViewController-based app\n2. Create a UIBarButtonItem and set its accessibilityLabel + hint\n3. set the item as an additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItem\n4. Enable Voice Over + Run the App\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoice Over reads out the accessibilityLabel/Hint of the items\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoice Over simply reads out “Button”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1/2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a related Bug Report (rdar://32922733) which describes that UIAccessibilityCustomActions don’t work on items in UIDocumentBrowserViewController"
