    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCustom UIPresentationController's containerView frame is not recalculated after hiding in-call status bar, if it had been toggled before modal controller was presented. And no UIPresentationController's methods are called to make it manually. This issue is reproduced only if turn on in-call status bar before presentation. Turning in-call status bar on/off while controller has already be present doesn't cause any issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create custom UIPresentationController\r\n2. Before presenting turn on in-call status bar\r\n3. Present some controller with custom UIPresentationController\r\n4. Turn off in-call status bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPresented controller takes all screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPresented  controller has 20px top offset.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.0, Xcode 9.0.1 (but also earlier version)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn a situation when I toggle in-call status bar while controller has already be present containerView's frame is changed properly (it has (0; 0) coordinates before turning on in-call and (0; 20) after). But if turning on it before presentation containerView's frame has (0; 20), but is not recalculated after."
