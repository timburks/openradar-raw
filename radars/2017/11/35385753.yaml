My Friend's locations are not shown in the Today view in Notification Centre.\r\n\r\nWhen you first add Find My Friends to Notification Centre it briefly shows the \"Sign in to iCloud\" button even though I am logged in. After that it changes to show \"Learn more about FMF\".\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nNothing special."
