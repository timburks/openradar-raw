    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder iOS 11, the device keeps sending the same battery level for each device information query. The level returned to the MDM server is the level at the time of MDM enrolment, not the current device battery level.\r\nThis is quite misleading, since our MDM solution allows to check the battery level via MDM information, so it may fail to alert for e.g. low-battery conditions in classroom environments with shared iPads, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- enrol device with MDM server\r\n- check battery level in MDM server data (or capture reply to DeviceInformation query requested by server)\r\n- charge or discharge device until a different battery percentage is reached\r\n- query DeviceInformation again via MDM\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReply sent by device for DeviceInformation request should contain the new, current battery level (\"BatteryLevel\" value)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReply sent by device for DeviceInformation request still contains the same battery level that was in the first DeviceInformation request after device enrolment.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVerified on the following two devices / OS versions\r\niPhone 8 running iOS 11.1.2 (15B202)\r\niPad Pro running iOS 11.0.2 (15A421)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCould not reproduce on iPad mini running iOS 10, so we assume this is an iOS 11 issue."
