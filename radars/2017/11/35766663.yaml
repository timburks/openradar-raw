    description: "Summary:\r\n(This radar is meant to be viewed in combination with rdar://35766611)\n\nThe Done button within the iOS 11 screenshot editor always offering an option to delete — as opposed to dismissing the modal right away or offering a delete option on long pressing — acknowledges that these screenshots are often transient and not needed for long term storage beyond the initial share.\n\nThis radar proposes some improvements to reduce friction for this use case of needing screenshots only transiently.\n\nCurrently, one must either expand the overlay, press Done, and then Delete from within that, or find it within Photos and delete it from there (and the deleted photos folder, albeit optionally).\n\nThe automatic copy feature mentioned in the aforementioned radar can be used to intelligently decide whether a screenshot is saved or not.\n\nIf the image on the clipboard is pasted within n minutes (say, 3), the image can automatically be deleted from Photos. Alternatively, this can be thought of the other way around: The image is not saved to Photos at all by default. However, if the user fails to paste it within the timeout or accesses the photo picker manually within the same duration, it is saved.\n\nAs this is an opinionated feature and can confuse users used to the current behaviour or who expect shared screenshots to still be stored long term, it could be implemented as an opt-in feature buried within Settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
