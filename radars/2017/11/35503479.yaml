    description: "Summary:\r\nMKMapView often causes VoiceOver to repeatedly says \"Places visible: zero\" even when there are visible places. When it happens \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce this in a demo project. Without access to MKMapView's accessibility source code it's hard to pin-point exactly what causes this.\r\n\r\nIt happens in Transit ( https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/transit-bus-train-times/id498151501?mt=8 ), especially when turning on VoiceOver in a route’s map view (tap on a bus route in the home screen, then select the map pin icon).\r\n\r\nI’ve also seen it happen in a free app called “Walkmeter” ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/walkmeter-walking-hiking-gps/id330594424?mt=8 ). Has been reported in a comment on this page ( https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-braille-ios-news/accessibility-bugs-ios-11-blind-and-low-vision-users-serious-minor?page=1 ). I can’t link to a comment so here’s the full relevant paragraph:\r\n“Apart from the nightmare with the siri voices, the only significant bug I've encountered is with my walkmeter app; not sure if the issue is specific to walkmeter or if it's a voiceover bug, but basicly, what's happening is that while the app is open, VO continually says \"no places visible\" I tried disabling automatic text detection, but it had absolutely no effect. So, for now, I have to 3 finger doubletap to turn off speech while I'm doing my treadmill walk, and then, when I'm done, I have to turn speech back on and try to find the stop and done buttons while constantly being interrupted by the \"0 places visible\" message. I'd love to do a screen recording of this bug, but I don't know if I would need to send it to apple or walkmeter.”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should only list the “Places visible” at predictable moments and should actually list them correctly all the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, VoiceOver will begin repeatedly saying “Places visible: zero” and it prevents the user from using the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
