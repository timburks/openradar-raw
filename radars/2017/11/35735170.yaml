    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe bug only happens on IOS 11, with Keyboard settings \"Predictive\" OFF.\r\nOur app (Snapchat) puts a virtual \"caption bar\" on top of system's keyboard. A controller listens to UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification event, and whenever it's fired the controller changes caption bar's y coordinate.\r\n\r\nHowever, when switching to emoji keyboard the event may not fire.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On IOS 11, System Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Predictive, turn OFF\r\n2. Tap caption bar to bring out keyboard, long press to switch to emoji keyboard. UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification does not fire even though keyboard heigh changed. Note that however if I \"tap\" to switch keyboard, it sometimes works."
