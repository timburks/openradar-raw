    description: "Summary:\r\niPhoneX and FaceID are awesome but double tapping the side-switch to confirm an App Store purchase is weird, counter-intuitive and a flow breaker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- iPhoneX with FaceID set up\n- select a non-free AP in the APP Store\n- tap on buy\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- a solid, call-to-action UIButton _in_ the appearing sheet should appear to ask for confirmation\n- once tapped it could morph to the faceID animation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- overlay appears to double tap the side button asking for confirmation\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
