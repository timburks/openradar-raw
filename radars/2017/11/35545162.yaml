    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #28633131\n\nSummary:\nAs it stands today, Configuration Profiles, which are the primary means by which MDMs manage clients, do not cover enough settings for many large organizations (Facebook, Google, etc)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Try to manage SSH settings\n2. Can't be done with profiles.\n\nExpected Results:\nAll major services on macOS should be manageable via Profiles or some other means.\n\nActual Results:\nCannot manage a large number of settings.\n\nNotes:\nHere are a list of settings that cannot be managed fully/at all using Configuration Profiles today:\n\n\n- Manage common settings via MDM\n  - ntpd (“Set date and time automatically”)\n    - Allowing multiple time servers to be set for shops where there’s a requirement to use an internal NTP server which isn’t accessible outside the network.\n  - Enforce SSHD enabled/disabled (called “Remote login” in System Preferences)\n  - SSH configuration (e.g. disable password auth / enforce key based auth)\n  - Associating SSH keys with users (for password-less SSH) (see also:  Kerberos auth to SSH hosts)\n  - Forwarding logs to one or more central syslog servers\n  - sudoers (lol)\n  - /etc/hosts\n  - pathsd\n  - Non-plist configuration files (e.g. conf files) Examples: Cisco AnyConnect, git, hg, arc, java ruleset, Splunk, Firefox, etc.\n  - PAM modules\n  - Security Certificate preferences\n  - Identity Preferences\n  - User Accounts (local users/passwords)\n  - pf/firewall\n  - pf logging\n  - file sharing, both Server.app & regular in sys prefs (AFP / SMB / FTP)\n  - Bluetooth settings\n  - Network locations, and all network settings (not just 802.1x / wifi payloads…)\n  - System certificates (adding via profile already work) - removal / revocation, CRL / OCSP, changing root CA trusts\n  - Printers - adding works via profile (barely), but doesn’t remove when profile is removed; lpoptions aren’t enforced (either permanently or set-once)\n    - Printer presets - particularly when critical information like network accounting is stored within the preset prefs data\n  - Default audio input/output interface selection for classroom/auditorium/kiosk use\n  - CUPS in general\n  - Location Services (on / off / privacy controls)\n  - TCC db (on / off / who gets what, access…)\n  - pmset / power management / scheduled reboots, authrestarts, etc.\n  - spotlight - adding / removing privacy entries, configuring / enabling\n  - User account creation? CreateUserPkg?\n  - Secure update process for passwords of specified local account(s).\n  - Hostnames / ComputerName / LocalHostName? (scutil?)\n  - SAML/SSO integration with DEP boot/MDM enrollment\n  - Maximum screensaver idle time (i.e., “No more than 15 minutes”, and not “exactly 5” or exactly “10”)\n  - Anything Apple hasn’t thought of yet that we can currently handle with the tools we have available today\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
