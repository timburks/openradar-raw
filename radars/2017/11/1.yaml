    description: 'We have uploaded multiple builds with On Demand Resources Enabled to App Store. After App Store processing, the build is showing On Demand Resource: Yes | 0 Asset Packs. This blocks users from downloading content packs for the app. The issue has only manifested itself since Nov 3, 2017 at 7:50AM. WE suspect the issue is on the App Store, rather than on our end, given that, after close inspection of the delivered achieve, all On Demand Resources assets are included along with the app binaries (.app). The ipa uploaded sums to 4.7GB. App Store Validation passes, and is successfully submits. The issue occurs after App Store completes its processing. Please check if this issue is in fact on App Store end.'
