    description: "Summary:\r\nOn macOS we have a long, successful history of tools analysing (and blocking) network traffic for various security, privacy and bandwidth optimisation purposes in mind. Given Apples focus on these areas and its strong standpoint against other players (like Google and Facebook), it should extend beyond the content blocker feature for Safari and give tools access to Network (Kernel) Extensions in iOS as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNowadays for a lot of APPs extensive tracking is considered the default with every action the user performs being recorded. Tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Firebase etc. are installed right from the start without the user having any knowledge about it.\nSo the steps to reproduce this feature:\n- get hired by an APP service agency\n- join any meeting about a new customer asking for the implementation of his APP idea\n- play buzzword-bingo on feature requirements, UI/UX flows, backend/SaaS criterias etc. up until to a point where someone (maybe you) asks: \"what about tracking?\"\n- to heat up the discussion, add \"should we add a register wall?\"\n- now write down everything what's broken on APP privacy\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTools/extensions sitting on top of N(K)E could analyse, show, log and block traffic going in and out of iOS core network layer and let the extension expose and configure its behaviour.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(impossible)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
