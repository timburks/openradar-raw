    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #35571322\n\nWhen attempting to use mdmclient dep nag, we have discovered that if a user has doNotDisturb turned on, they will never receive a dep nag.\r\n\r\nGiven that this will be a critical method to get devices properly enrolled in MDM for 10.13.2, this should corrected.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assign a DEP profile to a machine (10.11, 10.12, 10.13)\r\n2. Turn on doNotDisturb\r\n3. run /usr/libexec/mdmclient dep nag\r\n4. No nag\r\n5. Turn off doNotDisturb\r\n6. re-run /usr/libexec/mdmclient dep nag\r\n7. nag\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should receive a dep nag.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser does not receive a dep nag.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested on 10.12.6 and 10.13.1\r\n\r\nThis impacts 2,000 devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.X\r\n\r\nNotes:"
