    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNavigating to a view controller from a push triggered by a UIBarButtonItem and then returning to the original view causes the UIBarButtonItem to appear greyed out and inactive, despite being tappable and enabled.\r\n\r\nSample project available here: https://github.com/brendanlensink/barbutton\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample project and run on an iOS 11.2 device.\r\n2. Press the button labelled 'Left' in the top left.\r\n3. Press the back button to return to the main view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe 'Left' UIBarButtonItem should appear the same as the right button, in its active state with a blue tint.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe button appears faded.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nPressing down on the button and dragging seems to restore the correct color.\r\nThe same behaviour happens with the right UIBarButtonItem as well.\r\nThe issue seems to be with the underlying UIButtonLabel, where the alpha is not correctly reset to 1."
