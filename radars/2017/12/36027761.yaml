    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen adding a rightCalloutAccessoryView with a UIButton, the button does not respond to taps when another MKAnnotationView is on the map behind the button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on the iOS 11.2 simulator.\r\nTap on one of the pins in the lower right corner of pins to show the callout bubble where the info button is located in front of any of the other pins.\r\nAttempt to tap on the info button it and see that nothing happens.\r\nTap on one of of the pins on the right side of the block of pins to show the callout bubble where the info button is located with no pins behind it (only the map should be behind it).\r\nTap the info button and see the alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the button would work even if there are pins behind the button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button only works when there are no pins behind the button.  This works fine in iOS 10.3\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/danielbarela/ios-map-callout-test"
