    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nSmart punctuation in iOS 11 allows user input into text fields to change from simple glyphs to region-specific glyphs. This change occurs without passing through the text field delegate method shouldChangeCharactersIn. That delegate method is notified about the change to add a simple character and then the change to a region-specific character occurs without another call. Text field delegates should have access to these smart punctuation changes so that they can implement proper bookkeeping and validation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a text field with smart punctuation enabled\r\n2. Set a delegate on the text field with an implementation for shouldChangeCharactersInRange\r\n3. Set a breakpoint in the shouldChangeCharactersInRange or print the unicode scalars for the string changes\r\n4. Register an observer for the notification UITextFieldTextDidChange\r\n5. Set a breakpoint in the method that responds to that notification or print the unicode scalars for the contents of the text field\r\n6. Run and type a single quote into the text field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are two possible expectations. Either shouldChangeCharactersInRange is called after the smart punctuation replacement occurs (it sees only the region-specific character) and one notification is sent for UITextFieldTextDidChange. Or shouldChangeCharactersInRange is called again after smart punctuation replacement occurs (it sees both simple and region-specific changes) and two notifications are sent for UITextFieldTextDidChange.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nshouldChangeCharactersInRange is called once and includes the single quote for simple punctuation, unicode scalar value 39. Only one notification is sent for UITextFieldTextDidChange at which point the text field contains a curved single quote, unicode scalar value 8216.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nBase SDK iOS 11.1"
