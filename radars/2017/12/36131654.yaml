    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApp will crash when zooming in/out clustering annotations on the map. This is a *different* issue from previous 34653598 or 35381219 on iOS 11.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download my sample project from https://github.com/Nandalu/Housing\r\n\r\n2. Run this project on either simulator or device. Please zoom in the map to Taiwan, an island country in East Asia near China. Data points should appear.\r\n\r\n3. Pinch to zoom in and out fast a few times. Then you'll eventually get a \"Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS\" crash.\r\n\r\nThis is possibly because clustering may crash when mapView is adding new annotations at the same time.\r\n\r\nException backtrace\r\non Xcode: https://i.imgur.com/4uY0Atp.png\r\non Organizer: https://i.imgur.com/hgOCbtc.png\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\niOS 11.2.1 (15C153)\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations (January 6 2018, 1:02 AM)\r\nA solution is under investigation. We will follow up with you again when it is available.\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations (January 26 2018, 2:32 AM)\r\nWe believe this issue is resolved in the latest iOS 11.3 beta.  Please test with the latest iOS beta. If you still have issues, please update your bug report with any relevant logs or information that could help us investigate."
