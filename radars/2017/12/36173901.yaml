    description: "Summary:\r\nI just opened PDF Viewer, it auto-restored the hierarchy, so the UIDocumentBrowserViewController wasn’t displayed (we present our controller on top right at startup time) and on going back I get the layout as in attached image. We do this since we shipped the first version with document browser support, so shouldn’t be anything new.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis does work most of the time but sometimes gets into this weird state. pdfviewer.io\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDon’t place UI into the notch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUI in the notch. Even worse, once you tap the search bar you have to force-quit the app, as you can’t tap Cancel anymore. I tapped Recent and Browse a few times and then the extension just crashed, giving me the white screen of app death.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI realize that this bug report won’t be very useful but I am unable to offer a reproducible sample for all the various issues we’re seeing with UIDocumentBrowserViewController. This one is just here to point a finger at “there are problems in the safe inset area”. If I am able to find a reproducible pattern, I’ll follow up."
