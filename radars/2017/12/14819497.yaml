    description: "Summary: On a 64GB iPhone with a large photo library (60GB) in iCloud Photos, with \"Optimize iPhone Storage Enabled\" taking a photo with a good wifi connection then proceeding to edit / share it almost always requires waiting for the photo to be downloaded from iCloud storage, as between taking the photo and editing/sharing, it's been evicted from local storage, despite there being ~10 gigabytes of free storage on the phone. \r\n\r\nThis can be infuriating when you take some photos, then get on a plane for example (hence my marking this as a Usability bug) \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTake a photo, wander into another room sit down to edit, and then wait for the photo to be downloaded from cloud storage. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTake a photo, and be able to edit it for hours after taking it, even if the wifi was excellent at the time of taking the photo. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPhotos are evicted from the phone almost as soon as they're taken, with no attention payed to the idea that recent photos are likely the most desirable to keep on the phone.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2 (15C114) \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 6s, 64GB."
