    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\nIn my workspace I have my app and a framework referenced by it. Xcode asks me to update the framework, which has a clean git status.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message shouldn’t come for Framework if the App has uncommited changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message is shown even though (I think) it shouldn’t."
