    description: "Apple ID of the User: felix@sunapps.net\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA few weeks ago, the iTunes Connect login API endpoints on https://idmsa.apple.com/appleauth/auth/signin added a new rate limit. This is great, however it also counts successful attempts, resulting in issues if you login multiple times within a minute for one account on one IP address. This causes issues for larger companies that have a single IP address, and a shared Apple ID. The error message when running into the rate limit is also not clear, as it doesn't indicate the actual error reason\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Login on iTunes Connect multiple times within a short amount of time using the same Apple ID and IP address\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Since the login attempts are done with valid username + passwords, you shouldn't be locked out of your account, even if you login many times within a short amount of time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Your account gets locked, and only gets unlocked after a given time, or by logging in from a separate IP address\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
