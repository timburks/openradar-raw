    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #35462422\n\nInstalling a configuration profile to enforce com.apple.screensaver has no effect if the user already unchecked the Require Password setting.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start with a brand new Mac with macOS 10.13.1/clean install\r\n2) As a user, open the Security tab of System Preferences and uncheck \"Require Password\".\r\n\r\n3) Install the attached configuration profile to enforce com.apple.screensaver with the key \r\n```\r\n\t\t\t askForPassword \r\n\t\t\t \r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested this step using the following methods\r\na) manual install as a user\r\nb) with MDM as a device level profile\r\nc) using the sudo profiles -IF /path/to/profile.mobileconfig\r\n\r\nall methods are able to reproduce the issue if the user has changed the setting manually before the profile was installed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the profile to be installed and for the Require Password checkbox to be green. I also expect the user to be prompted for a password after the screen saver comes up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe profile is installed. The enforced policy appears to be ineffective as the user is never prompted for the password. Before a reboot, a user is able to click/unclick the Require Password checkbox even though the profile exists. \r\nRebooting does not cause the preference to take effect, but it grays out the checkbox as unchecked (attached screenshot)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.1/17B48\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:"
