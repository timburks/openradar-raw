    description: "Summary:\r\n- Code coverage data is not shown any longer in Xcodes. I even tried to do this with an older project I am 300% sure was generating Code coverage data previously, and even on the server testing. But there is still no data displayed both for new and old projects. https://www.dropbox.com/s/eartkm20kzzq49r/Screenshot%202017-12-06%2009.19.02.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Enable code coverage data generation, try to test the app and you will not get any coverage data displayed. The odd thing is that when using Xcode bot to test you don't see code coverage data as well, bu the bot does report if code coverage was better/worse since last integration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Code coverage is shown nicely\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Code coverage is not shown. Dimmed label only says \"No Coverage Data\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- Xcode 9.2 Release, Xcode 9 Release\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHigh Sierra 10.13.2 (17C85a)\r\nCode Coverage is enabled for gathering in Test scheme"
