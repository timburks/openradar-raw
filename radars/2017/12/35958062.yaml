    description: "I'm the author of iTerm2. I have received an unusually large number of reports from my users that certain NSUserDefaults keys get reset to their defaults. Affected users experience only a particular key's value getting reset, while other keys remain unaffected. All reports come from users on macOS 10.13. \r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce this myself, but I have users who can reproduce it on demand. Based on logging I added to my app, I can see that I'm not changing the value myself. \r\n\r\nThe attached sysdiagnose is from an affected user whose PromptOnQuit key in com.googlecode.iterm2 was reset. The issue report by the user who produced this sysdiagnose is here:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/6310#note_49853982\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a user default\r\n2. Relaunch app some number of times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser defaults unchanged\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser default is lost\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
