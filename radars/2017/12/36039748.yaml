    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the user visits an HTTPs website, many browsers already show a warning when any of the assets on the website are downloaded via unencrypted HTTP (see Mixed Content docs https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content)\r\n\r\nHowever this doesn't apply to file downloads on either Google Chrome, nor Safari.\r\n\r\nThis is a big problem, as anyone in the same network can easily do a man-in-the-middle attack to read & replace the content of the file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Visit an HTTPs encrypted website, notice the green SSL badge next the URL\r\n- The user feels safe and thinks everything on this website is encrypted\r\n- Click a download button for any kind of file, linking to an unencrypted HTTP URL\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe browser shows a warning or ideally an error that the download this website tries to trigger is unsafe.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe download works just fine, giving no indication to the user that it happened over unencrypted HTTP.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
