    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen starting showing a route with public transport (transit) Maps zooms out really far. This means very little detail is shown so I have to zoom in manually all the time to work out what the route is and this is really annoying.\n\nIâ€™ve attached a screen recording showing how it zooms out when getting public transport directions and when changing routes, then I manually zoom in to a more appropriate scale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet directions by public transport in Maps\nTap other route options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould zoom just enough to show the entire route\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nZooms out really far. Here in Singapore it zooms out to nearly show the whole country!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not a problem for driving and walking directions, which zoom out only just enough to show the route."
