    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a tap and a half gesture is performed on an empty, non-editable UITextView, the insertion point is shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached sample project shows this. Run it and perform the tap and a half gesture somewhere in the white area (tap then immediately touch again at the same point but don’t lift).\n\nThe steps done by the sample project:\n\nPut a UITextView on screen\neditable must be NO\ntext/attributedText must be nil\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the text view is not editable, it should not show the insertion point.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe insertion point appears in the text view and starts blinking.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2, iOS 11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe keyboard does not appear, so that’s good. It’s just the insertion point.\n\nYou may ask why I would have this useless text view. It’s in a collection view cell and this one item happens to have no text.\n\nWorkaround: disable userInteractionEnabled when the text view is empty."
