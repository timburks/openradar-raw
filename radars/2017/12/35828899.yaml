    description: "Area:\r\nCalendar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen you tap today and view a list of events, and there are none for the current month, even though the back button has the current month's name, when you tap it, it instead takes you back to an earlier month where it finds events.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Create a calendar with events a couple months ago.\r\n* In month view, tap the current date.\r\n* In the event list that comes up, see that there are no events today, and the only ones visible are from a couple months ago. Note that the back button correctly has the current month name\r\n* Tap the current month name back button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould see the current month view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* The month view that loads will not be the current month, but the earlier month with events.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOs 11.1.1."
