    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nper\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts/cncontactstore/1402849-enumeratecontacts\r\n\r\nContactStore.enumerateContacts(with:usingBlock:) should (and has up until 11.2) enumerated *all* system contacts, unless there is an error.\r\n\r\nSome of our users report, and their logs corroborate that sometimes ContactStore.enumerateContacts only enumerates a subset of their contacts, yet no error is thrown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCall `ContactStore.enumerateContacts` at various points in the app lifecycle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nenumerateContacts should either enumerate all contacts, or when it cannot, it should throw an error as documented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSometimes enumerateContacts only enumerates a subset of contacts before returning.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nThis is a new issue, only reported by iOS11.2 users. I have not been able to reproduce it locally, and our users only see it intermittently."
