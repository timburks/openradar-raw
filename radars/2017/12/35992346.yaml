    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nIncorrect/inconsistent NSDateFormatter/DateFormatter behaviour on iOS11 - formatters with current user locale does not provide date/currency formatting  according to user defined Regional settings in Settings.app.\r\nOn iOS 10 current user locale was user preffered language+region, on iOS11 it is app language+region. \r\nEven apps that are not localized for the user preffered language (most of apps and even Apple itself does dot localize for small languages like Latvian) should respect user selected region settings for date/currency formatting promised in the Settings.app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Simulator or device with iOS11, launch Settings.app and n the General-Langaue&Region section set Preffered language - Latvie≈°u (Latvian) and Region - Latvia (see promised date, currency formatting in the attached screenshot)\r\n2) Run attached project tests on simulator/device\r\nFor comparision run project on iOS10 with the same language/region settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDate and Number formatters with currentLocale should respect promised Regional settings set by user in the Settings.app (even is app itself is not localized for Latvian language - this is case with all small languages that does not get localizations from most apps).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDate formatter uses American date seperator \"/\" instead or Latvian date seperator \".\", returns English date strings.\r\nCurrency formatting style does not respect correct position for currency sign.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS11 SDK, IOS 11.2 (15C114)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\n\r\nattached\r\nbug-regional-formatters.zip, 37 KB\r\nscreenshot-regional-settings.jpeg, 243.1 KB"
