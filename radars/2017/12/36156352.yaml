    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #36155056\n\nWhen long pressing on a file in the Files app or UIDocumentBrowserViewController, these 8 options are available using the editing menu:\n\nCopy Duplicate Rename Move Delete Share Tags Info\n\nOn iPhone SE (the only iPhone I find comfortable to use) these are spread over three pages. Each item is small and hard to tap. The arrows to change page in the menu are even smaller. if you mis-tap it goes straight through to the view underneath and probably opens a document.\n\nOn iPad there is lots of space available so at least all the items fit on one screen, but it’s still all rather cramped and hard to quickly find the one you want.\n\nApps using UIDocumentBrowserViewController can add additional items here. In PDF Viewer, we add Export and Print. As they go onto a second or third page, these items are very well hidden on iPhone.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use the Files app to quickly do various actions on single files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be easy and comfortable to power through doing lots of things with files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to slow way down and tap very carefully, sometimes several time to get to the right page of menu items.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe you tried it already but I would have thought a vertical list in a popover might work well. Similar to the top part of the ••• menu in Pages. This allows things like icons and grouping too to aid recognition."
