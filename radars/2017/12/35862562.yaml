    description: "Summary:\r\nIn simple iMessage app with an embedded UITableViewController the contentInset is messed up after setting the app to .expanded presentation style and then back to .compact.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project.\nVerify that the table view insets are OK.\nExpand the UI by dragging the divider.\nVerify that the table view insets are OK.\nCompact the UI by dragging the divider.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen scrolling the table view, the insets should still be correct.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bottom inset is off by 214 points.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the screencast movie.\nWe tried to come up with a workaround and couldn't find one. Specifically, setting the tableView's contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior to .never doesn't help. Trying to correct the wrong adjustedContentInset by modifying the contentInset creates a feedback loop."
