    description: "Summary: When method bodies are folded, it is impossible to select any of the text that remains visible. This seems to be by design - it was changed in Xcode 9. In Xcode 8, the code could be unfolded by the mouse only when hovering over the elided section \"{...}\", which left the name of the method as normal text. Xcode 9 has changed this so that the entire line is highlighted whenever the caret enters it or the cursor passes over it, thus preventing any interaction with the text.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in functionality, and is different behaviour from every other text editor I have ever used. \r\n\r\nBeing able to select and copy part or all of the name of a method/function is invaluable when creating a family of similar methods. Now this is impossible whilst the code is folded.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n- Fold a method\r\n- Try to select the name of the method without unfolding the code"
