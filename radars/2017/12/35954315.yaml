    description: "Musicians and DJs often use their laptops for live performances. If the computer goes to sleep during a gig, it can create an embarrassing situation and possible financial repercussions for the user. One of our local venues charges a fee if a performer glitches while on stage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, headphones can trigger the \"lid close\" sensor on laptops. It's *very* common to have a set of headphones next to one's laptop during a performance.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a situation where the performer can nudge their headphones (or other magnetic equipment) while performing, and experience an immediate drop out of audio due to the system sleeping.\r\n\r\nIn these rare cases, a live-performance-oriented app should be able to disable lid close. The public NSActivityUserInitiated / NSActivityIdleDisplaySleepDisabled / kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleSystemSleep / kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleDisplaySleep do not prevent lid close sleep (nor should they).\r\n\r\nThe current known workaround (being advised by the community) is to turn off System Integrity Protection and install a kernel extension such as InsomniaX. This puts users at risk :("
