    description: "Please see attached notification E-mail about my MDM push certificate expiring (\"30 day notification_Apple Push Notification Service certificate expiration.eml\"): the e-mail does not display _any_ detail about the push certificate that is about to expire. The only criteria I could use to identify the certificate is the expiry date.\r\n\r\nI have never received an e-mail that contained useful information about which of my MDM push certificates the notification was about.\r\n\r\nFor users that manage multiple MDM push certificates (e.g. administrators of school districts, which may have one MDM push cert per school, or centralised administration of distributed offices, etc.), they might even have created all of their certificates on or around the same day.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if the notification mail would include some of the certificate details available (see screenshot \"Information displayed on Apple Push Portal.png\") instead of \"Mobile Device Management - null\" which is currently shown in the e-mail:\r\n- user notes entered in Apple portal\r\n- certificate serial number\r\n- push topic / certificate subject\r\n\r\nEither of these would allow to more easily identify which certificate the notification is about - ideally all of them would be included in the notification mail."
