    description: "Summary:\r\nXcodebuild tests run in a different order between `-skip-testing` (alphabetical) and `-only-testing` (arbitrary) params. Having consistent and obvious test execution order is extremely important for investigating issues and ensuring test failures aren't randomly introduced.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run xcodebuild with the `-skip-testing  / ` parameter and see that the tests run in alphabetical order\r\n2. Run xcodebuild with several `-only-testing  / ` parameters and see that the tests run in some unknown order (not alphabetical and not order specified on the command line)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `-only-testing` parameter should either run the tests in the order the parameters are supplied or in alphabetical order. The former option gives more control to developers, so would be preferable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `-only-testing` parameters and see that the tests run in some unknown order (not alphabetical) \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1 & OSX 10.12.2"
