    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I’m playing music on a MacBook Pro with TouchBar via a media player that exposes media player controls (e.g., iTunes, Spotify), I can pause or scrabble the currently playing track on the Touch Bar.  However, this functionality doesn’t work while in mission control - the media player controls do nothing on there!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Play an audio track via iTunes or any other media player that exposes media controls via the Touch Bar\r\n2.  Enter mission control via Ctrl + Up Arrow\r\n3.  Attempt to pause the currently playing track\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTrack pauses\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that this functionality does work on an attached Apple USB keyboard with numeric keypad, regardless of whether or not I’m in Mission Control.  This may also be the case with non Touch Bar MacBooks, but I’m unable to verify this without the relevant hardware.\r\n\r\nThis issue also happens when attempting to use the Touch Bar’s media player features while in “single app windows” Mission Control functionality (via Ctrl + Down)."
