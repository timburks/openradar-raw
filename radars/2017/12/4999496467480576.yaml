    description: "Sometimes, on any iOS 11.2+, the AASA file is not being updated after the application is installed. In that case, the only way to update it is to delete the app, restart the device, and install the app.\r\nThis was reproduced on multiple iPhone devices.\r\n\r\nApplications that were installed on the device before the update will continue working, however, upon reinstalling - they may stop working."
