    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter allocating a UITextField, it's never deallocated (iOS 11.2)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample project\n2. Tap \"Push\" to push a new view controller, which allocates a label and text field\n3. Pop the view controller by pressing the back button\n4. Note that the custom deinits for ViewController and Label are printed, but the TextField deinit is never called. The object stays in memory. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step (3), one would expect the TextField to be deallocated, and the console to print the statement in the deinit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe print statements in the deinit for ViewController and Label are printed, but not for TextField. The TextField is not deallocated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
