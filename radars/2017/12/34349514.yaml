    description: "In Xcode 9, \"Jump to next issue\" does not move the caret to the location of the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open any objective c file with method implementations in it\r\n- Create a compiler issue by typing some rubbish in a method body\r\n- Move the caret to the first line in the buffer\r\n- Press âŒ˜' to navigate to the issue using the menu command \"Jump to Next Issue\"\r\n- Type something\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe typed text from the last step should appear where the issue is. This was the behaviour in all previous Xcode versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe typed text appears where the caret was before \"Jump to Next Issue\" was invoked (the first line)."
