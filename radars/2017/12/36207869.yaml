    description: "Add the ability to schedule widgets to only appear at a particular time or on a particular day of the week. I may not need my calendar meetings to show up in the Today view outside of work hours. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, add the ability to have widgets show up outside/inside a location radius (similar to location-based reminders). For example, if Iâ€™m traveling greater than 50 miles away from home, I may want home control widgets to show up to let me remotely turn on alarms, adjust the thermostat, and switch lights on and off."
