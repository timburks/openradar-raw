    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nWhen a screenshot is taken in macOS, running `mdls Screen\\ Shot\\ 2017-12-14\\ at\\ 3.47.54\\ pm.png` will yield the following Spotlight Metadata Attribute keys (subset listed):\r\n\r\nkMDItemIsScreenCapture = 1\r\nkMDItemKind = \"PNG image\"\r\nkMDItemScreenCaptureGlobalRect = (\"-56\", \"-9\", 1552, 989)\r\n\r\nHowever when a screenshot is taken from the iOS Simulator (with the File > New Screen Shot âŒ˜S command), a file is written to the desktop that doesn't have any of the above keys.\r\n\r\nThe application I use would greatly benefit if these keys were added to the file written from the iOS Simulator."
