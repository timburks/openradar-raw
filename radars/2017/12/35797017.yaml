    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextField/UITextView/UISearchBar uses the magnifying glass to make it easier for the user to see which text he/she selected. Unfortunately, the logic responsible for positioning the magnifying glass below or above the text input doesn't take the safe area insets into account which basically makes it disappear behind the iPhone X's notch for every searchbar or textfield within a navigation bar. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen any app with a typical search (i.e. SearchController) like Mail on an iPhone X and start typing text (text should reach at least to the middle of the screen). Longpress on the text and select text so that the magnifying glass moves below the notch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe magnifying glass should move below the text input either as soon as it intersects with the notch or right from the beginning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe magnifying glass is above the text input and intersects with the notch until it's not visible/usable anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2 (15C5110b)"
