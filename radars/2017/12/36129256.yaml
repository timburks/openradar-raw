    description: "Summary:\r\nMany file formats have cross-references to other files that are required to correctly render it. PDF files might reference (X)FDF files or other, linked PDF documents. HTML documents requite JS, CSS, Image and video files to correctly render.\n\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController offers a secure scope for the tapped file, however has no way of even requesting access to linked files. This limits functionality in our case (PDF Viewer) or completely breaks it for other cases (e.g. a Markdown editor/preview with images linked).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is a conceptual (security) design issue, so no example project can be sent or is required.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAPI to request access to a file with an relative path inside the same storage scope (e.g. inside Dropbox, inside iCloud, inside local storage)\n\nAPI should show a alert to request additional access. Alternatively allow to get a folder-scope access. This API should also offer an NSProgress object to track download progress and to allow error reporting (no internet connection, download failed, etcâ€¦)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFunctionality is reduced. Opening linked external files in PDF Viewer fails, unless files are stored in local storage, as we can work around it in that case.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a conceptual limitation that limits adoption for any more complex app. Think video editor where a project file accesses linked files. An m3u mp3 playlist. \n\nA bundle is not a good workaround as various file providers do not handle bundles well (e.g. Dropbox) and it is not a natural concept for e.g. HTML websites to use a bundle folder."
