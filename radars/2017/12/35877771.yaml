    description: "This does not affect iOS 11.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFor iOS <11 the `-[UIViewController topLayoutGuide]` is not calculated correctly within a container view controller which has a child view controller which is a `UINavigationController` with a frame where origin.x < 0. The top view controller of the navigation controller will have an incorrect `topLayoutGuide`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch the attached project on a iOS 9/10 device/simulator in Portrait. \r\n\r\nIf you change line 57 in `ContainerViewController` to have a none-negative x-origin, you will see the expected result.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    leftFrame.origin.x -= 1; // If x < 0 the topLayoutGuide is not calculated correctly\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe left view should have a 20pt border to the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe left view has no border to the navigation bar\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.0.1 (9A1004)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\nmacOS 10.13.2 Beta (17C85a)"
