    description: "Updated 13 Feb 2018.  As of Xcode 9.3 v2, this is fixed.\r\n\r\nSummary: Xcode crashes when generating a PGO profile using `Test` action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open the attached project (any generic single view Swift project will do).  Generate a PGO profile using `Test` action (not `Run` action).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  As this is a swift project it should warn you that PGO doesn't work with swift (like it does when you select `Run Action`.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode 9.2\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Mac High Sierra, MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)"
