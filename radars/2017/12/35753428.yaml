    description: "Area:\r\nSpaces\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOccasionally, 4-finger gestures stop working (swipe left/right, swipe up/down).\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a new issue.  It looks like this has been going on for at least five years, and Apple has so far failed to fix it.  Please fix, as soon as you are done fixing the egregious security hole in High Sierra!\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3190476?tstart=0\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/53ttxz/macos_sierra_4_finger_gesture_not_working/\r\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/my-4-fingers-gestures-just-suddenly-stopped-working.1311936/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI don't have a REALLY good set of steps to reproduce, but this seems to happen most often when I have multiple fullscreen apps and/or multiple spaces/desktops open, and then I connect or disconnect some external monitors, or very rarely when I connect an iPad.  I have up to 2 externals of various kinds that I use at home and at work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n4 finger gestures would always work, because they remain configured in System Preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n4 finger gestures stop working.  A system restart is the only way I know of that fixes this 100% of the time, and that is an unacceptable productivity loss!\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacos 10.12.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
