    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nSummary: FileVault can not be activated in the GUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System-Preferences\r\n2. Open Security Pane\r\n3. Chose FileVault-Tab\r\n4. Click Activate Filevault\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be presented with a dialog to continue setting up FileVault (with the Apple-ID-option disabled if no Apple-ID has been set up). The user should be able to continue with a recovery key.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEither:\r\n- every option is greyed out and no button to continue is presented\r\n- An Error is displayed. In my case in German: \"Der Authentifizierungsserver hat die angeforderte Operation abgelehnt, weil die aktuellen Accountdaten diese Operation nicht erlauben\".\r\n- In English: Account \"myaccount\" cannot be used to manage encryption on this Mac. Click the lock to prevent further changes, then select another administrator account, and try again.\r\nAuthentication server refused operation because the current credentials arte not authorized for the requested operation\"\r\n\r\nNo secureToken is provided to either mobile user or local admin user.\r\nCreating a new local admin-account through deleting /var/db/.AppleSetupDone does sometimes yield a user with a secureToken, sometimes not.\r\nIf a local admin-user with a secureToken can be produced, it is possible to create a secureToken for a target user through sysadminctl interactive -secureTokenOn, but only in that case. That does still not allow activation of FileVault in the GUI, but it is activatable through CLI (fdesetup enable).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.2 / 17C88\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBound to AD, mobile Users (with or without admin-rights), one local admin account\r\n\r\nImpact: about 1200 Machines that will not be upgraded to High Sierra until that and another bug (FileVault will not update PreBoot-Password when user-password is changed in ActiveDirectory)\r\n\r\nAdditional comment:\r\nIt seems that the greyed-out Filevault-Enabling-Dialogbox appears in German (German (Switzerland)), but not in English. The change to English has been made with quitting the System Preferences, but not rebooting after the change."
