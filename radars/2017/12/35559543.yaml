    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince macOS 10.13 High Sierra, a WebDAV drive sporadically unmounts without the user wanting to unmount. It happens especially if the WebDAV drive is \"under high load\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a WebDAV drive via Finder\r\n2. Load many files into the WebDAV drive or save a file repeatedly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWebDAV drive should stay connect and function normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWebDAV drive sometimes unmounts itself\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.1 (but it already happened during the beta, even before the official 10.13.0 release)\r\n\r\nConsole:\r\nNov 15 15:21:34 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 received event(s) VQ_DEAD (32)\r\nNov 15 15:21:34 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 type 'webdav', mounted on '/Volumes/Usered00147', from 'https://webdavserver.com/Usered00147/', dead\r\nNov 15 15:21:34 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 force unmount https://webdavserver.com/Usered00147/ from /Volumes/Usered00147\r\nNov 15 15:21:34 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 found 1 filesystem(s) with problem(s)\r\nNov 15 15:21:34 <username> kcm[62480]: DEPRECATED USE in libdispatch client: Setting timer interval to 0 requests a 1ns timer, did you mean FOREVER (a one-shot timer)?\r\nNov 15 15:21:35 <username> NetAuthSysAgent[62478]: sendOptionsRequest: finalStatus(0)\r\nNov 15 15:21:35 <username> NetAuthSysAgent[62478]: WebDAV_OpenSession: not set to guest and user is NULL!\r\nNov 15 15:21:35 <username> NetAuthSysAgent[62478]: WebDAV_OpenSession: missing server credentials\r\nNov 15 15:21:35 <username> Microsoft Excel[62315]: open on /Volumes/Usered00147/Stat.xlsx: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've also attached a video to show the issue. The only thing I'm doing is opening an Excel file from a WebDAV drive and save it repeatedly. I've cut the video shorter. In reality, I had to save the file about a dozen times.\r\n\r\nI also managed to reproduce the issue by creating many small files with \"mkfile 1m {1..1000}.dat\" and just copying them into the WebDAV drive.\r\n\r\nI've tried several different WebDAV servers and the same issue exists on all of them. Even on WebDAV servers that are provided via localhost (loopback). Actually, this is how we've initially noticed the issue and it was definitely introduced with High Sierra because we never had such issues before that. https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/579"
