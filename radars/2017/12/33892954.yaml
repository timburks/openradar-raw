    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have a person in my contacts with the phone number 07000 123456 and they send me a message which is delivered from +44 7000 123456, Messages will not show their name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n[Assuming there's a way to spoof a phone number when testing in Messages... if not, I hope someone has a friend from the UK \U0001F643]\r\n\r\n1. Add a person with a UK phone number starting with 0 in Contacts (eg 07000 123456).\r\n2. Receive an iMessage from the same number, but replacing the 0 with +44 (eg +44 7000 123456).\r\n3. Check the conversation list in Messages.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list should show the person's name next to their message.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe person's name is not listed, and instead the sender is shown as +44 7000 123456."
