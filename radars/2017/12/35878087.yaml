Popover with empty list is shown when we try to dismiss the popover by tapping outside the popover. Sometimes this step results in crash.\r\n\r\nNote: iPhone uses UIPickerView which seem to work fine\r\n\r\nDemo: https://giphy.com/gifs/ios-uiwebview-xT9IgrdvNTKKirNc5O\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.
