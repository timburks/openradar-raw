    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #36129961\n\nThe documentation for the indeterminate property of NSProgress (Progress in swift) conflicts with header documentation (comments) and the actual behavior of the property.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook up the documentation for -[NSProgress indeterminate].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should reflect the behavior outlined in the NSProgress.h header comments.\n\nWhether the progress being made is indeterminate. -isIndeterminate returns YES when the value of the totalUnitCount or completedUnitCount property is less than zero. Zero values for both of those properties indicates that there turned out to not be any work to do after all; -isIndeterminate returns NO and -fractionCompleted returns 1.0 in that case. NSProgress is by default KVO-compliant for these properties, with the notifications always being sent on the thread which updates the property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation for  -[NSProgress indeterminate] states:\n\nProgress is indeterminate when the value of both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount are zero.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe documentation also conflicts with the following statement: “Setting both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount properties to zero indicates that there is no progress to track; in this case, *the isIndeterminate property returns false* and the fractionCompleted property returns 0.0.”.\n\nThe actual behavior of this property matches the behavior outlined in the header documentation."
