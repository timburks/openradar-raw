    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n*************************\r\nI have an iOS app that takes an html file, turns it into a PDF, and displays it to a WebKit web view. I have a weird problem where the bottom table cell gets cut off when I display to PDF. The weird thing is that the bottom table is only cut off when the text is centered. If it is left-aligned, everything works fine. \r\n\r\nFull Detailed Issue:\r\n*************************\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/q/47655057/2179970\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n*************************\r\n1) Download project from github:\r\nhttps://github.com/starkindustries/PrintPDFTest\r\n2) Run project on iOS device or simulator\r\n3) Once the app is running, tap the 'red' bar button item on the top-right. This makes the table's text centered.\r\n4) Tap the 'landscape' bar button item in the toolbar on the bottom. This prints the html to a PDF in landscape dimensions. Currently you should see a coral-red background, the text is centered, and there is no bottom table cell. \r\n5) Click the rewind button until the navigation bar title states \"PDF Landscape 505.\" Note that '505' is the height of the table in pixels. You should now see that the table has two cells.\r\n6) Increase the height to 515px by tapping the fast-forward button. Now the bottom table cell is cut off again even though it is within the bounds of the PDF page. This behavior is not desired.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n*************************\r\nThe bottom table cell is expected to NOT get cut off when given a height within the PDF bounds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n*************************\r\nThe bottom table cell does get cut off."
