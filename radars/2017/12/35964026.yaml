    description: "Area:\r\nPreview\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA PDF file that has been protected with a (owner) password to prevent others from copying the content of the file has no affect when you open the file with Preview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Encrypt a pdf with owner password.\r\nI.e. using the core graphics framework (kCGPDFContextAllowsCopying).\r\n2a. Open it with Preview. You will still be able to copy the content of the file.\r\n2b. Open it with any other PDF reader such as Acrobat Reader and you won't be able to copy the content of the file.\r\n2c. Open it with an older version of Preview (I tested everything between OS X10.7 and 10.11.6 (15G31)) and you won't be able to copy the content of the file (just as expected).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.2 (17C88)"
