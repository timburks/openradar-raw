    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDataMatrix codes are 2D barcodes which are used in various applications. The AVFoundation facility for detecting DataMatrix codes does not detect them when the use white dots on a black background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and install the attached program. (Also available at: https://github.com/langford/zzz-radar-datamatrix-white-on-black)\r\n\r\nPoint the device at the provided datamatrix code labeled \"Datamatrix, Black Dots on White Label from Inversion\" (Also available at: https://github.com/langford/zzz-radar-datamatrix-white-on-black/blob/master/Datamatrix%2C%20Black%20Dots%20on%20White%20Label%20from%20Inversion.jpg). You do not need to print out the image to work. The image on the screen of a Late 2016 15\" Macbook Pro with Touchbar will trigger it. You will see this information show up in the on-screen label:\r\n\r\n   0100358394024035216479456795871719073110S663527004973\r\n\r\n   What is scanned also has some unprintable characters. These are expected and are GS1 codes.  You can see that printed out in the debug print in the console.\r\n      \\u{1D}010035839402403521647945679587\\u{1D}1719073110S66352\\u{1D}7004973\r\n\r\n   That is great, and what we need from things printed this way.\r\n\r\n   However, not all datamatrix codes are printed this way.\r\n\r\n   When you point the device at the datamatrix code labeled \"Datamatrix, White Dots on Black Label\", you will see it *does not* trigger this handler. This is the problem. (Picture also available here: https://github.com/langford/zzz-radar-datamatrix-white-on-black/blob/master/Datamatrix%2C%20White%20Dots%20on%20Black%20Label.JPG)\r\n\r\n   Our particular use-case is medication labels. (This is not secret). We cannot scan dark labels and those are a good number of them in a medical context, and particularly our context.\r\n\r\n   The inversion of this image was done via http://pinetools.com/invert-image-colors with the item saved as a JPG. It is the one that works.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth images are detected and the information is returned. (\\u{1D}010035839402403521647945679587\\u{1D}1719073110S66352\\u{1D}7004973)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the Black on White example causes the API to detect the data matrix code\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.2, iPhone X (and various others) running 11.1.2 (15B202)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBuild and install on a recent model iPhone. \r\n\r\nPoint at the JPGs included in this zip file as opened by preview app.\r\n\r\nYou may need a screen similar to the late 2016 MacBook Pro for this to work, but I assume it will work for any reasonable screen."
