    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a view controller from a UIDocumentBrowserViewController, getting the transition controller with transitionControllerForDocumentURL:, the presented view controller does not control the status bar.\r\n\r\nThis is because UIDocumentBrowserTransitionController creates a plain UIPresentationController. This should not be done for opaque presented view controllers because a plain UIPresentationController fills the screen but returns NO to _shouldPresentedViewControllerControlStatusBarAppearance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use UIDocumentBrowserViewController\r\n2. Open a document by presenting a view controller with the transition controller from transitionControllerForDocumentURL:\r\n3. Make the presented view controller (or some child of it) hide the status bar or alter the status bar appearance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPresented view controller (or some child of it) should be able to hide and change the appearance of the status bar.\r\n\r\nThis can be done by making the presentation controller used by UIDocumentBrowserTransitionController should return YES to _shouldPresentedViewControllerControlStatusBarAppearance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPresented view controller (or some child of it) can not change the status bar from what the UIDocumentBrowserViewController specifies.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to set modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance on the presented view controller, even though this is a full screen presentation and this violates separation of concerns as this ought to be the presentation controllerâ€™s responsibility."
