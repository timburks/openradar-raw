    description: "Perhaps it's not noticeable in climate where the weather doesn't change much, but the first time I use the weather widget, it almost always shows me yesterday's weather, even if I have traveled across oceans or continents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Fly to London\r\n- Use the weather app\r\n- Make sure the weather widget shows the current London weather.\r\n- Fly home\r\n- Sleep\r\n- Wake up, check the weather widget\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Today's weather, in my current location\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Yesterday's London weather"
