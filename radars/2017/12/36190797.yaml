    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile attempting to release a newly-approved version of an iOS app, I encountered an issue with the iTunes Connect mobile app that caused my application to be removed from sale just as it was transitioning to “Ready for Sale.”\r\n\r\nAt the time, I was in an area of poor cellular coverage without wifi connectivity, which I believe contributed to the latent user experience in the application. The application didn’t provide visual feedback when network activity was occurring, making it difficult to determine if my attempts to tap “Release This Version” were successful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive App Review approval for a new version of an iOS app\r\n2. Navigate to approved app version in iTunes Connect iPhone app\r\n3. Tap Release This Version\r\n** note that UI does not update to indicate that work is happening **\r\n4. Assuming “Release This Version” was not actually tapped, tap it again, since nothing on the screen has updated.\r\n** note that the UI still has not updated to reflect work-in-progress **\r\n5. Leave the app and wait for status push notifications to arrive\r\n6. Discover the application you were attempting to release has been removed from sale moments after it begin App Store propagation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew app version should be released normally to the App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNew app version was briefly released to the App Store. Shortly thereafter, its status was updated as “Developer Removed.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n3.2.3 (373)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
