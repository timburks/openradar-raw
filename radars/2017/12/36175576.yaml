    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #36156990\n\nWhen cancelling an `NSURLSessionDataTask`, it typically logs this to the debugger console. It really shouldn’t do that, especially if the session’s delegate implements `-[<NSURLSessionDelegate> URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:]`.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Build and run any of the schemes in the attached sample project\r\n- make sure you can see the debugger console, and tap on the “Make Request” button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you have a working internet connection, and our website isn’t down, you shouldn’t see _anything_ logged to the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor every tap on the button, you a line like the following is logged to the console:\r\n\r\n2017-12-20 17:33:26.708636+0100 Task Force Swift[32801:407445] Task <E9222022-EA65-4105-8AD1-863F9ACB2C64>.<7> finished with error - code: -999\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 and above\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 and above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample: https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com/tree/master/36156990%20-%20NSURLSessionDataTask%20should%20not%20log%20cancellation%20to%20debugger%20console"

    title: NSURLSessionDataTask should not log cancellation to debugger console. This is confusing for customers of SDKs and causes support overhead.
