    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen saving a screenshot (of iPhone X, on a TouchBar MBP running macOS Sierra), the colors of the screenshot don't match when compared to the screenshot opened in Preview.app. (See attached sample screenshot.)\r\n\r\nIt looks like the Simulator saves images with the \"sRGB IEC61966-2.1\" profile. When I assign the \"Apple RGB\" profile to it in Photoshop (\"Edit\" > \"Assign Profileâ€¦\"), the colors on the screen match the displayed simulator window and any screenshots created on the device (in this case an iPhone X).\r\n\r\nNot sure what's exactly wrong here but to me, it looks like Simulator assigns the wrong color profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nsee also: \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/q/47721708/235297\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/282818#282818"
