    description: "Summary: Whenever I move an email sub-mailbox from one mailbox to another the mailing rule which was defined with that mailbox as destination break.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Create a mailbox called Newsletters and put into inside an existing mailbox (for example Work).\r\n2.  Create an email rule that filters newsletter emails and moves it to the Newsletters mailbox.\r\n3. Move the Newsletters mailbox from the Work mailbox to another mailbox (for example Personal).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Since the mailing rule is associated with the Newsletter mailbox it should re-configure itself to this new destination. Mailing rules depend on the mailboxes so a change in the mailbox location should be addressed to its dependency i.e. the mailing rules logic too.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: It creates an error in the mailing rules and highlights that it cannot find the mailbox.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSafari 11.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro Early 2013"
