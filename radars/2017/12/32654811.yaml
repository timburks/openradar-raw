    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith High Sierra, 10.13 Beta (17A264c) the MDM Command does not appear to work any longer. \r\n\r\nLooking at logs, it appears that `storedownloadd` GETs the appmanifest plist, and fails to download the pkg that the manifest points to. The log ends with \r\n\r\n2017-06-06 16:10:25.108171-0700 0x102e     Default     0x0                  416    storedownloadd: (StoreFoundation) [com.apple.commerce.CKLegacy] ISStoreURLOperation: Starting URL operation with url=https:/dev.micromdm.io/repo/munkitools-3.0.0.3333.pkg / bagKey=(null)\r\n2017-06-06 16:10:25.108290-0700 0x102e     Default     0x0                  416    storedownloadd: (StoreFoundation) [com.apple.commerce.CKLegacy] -[ISStoreURLOperation _runURLOperation]: _addStandardQueryParametersForURL: https:/dev.micromdm.io/repo/munkitools-3.0.0.3333.pkg\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend an InstallApplication command to an MDM enrolled mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npkg is installed.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe appmanifest plist is downloaded, but the pkg in the appmanifest url is not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13 Beta (17A264c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBusiness Impact : With APFS in High Sierra, Organizations will have to disown their imaging tools and use DEP as their primary deployment method. InstallApplication will play a key role in this transition as this would be the API that developers can build to deploy the necessary tools onto the machine on enrollment for streamlined user experience. This issue is currently a BLOCKER due to the high dependency on this API for admins around the world to build their new enterprise deployment strategy with High Sierra."
