    description: "Summary:\r\nI bought a track I liked and bought the rest of the album a few weeks later, from MacBook Pro.  When I try to even play any other track on iPhone, it takes me to Apple Music, or gives me a \"We ran into an error\" page.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy a track in iTunes Store (I bought <redacted>).\r\nConfirm that it downloads and plays just fine on all devices you have on account.\r\n\"Complete the album\".  Download and play on computer's iTunes.\r\nTry to download it on other devices without using Apple Music (have never used).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rest of the album should download exactly like the first track did, or I should have some descriptive UI that tells me why it can't.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n50% of the time I get a blank or error page, 50% of the time I get a \"sign up for Apple Music\" as if I'd never bought it.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10.3.3, macos 10.12.5, iTunes 12.6.2.20\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n<redacted> is my account, if you can tell any strangeness from there."
