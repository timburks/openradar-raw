    description: "Summary: \r\nThe app immediately communicates with a smart card reader when it is attached to the device. Since iOS 11, this doesn't work reliably anymore. Most of the time the error occurs on the first try.\r\n\r\nWe listen for the EAAccessoryDidConnect notification and immediately create a new EASession with the accessory. We get proper input and output streams and set them up. We then ensure that the outputstream's hasSpaceAvailable is true and then write a 10 byte payload to the accessory and wait for the hasBytesAvailable to read the response. But we don't get one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFirst run the attached example code, the device's screen should be all blank.\r\n\r\nThen attach a Feitian iR301UL smartcard reader to the lightning port (no need to insert a card).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should see this as the last two lines in the console:\r\nSent data 65000000000000000000.\r\nReceived data 81000000000000400000.\r\n\r\nThe Received data line indicates successful retrieval of the response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSent data 65000000000000000000.\r\n\r\nThe data is successfully sent, but nothing is received.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2.1 (15C153)"
