    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf a modally presented view controller (mpvc) presents a UIActivityViewController and the user selects a no-user-interface action extension (com.apple.services type), the mpvc will be dismissed when the extension completes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen and run the attached sample project on a iOS 11.2 device/simulator.\r\nTap \"Continue\" on the first view controller.\r\nTap \"Share\" on the modally presented view controller.\r\nTap \"More\" on the second row of the UIActivityViewController sheet and enable the No UI Action Extension and push Done.\r\nTap on the No UI Action Extension icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe second view controller should not be dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe second view controller is dismissed\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2. This also seems to affect iOS 10.3, but not iOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is different behaviour than other extension types and can cause confusion for users when the content they were acting on automatically dismisses after executing the extension."
