    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn every computer I've used since the 1980s I've been able to type á,é,í,ó,ú by pressing alt+[vowel] — on iPad with a hardware keyboard, this produces \"å\" regardless of my language / nationality / region choices. On macOS, with an Irish keyboard set, alt-[vowel] works as I expect it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse an iPad Pro with a hardware keyboard.\r\nAdd an \"Irish\" keyboard to Settings→Keyboards\r\nOn the hardware keyboard type alt+a.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should produce an \"á\" as it does on a Mac and PC\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt produces a å which is not even a valid character in Gaelic.\r\n\r\nNote: I am aware that alt-e, then [vowel] works, but:\r\n1. that is more complicated than alt-vowel \r\n2. it should work the same across Apple platforms with the same language settings, or I have to remember two approaches\r\n3. alt-a isn't doing anything useful in Irish/Gaelic as it is.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
