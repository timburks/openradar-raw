    description: "os_log captures the image, function, filename, and linenumber automatically, but may not always be correct, e.g. in the case of logging from a wrapper function such as _swift_os_log:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apple/swift/blob/65b0219/stdlib/public/SDK/os/os_log.m#L306\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if you could either expose an os_log variant that takes this info as freeform input, or one that takes the address of the relevant function, similar to the trick used by _swift_os_log, without having to expose os_log_pack_send and friends too:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apple/swift/blob/65b0219/stdlib/public/SDK/os/os_log.m#L324"
