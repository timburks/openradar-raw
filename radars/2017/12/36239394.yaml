    description: "When uploading an archive to the App Store via Xcode, there's a progress bar but no indication of how long the process has been going. However, when using Application Loader, there is an elapsed time indicator.\r\n\r\nOften, the \"Verifying assets with the iTunes Store...\" step takes a long time and it's difficult to tell if it's hung or not. It would be extremely helpful to include an elapsed time indicator somewhere on the screen."
