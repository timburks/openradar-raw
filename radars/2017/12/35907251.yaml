    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter a change of password of a mobile user in Active Directory, the password in the Preboot-Filevault-authentication is not updated\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up FileVault (if you can at all in 10.13)\r\n2. Log in with mobile user (Active Directory)\r\n3. Change Password outside the OS (to prevent namespace/encoding problems)\r\n4. Reboot\r\n5. Log in with old password at PreBoot-Screen (expected)\r\n6. Log in with new password at the LoginWindow\r\n7. Enter old password to update the Keychain\r\n8. Reboot again\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Set up FileVault (if you can at all in 10.13)\r\n2. Log in with mobile user (Active Directory)\r\n3. Change Password outside the OS (to prevent namespace/encoding problems)\r\n4. Reboot\r\n5. Log in with old password at PreBoot-Screen (expected)\r\n6. Log in with new password at the LoginWindow\r\n7. Enter old password to update the Keychain\r\n8. Reboot again\r\n9. The new password should unlock the PreBoot Screen\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n9. The new password does not unlock the PreBoot Screen, but the old one does\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.2 / 17C88\r\n\r\nImpact: 1200 Machines that will not be updated to 10.13 until at least this and another FileVault-Bug filed previously (FileVault can not be activated) will be resolved"
