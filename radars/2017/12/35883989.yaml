    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen UIViewControllerPreviewing.sourceRect is small popping previewing view controller is very slow.\r\n\r\nIt's a regression on iOS 11. It worked fine on iOS 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app on an iOS device that supports 3D Touch. If possible use an iPhone X because I feel this issue is more severe on iPhone X.\r\n2. 3D touch the pink rectangle whose I deliberately set very small to make the issue more obvious.\r\n3. Watch the slow peeking.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!EaoxgBiJ!GTQG22O9DdR_FRjwFetvPa_9tO2O4uQFGkCeVpL-5n0"
