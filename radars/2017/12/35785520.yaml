    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an app is running in a third of an iPad screen in split window layout (with another app taking up the other 2/3 of the screen), there is a drag handle at the top of its window that lets the user convert the app to a floating window. This handle does not seem to affect the safe area layout guides on UIView, so there's no way to take it into account when laying out content at the top of the app's window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-Run attached sample project on an iPad in landscape orientation\r\n-Tap the button in the middle of the screen a couple of times. Observe that the label at the top of the screen, pinned to the top of the safe area layout guide, moves to the top of the screen and down to make room for the status bar.\r\n-Open another app next to it in split screen mode (say, Safari)\r\n-Drag the divider between them so that the sample app is in the left third of the iPad's screen. Observe the drag handle at the top of the sample app.\r\n-Tap the button in the sample app a couple more times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label should stay just below the drag handle (because the safe area should be below it)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the sample app tries to hide the status bar, nothing happens (because the other app with 2/3 of the screen controls that), but the label moves up anyway, conflicting with the drag handle.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.1.2 (15B202)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, MH0W2LL/A\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tomhamming/rdar_35785520"
