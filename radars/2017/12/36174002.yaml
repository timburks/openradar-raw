    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the process that serves the proxied UI of UIDocumentBrowserViewController crashes, the app ends up in a “white screen of death”. This obviously shouldn’t happen, but it does, and in such cases it would be better to terminate the application (please create a new dedicated kill code, such as 0xdeadf331 or similar, so we can filter these out on crash reporting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload pdfviewer.io and play with the UI until it crashes. Tapping the bottom tab bar fast usually eventually kills the served UI and leaves the app in this state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProxy crashes should either restart the proxy, be handle-able or terminate the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwhite screen of app death\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
