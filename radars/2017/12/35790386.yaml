    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nAs of macOS Sierra, we have the ability to install a distribution package as part of the Setup Assistant which has been a great boon for admins around the world looking to move from imaging deployments to DEP. Now using InstallApplication API, necessary tools can be installed while the user is going through setup assistant for baseline configuration right out of the box. \r\n\r\nThe biggest disadvantage of the API is the limited feedback to the command. There is currently no way for an admin to know whether :\r\n\r\n1) The Manifest for the distribution package is downloaded and is accurate\r\n2) If the installer is being downloaded and installed\r\n\r\nThere have been issues with multiple InstallApplication commands leading to only one command being executed (RADAR #32654662). Only way to troubleshoot these issues have been to look through the logs, where we can clearly see the download percentage. Having the ability to query for this remotely would be extremely helpful to understand the current status"
