    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary: In Messages, one is able to use the search function in the emoji popover in Messages to search for various characters based on their unicode name. It's a very useful feature with so many emoji in our modern age.\r\n\r\nHowever, in macOS High Sierra, this search function appears to be broken. Searching for, for example, \"globe\" will return several globes. But if i search for \"middle finger\", the emoji \"middle finger\" does not appear, nor does \"hand with fingers spilt between middle and ring fingers\". In macOS Sierra, this search string will return both emoji, as well as, i believe, a few others. I am unsure of other search strings that may have issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: In Messages on macOS High Sierra, open the emoji popover and in the search box enter \"middle finger\".\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Multiple hand gesture related emoji would appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The search returns \"No characters found.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 (17B1003)\r\nMessages 11.0 (5500)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011)"
