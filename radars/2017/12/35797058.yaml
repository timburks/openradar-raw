    description: "NOTE: I am not going to attach a sysdiagnose because this issue is pervasive across four Macs here. I have confirmed with six other Mac users that they are seeing the issue as well, so a sysdiagnose will be of no help, and I'd need to attach four of them, for the four Macs I'm seeing the issue on. That's 6GB+ of useless data.\r\n\r\nSummary: As of December 1st, Console is filling—at the rate of 2 to 25 per second—with \"Month 13 is out of bounds\" error messages. It's apparently being generated by a bug in mdworker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use High Sierra on or after December 1, 2017, and probably before January 1, 2018.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: No spewing to Console.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Spewing to Console.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: 10.13.1 (17B1003)\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Irrelevant. Happens on every Mac I own running High Sierra, and just started this morning, December 1st, 2017."
