    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the key ‘whitelistedAppBundleIDs’ is defined in a Restrictions payload (com.apple.applicationaccess) and installed to a device, the device can no longer add a Google account under Settings > Accounts & Passwords. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a restrictions payload to an iOS device with whitelistedAppBundleIDs defined to your choosing. We used one that whitelisted Apple Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Notes.\n2. Go to Settings > Accounts & Passwords > Add Account\n3. Select “Google”. Provide accurate u/p credentials and optionally a 2FA token.\n4. iOS returns user to the “Add Account” screen and does not add the account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 4 should prompt the user to choose which aspects of their Google account they would like to sync, such as Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Notes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee step 4. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo error is produced on screen or from the console in Xcode when device is connected via lightning cable."
