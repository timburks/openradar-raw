    description: "Area:\r\nAVKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEverything is bad of using 3D Touch to Peek and Pop AVPlayerViewController:\r\n1. The performance of Peek and Pop is very bad.\r\n2. Because it is so hard and slow to peek it is very easy to apply over pressure so that it goes to Pop immediately after Peek just shows up. There is no stable Peek period.\r\n3. For a AVPlayerViewController presented with Peek and Pop any flick gesture will dismiss it. In comparison, a normally presented AVPlayerViewController can be interactively dismissed by pan gestures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. 3D touch at any place to Peek. Feel how bad the performance is.\r\n3. Try holding it in Peek state. Feel how hard it is to hold it stable in Peek state.\r\n4. After Pop, apply any flick gesture on the player to see it is accidentally dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!IGZCgZba!2mjt8ItvdnPtQeMwTj0dWrsKhSpdZco9ru2m1xOCKBE"
