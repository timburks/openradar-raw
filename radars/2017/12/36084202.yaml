    description: "We adopted the Xcode 9.2 (9C40b) and found that apps built with it might show twisted image assets on iOS 8.1-8.3 devices/simulators.\r\n\r\nThis prevents our app submission using Xcode 9.2 so it's a severe issue, and it greatly affects the usability of the App for users on iOS 8.1-8.3.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not specific to our app. We have verified the issue using Apple sample project listed here: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/MoveMe/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007315\r\n\r\nThe attached screenshots show 1 incorrect version of iOS 8.1 with twisted images, and 2 correct versions on iOS 8.4 and iOS 11.2.\r\n\r\nVerified the issue is not reproducible using Xcode 9.1.\r\n\r\nApple Response:\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original report your bug was duplicated to appears in a text box within the bug detail section of the bug reporter user interface. For security and privacy reasons, we don't provide access to the original bug yours was duped to.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please update your report directly at this link: https://bugreport.apple.com/."
