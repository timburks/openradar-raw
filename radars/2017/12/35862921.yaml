    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “Trust Computer” passcode prompt has a light background.  On iOS, this should mean that the status bar has dark text.  However, here it’s light text, with just ghostly shadows surrounding it as if the text was dark.  This is shown on my attachment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Plug previously untrusted device (iPhone, iPad) to your computer\n2.  An Alert appears asking if you want to trust computer - “Select Trust Computer”\n3.  A passcode prompt appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStatus bar text is dark.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus bar text is light.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
