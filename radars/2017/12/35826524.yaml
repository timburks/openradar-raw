    description: "Summary:\r\nSKPaymentQueue.restoreCompletedTransactions() does not refresh the App receipt if no In App Purchases were made. When developing, especially in a development signed mac Sandbox App this is inconvenient, because it would be a nice way to refresh the receipt without terminating the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a freshly built development signed Mac app without receipt:\r\nCall SKPaymentQueue.restoreCompletedTransactions\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe receipt should be refreshed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is still no receipt after calling this\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.2 Beta (17C83a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe alternatives are \r\n- exit(173) which is very intrusive in the user flow\r\n- SKReceiptRefreshRequest. This works in Sandbox but not in production. rdar://35826398\r\n\r\nThis means there is no unintrusive reliable simple way to make an app obtain an updated receipt in sandbox and production on mac.\r\n\r\nAs soon as IAP were made the receipt is in fact refreshed. It would be more consistent if it were also refreshed without IAP.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was observed on 10.13.1 and 10.13.2 betas"
