    description: "Summary: Siri offers an option to “tap to edit” after accepting a voice query, by which means the user may textually edit the captured input string using keyboard entry. Rather than re-evaluate the original request with the amended string, Siri appears to simply execute the new string with utter disregard to the consequences of the preceding. This can cause bad data to be created in apps, such as Reminders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Invoke Siri, and speak a phrase: “remind me to text Sara about the thing tomorrow at 7 a.m.”\r\n2. Tap “tap to edit” shown on the screen.\r\n3. Edit the text to say “remind me to text Sara about the guitar case tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.”\r\n4. Submit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne reminder is created, scheduled for 8:30 a.m., referring to the guitar case.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo reminders are created, scheduled for 7:00 and 8:30 a.m., referring to the “thing” and the “guitar case”, respectively.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.1 (15C153) and prior versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone10,6."
