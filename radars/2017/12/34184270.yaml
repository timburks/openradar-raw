    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn non-layered (hosted/backed) mode, drawing to the window backingstore (via CG) (from a drawRect:), and then calling [NSWindow invalidateShadow] will recreate the shadow based on the shape of the (possibly transparent) drawing done. This does not work in layer-backed mode.\r\n\r\nOne workaround that will trigger shadow invalidation is to do a setFrame(frame.width + 1); setFrame(frame.width - 1), which somehow tricks AppKit into really making the NSThemeFrame invalidate itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate layer-backed contentView, and update its layer.mask to a CAShapeLayer with a new/different mask each time the view is clicked e.g.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shadow should match the mask of the layer, after calling [NSWindow invalidateShadow]\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe shadow stays the same.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6"
