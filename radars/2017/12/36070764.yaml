    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn my app I have a view controller with a vertical stackView inside a scrollView. Every row is a child view controller with a collectionView (that scrolls horizontally). I noticed that safeAreaInsets is correctly set from parent to child view controller only if its view is inside the bounds of the parent's scrollView.\r\n\r\nHere is a video that shows the issue: https://youtu.be/1jFE0gTlp64\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open SafeAreaInsetsBug.xcodeproj\r\n2. Run on an iPhone X simulator\r\n3. Rotate to landscape\r\n4. Scroll to the third row\r\n5. Scroll the collectionView to the rightmost cell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe collection view should respect its superview safeAreaInsets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe left safe area inset for the collection view is correct, but the right one is not. Moreover if you scroll down to the 5th row (and more) you'll find out that neither the left inset is set correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2 (15C107)\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)"
