    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be helpful to put a set of breakpoints in a group that can be enabled or disabled in one go.\r\n\r\nWhen debugging certain areas in an app, I have specific sets of breakpoints for that area. Some of these breakpoints are \"valuable\" i.e. they have rich data such as conditions, log statements etc.\r\n\r\nWhen switching contexts to another area of the project I don't need these breakpoints. So I currently have to disable them all manually, a tedious process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:"
