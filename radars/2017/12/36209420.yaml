    description: Create/enable sticker packs to annotate sections in books in iBooks. It's possible to highlight in different colors, but it's really hard to keep track of what each color is supposed to mean. Sticker packs would allow us to visually contextualize passages that stick out and enhance the note taking and book consumption experience. For example, as a student I had a pack of physical stickers with arrows bearing different symbols (and a place to jot short notes). I could easily stick these next to passages in my notebook and visually scan to identify areas where I had questions, found a key point and more.
