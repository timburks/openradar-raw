    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen starting the Breathing app after a long time (for example, from the 'Take a breath' notification), the first breathing sessions _always_ gets interrupted immediately.\r\n\r\nStarting a new one after that works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Leave Breathing app for a long time (so it requires a full app launch, probably).\r\n2. Get notification for a new Breathing session.\r\n3. Start session from screen shown by notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSession progresses and completes as normal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSession gets interrupted immediately.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
