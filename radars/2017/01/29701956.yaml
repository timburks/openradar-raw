    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you open the emoji picker, in any textfield, and scroll down to pick one of the emoji's there, the selected emoji will be selected from the top instead. See the attached animated gif, where I try to pick 'Astronaut' and get 'Coffee' instead.\r\n\r\nLooks like it takes the coordinate in the view, but then forgets to include the scrolling offset to the calculation for which emoji was selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open emoji picker.\r\n2. Scroll down a bit.\r\n3. Select an emoji.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected emoji is inserted in the text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn emoji from the top of the picker is inserted in the text instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments: 'emoji-picking-picks-from-top.gif' was successfully uploaded."
