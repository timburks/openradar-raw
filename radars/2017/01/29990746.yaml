    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen inserting an Airpod into one's ear, a nice and helpful tone is heard to indicate it has connected (paired) to a device. \r\n\r\nHowever, if the airpod has not been worn in a while, the user may not remember which device it last paired to.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, an attempt to use the airpod to listen to, for example, music from an iPhone, may result in the music being output from the phone's speakers because the airpod is connected to the user's mac instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Pair Airpod to a device, say a mac. Listen to a video played on the mac.\r\n2) Remove Airpods and insert into case.\r\n3) Next day, insert Airpods into ears, hear \"paired\" confirmation tone.\r\n4) Start music playback using Watch. Note, the \"now playing\" Watch app does not indicate where playback will occur.\r\n5) Hear music being played, but faintly. \r\n6) Increase volume to compensate.\r\n7) Realize your coworkers are hearing your music from your phone better than you are.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 3) above, realize Airpods are not paired to the phone as expected, allowing the avoidance of Steps 5-7\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMusic plays through phone, not airpods.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6s\r\nWatch Series 0\r\nAirpods\r\nMacbook Pro\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPotential Privacy issue:\r\n\r\nBesides inconvenience and a bad user experience, this is also a potential privacy issue, if the Airpods are intended to be used to answer a phone call. In this scenario, people nearby could hear the caller reveal private information before the user realizes the Airpods are paired to some other device."
