    description: "We use the function SecTrustEvaluate to verify a certificate in our application. The certificate CA trust setting was set to \"Always Trust\".\r\n\r\nThe function worked with <= OS X 10.11.6 and returned kSecTrustResultProceed.\r\n\r\nBut on macOS Sierra 10.12.2 the function returns kSecTrustResultUnspecified with the same certificate, although it was set as trusted."
