    description: "Summary:\nWhen calling SecKeychainCopyAccess() from Swift in Xcode 8.1 instead of a returned SecAccess object with an OSStatus of noErr, no SecAccess is returned and the OSStatus is -4 or \"Function or operation not implemented\" as returned by SecCopyErrorMessageString(). According to the developer documentation this function is available as of macOS 10.10.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a valid SecKeychain object\n2. Create a valid SecAccess reference\n3. Call SecKeychainCopyAccess() with previously created SecKeychain and SecAccess as parameters\n\nExpected Results:\nA valid SecAccess object is returned, OSStatus of 0 aka noErr\n\nActual Results:\nNo SecAccess object is returned, OSStatus returned is -4, \"Function or operation not implemented\" \n\nRegression:\nThe issue occurs on macOS 10.12.2 using Xcode 8.1\n\nNotes:\nAccording to https://developer.apple.com/reference/security/1394733-seckeychaincopyaccess this function has been implemented as of macOS 10.10+ The discussion section further states that it was available as of OS X 10.2 but unimplemented before OS X 10.3. Looking at the available OSS version of SecKeychain.cpp and SecKeychainCopyAccess() at https://opensource.apple.com/source/libsecurity_keychain/libsecurity_keychain-55050.9/lib/SecKeychain.cpp indicates that it is still not implemented as of libsecurity_keychain-55050.9: \"MacOSError::throwMe(unimpErr);//%%%for now\""
