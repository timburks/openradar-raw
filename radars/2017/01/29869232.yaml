    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a file with \"restricted\" lineage is in the Trash, even if the user has permission to delete it, the Trash cannot be emptied and leads to nonsensical messages being presented to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal\r\n2. Run these commands (use 501 or the user name of the current user):\r\n\r\nsudo ditto /System/Library/CoreServices/ControlStrip.app ~/.Trash/ControlStrip.app\r\nsudo chown -R 501 ~/.Trash/ControlStrip.app\r\n\r\n3. From the Finder, attempt to empty the trash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Trash, being filled with files that are wholly owned by the user, should be emptied.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert:\r\n\r\n\"Some items in the Trash cannot be deleted because of System Integrity Protection.\"\r\n\r\nIf you press \"Continue\", another alert:\r\n\r\n\"The operation can’t be completed because the item “ControlStrip” is in use.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be noted here that \"ControlStrip\" is not actually in use.\r\n\r\nNow, if you go back to Terminal and simply \"rm -rf ~/.Trash/ControlStrip.app\", the files are removed from the trash and no special permissions or warnings are required or generated.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
