    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe user can select a single pdf document, click the share button and select my extension. However, the extension is not being displayed. It has something to do with the NSExtensionActivationRule key in the info.plst. \r\n\r\nSUBQUERY (\r\n    extensionItems,\r\n    $extensionItem,\r\n    SUBQUERY (\r\n        $extensionItem.attachments,\r\n        $attachment,\r\n        ANY $attachment.registeredTypeIdentifiers UTI-CONFORMS-TO \"com.adobe.pdf\"\r\n    ).@count == $extensionItem.attachments.@count\r\n).@count == 1\r\n\r\nis being used for the query. It has been copied from the apple docs: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html\r\n\r\nApple Developer Technical Support says:\r\n\"According to the engineering team, this is a bug in Sharing Services.  The item being shared by Preview and Finder is a URL to the open/selected file.  Sharing Services is supposed to acquire the UTI of the file referenced by the URL and register it in the extension item attachment's registeredTypeIdentifiers.  This is not happening for PDF files.  As a result, the only registered type identifier is \"public.file-url\" (the UTI of URLs) which your query does not permit.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download attached Xcode project.\r\n2. Open project and build and run the extension target in Finder.app or Preview.app\r\n3. Select one or multiple files and press the share button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe share extension for the test app should only be displayed when a single PDF file use selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe share extension is not being displayed in Finder. In Preview it is being displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://github.com/Iomegan/PDF-Share-Extension-App"
