    description: "JavaScripts referenced by HTML loaded into a WKWebKitView by an application fail to load when the application name contains spaces.\r\n\r\nThis is a broad bug. If you quit Slack, rename it to \"Slack X\", and re-launch it (on 16E144f), it will simply show a blank window.\r\n\r\nI've included a reductive case to demonstrate the issue as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start on a machine running 10.12.4 beta (16E144f)\r\n2. Download and unzip the attached JavaScriptPathBug.zip file <https://smilesoftware.com/static/bugs/JavaScriptPathBug.zip>\r\n3. Launch the JavaScriptPathBug app\r\n*. You'll see both a direct then an indirect alert followed by \"Hello, world!\" in the window\r\n4. Launch the \"JavaScriptPathBug copy\" app (a duplicate of the JavaScriptPathBug app but with a space in its name)\r\n*. You'll only see the direct alert followed by \"Hello, world!\" in the window\r\n5. Control-click on the window content and choose Inspect Element from the menu\r\n6. Click Console, and you'll see the error: \"Not allowed to load local resource <url>\" followed by the error: \"ReferenceError: Can't find variable: secondaryAlert\" which is a consequence of the first error (see attached \"Screen Shot 2017-01-31 at 10.00.59 AM.png\" file)\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\n\r\nExpected that both \"JavaScriptPathBug.app\" and \"JavaScriptPathBug copy.app\" would behave identically.\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\n\r\n\"JavaScriptPathBug copy.app\" fails to load javaScriptBug.js.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\n2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB\r\n\r\nmacOS Version:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 (16E144f)\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nSource is included in JavaScriptPathBug.zip for reference."
