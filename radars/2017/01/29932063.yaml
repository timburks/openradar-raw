    description: "Area:\r\nCore Location\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe have users reporting 0.5GB/week of data usage when our app is collecting high-fidelity GPS traces while a user is driving.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse GPS extensively while in the background, note that system \"time and location\" data usage skyrockets.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, collecting GPS routes of drives by users would use far less than 0.5GB/week.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nData usage is very high while using GPS in the background.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+"
