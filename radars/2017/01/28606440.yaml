    description: "When I add my CardDAV account to my iPhone, I can choose in contacts which groups to show. As you can see in the screenshots, the online address book has different default groups. But when I add the same account to my Mac, there is no place where I could choose which groups to display, it always displays all the groups.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add CardDAV account to macOS\r\n2. Try to choose one of the default subgroups\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can pick the groups exactly as I can in iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't even get told that groups exist, nor can I pick one. How can iOS offer that feature and macOS not?"
