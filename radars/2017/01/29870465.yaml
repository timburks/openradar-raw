    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you add multiple rules, each time, the view where you fill in what action(s) should be performed is getting shorter, in the beginning it doesn’t seem very obvious but if you keep adding rules it gets clearly visible\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open mail\r\n2. go to file > preferences > rules\r\n3. Add a rule, give it an arbitrary description\r\n4. Press ok to add it\r\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 multiple times 13+ times should do the trick, the more the merrier\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the initial screen to add a rule to be the same, every time I open it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe view where you fill in what action(s) should be performed is getting shorter by a bit everytime\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSeems to occur all the time I do this, very easily reproducible\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ll attach a screenshot, taken when adding my 13th rule - if you keep adding, it’s getting worse"
