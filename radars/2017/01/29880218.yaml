    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile Xcode is open, macOS keeps periodically prompting to allow Xcode access to the com.apple.dt.XcodeDeviceMonitor keychain item (see the attached screenshot). Despite having selected “Always Allow” multiple times, and having verified that the correct access permissions are set in both the login and system keychain for this item, the prompt keeps reappearing. In my experience this typically happens when the system wakes up from sleep while Xcode is open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a project in Xcode, put the system to sleep and wake it up again. (might not be reproducible in every configuration)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAs soon as I select “Always Allow”, I would no longer be prompted to allow access to com.apple.dt.XcodeDeviceMonitor. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe prompt to allow access to com.apple.dt.XcodeDeviceMonitor keeps reappearing. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nHappens with Xcode 8.2.1 (8C1002), but I could observe the same with previous versions of Xcode 8. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere are many other reports about this problem floating around online (see https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/64863 for an example). Some sources list possible workarounds, but so far nothing managed to permanently solve this issue for me."
