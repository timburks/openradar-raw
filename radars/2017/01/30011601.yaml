    description: "Summary:\r\nDocumentation is not clear about participating Slicing and Bitcode in the process creating app bundle variants. It is not obvious, if developer need to enable Bitcode in his project to make the app include only necessary variants on user devices, especially regarding architecture executables.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open App Thinning chapter from App Distribution Guide https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html\r\n2. See this statement: \r\n\"Slicing is the process of creating and delivering variants of the app bundle for different target devices. A variant contains only the executable architecture and resources that are needed for the target device.\"\r\n3. Open New Features in Xcode 7 https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode-Archive/Articles/xcode_7_0.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015242-SW1\r\n4. See these statements: \r\n\"Bitcode. When you archive for submission to the App Store, Xcode compiles your app into an intermediate representation. The App Store then compiles the bitcode down into the 64- or 32-bit executables as necessary.\r\nSlicing. Your artwork incorporated into the asset catalog can be tagged to indicate its suitability for the device that is targeted for installation when a user purchases and downloads your app into his or her device. Xcode supports organizing and tagging in the asset catalog so that the App Store can perform the slicing operation automatically. End users get just the resources needed for their device.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDocumentation explicitly says what Slicing and Bitcode are responsible for, in reducing final application size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDocumentation say opposite things about what Slicing and Bitcode are responsible for, in reducing final application size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a lot of misconception in developer's minds, because of this unclarity in the documentation, different answers provide opposite information about the subject:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/30722606/what-does-enable-bitcode-do-in-xcode-7"
