    description: "I was attempting to install an unsigned extension from outside the gallery. The extension is attached, but is also avialable here:\r\n\r\nhttps://joekuhns.github.io/PiedPiPer.safariextension/\r\n\r\nAs expected, I was asked whether or not I should trust this extension. Every time I clicked \"Trust\", my input was ignored, as though I was hitting Cancel.\r\n\r\nI eventually solved the problem by stumbling upon this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/214760/force-installing-untrusted-safari-extensions\r\n\r\nBy clicking the button via keyboard, and not mouse, I was able to get the extension trusted."
