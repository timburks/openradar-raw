    description: "Area:\r\nDock\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDragging a file from the Dock (via the pop-up windows that show when opening a folder in the Dock) into another application or context (I've noticed this when dragging files to the Trash or into a web browser) causes an error (logs attached) that then causes the Dock to enter a state where no animations play, including opening pop-up windows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStarting from a fresh boot, or after running \"killall Dock\":\r\n\r\n1. Have two or more test files in a folder (I used images)\r\n2. Add this folder to the Dock\r\n3. Use the following window settings:\r\n    - Display as: Folder\r\n    - View content as: Automatic\r\n4. Open the folder with a single-click to get the pop-up window\r\n5. Drag one file from the folder to the Trash icon in the Dock\r\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Dock continues to function normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn step 6, expect the machine to hang briefly. The typical Trash sound will not play. It is now impossible to view folder pop-up windows from the Dock. Window effects associated with shrinking or expanding applications to/from the Dock will not play. Clicking on an icon in the Dock will not trigger the \"depress\" animation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" Late 2016, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, Intel HD Graphics 530\r\n\r\nCrash log:\r\nJan  2 13:39:43 **** Dock[26786]: BUG in libdispatch client: kevent[EVFILT_MACHPORT] monitored resource vanished before the source cancel handler was invoked\r\nJan  2 13:40:29 **** com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.Dock.agent[26786]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1\r\nJan  2 13:40:30 **** com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent): Unknown key for integer: _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit"
