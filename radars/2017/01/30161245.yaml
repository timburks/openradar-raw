        Summary:
        When opening a website where you need to authenticate through HTTP auth, the shown dialog is modal and blocks interaction for the whole Safari window. It is not possible to switch tabs to e.g. a website that is showing the password you need to enter in the other one.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open a website that requires HTTP auth
        - Wait for the auth dialog to become visible
        - Try to switch tabs or open a new one

        Expected Results:
        - It just works. The auth dialog is shown if the tab that is requesting is is the selected tab.

        Actual Results:
        - It is not working. You canâ€™t switch tabs, nor can you create new tabs.

        Regression:
