    description: "Summary:\r\nRecently (I _think_ since around 10.12.2) Safari has started having a weird race condition: sometimes, when opening a new tab and typing an URL to open, then hitting enter and switching back to a different tab before the URL finishes loading, the typed in URL will open in the old tab, instead of the newly opened one.\r\n\r\nIt seems to happen more often if the URL is autocompleted and not fully typed by hand.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a 100% reproducible test case :(\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have multiple tabs opened in Safari.\r\n2. Press cmd-t to open a new one.\r\n3. Start typing an URL.\r\n4. Hit enter when you've typed enough of the URL for it to autocomplete to the desired one\r\n5. Switch back to one of the previous tabs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne can continue using all of the old tabs as they were and the new tab loads content in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, the newly typed URL will open in currently visible tab, losing the \"back\" history, making recovering from such errors infuriating.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 10.0.2 (12602.3.12.0.1)\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (16C67)"
