    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nstringByReplacingMatches(in:options:range:withTemplate:) in NSRegularExpression leaks memory. Applications that call this method repeatedly will inevitably be terminated by iOS due to memory pressure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached project, Radar13Jan2017.zip.\r\n2. Build and run with any iPhone simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app runs indefinitely.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a few minutes, all of the memory on the system is allocated and the app crashes. You can view the constant allocation growth in the debug pane in Xcode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C89)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Radar13Jan2017.zip' was successfully uploaded."
