    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iTunes open, but not playing any audio, and connecting a pair of Bluetooth Headphones will result in iTunes refusing to play audio until the program is quit and relaunched.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs almost every time (~99%) of the time that I've tried to replicate it.The play/pause button will toggle, but no audio will play either through the system speakers or through the headphones, and the track progress indicator does not advance.\r\n\r\nIn rare occasions (1 time) the track indicator does progress, but still nothing is played. \r\n\r\nIn all cases, the headphones to appear to be connected and system audio plays through them, just not iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Play a track (as a test) and pause it.\r\n3. Connect Bluetooth Headphones\r\n4. Attempt to play the paused track.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn this case, the track should play from the paused position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo audio is played through iTunes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1212) - iTunes 12.5.4.42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niTunes is open before headphones are connected. If iTunes is opened after connecting the headphones, no issue arises.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
