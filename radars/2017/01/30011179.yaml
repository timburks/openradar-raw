    description: I had done a Photo Book a few days ago. Apparently the pictures of this book have been stored in iCloud while only a preview stayed on my Mac. When I opened the book, Photos.app says it retrieved the Photos, and when clicking on a page I see them, but the general preview only shows gray pages.
