        Unable to verify MDM profile for setting automatic macOS updates has applied properly by checking in System Preferences: App Store

        Summary:

        I am unable to verify that an MDM profile for setting the `AutoUpdateRestartRequired` value in `com.apple.commerce` has been set correctly by looking in System Preferences: App Store.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install appropriate profile - sample profile available at https://gist.github.com/rtrouton/43438ddb9e9d471e5168030ba12bc3e4
        2. Open System Preferences
        3. Select the App Store preference pane
        4. Examine the checkbox for "Install macOS Updates"

        Expected Results:

        The checkbox for "Install macOS Updates" would be checked and possibly grayed-out.

        Actual Results:

        The checkbox for "Install macOS Updates" was not checked (see attached screenshot.)

        Regression:

        After installing the profile, I ran the following commands to see if the `AutoUpdateRestartRequired` value was set to "true" after the profile was installed:

        python -c "from Foundation import CFPreferencesAppValueIsForced; print CFPreferencesAppValueIsForced('AutoUpdateRestartRequired', 'com.apple.commerce')"

        python -c "from Foundation import CFPreferencesCopyAppValue; print CFPreferencesCopyAppValue('AutoUpdateRestartRequired', 'com.apple.commerce')"

        When profile was installed:

        Both commands returned a value of "True" (no quotes)

        When profile was not installed:

        Both commands returned a value of "None" (no quotes)
