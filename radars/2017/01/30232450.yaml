    description: "I noticed two issues related to SafariViewController on iPhone6Plus.\r\n1. When someone wants to open SFV presented modally as form sheet in landscape. Buttons from bottom toolbar are placed in navigation bar. After rotation to portrait and back to landscape it's ok.\r\n2. When someone opens SFV presented as full screen and rotates the device sometimes it gets squeezed."
