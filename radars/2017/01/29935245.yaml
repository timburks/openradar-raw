        Summary:
        The built-in QuickTime Player app does not support the new picture-in-picture feature introduced in macOS Sierra that is accessible from other apps such as Safari and iTunes

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a movie in QuickTime Player
        2. Look for the picture-in-picture control at the bottom of the movie window, like you would see in Safari.

        Expected Results:
        The button should exist and allow me to put the movie into PiP

        Actual Results:
        No such button exists

        Notes:
        The current workaround is to drag the movie to Safari instead, and invoke PiP from there.
