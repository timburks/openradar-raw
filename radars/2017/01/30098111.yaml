    description: "Peter Steinberger\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUICollectionView is an almost perfect superset of UITableView. Especially in our modern world with split screen and apps that can adapt to sizes, it's often desirable to have a mode that can switch between list and grid easily. Right now this is hard (reimplement a list that might not feel perfect because getting all the details of UITableView as a collection view layout just perfect is hard) or it means maintaining two controls with different callbacks - something that just cries for bugs.\r\n\r\nThe situation is imperfect and Apple knows - this was already discussed in WWDC'14 Session 232 - Advanced User Interfaces with Collection Views where UI was built to resemble table views.\r\n\r\nIt's time for an official API so people don't need to create imperfect copies and can rather spend time to make great apps.\r\n\r\nWe've blogged about this here in much more detail:\r\nhttps://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/the-case-for-deprecating-uitableview/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to simulate UITableView with a custom UICollectionView layout.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA predefined UICollectionViewTableLayout readily available as public API.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe have to manually build something like UICollectionViewTableLayout for each app, which is hard and makes apps imperfect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1, iOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/the-case-for-deprecating-uitableview/ for a detailed post about this issue\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
