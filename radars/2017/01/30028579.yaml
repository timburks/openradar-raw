    description: "Many Alerts in Xcode have a \"please don't show this alert again\".\r\n\r\nOne command I have to use several times a day is \"Clean Build Folder\" (option-Product->Clean), and it doesn't have that option.  Since I need to clean my build folder (to unconfuse the swift compiler, or I get a \"AppDelegate.o symbol table larger than file\", or I change Xcode versions, or for a host of other reasons) regularly, it'd be nice not to also have to dismiss an alert.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like for there to be a \"please don't show this alert again\" on that dialog.  (screenshot attached)"
