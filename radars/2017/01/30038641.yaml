        Summary:
        The iPhone SE should be updated to be technically on–par with the latest regular iPhone models. Specifically, the camera, processor, and storage configurations should be revision bumped. Oh and please _do_ keep the headphone jack!

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Not really applicable but compare the “Storage”, “Chip”, and “Camera” sections of https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/ and https://www.apple.com/iphone-7/specs/

        Expected Results:
        Should be the same (save for absence of the 7/7 Plus divide, which doesn’t port over)

        Actual Results:
        The “Storage”, “Chip”, and “Camera” sections read like those of the iPhone 6s.

        Regression:
        Unfortunately the SE isn’t even quite on par with the 6s, as it lacks support of 3D touch.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
