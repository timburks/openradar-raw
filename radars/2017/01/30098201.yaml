    description: "Peter Steinberger\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using a UISearchController inside a UITableViewController that itself is displayed in a UINavigationController whose toolbar is set to be visible, the search controller’s table view will get an inset at the top that is of size navigationbar+toolbar, leaving a 44.0pt gap between the navigation bar and the first row of the search results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the sample project\r\n- Run it on an iPad (tested with iPad Pro 12.9” and iPad Air 2 Simulator)\r\n- Tap the ‘Tap Me’ button in the top right corner\r\n- Tap the search bar of the view controller that just appeared in a popover\r\n- Type something (one letter is enough)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe results table view shows all entries, starting with the first cell right belog the navigation bar / search bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The result table view shows all entries, but there is a gap of 44pt between the navigation bar / search bar and the first cell.\r\n- Checking the result table view’s contentInset reveals a top value of 88pt.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample code also at https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com/tree/master/30011840%20-%20SearchContentInset\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook TouchBar 2016, Xcode 8.2.1, iPad Pro 9.7'"
