    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 seems to want to indent everything between @implementation and @end. It will automatically insert indentation before e.g. method definitions. That is pretty annoying behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open any Objective-C file. \r\n2) Press return on an empty line, or after the final '}' of a method, anywhere between the @implementation and @end.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new line to be inserted, and the cursor at the beginning of the line, with no indentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIndentation is inserted (4 spaces in my case)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMovie which shows the behaviour is attached. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDefault settings for indentation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IncorrectIndent.mov' was successfully uploaded."
