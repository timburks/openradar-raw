    description: "Summary:\r\nIn older versions of iTunes I could tag all songs of an album as gape-less and they would play as gape-less. Not so in 12.5.4.42 I can neither tag songs like this, nor does it seem to remember albums where I did set this in the past. All my gape-less mix albums now have gapes, really all of them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a gape-less album in your iCloud Library\r\n2. Download it from there\r\n3. Play it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt plays gape-less\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a gape between all the tracks. Also external tools don't recognize the album as gape-less any longer and I have no way to change the gape-less state."
