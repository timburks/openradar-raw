    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Time profiler instrument used to work in the simulator.  Now it's broken. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is an oversight, and not Apple deciding to protect us from ourselves.  _Many_ times I've used the time profiler in the simulator to track down performance problems in my own code (such as unexpected O(N^2) behavior). \r\n\r\nI also teach iOS programming courses, and sometimes our students don't have devices.  Not being able to use the simulator is a serious handicap for them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Profile your application (iOS, simulator target)\r\n2. Choose Time Profiler template\r\n3. Run the app \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp runs, time gets profiled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Time profiler does not support the iOS Simulator platform\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTBH, I'd be happier if existing bugs could be addressed (c.f. rdar://22524679) rather than existing useful functionality is removed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n\r\nIt worked correctly every single version of Xcode prior to this version since the iOS SDK came out.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-01-25 at 2.12.56 PM.png' was successfully uploaded.
