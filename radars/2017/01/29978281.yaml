    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are putting our Messages Extension code in a separate framework since it will be reused between two different apps. We update the MainInterface.storyboard such that the initial VC references our MSMessagesAppViewController in our framework.\r\n\r\nIf we remove all the code source files from the \"iMessageExtension\" group as defined in the project the app builds and runs on the simulators, but refuses to install on a real device. The only error message is \"App Installation failed. An unknown error has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nIf I create a dummy source file (see DummyObject.swift) in said group things work great once again!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the two projects \r\n2. Build and run the BAD project \r\n3. Build and run the WORKS project\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the projects is that DummyObject.swift file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth projects should work...\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBAD project fails to install on real devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\nMacOS: 10.2.2"

    reproducible: AlwaysWhen the "+" (plus sign) is used in a query parameter it needs to be percent encoded, but NSURLComponents does not do that. The result is that when sent to a web server the "+" gets erroneously interpreted as a "space" character when decoded.
