    description: "Summary:\r\nSleep++ and other apps should be able to suppress raise-to-wake while they are active.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run Sleep++\r\n2. Let the Watch display sleep.\r\n3. Roll over.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWatch does not wake up without touching while wearer is sleeping.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch wakes up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://jonmitchell.net/blog/why-im-an-almost-everyday-apple-watch-wearer\r\n\r\nConverting the watch between awake-mode and sleep-mode is a bit more fiddly than just switching faces, since I have to toggle raise-to-wake in Settings and start or stop sleep tracking in Sleep++, but I don’t see how that can be avoided. Launching Sleep++ from a complication is easy. I wish the raise-to-wake toggle was in Control Center instead of buried in Settings. I’ll explain the only solution I’ve figured out to reduce the friction there in the Dock section."
