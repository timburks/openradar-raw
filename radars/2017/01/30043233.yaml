    description: "Area:\r\nMenu Bar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nGiven in 10.12.2 battery time remaining was removed from the battery menu it is now more difficult to estimate how long is left before battery shut off. The battery icon does not have enough accuracy. The work around is to view the battery percentage however this isn't shown in the menu. You have to check the \"Show battery percentage\" and then it appears in the menu bar and takes up vital space, so after viewing percent you would turn it off again. This whole procedure takes 4 clicks. If the menu showed battery percentage then it would be one. Thus for this reason I would recommend displaying the battery percentage in the battery menu, or option click menu would be fine too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click battery menu icon\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee accurate information about battery remaining.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHave to click show battery percentage, view it, then hide battery percentage, taking 4 clicks total.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)"
