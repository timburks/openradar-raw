    description: "Summary:\r\nWith new log subsystem introduced in 10.12 Sierra it is no longer possible to send log messages to remote syslog server. In previous versions of macOS it was possible possible to configure syslog via /etc/syslog.conf  config file to send logs to remote servers. In 10.12 syslog is still place but it's missing content since it was moved to new log subsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to configure log system to send log messages to remote syslog or syslog-ng server.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to configure logd to send messages to remto syslog server.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12"
