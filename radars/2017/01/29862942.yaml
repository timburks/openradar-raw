    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince iOS 8 there's the Reachability feature when performing a double tap on the home button. Currently, it is not possible to trigger deactivating manually. Being able to manually deactivate reachability would enhance custom container view controllers. \r\n\r\nAlso in Mail.app reachability is disabled when tapping on Edit in the inbox. This behavior can currently not be reproduced (and is also inconsistent).\r\n\r\nI suggest making [UIApplication _deactivateReachability] public.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch for a way to deactivate reachability.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind your way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind no way in the documentation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Reachability.zip' was successfully uploaded."
