    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSandbox users created recently (not sure of the exact date this started) cannot be used for in-app purchases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a sandbox user at https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/users_roles/sandbox_users\r\n2. Verify the email address by following the link in the email and logging in.\r\n3. Attempt to make an in-app purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the in-app purchase to succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFirst, after logging in to the sandbox account, I get an \"Apple ID Verification\" dialog saying, \"Open Settings to continue signing in with \"nsolter+test26@ixl.com\"\"\r\n\r\nWhen I go to settings, I receive a dialog with title, \"New Password Required\" and text, \"To finish signing in, you must create a new Apple ID password.\"\r\n\r\nAfter clicking ok, I get the change password dialog. After changing password I get a dialog stating, \"The Apple ID you entered couldn't be found or your password was incorrect. Please try again.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, trying again doesn't work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nios8, ios9, ios10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSandbox users created last year seem to work still. It's only new users that fail."
