    description: "Frequently after calling \"reloadSections:\" on a UICollectionView, decoration views will then appear with a different z-index. This often causes the decoration views to appear on top of collection view items that have higher z-indexes.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to reset the z-index on \"initialLayoutAttributesForAppearingDecorationElementOfKind:atIndexPath:\" and \"finalLayoutAttributesForDisappearingDecorationElementOfKind:atIndexPath:\" but this has not resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a sample app that demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) On a UICollectionView with a custom subclass of UICollectionViewFlowLayout, add a decoration view to a  that has a lower z-index than the items and/or supplementary views. \r\n2.) Call \"reloadSections:\" on the UICollectionView (might take 2-4 calls to reproduce.\r\n\r\nIn the provided sample project:\r\n\r\nClick \"reload section\" 2-4 times to reproduce issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nZ-index of decoration view is respected in relation to other elements in the collection view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nZ-index of decoration view is not respected. respected in relation to other elements in the collection view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10+"
