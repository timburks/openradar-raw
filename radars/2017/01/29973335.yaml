    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen capturing a video through UIImagePickerController, if a user finishes capturing, plays back the video, and clicks Retake during playback, when they finish that Retake by pressing stop, the next view will show a Pause button, even though playback is not occurring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Implement a UIImagePickerController with mediaType of kUTTypeMovie to allow a user capture a video.\r\n2) Run the app and get to the UIImagePickerController VC.\r\n3) Capture a video and press stop.\r\n4) Click the play button, and while the video is playing, click \"Retake\"\r\n5) Record a new video, and press stop.\r\n6) At this point, the VC will show the most recent video in a paused state, but display a Pause button, instead of a Play button.\r\n7) Clicking on the Pause button changes the button back to Play.\r\n8) Clicking the Play button Plays the video.\r\n\r\nAlternatively using iMovie for iPhone:\r\n1) Create a new Project\r\n2) Choose Movie\r\n3) Click Create Movie\r\n4) Click +\r\n5) Click Camera\r\n6) Capture a video and press stop.\r\n7) Click the play button, and while the video is playing, click \"Retake\"\r\n8) Record a new video, and press stop.\r\n9) At this point, the VC will show the most recent video in a paused state, but display a Pause button, instead of a Play button.\r\n10) Clicking on the Pause button changes the button back to Play.\r\n11) Clicking the Play button Plays the video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter a video Retake, the VC should show a Play button, instead of a Pause, as it is not currently playing anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a video Retake, the VC shows a Pause button, that seems to be in a stale state from when the original video was being played on a previous step.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproducible on an iPhone 6, originally found in the ShareFile app, but also reproducible in iMovie for iPhone."
