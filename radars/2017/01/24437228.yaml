    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a new Mail account to Internet Accounts and you don't choose to use this account for Notes, too, the only way to later on change that selection is to delete and re-add the account. If you initially pick both, you can change your mind at any time later on, though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to System Preferences\r\n2. Go to Internet Accounts\r\n3. Click + to add a new account\r\n4. Click on Add Other Account...\r\n5. Choose Mail account\r\n6. Enter the credentials of a valid mail account\r\n7. Use with offers Mail and Notes - only pick Mail\r\n8. Select created account in list and enable Notes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see \"Use with:\" where both is offered, Mail and Notes and Mail is checked Notes, isn't. So you can just check Notes, maybe even uncheck mail, if you like.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou only sse a checkbox \"Enable this account\". The only way to get this selection back is to delete and re-add this account. Note that if you initially picked both, you can later on always change the selection as desired."
