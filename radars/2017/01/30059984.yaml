    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile playing a locally stored track in iTunes, occasionally the track will skip like a scratched CD. I have checked but at no time this has happened has the system been under high load. It's mostly idling or editing trivial text files. This is not a track issue as replaying the track does not cause the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio on a digital device should not skip during playback.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio skips occasionally.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G1212) - iTunes 12.5.4.42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
