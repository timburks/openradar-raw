    description: I know this sounds like a quibble but the all of the Aerial are fantastic and weâ€™d love to see the entire selection more often. Usually it just repeats the same 4 or 5 (which again, are fantastic). Maybe it could randomize a playlist (like iTunes) and use that until each is played instead of always picking a random 2-3 each download period.
