    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRight now, photo permissions for iOS apps are an all-or-none permission. Either a user grants an iOS app complete permission over their entire photo library, or none. I’d like to see some additional controls to allow users to use apps with confidence that their photos won’t wind up in the wrong hands. Specifically, I would like to see write-only permissions for apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new app from a developer you’re unfamiliar with.\r\n2. The app prompts you to allow photo permissions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I’m only interested in letting the app save photos, but not read my existing photos, I’d like the option to grant write-only permissions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only choices are \"allow\" and \"deny.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems similar to location permissions, where the choices were expanded to \"Always Allow,\" \"Allow While Using,\" and \"Deny.\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus, AT&T, 128 GB"
