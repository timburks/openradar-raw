    description: "Summary:\r\nDocumentation for Swift Foundation library URL structure (available at https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/url) incorrectly states that this struct and many of its methods and properties are available only on iOS 10.0+, macOS 10.12+, tvOS 10.0+ and watchOS 3.0+. This is incorrect and grossly misleading. The structure is available in Swift 3 for all OS versions supported by it (as part of the Swift runtime libraries shipped with any Swift app), and availability of many methods and properties should reflect their respective NSURL counterparts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look in documentation at https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/url – for example, looking for the \"path\" property (many more properties and methods are affected).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDocumentation correctly states that URL structure is available in iOS 8.0+, macOS 10.10+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 2.0+ (minimum versions for Swift) – just like NSURL class. Documentation of properties and methods like \"path\", which have NSURL counterparts introduced long before iOS 8, also states the same availability.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost properties of URL struct have availability of iOS 10.0+, macOS 10.12+, tvOS 10.0+ and watchOS 3.0+, which is very confusing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe \"workaround\" is to consult NSURL documentation to check availability.\r\n\r\nIronically, some methods/properties *actually* introduced in or after iOS 8.0, macOS 10.10, etc., e.g. \"hasDirectoryPath\", are marked respectively in URL struct documentation. This is funny: how come a property became available earlier than the struct itself?"
