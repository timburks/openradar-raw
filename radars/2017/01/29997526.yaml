    description: "The currently released source code for exit() in Libc from 10.12.1 is at https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-1158.20.4/stdlib/FreeBSD/exit.c.auto.html. Here it is, reproduced:\r\n\r\n52  /*\r\n53   * Exit, flushing stdio buffers if necessary.\r\n54   */\r\n55  void\r\n56  exit(int status)\r\n57  {\r\n\r\nThat’s the end of the file. No implementation is present. The file won’t compile.\r\n\r\nYou have to go back to Libc-997.90.3 (first shipped with 10.9.2) to find a working version of this file. https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-997.90.3/stdlib/FreeBSD/exit.c.auto.html\r\n\r\nPlease correct whatever is stripping the implementation of exit() for public source release so that future source releases include this code and the file can be compiled."
