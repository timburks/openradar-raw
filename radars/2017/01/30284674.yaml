    description: "31-Jan-2017 03:00 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nScreen Saver & desktop\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using legacy smart card authentication on macOS 10.12, you can set an option in Security & Privacy to activate the screensaver when the card token is removed.\r\n\r\nThis, when set with a configuration profile on 10.11 works perfectly. The same profile on 10.12 fails to work.\r\n\r\nI only have legacy TokenD drivers for the card so cannot test if this is a legacy only issue or present with CTK drivers as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall a legacy TokenD card driver on 10.12.x\r\nSet a configuration profile for \"com.apple.screensaver\" for \"tokenRemovalAction\" to \"1\".\r\nLog in with a smart card.\r\nRemove the card from the reader.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen should lock and the screensaver should activate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
