    description: "Summary:\n\nThe NSFilePresenter documentation contains the following paragraph:\n\nFile Presenters and iOS\nIf your app enters the background with an active file presenter, any other processes that perform a coordinated read or write on the presented file can deadlock. To prevent this situation, call presentedItemURL to remove the file presenter in the applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) method or in response to a UIApplicationDidEnterBackground notification. Call presentedItemOperationQueue to add the file presenter again in the applicationWillEnterForeground(_:) method or in response to a UIApplicationWillEnterForeground notification.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsfilepresenter\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nRead the paragraph. Notice “Call presentedItemOperationQueue to add the file presenter again” does not make sense here. \n\nExpected Results:\n\n“Call addFilePresenter(_:) to add the file presenter again”\n\nActual Results:\n\n““Call presentedItemOperationQueue to add the file presenter again”“\n\nRegression:\n\nOccurs in the documentation bundled with Xcode 8.2.1.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe NSFileCoordinator documentation https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsfilecoordinator has the same paragraph with the correct reference to addFilePresenter(_:)."
