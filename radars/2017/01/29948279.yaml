        Summary:
        NSURL and NSURLComponents don’t support internationalized domains. WebKit already supports them, and from what I’ve been able to find it uses libicucore, which is available to developers, but some headers are stripped for some reason.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Run this code

        print(URL(string: "http://❤️❤️❤️.ws"))
        var components = URLComponents()
        components.scheme = "http"
        components.host = "❤️❤️❤️.ws"
        components.url?.absoluteString
        print(components.url!)

        Expected Results:

        It should print http://xn--qeiaa.ws/ twice

        Actual Results:

        The first one prints nil as it fails to create the NSURL.
        The NSURLComponents one uses percent-escaping for the host, which seems to work in WebKit, but loads a different site when used with NSURLSession
