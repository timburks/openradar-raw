    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8.3 reports its Swift version as \"3.0\" rather than the expected \"3.1\". This makes it hard to conditionally compile portions of Swift code depending on the Swift version.\r\n\r\nSwift 3.1 aims to be a source-compatible release with Swift 3.0.x, but in practice, that's not the case: https://twitter.com/simjp/status/824682896879292416\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to guarantee full source compatibility, so even if the differences that I'm aware of are addressed, there will likely be others, so having a way to conditionally compile code is critical.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n/Applications/Xcode-8.3.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift --version \r\nApple Swift version 3.0 (swiftlang-802.0.27.2 clang-802.0.27.2)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-macosx10.9\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode 8.3 should report a Swift version of 3.1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 8.3 reports a Swift version of 3.0.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
