    description: "There are 133 iMessage Signing Keys Private, 133 iMessage Signing Keys Public, 133 iMessage Encryption Keys Private, 133 iMessage Encryption Keys Public - that's a TOTAL OF 532 KEYS! \r\n\r\nI understand that iMessage may need one key per known device, but I have only 3 devices (two Macs and one iPhone). And these cannot be keys from my iMessage contacts as if they were from contacts, I would hardly have the private keys, right? I also understand it if iMessage changes these keys maybe once a while, e.g. once every year or maybe every 6 months for security reasons but it looks as if these keys get changed on every reboot! Please excuse my wording, but that's nuts!"
