    description: "From your documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/WorkingwithConstraintsinInterfaceBuidler.html\r\n\r\n\"In Interface Builder, you can set whether the view’s margins represent the layout margins or the readable content guide. Select the view (typically the view controller’s root view), and open the Size inspector. If you select the Follow Readable Width checkbox, any constraints drawn to the view’s margins use the readable content guide instead.\"\r\n\r\nThis is definitely not the case as I see no such flag when selecting the UIView at the root of the UIViewController in the scene."
