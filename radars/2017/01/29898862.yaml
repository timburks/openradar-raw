    description: "Summary:\r\nI live in Germany and use German iTunes Account. I don't speak German and don't enjoy German music (sorry :(!). Apple Music keeps suggesting me german authors and puts their music into \"curated playlists\" like \"Today's Hits\", \"The A-List: Pop\" etc etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use non-US Apple ID\r\n2. Try to use Apple Music suggestions to find new music.\r\n3. Be dissappointed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like a way to change the country for which the playlists are generated? I know Spotify had \"Top 100: $COUNTRYNAME\" or similar. I'd like something like that.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSO. MUCH. GERMAN. RAP.\r\nJUST. NO."
