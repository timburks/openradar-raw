    description: When in an interactive transition while rotating the device, UINavigationController has disabled interface rotation and rotates only after the interactive transition ends. As far as I can tell, this is done through `-[UIWindow beginDisablingInterfaceAutorotation]` and `-[UIWindow endDisablingInterfaceAutorotation]`. These methods should be public as they would help a lot when dealing with custom container view controllers that have a similar look than `UINavigationController`. This is not only about the fact that itâ€™s hard to deal with gestures while the device is rotating, but it would also benefit the user experience if container view controllers could prevent rotation while the user is interactively doing something to the views.
