        Summary:
        The attached project does not build with Swift 3.1. MusicVector and MusicMagnitude reference each other (Vectors have Magnitude and Magnitudes can be extracted from Vectors) and, as far as I can tell, this cyclical relationship is causing an issue with compilation where Magnitude is not seen as an associatedType on Vector.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Build the attached project with Xcode beta 8.3

        Expected Results:
        Successful build.

        Actual Results:
        Build fails with the message that `'Self' does not have a member type named 'Magnitude'; did you mean 'Iteratorâ€™?` etc

        Regression:
        Does not occur with Xcode 8.2.1 (Swift 3.0.1)

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
