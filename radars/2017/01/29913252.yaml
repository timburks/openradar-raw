    description: "Area:\r\nReminders\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a reminder about a webpage is created from Safari via Siri (by asking, for example, 'remind me about this' while Safari is the focused window), or using the share menu (Share > Reminders), the created reminder will open in Google Chrome if it is installed, even if Safari is the default browser.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Google Chrome, and open it at least once. Ensure Safari remains the default browser.\r\n2. Open Safari, and navigate to a webpage\r\n3. Create a new reminder about the current page. Either:\r\n    • Invoke Siri, and ask 'remind me about this'\r\n    • Use the share menu to create a reminder (Share > Reminders)\r\n4. Open Reminders\r\n5. Note that the created reminder has a Google Chrome icon next to it.\r\n6. Click the Google Chrome icon\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the notification:\r\n7. Schedule the reminder created in the previous steps for a time in the near future\r\n8. Wait for the reminder notification to appear\r\n9. Click the 'open in Google Chrome' button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• The created reminder should open in either the browser that created it, or the default browser, and should show the correct icon for that browser\r\n• The notification pop-up for one of these reminder should also open in the correct browser\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• The created reminder opens in Google Chrome rather than Safari or the default browser when the icon next to it is clicked\r\n• The notification pop-up also opens in Google Chrome when the action button is clicked\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPartial workaround: clicking the blue link under the reminder in the reminders list does open it in the default browser, but this link only links to the root domain of the created link, so the actual page linked is not available in this way.\r\n\r\nMoving Chrome to the trash and emptying it will fix this issue after Reminders is re-opened, until Chrome is next installed and re-opened.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nGoogle Chrome must be installed, and have been opened at least once. Tested with Google Chrome 55.0.2883.95."
