    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode, in storyboard editor if you attempt to use the new \"View as\" feature at the bottom, when you change size class (device or orientation) then a map view with constraints does not update to its new position.\r\n\r\nSo say you have a View controller and drag a map view into its view, and then set the 4 constraints to make it match the size of the parent view. If you use the View as feature to change device or orientation the map view does not update, it just stays where it is. UIView, UIImageView, UITableView all don't have this behaviour, only MKMapView hence must be a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode \r\n2. File->New Project, iOS, Single View Application, Language: ObjC, Devices: iPhone.\r\n3. Open Main.storyboard\r\n4. Drag Map Kit View into the displayed view, from Object Library at bottom right.\r\n5. Resize Map View to fill parent view.\r\n6. From bottom bar choose \"Add new constraints\"\r\n7. Click all the red lines and ensure the numbers are all zero.\r\n8. Click the View as Iphone in bottom bar to expand bottom bar to show devices and orientations (size classes)\r\n9. Click orientation landscape\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMap View should update its position and size to be fill the parent view, since that is what the constraints are.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMap View remains where it was and no longer reflects the constraints. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo experience the correct behaviour, try the steps to reproduce again using a Image View.\r\n\r\nAttached images:\r\n\r\nScreenshot 1: shows map view in initial position\r\nScreenshot 2: shows map view has not updated after orientation change.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screenshot 2.png' and 'Screenshot 1.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nImages shared here for Open Radar:\r\nhttps://postimg.org/gallery/1ug2xb7gg/f3b334a9/"
