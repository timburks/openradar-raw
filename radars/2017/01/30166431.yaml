    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a UICollectionViewController's size is changed to Freeform, Interface Builder warns that the UICollectionView is misplaced, even though the collection view's size should be identical to the its view controller's size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open or create a storyboard in an iOS project.\r\n2. Drag a UICollectionViewController from the Object Library onto the layout area.\r\n3. In the UICollectionViewController's Attributes Inspector, change the size from Fixed to Freeform.x\r\n4. In the UICollectionViewController's Size Inspector, change the height and width to something other than the default values.\r\n5. Observe that there's now a warning in the view hierarchy, complaining that the collection view's expected height is 320 x 480, but the actual size is the freeform size of the view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause the UICollectionView is the root view of a UICollectionViewController, its size should be identical to the UICollectionViewController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInterface Builder warns that the expected size of the collection view is 320 x 480 (regardless of which device size is being used to view the layout), but the actual size is the size that was set explicitly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS simulator on iPad Air 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac OS X 10.11.6 (15G1212)\r\nXcode 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
