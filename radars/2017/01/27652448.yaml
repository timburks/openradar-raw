    description: "Area:\r\nMessages Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have the need to know when the view changes size, such as when the user changes orientation of the device (so I can adjust the size of my cells in a collectionView).\r\n\r\nIf you look at my test project you will see the main app behaves as expected by watching the print statements in the console. However the message extension does not print anything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. uncompress and build the attached test project.\r\n2. Run the Message Extension scheme to see that no print statements are output when the device is rotated.\r\n3. Run the main app to see that the same methods work fine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIViewController.viewWillTransition(to:with:) should get called when an iPad is rotated, or even when the view controller is first displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo output\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1, Xcode 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2"
