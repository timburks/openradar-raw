    description: "Mail correctly doesn't fetch images from mails marked as spam. This is important to prevent tracking of spam mails.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a spam mail is then deleted and later viewed from the Trash folder, the images ARE loaded from the remote server allowing the spammer to track the user."
