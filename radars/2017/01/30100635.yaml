        Summary:
        In a UITabBarController, that encloses a UINavigationController, that encloses a UITableViewController that presents a UISearchController, when the results controller is presented, its bottom edge inset will be incorrect when the keyboard animates into view.

        Also, in landscape mode, the top scrollIndicatorInsets are incorrect.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open and run the attached sample project. The project includes two tabs: one with a search controller that is presented on tapping a bar button item, one that includes a search bar as the table view header view.

        Expected Results:
        The content insets as well as the scrollIndicatorInsets should be correct at all times.

        Actual Results:
        In both tabs, when opening the search and typing the first letter (so the keyboard comes up), the bottom contentInset is wrong (49 pt too large). When turning to landscape, the top scrollIndicatorInset is too large (although the top contentInset is correct).

        Notes:
        I've experimented with different choices which view controller sets "definesPresentationContext". In the current state of the project, the content view controllers define the context. When moving the flag to the navigation controllers or the tab bar controller (which should equally work imo), even weirder effects with the contentInset can be observed. Sometimes the top insets are wrong, sometimes the bottom insets are wrong and sometimes the bottom insets with hidden keyboard are wrong.
