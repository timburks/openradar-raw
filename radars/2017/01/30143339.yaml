    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a CALayer has a speed set to a value lower than 1, frames are dropped when it animates (unless iOS is displaying a double height status bar)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure your iOS device is not in a mode where it would display a double height status bar\r\n2. Create a UIView\r\n3. Set its layer’s speed to 0.1f\r\n4. Add the view to the view hierarchy\r\n5. Animate the view’s position\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view animates smoothly from one position to another 10 times slower than the duration set on the animation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view animates to the new position but 90% of the frames are dropped\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSample project available at: https://github.com/prendio2/calayer-speed-bug/\r\nReproduced on iPhone 6S running iOS 10.2, 5S running 10.2, and 5S running 10.0.2\r\nTested on iPad mini running iOS 9.3.5 and the issue does not reproduce there\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- If you put the iOS device in a mode where it has a double height status bar (start GPS directions or a phone call for example) then the animation runs smoothly (and this is the case whether the app is currently displaying the status bar or not)\r\n- This behaviour also effects transition if you set the completionSpeed on UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition which I presume is in turn setting the CALayer speed"
