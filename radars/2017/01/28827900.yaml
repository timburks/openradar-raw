    description: "Summary:\r\nOn Safari 10.0 if an event handler is specified on JavaScript's XMLHTTPRequest upload object during a POST to a digest protected resource, the POST fails and is not completed. It appears to happen on Mobile Safari on the latest version of iOS as well.\r\n\r\nBasic authentication works OK. This only fails with Digest authentication.\r\n\r\nSee attached file \"xhr-upload-event.html\". Removing the req.upload.onerror function allows the POST to be made successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an HTTP digest protected resource\r\n2) Write an XHR request with an event handler on upload to the digest protected resource\r\n3) Attempt to run the request using Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe POST is made, or an error is returned\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe POST hangs\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac Mini, MacOS Sierra 10.12, Safari 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10)\r\niPad model MD513B/A, version 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRegular setup of Safari and Mobile Safari on iOS"
