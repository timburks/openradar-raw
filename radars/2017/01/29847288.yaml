    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's not possible to detect when a file copied to an app through iTunes is completely transferred rather than partially. To achieve this, please make the device coordinate its writes using the NSFileCoordinator/NSFilePresenter API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the xcode project\r\n2. Launch the app on a device (not simulator). This app is using NSFileCoordinator/Presenter to watch the Documents folder.\r\n3. Use iTunes to transfer a file to the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nregistered NSFilePresenter should be notified about the change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPresenter is not notified.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10"
