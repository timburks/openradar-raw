    description: "Area:\r\nSetup Assistant\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm starting to get a lot of new Macs shipping with DEP enabled and while they are added to a particular PreStage, they do not immediately pick up that it's required as part of the Setup Assistant flow.\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, this isn't great for a touch-free deployment of Macs. I either need to be present to guide employees or send them detailed instructions for setting their Macs up for the first time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure Mac is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment via MDM of choice (in our case JAMF Pro)\r\n2. Boot brand new Mac for first time (or wipe Mac and re-install operating system\r\n3. Proceed through Setup Assistant\r\n4. Connect to wifi when prompted and click Continue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be presented with Setup Assistant page informing them that their Mac is going to be managed by the particular company after which they should need to authenticate with LDAP (as set in the PreStage)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is presented with the normal Setup Assistant and can proceed to transfer data/setup as new Mac without enrolling in the MDM.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA video of this can be seen here https://cultureamp.wistia.com/medias/gaiq4f540s\r\n\r\nIn order for the Mac to see that it is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment, once the user connected to wifi for the first time and clicks continue, when they hit the Transfer your Data page, they need to click back, connect to wifi and hit continue again. \r\n\r\nThe second time they do this, the Mac sees that it is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment and the Setup Assistant flows as expected with the Mac being enrolled in the MDM\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on brand new 2016 TouchBar enabled macs (13\" & 15\"). Additionally I can reproduce on Macs that are 1-2 years old.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
