    description: "The documentation for WKSnapshotRefreshBackgroundTask method setTaskCompleted(restoredDefaultState:estimatedSnapshotExpiration:userInfo:) parameter estimatedSnapshotExpiration says to \"Use nil if the next snapshot needs to be scheduled as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nestimatedSnapshotExpiration is declared as Date, as opposed to an optional Date?, so passing nil is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations:\r\nEngineering has the following feedback for you:\r\n\r\nThat is on purpose.  It was discussed during API review and decided that it is better to make developers think about this value than providing any default (there is no good default essentially).\r\n\r\nThis value controls when you will next get to run as an app, so passing nil, which i would interrept as “I don’t care” seems invalid.  You should care when you next run, even if you decide that is “never” you still care.  \r\n\r\nThe header for this method has a comment that explains this a little more.  In this case, if this dev thinks their app should never run again then they follow this direction from that comment:\r\n\r\n“Use [NSDate distantFuture] if the snapshot doesn't need to be replaced.”\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback. Engineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you just have questions about the resolution, then please update your bug report with that information so we can respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy response:\r\n\r\nThat sounds great, but please remove this line from the documentation if nil is not a valid parameter value:\r\n\r\n\"Use nil if the next snapshot needs to be scheduled as soon as possible.\""
