    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the XCTest framework it currently doesn’t seem possible to simply scroll to an element that’s off the screen. It’s possible to do a number of swipeUp or swipeDowns, but that way you risk swiping over the element. The number of swipes will always be an arbitrary number. It would be good to be able to test if an element exists in a tableView or collectionView, and if so, to be able to scroll to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee Summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee Summary\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsee Summary\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs in all iOS 10.x versions, potentially also in lower versions and/or on macOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to create a loop, and keep swiping up or down until the element is found, but tbh, I think it would be better if this was part of the XCTest framework\r\n\r\nAn example of a workaround can be found here: http://averagepro.com/2016/02/12/more-xctest-ut-testing-a-helper-function-to-scroll-to-a-cell-in-a-uicollectionview/"
