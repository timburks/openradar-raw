    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen our app kicks off a SKReceiptRefreshRequest and the user doesn't have billing info associated with the account, we receive an SKPaymentTransactionState.Failed event (as expected). But then, after the user updates the billing information and completes the purchase, we never receive the SKPaymentTransactionState.Purchased event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove your billing information from an apple account.\r\n2. Try to make a subscription purchase in the app with that apple account.\r\n3. Observe that the app never receives the correct callback and never creates a login for the user, even though the purchase succeeds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the app to receive the SKPaymentTransactionState.Purchased so that it can process the transaction by creating a login for the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app never receives the SKPaymentTransactionState.Purchased event, so the user is left having purchases a subscription, but without a way to login.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nios9 and io10. Not tested on ios8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis thread seems to describe the issue: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/20194. Many people are complaining that it has recurred this week."
