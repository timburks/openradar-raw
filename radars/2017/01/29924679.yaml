        Summary:
        When using the Messages.app to share a Live Photo to an Action Extension, the extension system tells the extension that a public.image is shared. When retrieving the item as URL, a URL with the .jpg extension is handed to the extension. Messages should share the live photo and should advertise the fallback jpeg as public.jpeg.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Install the sample project on an actual device / run the ImageSharing target on that device
        - Go to Messages.app
        - Open a Live Photo
        - Tap the action button
        - Tap the ImageSharing action extension

        Expected Results:
        The image is shown in the appearing view controller from the action extension.

        Actual Results:
        An error is shown, telling you that only an arbitrary image was shared.

        Regression:
