    description: "Summary:\nIn a UITabBarController, that encloses a UINavigationController, that encloses a UITableViewController that presents a UISearchController, the contentInset of the presenting view controller is not restored correctly in case of interface rotation on a different tab.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen and run the attached sample project. The project includes two tabs: one with a search controller that is presented on tapping a bar button item, one that includes a search bar as the table view header view.\n\n- In the first tab, open search, type a letter then dismiss the keyboard by tapping the Search key\n- Switch to the second tab and do the same\n- Turn to landscape\n- Switch back to the first tab and close search by tapping \"Cancel\"\n\nExpected Results:\n- The top contentInset of the presenting view controller should be correct (height of landscape navigation bar).\n\nActual Results:\n- The top contentInset now is too small (0) and the first table cell underlaps the navigation bar.\n\nSee also: \nrdar://30100635 UISearchController sets incorrect contentInset, scrollIndicatorInsets"
