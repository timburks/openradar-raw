    description: "Area:\r\nSetup Assistant\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMacs do not consistently apply the DEP enrolment at the setup assistant\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure Mac is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment via MDM of choice (in our case JAMF Pro)\r\n2. Boot brand new Mac for first time (or wipe Mac and re-install operating system\r\n3. Proceed through Setup Assistant\r\n4. Connect to wifi when prompted and click Continue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be presented with Setup Assistant page informing them that their Mac is going to be managed by the particular company after which they should need to authenticate with LDAP (as set in the PreStage)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is presented with the normal Setup Assistant and can proceed to transfer data/setup as new Mac without enrolling in the MDM.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 16C67\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn order for the Mac to see that it is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment, once the user connected to wifi for the first time and clicks continue, when they hit the Transfer your Data page, they need to click back, connect to wifi and hit continue again. \r\n\r\nThe second time they do this, the Mac sees that it is assigned to a PreStage Enrolment and the Setup Assistant flows as expected with the Mac being enrolled in the MDM\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nbug occurring consistently on all machines\r\n\r\nimpacting over 3000 machines on our customers fleet"
