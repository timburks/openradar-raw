        The reachability callback and getting the flags directly get stuck at 0

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Run simulator (w/ WiFi internet)
        2) Turn off WiFi (flags will go to 0)
        3) Turn on WiFi

        Expected Results:
        Flags callback goes to reachable

        Actual Results:
        Flags callback stays at 0
        (Also, getting flags will also return 0)
