    description: "When connected to an LG UltraFine series (4 or 5K version) monitor, volume step-changes are too significant in comparison to any other form of audio output.\r\n\r\nThe first 2 bars represent a huge difference in audible volume compared to the output of headphones, speakers, BlueTooth earpieces etc. making the key controls unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a late 2016 MacBook Pro to an LG UltraFine 4K or 5K monitor.\r\n2. Play some audio.\r\n3. Use the keyboard volume controls or drag the TouchBar control the alter the volume.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGradual increase/descrease in volume similar to those experienced via other connected audio devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSignificant changes in volume going from very quiet to very loud within 1-2 clicks of visual scale. The top volume is far too loud for any environment and distorts terribly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue was reported initially to LG who accepted no responsibility. I've seen been through Apple Support and to an Apple Store where the situation was replayed with different MacBook and LG display configurations, all with the same outcome. No one is sure if this is a hardware, monitor/MacBook firmware, or macOS issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\nLG UltraFine 4K Display\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2"
