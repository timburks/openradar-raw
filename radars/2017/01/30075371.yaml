    description: "Area:\r\nPassKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe would like to do the following:\r\nConstruct a PKPaymentRequest without providing billing or shipping contact details.\r\nDetermine if the user already has contact details from a previous use of Apple Pay.\r\nIf they do not, then provide contact details from our own user account.\r\nWe get an immediate call back that the user has changed shipping contact, and so can check if the user has Apple Pay provided contact details, but cannot then provide new contact details instead as the auth sheet has already been presented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Construct a PKPaymentRequest without a shippingContact.\r\n2) Present Payment Authorisation View Controller\r\n3) Receive delegate callback that the user did change shipping contact\r\n4) Shipping contact is insufficient.\r\n5) We have user details from the users account \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCan provide updated details to the PKPaymentRequest that will be presented within the payment authorisation sheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to affect the payment authorisation sheet once it has been presented.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Pay enabled device"
