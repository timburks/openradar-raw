    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBecause sandbox accounts don't actually have billing info, there appears to be no way to test failure scenarios such as missing or invalid billing information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a sandbox user\r\n2. Make an in-app purchase with the sandbox user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like to be able to test failure scenarios around billing/payment info.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe purchase always succeeds. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall ios versions\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWithout this enhancement, we can only test these scenarios in production, which is less than ideal."
