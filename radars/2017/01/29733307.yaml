    description: "Very often when typing near the bottom of a file, the Xcode code editor will jump around and take focus away from the line I'm editing. See attached video. Saving often triggers that but sometimes it also happens just because the editor updates the syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust edit a file near its bottom."
