    description: "Summary:\r\nSince the web iTunes store first started supporting apps there has always been an \"View in iTunes\" button. This was useful when we still arranged apps and synced via iTunes but no longer reflects how users install apps. There is likely a massive loss of app downloads due to the friction getting from iTunes web app link to actual device, not to mention a barrage of alternative solutions that have privacy implications (text me link services, 3rd party link slingshot apps, etc). \U0001F61F\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen any app link (ex. https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id962969578) \U0001F62C\r\nObserve that the only available action is \"View in iTunes\" \U0001F630\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a solution for opening the app's App Store listing on their native device \U0001F60C\r\n…or an option to bookmark/wish-list it \U0001F913\r\n…or a proactive suggestion in iOS (think Handoff) \U0001F914\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere isn't a user-friendly nor actionable way to download the app on the user's device. \U0001F624\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile it's true that downloading the app in iTunes is one way to trigger an automatic download on device, these days most users probably want to avoid the extra steps of opening and waiting for iTunes to load in order to manage their iDevices (additionally many users don't know that they likely have automatic downloads turned on in the first place and may want to view the listing on their device before downloading anyway).\r\n\r\nIt's also true that iCloud clipboard could be used, but again this is a power feature most users opening iTunes links don't know about and itself can be less than speedy  and reliable in its current form.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to consider this! I have no doubt that users would raptly rejoice at this improvement, as would developers and those on the App Store due to a less \"leaky\" download funnel.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
