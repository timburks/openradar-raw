    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://30170477\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe addition of `SKStoreReviewController` is nice to see, however the documentation states \"it is not appropriate for use from a button or other user action\".\r\n\r\nPlease add the ability for developers to offer users a way to self-initiate the new rating/review alert dialog. Specifically, I would like to place a \"Rate this app\" button in my settings screen that the user can tap if they want.\r\n\r\nI understand that Apple does not want developers to be able to force this alert dialog open whenever they want, so perhaps the SDK gains a `UIReviewButton` that the app includes in their view hierarchy. Apple can ensure that this button can only be interacted with from the user (likely running out of process), and when tapped, it displays the rating alert dialog."
