        Summary:
        The rating star groups in the album view are horizontally misaligned when song durations have inconsistent amounts of digits. This makes them look bad.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In album view open the details of any album that contains songs with durations summarized with different amounts of digits (e.g. four minute song and a ten minute song).

        Expected Results:
        Star groupings are aligned to themselves, not the leading digit of a song’s duration.

        Actual Results:
        Star groupings appear to be aligned to the leading digit of a song’s duration, leading to inconsistent horizontal placement.

        Regression:
        None known.
