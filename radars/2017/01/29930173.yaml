    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the temperature is slightly below zero, Siri rounds to zero but neglects to take off the negative sign. It does this in one place in the output, but shows it properly in another place. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask Siri for the temperature somewhere where it is slightly below zero.\r\n2. Observe the two different temperatures reported in Siri's output: -0 and 0. Note that it is correct in the summary text at the top of the screenshot, but in the Weather \"card\" below it shows the negative sign.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth would report 0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne reports -0 (not a number), the other 0.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis has been present as far as I know of since (at least) iOS 7. I am currently running 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUnsure if this is actually a Siri problem, or a Weather.app problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s."
