    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI am implementing CloudKit syncing in both macOS and iOS editions of an app.  The syncing works as expected on both, and the iOS app successfully receives push notifications of changes, but the macOS one does not.\r\n\r\nSee this bug report (by someone else) for code that demonstrates this issue: rdar://23804473\r\n\r\nThat bug report was for 10.11, but I am experiencing this issue on 10.12.2, so I assume it hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n\r\nIs there any workaround?  I tried an idea someone suggested, of setting the soundName to an empty string, but that didn't help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEnable CloudKit syncing in the project settings.\r\n\r\nSave a CloudKit subscription.\r\n\r\nRegister for remote notifications via:\r\n\r\n[NSApp registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:NSRemoteNotificationTypeNone];\r\n\r\nSuccessfully get the token in:\r\n\r\n-application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:\r\n\r\nNever get a notification via:\r\n\r\n-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:\r\n\r\nSee that other bug report for details.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: gets called when a change is made on another device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification: is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\nmacOS version 10.12.2 (16C67).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nRelated rdar://23804473"
