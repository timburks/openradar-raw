        Summary:
        implementing `&&` and `||` on SatExpression seems to throw the compiler off. I receive `&& is not defined for two Bool operands` in the official Xcode toolchain and a bunch of `!= is ambiguous` in the 2017-01-20 snapshot.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        build the attached project in Xcode 8.2.1	

        Expected Results:
        Successful build	

        Actual Results:
        Type errors
