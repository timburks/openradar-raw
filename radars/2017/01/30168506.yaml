    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using token-based authentication in the APNs development environment, the APNs server will respond with HTTP/500 (`InternalServerError`) when sending notifications after a connection has been idle for more than an hour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a connection to a development-environment APNs server without TLS client authentication (i.e. in \"token authentication\" mode).\r\n2. Send a notification with an authentication token.\r\n3. Leave the connection idle (except for HTTP/2 `PING` frames) for more than an hour.\r\n4. Send a second notification with the same authentication token as the first notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe APNs server takes one of three actions:\r\n\r\n1. Some time in the idle period, the server closes the connection with an HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frame.\r\n2. After the second notification is sent, the APNs server accepts the notification.\r\n3. After the second notification is sent, the APNs server rejects the notification for a specific reason (e.g. `ExpiredProviderToken`).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the second notification is sent, the APNs server responds with `InternalServerError`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue appears to affect multiple APNs providers on multiple platforms, and so it seems unlikely that the issue is a bug in a specific provider library. Some examples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/relayrides/pushy/issues/408\r\n- https://github.com/node-apn/node-apn/issues/449\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nToken-based authentication in the development APNs environment\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
