    description: "Xcode 8.3 beta throws a build error when building for running on the device:\r\n\r\n\"WhereTo\" has conflicting settings for automatic signing. Bundle identifiers differ across build configurations. Make these settings the same for each build configuration to continue using automatic signing, or switch to manual signing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem because we need different bundle identifiers to run the production and debug version of the app simultaneously on the device. And of course we don't want to go back to manual code signing hell!"
