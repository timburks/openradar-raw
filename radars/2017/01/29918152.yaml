    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting UICollectionViewFlowLayout.sectionHeadersPinToVisibleBounds makes section headers pin to visible bounds. Unfortunately, this breaks while fast scrolling and inserting new UICollectionView cells at the same time. See recorded `fast_scroll.mov` and sample project `CollecionViewTestApp.zip` used in that recording. The problem happens more often and is better visible when item cells have a lot of subviews and autolayout constraints.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open example project.\r\n2. Run it on iOS device or simulator.\r\n3. Try to scroll really fast.\r\n4. See section header glitches.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSection header should always stick to visible bounds no matter what.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSection header sometimes unpins from visible bounds for a while.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'fast_scroll.mov' and 'CollecionViewTestApp.zip' were successfully uploaded."
