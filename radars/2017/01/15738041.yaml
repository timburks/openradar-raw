    description: "Summary: When the temperature is slightly below zero, Siri rounds to zero but neglects to take off the negative sign. It does this in one place in the output, but shows it properly in another place. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Ask Siri for the temperature somewhere where it is slightly below zero.\r\n2. Observe the two different temperatures reported in Siri's output: -0 and 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Both places would conform and report 0 degrees.\r\n\r\nActual Results: One says -0 and the other says 0.\r\n\r\nVersion: 7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration: iPhone 4S"
