    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to official documentation, the UIView class disables layer animations by default but reenables them inside animation blocks.\r\nHowever, this behavior does not work as expected. In addition, actionForLayer:forKey: return NSNull (which effectively block implicit animation) both inside and outside of UIView's animation blocks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIView's animation block and modify any animatable property on the backing-layer of the view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe layer will perform an implicit animation of the property for 0.25 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layer immediately change the view's presentation of the property without any animation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, iOS 10, and possibly anything after 2014\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEither this is a bug or the official documentation on Core Animation must update the expected behavior (e.g: Backing-layer no longer perform implicit animation inside/outside of UIView's animation blocks\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.2.1, iOS 9 / 10 Devices"
