    description: "Summary:\r\nIf when you use the \"Create NSManagedObject subclass\" in Xcode's model editor you have Codegen set to anything other than manual/none, then the header that is generated has \"This file was automatically generated and should not be edited\" in it. However this isn't applicable to the file being created, that statement is only applicable to the files that Xcode creates for when code gen is turned on. \r\n\r\nIt would also be useful when the subclass is generated for codegen to be automatically turned off if it was on, since once the developer generates the subclass they certainly do not want any further code generation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create iOS master detail project with core data turned on.\r\n2. Open the xcdatamodel\r\n3. Choose Editor->Create NSManagedObjecrtSubclass\r\n3. In file browser open the project subfolder (why is this necessary?)\r\n4. Save the files.\r\n5. Move the generated class files into the group (why is this necessary?)\r\n6. Open any of the files and view the comment at top.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShouldn't say do not edit this file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSays do not edit this file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2.1 (8C1002)"
