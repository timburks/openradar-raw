    description: "I am using a MacBook Pro late 2016 on a desk, closed,with an external USB-C monitor. If I choose to disconnect the USB-C monitor (the Apple-preferred LG UltraFine model) whilst the MacBook is sleeping, when waking the MacBook up later the graphics will either be corrupted (glitchy, unstable) or show the wrong screen/space and be unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Whilst MacBook is closed and sleeping (not powered off) connect USB-C display\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Connect USB-C display to MacBook Pro\r\n2. Sleep MacBook Pro\r\n3. Disconnect USB-C display whilst sleeping\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn wake the Mac should respond to the current state and present the OS as configured across available display(s).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe MacBook will show either glitch graphics (small elements of screen repeatedly redraw over each other on any significant mouse movement etc.) or a darkened version of the desktop is seen, as if it's showing a secondary monitors output. I've yet to find a way of getting out of this environment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhenever the Mac ends up in this state I have to do a full power cycle of the MacBook to recover. I have developed a workaround since finding out how to reliable reproduce - I ensure the Mac is always awake and open before connecting/disconnecting a display.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2\r\nLG UltraFine 4K"
