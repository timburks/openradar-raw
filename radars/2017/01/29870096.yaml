    description: "Summary:\nImmediately after connecting my Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard wit a lightning cable, they show up under the poetic names of “Magic Keyboard” and “Magic Trackpad 2”. There are no other keyboards or trackpads nearby. I named my keyboard and trackpad differently (“Whakkee’s Trackpad” and “Whakkee’s Keyboard”.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open laptop, to wake it up from sleep (mid 2014 rMBP 13”)\n2. Attach trackpad and keyboard to laptop via lightning cable (which was attached to 27” Cinema Display)\n3. See that the names are not correct \n\n\nExpected Results:\nI expected to see the names I named my trackpad and keyboard\n\nActual Results:\nInstead I saw generic names - I think “Magic Trackpad 2” was it’s previous name, the keyboard name is so generic, no idea, but that might also be the previous one\n\nRegression:\nI’ve seen it sometimes, but not consequently\n\nNotes:\nI use the keyboard and trackpad with my work laptop (mid 2014 rMBP, 15”, i7) sometimes too, it mostly happens when they were connected to that computer before and they’re being switched back to my own laptop.\nI’ll include screenshots of what this looks like."
