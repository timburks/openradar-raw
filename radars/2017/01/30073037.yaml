    description: "Summary:\nWhen using UIImageJPEGRepresentation to get the NSData of a UIImage backed by a CGImage having kCGImageAlphaNone, there is a memory leak.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open the attached TestLeak project\n2. Run Instruments, and measure leaks. \n3. Observe the leak of the CGImage.\n\nExpected Results:\nNo leaks.\n\nActual Results:\nA CGImage is leaking.\n\nNotes:\nThe leak appears when getting the NSData out of a kCGImageAlphaNone buffer. If I change the buffer format to kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast, there is no leak (see example project which demonstrate the two versions). However, the documentation claims that these two flags are equivalent: “kCGImageAlphaNone: There is no alpha channel. If the total size of the pixel is greater than the space required for the number of color components in the color space, the least significant bits are ignored. This value is equivalent to kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast.”\n\nBased on this, it sounds to me that this is an issue in UIImageJPEGRepresentation where a code path is missing a CGImageRelease. This is also confirmed by the Leaks instruments (see screenshot)."
