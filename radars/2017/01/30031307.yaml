    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe current APIs for HomeKit enabled devices, i.e. the HomeKit framework, is limited to iOS, tvOS and watchOS.\r\n\r\nBy providing a public API that is not limited to iOS, e.g. a HTTP REST interface hosted on the Apple TV, developers can create software that utilize HomeKit enabled accessories to create a truly connected home.\r\n\r\nSuch an API should enable developers to create applications for other platforms than iOS and OS X using other languages than Swift and Objective-C. Examples of this include applications written in Node.js, Python and Ruby. \r\nThese applications would benefit from existing HomeKit technology to provide even more advanced features to consumers.\r\n\r\nEnabling HomeKit on the Apple TV allows iOS to communicate with HomeKit enabled accessories remotely. Opening this technology or similar to developers would likely solve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy HomeKit enabled accessories.\r\n2. Configure HomeKit on a fourth generation Apple TV.\r\n3. Hope to be able to communicate with HomeKit accessories through the Apple TV using other technologies than iOS/macOS and Swift/Objective-C.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCommunicate with HomeKit accessories through the Apple TV using other technologies than iOS/macOS and Swift/Objective-C.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCommunication with HomeKit accessories is only possible using the HomeKit framework.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2,\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ntvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 with multiple HomeKit accessories, e.g. the Elgato Eve Room and Elgato Eve Weather."
