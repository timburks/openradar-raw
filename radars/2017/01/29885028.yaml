    description: "Area:\r\nNotifications\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApp notifications aren't always welcome. They can be downright annoying. When an app shows a local or push notification on your device, that would be the perfect time for a user to be able to disable them...right?\r\n\r\nA quick, on-notification, way to disable app notifications should be added to iOS (and OS X while we're at it). A simple swipe action on the notification could expose a button that would allow the user to kill local and/or push notifications from that app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Get a notification\r\n2) Try to turn them off quickly & intuitively\r\n3) Be frustrated \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) See a notification from an app you don't want\r\n2) Swipe right\r\n3) See the cool \"turn off local/push notifications\" button\r\n4) Push button\r\n5) Never be bugged again on that device from that app\r\n6) Pour an adult beverage & be happy with life\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't currently disable notifications when a notification occurs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iOS versions\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLocal and push notifications should both be easily disabled. You can have the ability to turn them back on in Settings/Notifications.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
