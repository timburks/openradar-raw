    description: "Peter Steinberger\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the Messages.app to share a Live Photo to an Action Extension, the extension system tells the extension that a public.image is shared. When retrieving the item as URL, a URL with the .jpg extension is handed to the extension. Messages should share the live photo and should advertise the fallback jpeg as public.jpeg.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install the sample project on an actual device / run the ImageSharing target on that device\r\n- Go to Messages.app\r\n- Open a Live Photo\r\n- Tap the action button\r\n- Tap the ImageSharing action extension\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image is shown in the appearing view controller from the action extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error is shown, telling you that only an arbitrary image was shared.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMirror for samples: https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com/tree/master/29924679%20-%20MessagesLivePhotoImageSharing\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.2.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
