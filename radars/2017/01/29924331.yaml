        Summary:
        When using the Photos.app to share a Live Photo to an Action Extension, the extension system tells the extension that a live photo is there but it then can't be accessed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Install the sample project on an actual device / run the ImageSharing target on that device
        - Go to Photos.app
        - Open a Live Photo
        - Tap the action button
        - Tap the ImageSharing action extension

        Expected Results:
        The image is shown in the appearing view controller from the action extension.

        Actual Results:
        An error is shown, telling you that the item received was (null)

        Regression:
        The issue here is that `[itemProvider hasItemConformingToTypeIdentifier:(NSString *)kUTTypeLivePhoto]` returns `YES` but `loadItemForTypeIdentifier:(NSString *)kUTTypeLivePhoto options:nil completionHandler:...` calls the completion handler with a nil item.
