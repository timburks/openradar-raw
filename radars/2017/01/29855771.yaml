    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter connecting an external monitor the TouchBar volume and brightness sliders no longer appear when tapping their respective buttons. The buttons still show their pressed state (light background) when pressed, however no slider shows and the existing controls (both system controls and app controls) stay shown.\r\n\r\nA restart is required to get normal behaviour back, disconnecting the monitor is not enough.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an external monitor\r\n2. Press the volume or brightness slider buttons on the TouchBar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll system and app controls to hide and the slider to show.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem and app controls stay exactly as they are and the slider does not show.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)\r\n2.7 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3\r\nRadeon Pro 455 2048 MB\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
