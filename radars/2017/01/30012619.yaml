    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using custom class of `UITextView`, during tests I got this crash. Looks like it's general problem of `UITextView`. In most times crash occurs after 2-nd try of text selection. I think this scenario can kill most of the apps using `UITextView`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts app\r\n>> Apps open\r\n2. Tap on `+` icon in top right corner\r\n>> New Contact modal appears\r\n3. Scroll down to `Notes` section\r\n4. Type long word without spaces, eg: `qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq` (90 x `q` sign)\r\n5. Tap on text:\r\n>> Menu appears\r\n6. Choose `Select All` option\r\n>> All text selected\r\n7. Delete text\r\n>> Text deleted\r\n8. Repeat steps: 4, 5, 6\r\n>> App crashes after selecting all text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll text should be selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 64GB, using WiFi"
