    description: "Area:\r\nImage I/O\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCGImageProperties.h states that the symbol kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOriginal has been available since iOS 4. However, in iOS 9.3 (and likely earlier), the symbol kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOriginal is a private symbol and cannot be linked at runtime, and apps which reference this symbol crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app that uses the symbol kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOriginal\r\n2. Run it on iOS 9\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should work properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes on launch with the following text:\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: _kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOriginal\r\n  Referenced from: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/FCCC4DE8-8B78-4BAF-98F1-1584CD87D26C/Workflow.app/Frameworks/ContentKit.framework/ContentKit\r\n  Expected in: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/ImageIO\r\n in /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/FCCC4DE8-8B78-4BAF-98F1-1584CD87D26C/Workflow.app/Frameworks/ContentKit.framework/ContentKit\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this from occurring, kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOriginal should be marked as available in iOS 10.0 and later. On older systems developers must use the older, typo'd symbol, kCGImagePropertyExifSubsecTimeOrginal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
