    description: "Area:\r\nSystem, General\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI would like to be able to initiate OTA app installations on tvOS outside of TestFlight and the App Store. We've had this capability on iOS for several years, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent for tvOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to find a way to install an app over the air, without using TestFlight or the App Store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDiscover clearly documented method for performing an OTA app installation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFruitless Googling that leads to no feasible solution short of private APIs that require special entitlements.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV (4th Generation)"
