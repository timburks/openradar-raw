    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 introduced a separate Xcode 8 xib file format, which is automatically written always, once a xib file is saved. The corresponding Xcode panel allows to manually select Xcode 7.x compatible xib format, but then the file will be only saved and closed.\r\nOnce the file is opened again, by default it is saved again in Xcode 8 format.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue for any project which wants to use the latest Xcode for changing Xib files, but has a building infrastructure which builds the software with older Xcode versions.\r\nIf you save a xib in Xcode 8 format, it will fail to compile with any previous Xcode version.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open xib file in Xcode 8, which was created with Xcode 7.x\r\n2. Make changes\r\n3. Save file again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile is saved in Xcode 7.x format, file can be still compiled by older build setups based on Xcode 7\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFile is saved in Xcode 8 format and cannot be compiled anymore by older build setups\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.1 (8B62), macOS 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
