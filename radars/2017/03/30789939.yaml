    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be useful if, from the simctl CLI, you could change the simulated location of a iOS simulator. This would be useful for scripting, especially automation tests, where you aren't particularly launching from Xcode, so gpx files won't work, and you don't want to try and use AppleScript to change it in the Simulator.app UI\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an iOS simulator\r\n2. Attempt to script changing the location\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou could easily do this from `simctl booted location coordinates` or something similar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou cannot do this without the use of a private NSDistributedNotificationCenter notification\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've written a tool to use the private notification to do this in the meantime https://github.com/lyft/set-simulator-location"
