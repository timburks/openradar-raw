    description: "I previously had a paid developer account which I had about 3-5 devices on (not sure exactly how many). I have now been downgraded to a free developer account and can no longer deploy to my iPhone (new device - was not on the paid developer license).\r\n\r\nI have contacted developer support about this issue and received the feedback of -\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Apple Developer Program Support. My name is <redacted>, and I am happy to assist you today. I understand your concern regarding the difficulty to clear the list of the devices associated with your account <redacted>, and I regret any inconvenience it might have caused you. \r\n \r\nPlease note that the possibility to reset the list of devices of the developer account is active only for the Apple Developer Program memberships.\r\nTherefore you should renew your account in order to proceed with the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am pretty much being told to upgrade and pay money to be able to use an advertised functionality for free developer licenses on my own free developer license. \r\n\r\nI know that the solution is simple; buy a license. The issue is more with the fact that this appears to be a genuine issue when dropping from a paid developer license with multiple devices on it, to a free developer license as the device list is not cleared during the 'downgrade' and therefore making the functionality unable to be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n2. Have a now free developer account which had multiple devices on it as a paid developer license which as now expired\r\n3. Attempt to deploy to a new device which wasn't one of the multiple devices on the paid developer license before downgrade using automatically managed signing and select the team as 'Personal'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to deploy to device using free developer account\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to deploy to device using free developer account\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.2.1 (8C1002) / MacOS 10.12.2 (16C67) / iOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUnable to test on a device which may have been on the paid developer license before downgrade (no longer have them), but it appears that deploying onto a device that is definitely not in the list of devices when the license was a paid developer license, that this is an issue."
