    description: "Summary:\r\nIn version of iOS prior to 10.3 beta 4, if a Reminders notification appeared and was ignored, it would appear on the lock screen when the phone was next awakened. This no longer happens. The only exception is if the phone is already asleep.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a Reminder for a future date/time.\r\n2. Have the phone unlocked and awake at that time.\r\n3. Observe the notification.\r\n4. Either swipe the notification up and lock the phone, or just lock the phone.\r\n5. Wake the phone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe reminder should appear on the lock screen because it was ignored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe reminder is not on the lock screen. The task does not get completed. Sadness ensues."
