    description: "Area:\r\ntvOS SDK\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting the value `forceRightToLeft` to the property `semanticContentAttribute` in an instance of UIStackView in tvOS does not have any effect. The views are anyway added from left to right.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn this repo https://github.com/dcordero/Radar-31138095 you can find two projects with exactly the same piece of code. One of them running in iOS and the other one in tvOS.\r\n\r\nIn iOS, the views are added from right to left to the stack view, but in tvOS, on the other hand, they are added from left to right.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe views are added from right to left, as documented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe views are added from left to right regardless of the value assigned to semanticContentAttribute\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTv 4th Generation"
