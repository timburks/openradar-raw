    description: "Summary:\r\nSee rdar://17979783, which was duped to rdar://22503242, subsequently closed, and the radar annotated with:\r\n\r\n\"The original report on this issue, Bug ID 22503242, is closed.  If you see this issue in a newer release, please file a new bug report\"\r\n\r\nIt's still there in Xcode 8.3b4.  See attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nIn the Devices window, the splitter for the log has a one-pixel wide, _INVISIBLE_ splitter.  That's pretty user-hostile.  It'd be nice if the entire height of that splitter area (with the down-arrow button thing) were a hit target vs a very thin an slippery one-pixel stripe.\r\n\r\nit'd be even nicer if it were visible, so I knew which one-pixel-row was useful resizing the panel.\r\n\r\nBeing the submitter of rdar://17979783, I'm kind of peeved that it got duped and thrown in to the Radar Black Hole. I imagine whomever is behind rdar://22503242 is kind of peeved it's not fixed.  And I'm also peeved I'm volunteering some of my wednesday night filing radars on problems I've already filed radars about.  (especially when radar web blows chunks - c.f. rdar://30364703 - but unreliable for 1 meg files tonight) What's the point?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open the Devices window\r\n* Try to resize the log portion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* There's a UI affordance of a non-microscopic hit area\r\n* There's a UI affordance of visibility of the drag region\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* the drag region is invisible, and tiny.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 4 (8W143q)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode is already the death of a thousand cuts.  c.f. rdar://22524679  Sure, \"Radar or GTFO\" and the \"File a radar\" T-Shirts are cute, but obviously they do no good.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-03-08 at 8.45.15 PM.png' and 'Screen Shot 2017-03-08 at 8.48.23 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
