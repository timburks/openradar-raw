    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the following line of code it will endlessly fix the 1st instance of kCTFontNameAttribute by endlessly casting it to String while the real issue remaining is the 2nd instance of kCTFontNameAttribute needing casting.\r\n\r\nUIFontDescriptor(fontAttributes: [(kCTFontNameAttribute as String) as String: \"AppleColorEmoji\"]).matchingFontDescriptors(withMandatoryKeys: [kCTFontNameAttribute])\r\n\r\n--- Update ---\r\n\r\nWait, even after I manually fit it by casting the 2nd kCTFontNameAttribute to String Xcode still insist that \" 'String' is not implicitly convertible to 'String'; did you mean to use 'as' to explicitly convert?\". So the issue is deeper that I originally thought. Since I cannot come up with a proper title I'll leave the original title here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample playground.\r\n2. Follow Fix-it.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cTYyQ0GPtyC"
