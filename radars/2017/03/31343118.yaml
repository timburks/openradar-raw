    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://31341632\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApp-Preview Videos are not available in iTunes and are not available in iTunes Preview (Website of an App entry). Therefore metadata is incompletely displayed and disrupts the presentation of the whole app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an App which has an App-Preview Video.\r\n2. Open that App's entry in iTunes or iTunes Preview (Website)\r\n3. Recognize that there is no App-Preview Video displayed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp-Preview Videos are consistently displayed with all the other metadata of the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIncomplete metadata is displayed no video and not even the poster keyframe for the video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nany\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a developer I would AT LEAST expect that in case the App-Preview video cannot be shown, the POSTER IMAGE/FRAME of the Preview Video should be displayed as an additional (6th) screenshot instead. Displaying incomplete metadata does disrupt the complete product-presentation on the AppStore.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
