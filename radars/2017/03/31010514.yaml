    description: When a view controller contains a table view and has its navigation controller property hidesBarsOnSwipe set to true, the frame for the table view's cell UI is miscalculated during the nav bar hide animation. If the user pans the table view up slightly to begin the animation of the nav bar hide then releases touch before completion of the nav bar hide, the table view cell UI appears to render partially off screen.
