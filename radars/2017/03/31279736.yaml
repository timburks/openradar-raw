    description: "When using predictive text (auto complete) to type on the standard iOS keyboard, a typed space is removed or ignored when typed mid-sentence after selecting a predictive suggestion word.\r\n\r\nFor example, I typed the phrase \"I think I'm going to be a good night\" entirely using the predictive word bar. Then, I set my cursor to the exact start index of the word \"going\". I selected the predictive word \"just\" and then attempted to use the keyboard to type a space. However, that space I typed is consumed or ignored immediately afterwards. Therefore it seems that the first space typed after a selected predictive word is removed by the OS.\r\n\r\nIt seems I can type spaces after that first space is consumed, but at this point, corresponding application logic can be thrown off sync by the content displayed in the text field or view.\r\n\r\nSee attached video for clarification.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: List the step by step process to reproduce the issue\r\n1. Type some words entirely using predictive text\r\n2. Move cursor to a start index of one of the words mid-sentence\r\n3. Select another predictive text suggestion\r\n4. Type a space\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Describe what you expected to see\r\nTwo spaces will appear after the selected predictive word. One that is automatically placed there by virtue of the predictive words selection feature and one that I typed myself.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Describe what you actually saw\r\nThe OS consumes the manually typed space."
