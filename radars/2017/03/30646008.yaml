    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using Realm(alternative to CoreData - realm.io) for a project. When I try to print an object created by the framework I have this warning:\r\n\r\nwarning: Swift error in module RealmSwift.\r\nDebug info from this module will be unavailable in the debugger.## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI think an important remark is that the framework used in the sample project attached to this report was built using Carthage. A very popular dependency manager for Apple platforms. I am sure you guys know about it.\r\n\r\nI have submitted and issue on their GitHub - https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/4643\r\n\r\nAccording to their team there might be an issue with dynamic frameworks built using xcode-build which is used by Carthage under the hood.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample project\r\n2. Hit a break point\r\n3. Print an object in the LLVM console.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrint object description\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is printed but first the warning described above appears in the console.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1, macOS 10.12.3"
