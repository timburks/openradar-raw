    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDoc of UIFont.withSize(_ fontSize: CGFloat) -> UIFont says:\r\nReturns a font object that is the *same* as the receiver but which has the specified size instead.\r\n\r\nSo the only thing that may change is font size, which is the very expected behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not true sometimes. For example:\r\nlet font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 32, weight: UIFontWeightHeavy) // It's .SFUIDisplay-Heavy\r\nfont.withSize(font.pointSize) // It's now .SFUIDisplay-Semibold\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample playground and read the logs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing except font size should change. Or, the document should be corrected to point out these special cases.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/c0GB33_YU1T"
