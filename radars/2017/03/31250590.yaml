    description: "The 2 preferredLocalizations methods are class methods but keep talking about some unspecified specific bundle as if they are called on some individual Bundle instance, which is very confusing or even plainly wrong.\r\n\r\n* preferredLocalizations(from:), https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/bundle/1417249-preferredlocalizations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn array of NSString objects, each of which specifies the language ID for a localization that *the bundle* supports.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is `the bundle?\r\n\r\n* preferred​Localizations(from:​for​Preferences:​), https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/bundle/1409418-preferredlocalizations:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReturns the localizations that a bundle object would prefer, given *the specified bundle* and user’s language preferences.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn array of NSString objects, each of which identifies a localization in *the receiver’s bundle*. These strings are ordered in the array according to the specified preferences and are taken from the strings in the localizations​Array parameter. If none of the user-preferred localizations are available in the bundle, this method returns one of the bundle localizations.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat exactly are the specified bundle and the receiver’s bundle?\r\n\r\nI believe these 2 class methods should have nothing to do with any specific bundle and generate their results only with the given parameters `from` and `or​Preferences`(it is implicitly Locale.preferredLanguages for preferredLocalizations(from:)).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, their CF equivalents CFBundleCopyPreferredLocalizationsFromArray  & CFBundleCopyLocalizationsForPreferences have much better documentations: \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/corefoundation/1537164-cfbundlecopypreferredlocalizatio\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/corefoundation/1537153-cfbundlecopylocalizationsforpref"
