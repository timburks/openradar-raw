It would be useful if this constant existed, instead of developers having to decipher what -34018 is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Attempt to write an item to a shared keychain with no entitlements\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou get an OSStatus back that is comparable to an existing constant\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get a number that is not documented and is only known to be errSecMissingEntitlement because of apple developer forum posts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/13457#37359 for more details."
