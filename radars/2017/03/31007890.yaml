    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for the automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets property of UIViewController does not describe how it finds the scroll view that it manages.\r\n\r\nExperimentation suggests that the scroll view must be a subview of view.subviews[0] or it is not managed automatically. Placing a scroll view at any other position in the subview index prevents the container view controller from adjusting the content offset.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not documented which can lead to some surprises when working with scroll views embedded in container views.\r\n\r\nautomaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets -\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621372-automaticallyadjustsscrollviewin"
