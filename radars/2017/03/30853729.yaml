    description: "Summary:\r\nSome albums (they have in common they were imported recently, but while necessary, this is not a sufficient condition) behave in iTunes as though album shuffle mode (which I never use) was on, even though song shuffle mode is set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an iTunes playlist with tracks from http://smrpg.ocremix.org/ ; double-check that \"skip when shuffling\" is not set for these tracks\r\n2. Add 2-3 unrelated tracks to that playlist, e.g. I took tracks 1-3 from https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/volume-1/id362630989?app=itunes\r\n3. Set shuffle mode to \"Songs\"\r\n4. Click \"shuffle all\" in the playlist\r\n5. Note which track is played\r\n6. Skip towards the end of the track\r\n7. Note which track plays next\r\n8. Go to another playlist, and hit \"shuffle all\"\r\n9. Go back to the specifically set up playlist\r\n10. goto 4 and loop this 4 or 5 times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny track of the playlist may be playing at step 5, and even if sometimes the same track may be chosen again at step 5, this never determines which track plays at step 7.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt step 5, tracks 2 to 34 of \"Super Mario RPG: Window to the Stars\" are never playing; and if track 1 of that album was playing at step 5, then track 2 of that same album is always playing at step 7\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\niTunes 12.5.5.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile with some work I was able to pin down the issue somewhat, I have not been able to determine what exactly matters that causes some albums to behave that way. I know that reimporting makes a difference, as an album that did not behave that way started to do so after I removed its tracks and imported it again; but in another case, the album kept behaving as expected after being removed then imported again.\r\n\r\nAlso note that being able to have some albums behave as though album shuffle mode was set, even when song shuffle mode is set, would be a useful feature, on condition this can be controlled.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
