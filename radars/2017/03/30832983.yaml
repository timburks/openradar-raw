    description: "Summary:\r\nAs existing Apple developers transition from Objective C to Swift, more and more of us will run into situations where we add a Swift dependency to unit tested code, and witness the unit testing target fails to run because of missing Swift libraries.\r\n\r\nBecause a Unit Test target is not designed to be shipped, and because the CopySwiftLibs build phase has no effect in the absence of linked Swift binaries, there is little to no risk in enabling the \"Always Embed\" option for Unit Test targets.\r\n\r\nI think that flipping this switch to on by default will save developers time and frustration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 3 (8W132p)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
