    description: "Adding support for call blocking and indentification requires developers to send a sorted array of name and phone number.\r\n\r\nThere should be a better API to send the delta since the last update, as frequent recreation of the whole name, number array is an expensive operation, and leads to a very high average energy usage of the app.\r\n\r\nFor our usecase, we have to update an array of 10000 names with their numbers, everytime we sync our data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app with call identification support\r\n2. Turn on Call Identification\r\n3. Sync the data from server if applicable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCallKit API's should provide helper methods for adding/updating/deleting records from the call kit database.\r\nSpecially in any order of phone number and name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe have to fetch all details from DB, sort it and then call addIdentificationEntry for every name and number pair."
