    description: "To display public transport directions to a given placemark, it would be great to set the MKMapView into a public transport mode similar to the Maps app. Specifically, we'd like to see roads toned down and train lines emphasized.\r\n\r\nIdeally it would just be another MKMapType or perhaps a property like \"showTransitLines\"."
