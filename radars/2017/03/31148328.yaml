    description: "Summary:\r\nThe list of possible objects that can work as an activity in a `UIActivityViewController` is undocumented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Look in the documentation for `UIActivityViewController`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- There should be some sort of list or explanation what kind of objects can be shared as activities.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- There is nothing like that\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is especially problematic as there seems to be much more than just an image, a string or plain data supported here. E.g. providing a `UIPrintPageRenderer` works. This is a duplicate of rdar://31147307"
