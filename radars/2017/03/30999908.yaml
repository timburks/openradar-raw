    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTo test scenarios related to no internet connectivity in the app, i have to turn off Wi-Fi or disconnect my mac's network cable.\r\nThis is quite troublesome, as i cannot check mail, or google things while debugging a no internet issue in the simulator\r\n\r\nSo i would like to raise an enhancement request for this, where turning off the Wi-Fi from Control Center in the simulator should itself be enough to simulate no internet connectivity\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry turning off Wi-Fi from Control Center in simulator\r\nObserve that the simulator isn't actually disconnected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTurning off Wi-Fi in the control center of simulator should turn off internet for the simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTurning off Wi-Fi in the control center of simulator does nothing right now\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
