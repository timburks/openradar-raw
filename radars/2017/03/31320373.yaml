    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the launch of iOS 10.3, it seems something is up with the \"Write Review\" button in the App Store.\r\n\r\nWhen a new version of the app comes out, the \"Write Review\" is missing at first. It only seems to appear when enough reviews have been written to trigger showing the average rating / etc.\r\n\r\nSwitching to the \"All Versions\" segment reveals the review option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the App Store for an app you own and just got updated\r\n2. Go to the reviews section\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect a \"write review\" button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nButton is missing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Shown.PNG' and 'Missing.PNG'"
