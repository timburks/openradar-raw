    description: "GitHub Sample Code: https://github.com/brianmichel/CustomTransitionFailure\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting definesPresentationContext has no effect when using a custom view controller transition and presentation controller. This means that it is impossible to achieve custom presentations that mimic the behavior of \"modalPresentationStyle = currentContext\" or the like.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the sample project\r\n2. Run the project and tap on the orange view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the tapped view controller (OtherViewController) defines it’s own presentation context (ViewController.swift:146) I expect that the presented view controller can be presented within the bounds of the presenting view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe presented view controller’s transition view is inserted higher up in the view hierarchy due to the inability of custom presentation controllers to respect custom presentation contexts.\r\n\r\nAs a test, you can override the private value on ViewController.swift:85 with a value of true to see the desired behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 (14E5273a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus, 128 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CustomTransitionFailure Compressed.zip' was successfully uploaded."
