    description: "Area:\r\nMission Control\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nExiting an appâ€™s full-screen mode via the escape key, particularly when the key is also used for some other function, can be disruptive and disorienting, and may be considered unexpected behavior by the user. Full-screen mode can be otherwise exited by invoking the same methods used to enter it, of which the escape key is not one. A user option to disable this function of the key would resolve this problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing iTunes 12.5.5.5 as an example:\r\n1. Enter full-screen mode (e.g. by selecting View -> Enter Full Screen).\r\n2. Select a track if necessary, and then click on a track name, artist name, etc. to edit it.\r\n3. Press esc to discard any changes to the field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected field is no longer being edited, any changes that had been made are discarded, and nothing else is affected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSame as expected, with the addition of simultaneously exiting full-screen mode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue occurs with many apps, including games (where esc is used to pause), which use the native full-screen mode. Examples include Safari, iTunes, Unity engine games such as Velocibox."
