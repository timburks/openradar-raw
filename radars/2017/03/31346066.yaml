        Searching files by tag and name only works when searching the tag name first, then adding a filter on the file name.

        Intuitively I'd like to do it the other way around, so searching by file name, then filtering by tag.

        However, in the popup menu of search criteria, "Tags" isn't listed. I couldn't find it either in the "Othersâ€¦" dialog.
