    description: "When initiating an SKProductRequest with known valid product identifiers (that is, the identifiers are associated with in-app products currently available for sale), the response delegate method fires with all requested product identifiers present in the invalidProductIdentifier field and an empty array of SKProducts. \r\n\r\nThis is only happening in the Sandbox environment and can be reproduced in apps posted to TestFlight for testing.\r\n\r\n- (void)fetchProductInformationForIds:(NSArray *)productIds\r\n{\r\n\tSKProductsRequest *request = [[SKProductsRequest alloc] initWithProductIdentifiers:[NSSet setWithArray:productIds]];\r\n\trequest.delegate = self;\r\n\t[request start];\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd here is the delegate method implementation to handle the response. \r\n\r\n- (void)productsRequest:(SKProductsRequest *)request didReceiveResponse:(SKProductsResponse *)response\r\n{\r\n   if ([response.products count]) {\r\n\t NSLog(@“Valid product skus: %@\", response.products);\r\n    } else {\r\n         NSLog(@“No products found\"); \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    if ([response.invalidProductIdentifiers count]) {\r\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to get info for skus: %@\", response.invalidProductIdentifiers);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhen the error occurs, no product are found and all of the submitted identifiers are returned as invalid."
