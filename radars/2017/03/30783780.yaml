    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes our designs dictate that an image have a different color for different states. This is easy to achieve when you have each of those images pre-rendered with the color applied to it, but when you're using template images, there doesn't appear to be a way to make this happen without having to either tint the image at runtime, or just not use template images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a template image.\r\n2. Set the image on a button.\r\n3. Try to have a different tint color for different states to change the color of the image when the button changes state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn API exists that allows me do to this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo API exists. I have to implement my own `TintedButton` subclass of `UIButton` to support this behavior, and hope that my implementation of how to interpret `UIButton.state` matches up with how `UIButton` uses that value to determine which value to use for the other `-set<Thing>:forState:` APIs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS Devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
