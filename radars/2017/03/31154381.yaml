    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification incorrectly sent twice when an app with a background task is killed from Springboard\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up an app that has some background work to do, is capturing audio or otherwise running in the background.\r\nBackground it -- it receives UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification.\r\nKill the app from Springboard before it finishes its background work -- it receives another UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlready backgrounded apps should not be sent a redundant backgrounding notification. If there is a need to tell background apps that they've been told to knock it off, there should be another notification for this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication lifecycle listeners have to be wary and not mess stuff up when they are lied to by the system.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt also appears that UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification is received by listeners more than once when an app comes from background to foreground after it has been suspended. This is still happening on iOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
