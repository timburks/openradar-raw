    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Caching Server does not cache Mac software updates from 10.12.x clients\r\n\r\nIf a mac AppStore App or iOS device requests an install/update it is cached and served correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Server.app on 10.12.x server machine\r\n2. Turn on Caching and enable ClientIdentity Logging. \r\n3. Tail the Debug.log on the server machine.\r\n4. Install 10.12 on a client machine\r\n5. Run AssetCacheLocatorUtil on client machine to confirm machine is able to see caching server\r\n6. Run `softwareupdate -d -a` note that software begins to download, however there are no connections from the client on the caching server\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe client running `softwareupdate -d -a` should download updates from caching server.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCaching Server does not receive a request from the client and the client downloads direct from Apple \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nServer.app 5.2\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAffects over 100 caching servers and 5,000+ Macs in our environment"
