    description: "Area:\r\nTime Machine\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This is not a bug with Time Machine data or backup behavior, but a bug with the app itself and it's behavior responding to an AppleScript activation. Please do me the favor of trying the simple AppleScript described below before asking me to create a hundreds-of-megabytes large system profile.\r\n\r\nBug: Time Machine app doesn't respond to activation event, causing the sending app/process to hang. In an app like my FastScripts, because AppleScripts are run on the main thread, this causes the app to hang. In an app like Script Editor where the app is run on a thread, it causes the script window to become unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Script Editor\r\n2. Paste in the following script:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Time Machine\" to activate\r\n\r\n3. Run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Machine is activated for the current app, and the script completes running.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script keeps running until it finally times out.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be ameliorated by adding an explicit, shorter timeout around the call:\r\n\r\ntry\r\n\twith timeout of 0.1 seconds\r\n\t\ttell application \"Time Machine\" to activate\r\n\tend timeout\r\nend try\r\n\r\nWhatever TimeMachine.app is doing in response to the activation event, it should cede control back to the calling app by responding appropriately to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.3 (16D32)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
