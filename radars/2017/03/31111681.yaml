        Summary:
        Before Xcode 8 there were Alcatraz, the developers so much loved tool that brought lots of great plugins to Xcode. One of my favourite plugin was XcodeColor - that gives you a preview of the current color in code. Nobody can see colors when they are represented in code. So, this plugin should be an official default of every Xcode installation!

        In my opinion this is a long standing wish of many, many developers around the world, and inside Apple, too. So please give us such an extension. We will LOVE it!

        Thanks,
        A passionate german developer living in Austria.
