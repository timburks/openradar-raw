    description: "Summary:\r\nThe revision history for the Configuration Profile Reference at https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/RevisionHistory.html no longer lists revisions made between 2016-12-12 and the most recent entry, i.e. the most recent entry is \"recycled\" and used to list the latest changes vs. making a new entry so that older revisions remain available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit the referenced page https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/RevisionHistory.html on a given date\r\n2. Monitor https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/navigation/ for listed changes to the Configuration Profile Reference document\r\n3. Go to the Document Revision History when a change is posted\r\n4. Notice that changes previously listed in the Document Revision History during step 1 are no longer there, and were replaced with the now-current Document Revision History entries.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrevious Document Revision History entries to still be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe most recent Document Revision History entry was updated with changes, other entries are no longer available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/RevisionHistory.html\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appears to have started sometime after the 2016-12-12 entry, as multiple changes have been posted since then but only the most recent one (2017-03-08 as of right now) is available."
