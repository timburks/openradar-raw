    description: "Summary:\r\nI am unable to build due a linking error only when I build for testing when code coverage is enabled. If I turn off code coverage the build for testing is successful. I have added 2 framework targets with their own test targets which may be a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS app project with a test target\r\n2. Add an external Xcode project as a dependency\r\n3. Add a framework target with tests\r\n4. Add another framework test with tests\r\n5. Enable code coverage in the build scheme\r\n6. Build for testing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should be successful for building the app target with or without test targets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLinking fails to the external project dependency. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is yet another reason many developers working with Xcode use as an excuse for not adding tests. Overcoming these build errors is time consuming and costly and ultimately it affects users who either end up using crashy apps or do not get features which were cut due to time wasted with getting Xcode to work."
