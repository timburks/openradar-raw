    description: "Area:\r\nGraphics&Imaging\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI don't know how widespread this is, but it's 100% reproducible for me.\r\n\r\nSince at least macOS 10.12.4 beta 3 (and still happens on beta 4, wasn't able to check previous betas) my external monitor no longer works.\r\n\r\nMy MacBookPro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) no longer connects to my HP w2207 monitor over mini-display port to DVI.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be something with my cable, but I'm able to boot into 10.11, 10.10 and 10.9 and this same machine works perfectly with that monitor with no changes.\r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more helpâ€”not sure how to debug this any further.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect MacBook Pro to monitor over mini display port adapter to DVI\r\n2. No signal\r\n3. Reboot to any other macOS, it works as expected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMacBook connects to external monitor\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen is black. Usually what happens is my MacBookPro kinda \"flashes\" once or twice while the connection is switching over. That isn't currently happening, I plug it in any nothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.4 Beta (16E175b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThank you! \U0001F913\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens in 10.12.4 beta 3 & 4, haven't seen it anywhere else. Night Shift is disabled, which is the only new thing that might be related. \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
