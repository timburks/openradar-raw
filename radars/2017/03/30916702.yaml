    description: "I have a view controller in which there's an outlet property of type TableView and I changed its access level to private. I created an extension to this view controller which conforms to a protocol and inside this extension, I am trying to access the tableView property but due to private access level, it should show Accessible error. It's not showing Accessible error but 'Ambiguous error'.\r\n\r\nI have attached the screenshots. I think it might be due to the name I am using which is 'tableView' but it should show the correct error."
