    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new unified logging system introduced in iOS 10 gives a lot of flexibility and power to developers. On iOS, there's no easy way to gather the log files from users however. Having the user do a sysdiagnose and then manually send the files is a complicated process that most users won't be able to do.\r\n\r\nA common feature in iOS apps is to have a \"Submit Bug Report\" or \"Submit Feedback\" button somewhere that allows the user to send an email from within the app using a mail compose controller. Often times the app will attach its own log files to these emails. These files are usually in plain text, only containing the applications own logging, and without any of the benefits or protections of the new unified system. I'd like a way to programmatically collect the new log files so that a single .logarchive file could be attached to these emails without the user needing to take any additional steps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the new unified logging system to generate some log messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to programmatically gather log files from the iOS device so that they can be sent along with bug reports from within applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to programmatically gather log files. Instead, the user has to perform a sysdiagnose and send them manually.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis applies to the other platforms as well, since the unified logging APIs are cross-platform."
