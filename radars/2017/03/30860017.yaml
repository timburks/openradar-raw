    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen setting up a text system manually in order to use custom subclasses, the text system provokes a warning about objc_{load,store}Weak being used incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached sample\r\n- Enable the \"Malloc Scribble\" diagnostic option (and possible Malloc History to track down the identities of the objects involved later)\r\n- Set a symbolic breakpoint on \"objc_weak_error\"\r\n- Run the app\r\n- The load time code will build up a text system attached to a text storage\r\n- Click the button, this will tear down the old text system and replace it with a new one (still attached to the same text storage)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- No misuse of ObjC weak references.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Breakpoint is hit\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPoking around, it looks like maybe the storage that is being misused is the private _textView ivar in NSTextContainer. Perhaps the \"default text system\" code is OK, but the manual setup path is directly assigning to the ivar instead of doing objc_storeWeak to clear the _textView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.2.1\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextContainerWeakTextView.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSample code at <https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9ef9400gqmlxmk/TextContainerWeakTextView.zip?dl=0>"
