    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, notifications are not displayed with the mutated content returned by the Notification Service Extension (NSE).  I am able to verify that the NSE is invoked, runs successfully, and returns mutated content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSE that mutates every notification it receives to have a body of \"1\"\r\n2. Send many notifications to the NSE (ex: mutable-content set to 1) with a body of \"2\" in quick succession.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll notifications should have a body of \"1\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost notifications shown have a body of \"1\", but sometimes \"2\" also appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1"
