    description: "Summary:\r\ncompiler/analyzer does not catch init methods returning null with nonnull - very simple\r\n\r\nThis means we can't catch bugs at compile time due to nullability contracts being broken\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot for crystal clear repro\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Have this init method:\r\n\r\n- (nonnull instancetype)initWithCondition:(BOOL)condition\r\n{\r\n    if (condition) {\r\n        return nil;\r\n    }\r\n    return [self init];\r\n}\r\n\r\n2) set CLANG_ANALYZER_NONNULL to YES for the project being analyzed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nstatic analyzer (or, even better, the compiler) will have warning where \"return nil\" line happens:\r\n\"nil returned from a method that is expected to return a non-null value\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such warning, expect crashing in production when nil is returned and Swift is the consumer language"
