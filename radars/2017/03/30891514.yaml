    description: "Highly annoying for a *spreadsheet* that somehow the calculation is wrong. I checked and double-checked and calculated manually but I really do add up to 12,50 in the \"Geld\" column.\r\nTurns out, some of the cells stayed as 'Text' instead of converting automatically to number, and the Sum field gives NO INDICATION something is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. open spreadsheet\r\n2. change number in field E23\r\n3. the 11 sum at the bottom does not change\r\n\r\nI expected 12,50 as a total to begin with\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nI now have to manually go over all the cells to see which are wrong, or select all cells and convert them to 'number' instead of automatic."
