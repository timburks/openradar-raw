    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a symbolic breakpoint is attempted to be set using Swift syntax, then it should match implementations that are known to originate in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nFor example if I set a breakpoint in lldb for \"UIView.layoutSubviews\" then lldb should be aware on behalf of Swift developers, that this is an automatic mapping from the Objective-C -[UIView layoutSubviews] and set the breakpoint on the pertinent lower-level symbol.\r\n\r\nBy choosing to expose system level frameworks to Swift developers with a modified syntax, it seems Apple should take on the burden of making sure that modified syntax is treated as canonical regardless of the implementation language.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 4 (8W143q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
