    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to migrate an old XIB-based (\"MainMenu.xib\") application to fully utilize Storyboards. Unfortunately, there is no way to add an \"Application\" object (the one that contains the menu, etc.) to a newly created Storyboard. It appears that one is created upon creation of a Storyboard-based application, and that's it. It makes it extremely difficult to add a menu to a new Storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new macOS project with a XIB based layout\r\n2. Try to migrate to Storyboards\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome way to add an \"Application\" object to the storyboard with the application's menus\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo object is available in Interface Builder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\nCreate a new storyboard based project with the exact same name, open both .storyboard files in a text editor, copy the \"Application\" scene XML node, and paste in the original project's storyboard.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.3 Beta (16D17a)"
