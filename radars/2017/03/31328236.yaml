    description: "Summary:\r\nI was listening to music from iTunes on my Mac through AirPods. I started a tvOS app in the simulator from Xcode and, when the simulator made noise to signify the app starting, the music paused for a beat and then played at such a loud volume through the AirPods, my ears still hurt as I type this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start music playing on AirPods connected to your Mac.\r\n2. Run a tvOS app in the simulator from Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe music keeps playing at the same volume and quality.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe music gets extremely loud and sounds very different, like itâ€™s being processed differently.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.3 (8E162)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also seems to happen when the watchOS simulator plays a haptic.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\nAirPods"
