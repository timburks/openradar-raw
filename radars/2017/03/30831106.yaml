    description: "Let there be two targets:\r\n1. Main application\r\n2. Finder sync extension (App Sandbox)\r\n\r\nThey belong to same App Group. CFMessagePort has a name which includes AppGroup name (as required).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start main application\r\n2. Start Finder extension\r\n3. Tap on 'SEND MESSAGE' button in main application.\r\n4. Crash happens in Finder Sync Extension which receives a message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder Sync Extension should receive a message and send a reply to Main Application. No crash should happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash happens when Finder Sync Extension receives a message from Main App.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.3 (16D32)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is VERY important for my project. If you need any clearance on what's the issue, you can always reach me at my email.\r\nIt would also help to know if you would recommend some other way of communication between Main application and Finder Sync Extension.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCrash happens only on MacOS Sierra. On El Capitan it's working as expected."
