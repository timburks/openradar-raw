    description: "When overriding a UIView's backing layerClass, the change does not propagate immediately to the compiler. Upon accessing the view's layer property, it sees type CALayer. This is despite the fact that it may be CAGradientLayer for example, or any other type of custom CALayer implementation/extension/subclass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Override UIView layerClass from CALayer to CAGradientLayer for example.\r\n2. Try to set the .colors of the layer in viewDidLoad() for example.\r\n3. Find that the layer has no property of colors. The layer needs to be force cast to CAGradientLayer before it has the required/desired properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Override UIView layerClass from CALayer to <Other CALayer>\r\n2. Use properties of new type of layer without requiring force cast.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStill requires force cast."
