    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 10 the Activity.app also shows the route on an map. If I export the workout via the share button, the app only creates a screenshot. It would be nice, if it would also be possible to export the route as .gpx or .kml file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Record a workout (with you ï£¿ watch)\r\n- Open the Activity.app (on your iPhone)\r\n- View the workout\r\n- Click on the map view\r\n- Click the share button\r\n- Image of the route gets exported\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be an option to export the route as image or as .gpx or .kml file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly a screenshot gets exported."
