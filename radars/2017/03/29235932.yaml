    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are advised in Apple API Reference (https://developer.apple.com/reference/coretext/1478566-ctframesettersuggestframesizewit?language=objc) that to use CTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraints to determine how much space is needed to display a string.\r\n\r\nAnd before iOS 9, this method works as expected as it always returns the correct value. Since iOS 9 came out, we find the method returns a lot of incorrect size for emoji only strings, which breaks our rendering component.\r\n\r\nFor example, given an constraint of maxWidth = 288, and a font = 40.0pt, (each emoji's size can be estimated as 45pt). However, for some string with 7 emojis in total, it renders 5 emojis in the first line and 2 emojis in the second line (Incorrect).  And for the rest strings, it renders 6 emojis in the first line and 1 emoji in the second line (Correct).\r\n\r\nAn incorrect emoji string example: @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\U0001F601\"\r\nA correct emoji string example: @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\u263A\"\r\n\r\nSince (45 * 5 = 225) < (45 * 6 = 270) < 288 always holds, we believe the method is somehow broken after iOS 9. And the issue didn't get fixed in iOS 10 as well as latest Xcode 8.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Initialize an attributedString with content: @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\U0001F601\", line spacing = 1.0; font size = 40.0pt, MinimumLineHeight = setMaximumLineHeight = 40.0pt.\r\n2. Use CTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedString method to create a CTFramesetterRef, then use CTFramesetterSuggestFrameSizeWithConstraints with constraints={288, CGFLOAT_MAX}.\r\n3. See the value returned was {225, 81}, while the correct value should be {270, 81}.\r\n\r\nRedo step 1-3 with string: @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\u263A\", see the returned value was {270, 81}.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor both string @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\U0001F601\" and @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\u263A\", the returned value should be {270, 81} given font size = 40.0pt and constraint = {288, CGFLOAT_MAX}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor string @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\U0001F601\" the returned value should be {225, 81} given font size = 40.0pt and constraint = {288, CGFLOAT_MAX}. (Correct)\r\nFor string @\"\\U0001F611\\U0001F611\\U0001F606\\U0001F606\\U0001F609\\U0001F60C\\u263A\", the returned value should be {270, 81} given font size = 40.0pt and constraint = {288, CGFLOAT_MAX}. (Incorrect)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 [14B100]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is identified after iOS 9.0, and all the experiments were done in latest Xcode with Version 8.1 (8B62), tested in both iOS simulator (iPhone 7  Plus) and iPhone device.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, 128 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
