    description: "Thanks for the new ability to reply to customer reviews. In light of this new ability it would be great if iTunes Connect supported a notification for any new reviews of products. There is a new notification to be notified when a customer changes a review after a developer replies, but there is no notification to be alerted of new reviews.\r\n\r\nMany developers will want to keep apprised of all reviews in case there are valuable replies to offer customers. In this case, it will always be most beneficial to both customers and developers if the reply can be offered in a timely manner after the customer has left the review."
