    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur application \"Merlin Project Express\" is sold via the Mac App Store and offers an auto-renewable subscription as an in-app purchase.\r\nStarting yesterday, customers complained that subscriptions they bought are not recognised by the app. \r\n\r\nA lot of other people in the dev forum seem to currently have similar problems:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/community/system-frameworks/in-app-purchase\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the application \"Merlin Project Express\" from the Mac App Store\r\n2. Open it and in the upcoming panel chose to purchase a monthly subscription\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- After the successful purchase, the application should inform you about the validity of your subscription.\r\n- The local application receipt should contain the subscription as an in-app purchase entry.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The application does not recognise the purchase\r\n- The local application receipt does not contain the subscription as an in-app purchase entry.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- The problem does not occur for customers on OS X 10.11 or 10.10\r\n- Deleting the application and re-downloading it from the store or re-purchasing the subscription delivers the correct receipt and makes the app work as expected"
