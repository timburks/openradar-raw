    description: "I have created an iOS Share Extension, and am returning a simple NSItemProvider:\r\n\r\n    let item = NSItemProvider(item: \"A Response\" as NSSecureCoding, typeIdentifier: kUTTypeText as String)  \r\n    let extensionItem = NSExtensionItem()  \r\n    extensionItem.attachments = [item]  \r\n\r\n    self.extensionContext!.completeRequest(returningItems: [extensionItem], completionHandler: nil)  \r\nBut in the host app, in the completionWithItemsHandler, completed is true, yet, returnedItems is nil.\r\n\r\n    activityController.completionWithItemsHandler = { (activity, completed, items, error) in  \r\n\r\n        print(\"\\(items?.count)\")  \r\n\r\n    }  \r\nYet, returning the exact same response in an Action Extension, the result reached the host app.\r\n\r\nDoes a Share Extension not send its response back to the host app? The docs would suggest otherwise: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Share.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH12-SW1\r\n\r\nSample project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/h3xg3wc5e1sp9sa/ExtensionApp.zip?dl=0"
