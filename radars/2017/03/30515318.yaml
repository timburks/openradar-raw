    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Store notifications on iOS and watchOS should have a button to easily ‘Play on TV’. When a pre-ordered movie is now available to start watching and the notification appears on both my phone and my watch I would love to just start playing that content on the big screen right away.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Preorder a move, album, or other content from iTunes Store\r\n2. Notification appears on iOS and watchOS with additional button to ‘Play on TV’\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThis type of feature plays to our strengths as a tightly integrated hardware, software, and services company."
