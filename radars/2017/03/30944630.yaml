    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIBarButtonItem is added in Interface Builder with the SystemItemStyle of \"Done\", the button is bold. If the same button is created in code, this is also bold.\r\n\r\nIf the tintColor property is set on either UINavigationBar or UIWindow (or possibly others) via UIAppearance, the interface builder instantiated button loses its boldness, while the programatic version retains it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButtons are a consistent style whether created from code or Interface Builder. This IS the case prior to making a UIAppearance call, but afterwards a difference is introduced\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProgramatic- and Interface Builder-instantiated buttons have differing styles after calling to UIAppearance (but not before).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.1 (13E238), 10.2.1 (14D27)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus"
