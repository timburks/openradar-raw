    description: "Summary:\r\nKeyboard shortcut inconsistencies for switching to full screen in different OS X applications:  \r\n\r\nDVD-Player 5.2: CMD-F\r\niMovie 8.0.6: CMD-G\r\niPhoto 8.1.2: OPTION-CMD-F\r\niTunes 10.0: CMD-F\r\nKeynote 5.0.4: OPTION-CMD-P\r\nPages 4.0.4: OPTION-CMD-U \r\nPreview 5.0.2: SHIFT-CMD-F\r\nQuickTime Player 10.0: CMD-F\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the particular program and search in the menu bar for the appropriate entry to switch to full screen and take a look at the associated keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConsistency among all Apple programs, i.e. only one shortcut (e.g. CMD-F) to trigger full screen mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInconsistencies among Apple programs regarding keyboard shortcuts for triggering full screen mode. There are at least six different shortcuts (see listing above)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConsistent interfaces are important for usability. It's tedious for the user if he has to remember six different shortcuts and also which shortcut works in which application. This may hamper the users workflow and distract from the tasks the user wants to accomplish."
