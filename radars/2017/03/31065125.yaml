    description: "Summary:\r\nPDFkit fails to render ligatures (such as fi and fl) as searchable and copiable characters. This works with OS X up to Yosemite, but somehow is broken in El Capitan and Sierra. A minimal working example is attached, created with XeLaTeX. The ligatures contained in this example cannot be copied nor searched correctly by Preview. The same document works fine with other PDF readers that do not rely on PDFKit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open the attached PDF file with Preview\r\n2. select and copy the text included in the PDF\r\n3. paste the copied text into any editor, such as TextEdit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pasted text should read:\r\nThis text should be entirely copiable, but it is not: figure literature ligature final.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe pasted text is:\r\nThis text should be entirely copiable, but it is not:  gure literature ligature  nal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\nPreview 8.1 (877.7)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lihs13fy794gwt6/ligatures_mwe.pdf?dl=1"
