    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe problem appears when the dock plug-in and APNs are combined\r\n\r\nIf an application is closed and the plug-in has set a badge count on the dock icon, when a notification comes with an updated badge, I cannot see any change on the dock icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prepare an application with the dock tile plug-in installed (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/DockTile)\r\n2. Add APNs handling\r\n3. Set a badge count and close the application - the badge should stay on the dock icon because of the plug-in\r\n4. Send a notification to the application with an updated badge value\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification comes and the dock badge is updated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification comes but the dock badge still has the old value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9-10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe plug-in has other bundle identifier than the application. Target of notifications is the application's bundle identifier. \r\n\r\nThe problem can be also synchronisation between the plug-in and the notification (even if the notification would be setting the badge count). The application saves a badge value into the User Defaults. The plugin loads the badge value from there. If the application is closed and the notification comes with an update, the plug-in - when starts running - will not know about updated value and will load the old value.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Mid 2015\r\nOS X 10.11.6\r\nXcode 8.2.1"
