    description: "This support page has a typo in the row corresponding to the \"X\" key. It reads \"Start up from *an* macOS startup disk when…\" but should read \"Start up from *a* macOS startup disk when…\" (emphasis mine).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\r\n2. See row corresponding to \"X\" key\r\n3. See typo in description column\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee correct description: \"Start up from a macOS startup disk when…\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee typo in description: \"Start up from an macOS startup disk when…\"\r\n\r\nTitle & URL:\r\nStartup key combinations for Mac\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nPresumably this was due to an overly quick find-and-replace job when OS X was changed to macOS. Other such typos may exist in the kbase."
