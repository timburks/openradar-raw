    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOpening this radar for Apple visibility.\r\nDuplicate of rdar://29426145\r\n\r\nMany Mac OS X users have installed the open-source keyboard customization utility \"Karabiner\" to remap their keyboards, provide internationalization support, improve keyboard accessibility, and otherwise improve their Mac keyboard experience.\r\n\r\nThe macOS 10.12 Sierra update has caused Karabiner to stop working.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/issues/739\r\n\r\nThe developer has said:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12 changes to the generic keyboard and mouse drivers had a great impact on Karabiner\r\nThese will require large changes to the Karabiner architecture.\r\nThere is not a workaround for this issue.\r\nPlease wait for an update to Karabiner for macOS 10.12.\r\n(It may take a long time.)\r\nIt's unclear if this app will ever be updated, or if the app's behavior will ever be possible under the new keyboard drivers.\r\n\r\nIf possible, a partial rollback or compatibility layer to support the legacy keyboard drivers would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use open-source Keyboard customization app Karabiner in macOS Sierra. Karabiner uses pre-10.12 keyboard drivers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCan use app Karabiner (which uses pre-10.12 keyboard drivers) to remap keyboard in Sierra.\r\nUsers can stay productive when using the latest release of macOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp Karabiner (which uses pre-10.12 keyboard drivers) does not function under macOS 10.12 due to system updates to keyboard drivers.\r\nUser cannot customize keyboard in Sierra.\r\nUser will not update to Sierra, and stay on macOS 10.11 instead, in order to keep their productive keyboard customizations.\r\nUsers purchasing newer Apple hardware are permanently unable to use Karabiner because of the inability to downgrade to a compatible version of macOS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany users have come to rely on this app to customize their keyboard. The lack of keyboard customization in Sierra is causing people not to update to the latest version of OS X.\r\n\r\nFrom Apple, a legacy keyboard driver compatibility layer, partial rollback, migration document, or any other action with regards to these drivers would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS prior to 10.12.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
