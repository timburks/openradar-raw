    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a restart, macOS attempted to restore my applications after a particularly \"poor\" restart (involving a kernel panic), the iOS Simulator got stuck in a nonresponsive state immediately after asking whether I wanted to reopen the closed windows. Force quitting and reopening (either from Xcode or Finder) simply leads to the same result. Here's some relevant stuff I could dig up from Console:\r\n\r\n[MT] DVTAssertions: Warning in /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/IDEFrameworks/IDEFrameworks-11764/IDEFoundation/Misc/IDEClientTracking.m:227\r\nDetails:  Was asked to cancel clients, but the following clients remain registered after 2 seconds: {(\r\n    <IDEConcreteClientTrackingToken:0x7fcf4597c2d0:'Run \"break\"'>\r\n)}\r\nObject:   <IDEConcreteClientTracker: 0x7fcf4594b140>\r\nMethod:   -_clientCancellationTimeout\r\nThread:   <NSThread: 0x7fcf3f7021c0>{number = 1, name = main}\r\nPlease file a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com with this warning message and any useful information you can provide.\r\n\r\nFailed to write crash history to file:///Users/saagarjha/Library/Application%20Support/CrashReporter/Xcode_BCC59DE9-2449-53E0-82E2-B4AE8D098014.plist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot quite sure, but:\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode and Simulator\r\n2. Restart\r\n3. Have a kernel panic in the middle\r\n4. Have macOS reopen Simulator on boot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS Simulator launches successfully\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHang upon launch\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.2 beta (8C30a)/macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta (16C60b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt appears that one of my apps messed with my permissions, and while I was able to \"fix\" it (by chmod-ing a bunch of directories to 775), this may be actual source of the issue. If you require a spindump to confirm this, I'd be happy to provide one.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEarly 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta (16C60b)"
