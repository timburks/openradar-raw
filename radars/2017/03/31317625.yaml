    description: "Summary:\r\nThe total number of crashes reported by the App Analytics (by weekly report, in the main dashboard and in the crash view) seems to be not reliable. \r\n\r\nIf you check the attached image \"main.png\", you can note around 300 crashes (40 per day) when no filter are applied to the chart. If I apply a \"view-by app version\" filter you can note that the total crash number is completely different (check image `version.png`) maximum of 5 per day. It seems that the crash reporter is reporting crashing coming from a version that is not listed! I've also tried to filter the crashes per single app version but I wasn't able to find any number similar to what is reported without filters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. login into iTunes connect \r\n2. click on App Analytics icon \r\n3. Here you can already see an higher number of crashes\r\n4. Select one application to open the dashboard\r\n5. Again, you'll see the same higher number of crashes \r\n6. Click the crashes chart\r\n7. Here you have the view without filter that is reporting a huge number of crashes. \r\n8. Apply a filter \"View By -> App Version\" \r\n9. The information shown now is completely different and even if you sum the crashes per single App Version you do not obtain the total crashes reported without filters. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe crashes reported without \"View-by\" filter should be the same reported with a \"View-By\" filter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe crashes reported without \"View-by\" filter are way more than the crashes reported with a \"View-By\" filter.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 10.0.3 (12602.4.8)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe crash reports that I'm receiving on XCode organizer are now less than the reports that I was receiving with the previous App version... this should be and indicator that also crashes should be diminished.... but actually the situation reported by the analytics says the contrary.  \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'versions.png' and 'main.png' were successfully uploaded."
