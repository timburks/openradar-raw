    description: "Area:\r\nMedia Player Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a user opens Apple Music, chooses a playlist and hits the share button, the playlist gets an idpl value seen in the URL that can be shared with other users.\r\n\r\nWithout a user manually pressing that share button there seems to be no way to get the idpl value or the share URL of a playlist from MPMediaPlaylist.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could programatically get this share URL from MPMediaPlaylist so we can open Apple Music to the specific playlist.\r\n\r\nI can get the id of each MPMediaItem in iOS 10.3+ and recreate the playlist on another user's device.  But I can't open Apple Music to this playlist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Obtain an instance of MPMediaPlaylist\r\n* No way to share this playlist with other users\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA property or method with callback for the share URL in MPMediaPlaylist.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way to get share id or URL of a MPMediaPlaylist entity.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2.1 (14D27)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI set up a proxy and had a look at the requests iTunes makes.\r\n\r\nI created a playlist in iTunes and added songs to the playlist. Every song I added made several requests to various endpoints under: https://ld-6.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZDaap.woa/daap/update No idpl id in any of the responses\r\n\r\nThen I manually hit the share button. A request is made to https://client-api.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStorePlatform.woa/wa/lookup with the idpl id in the URL.\r\n\r\nNow when you add more songs to the playlist, the responses contain the idpl id.\r\n\r\nFrom that it seems that the idpl id is created on the device when the user touches share.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
