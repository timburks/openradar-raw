    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to open the same address in Apple Maps from an iOS app twice, on the second time as Apple Maps loads, the address is either not shown or shows “No Results Found”. This occurs when attempting to use CLGeocoder to geocode an address from a string. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that uses MapKit’s CLGeocoder.geocodeAddressString\r\n2. Provide an address in string format i.e. “19061 N. 27th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85027”\r\n3. Call CLGeocoder.geocodeAddressString\r\n4. Create a MKPlacemark from the geocoder result\r\n5. Create a MKMapItem from the MKPlacemark\r\n6. Call `openInMaps(launchOptions: nil)` on the MKMapItem\r\n7. Allow Apple Maps to open and locate the address.\r\n8. Return to the test app and perform the geocoding again.\r\n9. Allow Apple Maps to load again and notice the Maps Search box loads, then disappears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you attempt to geocode and load the same address twice in Apple Maps, Maps should always load the address and display the place mark on the map UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the second attempt to show the address in Apple Maps, the Apple Maps UI loads but the bottom Search Box disappears or shows “No Results Found”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhone Simulator 10.2, Xcode 8.2.1, iPhone 6S Plus, iOS 10.3 (14E5277a)"
