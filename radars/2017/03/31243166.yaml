    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI used to comment out code in Xcode by using the handy / and * keys on the number pad to quickly type \"/**/\" or \"//\". This stopped working a while ago (El Capitan? not sure.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use a A1243 keyboard with German layout (that might not be necessary)\r\n2. Use German as an input source\r\n3. Type a \"*\" and/or a \"/\" in on the number pad (the keys right below F18 and F19) in e.g. Text Edit.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA \"/\" or \"*\" should show up\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens when hitting those keys.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.10.3 (16D32) and earlier.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame problem with the \"=\" key below F17. \"+\" and \"-\" on the number pad work as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- A1243 keyboard with German layout (that might not be necessary)\r\n- German as an input source\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0298.JPG' was successfully uploaded."
