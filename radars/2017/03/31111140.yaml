    description: "Summary:\r\nIn our app we want to disable swiping the master view from the edge on iPads because it interferes with the user experience. Thus we set presentsWithGesture = NO for the split view controller. At the same time, we wanted to maintain a minimum 320 pt width of the master view, which seemed to be reduced to 309 pt since iOS 8.\r\n\r\nA number of crash reports was discovered to be caused by this combination, specifically the order of which these two attributes were set. Our fix was to ensure presentsWithGesture = NO was called *before* minimumPrimaryColumnWidth was modified.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Master-Detail Application (I use Objective C)\r\nIn AppDelegate.m, add the following two lines to application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\r\n\r\n    splitViewController.minimumPrimaryColumnWidth = 320.0f;\r\n    splitViewController.presentsWithGesture = NO;\r\n\r\nLaunch application on an iPad device or simulator in portrait orientation.\r\nOn the detail view, swipe left then right without lifting your finger.\r\nThe application will now crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the application to behave identically, and not crash, regardless of the order of these two lines of code, since there is no documentation that suggests the ordering matters.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application crashed because minimumPrimaryColumnWidth was set before presentsWithGesture = NO was specified.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4 mini\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
