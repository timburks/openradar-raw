    description: "We have several classes of users on our XCode Server instance. One of these is our QA team which uses it to install integrations onto their iOS devices. Occasionally, a QA member presses the integrate button and starts a new integration, which can be confusing.\r\n\r\nWe would like the ability to segregate these users into a group that allows only access to download an app's ipa and does not allow those users to start or edit an integration."
