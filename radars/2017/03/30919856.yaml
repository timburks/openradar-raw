    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAll common formatters (e.g. (NS)DateFormatter, (NS)NumberFormatter) provide a locale property with which a locale can be specified in which the formatter should format the input. (NS)ByteCountFormatter is missing such a property.\r\nSince usually all formatters need to format in a specific locale, it would probably the simplest to add such a property to the common (NS)Formatter superclass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project\r\n2. Create an (NS)ByteCountFormatter instance.\r\n3. Try to format a string in a locale which differs from the system locale (e.g. by setting the locale property)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a property on the (NS)ByteCountFormatter instance for the locale that is used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo locale property is present and there is no way to tell the (NS)ByteCountFormatter which locale it should use. It will always default to the system locale.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince (NS)ByteCountFormatter most likely uses an (NS)NumberFormatter internally (Linux Foundation does at least), it could also be an option to expose this instance. However, this could also cause a lot of other problems since properties on (NS)NumberFormatter could be changed, that would result in faulty formatting of byte counts.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Device"
