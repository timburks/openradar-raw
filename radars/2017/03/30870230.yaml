    description: "Summary:\r\nThe API docs https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621453-modalpresentationcapturesstatusb state that \"The system ignores this propertyâ€™s value for a view controller presented fullscreen\". However when presenting a full screen modal I have found that it is still necessary to override this value and set it to 'true' in order to capture the status bar appearance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1). Create a custom UIViewController with preferredStatusBarStyle overridden to .lightContent\r\n2) also override modalPresentationStyle to .overFullScreen\r\n3) present that custom controller over another controller. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe custom controller should capture the statusbar appearance, and so a light status bar should be shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe custom controller doesn't capture the status bar appearance, and so no change is made to the status bar. \r\n\r\nIf you override modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance and set it to `true` in the custom view controller, then the status bar appearance is captured."
