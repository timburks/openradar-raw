    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAFAIK, it only occurs for AppleColorEmoji font. The 1st CTFontCopySupportedLanguages call works as expected, returning an empty array. But since the 2nd time all calls of CTFontCopySupportedLanguages return nil, which is unexpected:\r\n\r\n1. 2nd call differing from 1st call is already wrong.\r\n2. Its doc says it returns \"A retained reference to an array of languages supported by the font.\"\r\n3. Its type annotation in Swift is (_: CTFont) -> CFArray, which causes crash since 2nd call on because nil is returned for non-optional type.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample app and read the console logs. Relevant code is in -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cEtBTbZ9i1c"
