    description: "Area:\r\nNotification Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the device is unlocked new notifications will stop the sound of the previous notification. When the device is locked notification sounds will start to stack. This is problematic if the notification sounds a longer than a second or two.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock the device\r\n2. Receive multiple notifications with long sounds\r\n3. The sounds now stack together and only stop once all are finished playing or the user pressed the home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the experience to be similar/same between the locked and unlocked state. The new notification should stop the sound of the previous notification.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification sounds on the lock screen stack.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1, 10.3 beta7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone5S, Spring using Wifi/Mobile Data"
