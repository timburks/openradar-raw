    description: "Summary:\r\nSince OS X Mavericks, Apple has allowed notifications for websites via the W3C Web Push API (https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/) as well as Safari Push Notifications (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/NotificationProgrammingGuideForWebsites/Introduction/Introduction.html), allowing websites to update users unobtrusively about new content and updates. \r\n\r\nIt would be useful for this feature to be implemented in iOS Safari, as many people rely on their smartphones for up-to-the-minute content. Preventing web-apps from presenting push notifications relegates them to second-class citizens. \r\n\r\nChrome for Android now allows push notifications (https://blog.chromium.org/2015/04/reaching-and-re-engaging-users-on.html), giving an inconsistent experience across mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari on an iOS device.\r\n2. Navigate to a page that supports Safari Push Notifications (ex: http://www.cnn.com)\r\n3. No option to receive push notifications is presented to the user\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA modal asking to allow push notifications from the visiting site appears. A user could allow or deny notifications. If a user wishes to change their preferences after allowing or denying web notifications, they can change their preferences from the Settings app in an appropriate pane (likely either Settings>Notifications or Settings>Safari)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo options are shown to receive push notifications on iOS Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS version through current (10.3 as of this radar submission)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device."
