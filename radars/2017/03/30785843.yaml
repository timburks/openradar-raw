    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTrying to copy a Google search URL in Safari is impossible due to the URL bar automatically taking the search text from the URL and using that in the URL bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Google anything (via URL bar, or Google.com text box)\r\n3. Try to copy URL\r\n4. Text is only the search text\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome sort of ability to copy the URL text somewhere. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI had to open my Macbook, load up a browser, perform the same search again, and iMessage myself the URL.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 (14E5260b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI see the usefulness of having the search text in the URL as opposed to the URL, but having no way to get the actual URL is frustrating.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 64GB, GSM (Rogers Canada)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
