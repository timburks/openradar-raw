    description: "Summary:\r\nSince it's apparent that Date objects play a large part in reaching goals (rdar://30785069) why not make this bug into a feature?\r\n\r\nYou could get a achievement any time you stand more than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nGiven the Earth's circumference of 24,901 miles and an Airbus A380 traveling at 560 miles/hour, the theoretical limit for this achievement is 44.4660714286 hours.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, a westward trip from Fiji (where I discovered the problem in rdar://30785069) to Cupertino would be a great way to maximize this achievement."
