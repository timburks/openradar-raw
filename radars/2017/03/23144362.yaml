    description: "Ryan Manly16-Oct-2015 11:04 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a computer is bound to a directory service and the login window is set to display as name and password fields, if the directory service is not available the red dot will appear in the name field. After typing in a username and hitting the TAB key to input the password focus is instead moved to the red dot and not to the password field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. bind to AD or OD\r\n2. set machine to display login as \"name and password\"\r\n3. log out of machine off network or in some other way to make directory services unreachable\r\n4. type username\r\n5. hit tab key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTab key moves to password field for entry\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTab key highlights red dot that indicates network account unavailable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11 - 10.11.1 (15B38b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis did not occur in previous OS X versions\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LWScreenShot 2015-10-16 at 8.00.59 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
