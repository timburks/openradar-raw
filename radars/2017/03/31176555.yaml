        Summary:
        When launching Xcode.app (but not `xcodebuild`), any iOS/tvOS devices attached and trusted with the current macOS host will begin "Processing Symbol Files" if that hasn't yet been done or if the current symbols are stale (e.g. from a different OS version).

        There's no way (officially supported or otherwise) to either a) explicitly trigger the symbolication process or b) monitor an ongoing symbolication operation to be notified of its progress or completion.

        Ideally, there would be a way to do both from an `xcodebuild` command.

        Also, the fact that running `xcodebuild` doesn't automatically process symbol files should probably be considered a bug. Please let me know if I should file a separate radar for that.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A.

        Expected Results:
        N/A.

        Actual Results:
        N/A.

        Regression:
        N/A.
