    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen pressing the list item in the navigation bar of a QLPreviewController with many items (e.g. >= 50), the main thread is blocked while the list is configured and shown. When opening the list with less than 50 items, it'll appear within around 10 seconds on an iPad Air 2 Simulator.\r\nThis only happens on iPads and when the width trait is regular size (so that the list is presented in a popover).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a QLPreviewController whose dataSource returns more than 50 items.\r\n2. Present the QLPreviewController on an iPad.\r\n3. Click the list button.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Open and run the attached sample project on an iPad.\r\n2. [Optional] Configure number of items.\r\n3. Click \"Show QLPreviewController\" Button.\r\n4. Click the list button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list shows more or less immediately while the previews for the items in the list are loaded asynchronously.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe main thread is blocked until the list appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 (14B72)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn all other configurations (when the list is presented fullscreen) it works as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad or iPad Simulator. App needs to have regular width.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'QLPreviewTester.zip' was successfully uploaded."
