    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running `xcodebuild ... -destination='id=$DEVICE_ID'` on a device that is paired (aka trusted) but has never had its symbol files \"processed\" (aka copied) will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcodebuild: error: Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier:\r\n        { id:6bce7c0274b3d85a230c0e1316dd6c1f5b583fc3 }\r\n\r\n    Unsupported device specifier option.\r\n    The device \"My Mac\" does not support the following options: id\r\n    Please supply only supported device specifier options.\r\n\r\n    Available destinations for the \"Realm iOS static\" scheme:\r\n        { platform:OS X, arch:x86_64 }\r\n        { platform:iOS, id:6bce7c0274b3d85a230c0e1316dd6c1f5b583fc3, name:iPad }\r\n        { platform:tvOS Simulator, id:A9C2C50E-F8D0-46BF-9685-F1C599EB6A1A, OS:9.1, name:Apple TV 1080p }\r\n        { platform:iOS Simulator, id:8D3789BD-BADC-4ABD-9CCD-E510D6EF08B3, OS:9.2, name:iPad 2 }\r\n        ...(lots more simulators)...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that xcodebuild was 'unable to find' the destination of 6bce7... (external iPhone) but listed this same device (6bce7...) in its 'Available destinations' prompt a few lines later.\r\n\r\nThis error does not occur after the device has had its symbol files copied/processed, instead happily running the binary on the device, with great success and aplomb.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've also filed rdar://31176555 (http://www.openradar.me/31176555) to enable more transparency into the symbolication process which would be useful to work around this limitation, and would possibly be useful in other ways as well, beyond working around bugs."
