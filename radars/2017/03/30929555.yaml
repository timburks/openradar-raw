        Summary:
        As it stands today, Configuration Profiles, which are the primary means by which MDMs manage clients, do not cover enough settings for many large organizations (Facebook, Google, etc)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to manage SSH settings
        2. Can't be done with profiles.

        Expected Results:
        All major services on macOS should be manageable via Profiles or some other means.

        Actual Results:
        Cannot manage a large number of settings.

        Notes:
        Here are a list of settings that cannot be managed fully/at all using Configuration Profiles today:


        - Manage common settings via MDM
          - ntpd (“Set date and time automatically”)
            - Allowing multiple time servers to be set for shops where there’s a requirement to use an internal NTP server which isn’t accessible outside the network.
          - Enforce SSHD enabled/disabled (called “Remote login” in System Preferences)
          - SSH configuration (e.g. disable password auth / enforce key based auth)
          - Associating SSH keys with users (for password-less SSH) (see also:  Kerberos auth to SSH hosts)
          - Forwarding logs to one or more central syslog servers
          - sudoers (lol)
          - /etc/hosts
          - pathsd
          - Non-plist configuration files (e.g. conf files) Examples: Cisco AnyConnect, git, hg, arc, java ruleset, Splunk, Firefox, etc.
          - PAM modules
          - Security Certificate preferences
          - Identity Preferences
          - User Accounts (local users/passwords)
          - pf/firewall
          - pf logging
          - file sharing, both Server.app & regular in sys prefs (AFP / SMB / FTP)
          - Bluetooth settings
          - Network locations, and all network settings (not just 802.1x / wifi payloads…)
          - System certificates (adding via profile already work) - removal / revocation, CRL / OCSP, changing root CA trusts
          - Printers - adding works via profile (barely), but doesn’t remove when profile is removed; lpoptions aren’t enforced (either permanently or set-once)
            - Printer presets - particularly when critical information like network accounting is stored within the preset prefs data
          - Default audio input/output interface selection for classroom/auditorium/kiosk use
          - CUPS in general
          - Location Services (on / off / privacy controls)
          - TCC db (on / off / who gets what, access…)
          - pmset / power management / scheduled reboots, authrestarts, etc.
          - spotlight - adding / removing privacy entries, configuring / enabling
          - User account creation? CreateUserPkg?
          - Secure update process for passwords of specified local account(s).
          - Hostnames / ComputerName / LocalHostName? (scutil?)
          - SAML/SSO integration with DEP boot/MDM enrollment
          - Maximum screensaver idle time (i.e., “No more than 15 minutes”, and not “exactly 5” or exactly “10”)
          - Anything Apple hasn’t thought of yet that we can currently handle with the tools we have available today
