    description: "Can not connect a control's event to an existing IBAction, if the IBAction is expecting an Any parameter. If you change the parameter type of the IBAction to AnyObject, or a control's type such as UIButton, this problem is resolved. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n1. New Xcode Project\r\n2. Drag on two buttons to storyboard\r\n3. Open Assistant Editor\r\n4. Connect a button to an IBAction, by control dragging from button in storyboard to ViewController.swift, select 'Action' connection, and leave the 'type' as the default 'Any'. Give the action a name (let's call it 'hitMe' and select 'Connect'.\r\n5. Control-drag the second button to the 'hitMe' IBAction, and...wait - why isn't it letting me? Weird. Right click on the button and drag from the TouchUpInside event to the IBAction. No, that didn't work either. How about from the TouchUpInside event in the Connections Inspector? Nope. Hmm...\r\n\r\nExpected results\r\nYou expect that the IBAction method will highlight, and allow you to drag a second control to the same IBAction.\r\n\r\nActual results\r\nThe IBAction method does not highlight. \r\n\r\nAdditional notes\r\nProblem can be resolved by changing the parameter type to UIButton, or AnyObject."
