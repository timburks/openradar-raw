    description: "Summary:\r\nI am unable to play my voicemail on my iPhone. This has been an intermittent problem for multiple years (3+) and it has happened on different iPhone's as I've upgraded.\r\n\r\nThe play button does not work when I press it and the transcription while nice to have, is not accurate enough. I need to be able to listen to my voicemail.\r\n\r\nI've had voicemail crash multiple times. Reseting phone doesn't always fix, it's very buggy and needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait for someone to call me\r\n2. Don't pick up\r\n3. Let them leave a voicemail\r\n4. Try to play the voicemail\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Voicemail should play and I should be able to followup with my contact\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Play button activates and deactivates\r\n2. No sound comes out, even with speaker option\r\n3. Voicemail/phone app will sometimes crash and behavior erratically \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2.1 (14D27)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S+ 64gb\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
