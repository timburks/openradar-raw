    description: "Area: UIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: The UIDatePicker used to show \"Adar\" for non-leap years for the NSHebrewCalendar. In iOS 10.3 beta it shows Adar I and Adar II for all years.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Set up Xcode project with a UIDatePicker\r\n2. Set the calendar to Hebrew\r\n3. Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The date picker should hide Adar I when the date of the date picker represents a non-leap year on the date picker. \r\n\r\nActual Results: The date picker shows both Adars, and Adar I is un-selectable. \r\n\r\nThis is confusing to me as an American Jew who uses the Gregorian and Hebrew calendars. I don't usually think of the non-leap Adar as \"Adar II\" even though this is semantically correct. Israelis who use the Hebrew calendar daily might intuit this better, but the previous behavior is more natural to me. \r\n\r\nFurther, the disabled state of the Adar I row doesn't provide a great enough contrast for me to tell without attempting to select it. \r\n\r\nSee the attached screen shot for actual usage inside of my app, with the problem demonstrated. This year, 5777 on the Hebrew calendar is not a leap year and yet the picker shows both months. \r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 10.3 Beta 3, iPhone 6S, Verizon"
