    description: "We would like to see the public transit APIs improved, too. Currently, we refrain from using them in our Where To? app http://itunes.apple.com/app/id903955898?mt=8 because they're fairly limited. We've duped some of the individual radars in this list that are of particular interest for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://30418222\r\n\r\nI would like to see some public transit APIs in MapKit, allowing us to build our own public transit routing apps with custom UI. I've been filing a lot of radars asking for specific things, and here's a list of them.\r\n\r\nrdar://30395156, new constant for TransportSubtype (i.e. public transit mode, e.g. bus or ferry)\r\nrdar://30395905, ability to know if an MKMapItem is a transit stop\r\nrdar://30396538, MKDirectionsResponse having a property that returns a directionsRequest to repeat the same query\r\nrdar://30396574, MKRouteStep should have origin/destination MKMapItem properties\r\nrdar://30396631, MKRouteStep should have transit type property\r\nrdar://30396804, classes to represent transit lines (e.g. subway lines) and trips (e.g. one train service on one line at a certain time)\r\nrdar://30396832, MKRouteStep should have a property representing the transit trip\r\nrdar://30396881, a class representing a calling point (i.e. a map item combined with a time and a platform number)\r\nrdar://30397022, extra properties on MKMapItem for transit stops\r\nrdar://30397188, a transit stop search request (to find transit stops in a region)\r\nrdar://30397273, a request to get the upcoming departures from a transit stop\r\nrdar://30417333, a request to get the calling points from a departure\r\nrdar://30417363, colours for transit lines to be exposed"
