    description: "Summary:\r\nProject is attached.  Demo movie at [REDACTED]\r\n\r\nI have a window with a custom NSView in it.  The view's class is displayed in the placeholder.  If I change the class, the classname is not updated, so now the screen is stale w.r.t. what's actually happening. I have to leave the editor and come back in to get it to reflect reality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. change the class of a custom view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe displayed class name changes to reflect relity\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe displayed class name doesn't change, providing misleading information\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 2 (8W120l)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'GrafDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
