        I would like to see some public transit APIs in MapKit, allowing us to build our own public transit routing apps with custom UI. I've been filing a lot of radars asking for specific things, and here's a list of them.

        rdar://30395156, new constant for TransportSubtype (i.e. public transit mode, e.g. bus or ferry)
        rdar://30395905, ability to know if an MKMapItem is a transit stop
        rdar://30396538, MKDirectionsResponse having a property that returns a directionsRequest to repeat the same query
        rdar://30396574, MKRouteStep should have origin/destination MKMapItem properties
        rdar://30396631, MKRouteStep should have transit type property
        rdar://30396804, classes to represent transit lines (e.g. subway lines) and trips (e.g. one train service on one line at a certain time)
        rdar://30396832, MKRouteStep should have a property representing the transit trip
        rdar://30396881, a class representing a calling point (i.e. a map item combined with a time and a platform number)
        rdar://30397022, extra properties on MKMapItem for transit stops
        rdar://30397188, a transit stop search request (to find transit stops in a region)
        rdar://30397273, a request to get the upcoming departures from a transit stop
        rdar://30417333, a request to get the calling points from a departure
        rdar://30417363, colours for transit lines to be exposed
