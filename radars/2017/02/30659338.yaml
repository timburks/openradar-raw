    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMessages notifications for stickers should be disabled by default as they do not add any important information to influence a conversation.\r\n\r\n(I am frequently spammed by sticker notifications in group conversations)\r\n\r\nIf not, Messages should either show an option in Settings to disable notifications for stickers or allow them to be turned off on a per-conversation basis.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Participate in group conversation with other users\r\n2. Have another one or more users in the group conversation apply one or more stickers to message(s)\r\n3. Receive notifications for each sticker, which are not useful/informative\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect not to receive any notifications for stickers being applied, or have the option to disable sticker notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI receive a notification for each individual sticker being applied to a message.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1 [14D27]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 32GB"
