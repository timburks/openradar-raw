    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to upload 4000+ files (but occasionally also fewer) Safari hangs and doesn't complete the upload. Request goes into timeout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Publish a small script on a server to upload multiple files (see the attached file)\r\n2. Download an image from lorempixel (small, I used 100x50 px)\r\n3. Duplicate the downloaded file exponentially up to 8192 files\r\n4. Send them to the server through the script just published\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpload completes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari loads indefinitely, the upload hangs and the request timeouts.\r\nMore steps AFTER the timeout:\r\n5. Try again to upload the files: Safari loads indefinitely and the upload hangs at the same percentage of the previous upload.\r\n6. Try again to upload the last file of the list: Safari loads indefinitely and the upload hangs.\r\n7. Try again to upload the first file of the list: the upload succeed.\r\n8. Try again to upload another file not included in the list of previous files. Safari loads indefinitely and the upload hangs\r\n\r\nIt's something like \"I can upload a maximum of yyy mb for tab or zzz files and I can't read more than these limits so I can't complete the upload\"\r\n\r\nSo, to workaround the issue I need to force quit and restart Safari.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 10.0.3 (11602.4.8.0.1) with El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe issue occurres every time"
