    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting constraints relative to layout margins guide in designated initializer doesn't work reliably. If you set the constraints of a view via code, the layout margins guide is not set properly if you initialize the view with .zero\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\noccurs if view is created via code and layout margins are set in viewDidMoveToSuperview or in traitCollection did change\r\n\r\nalso see description and additional notes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nlayout margins guide should be set according to the layout margins\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nlayout margins are set to zero\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C89)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nmore info here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/40334423/2048599\r\nand here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/93313\r\n\r\nit works if the view is initialized with a bigger size than the layout margins guide - storyboards is using 1000.0 x 1000.0 to initialize and then it works, but it feels icky to use an arbitrary size here\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nrMBP with simulator or device - seems it doesn't matter what you use"
