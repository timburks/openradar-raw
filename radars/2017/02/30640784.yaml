        Summary:
        When using Accessibility zoom (using scroll gesture + control) with smooth images enabled, my MacBook Pro 2016 sometimes (two or three times a week) hangs: it's fans starts to run loudly and the screen, nor input devices do anything. Closing the MacBook and opening it again does not resolve the issue. Only a hard reboot works.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Get a MacBook Pro 2016 13"
        2. Attach it to an UltraFine 5K display
        3. Enable ctrl+scroll for Accessibility Zoom
        4. ctrl+scroll to zoom in/out many many times

        Expected Results:
        1. Machine doesn't hang

        Actual Results:
        2. Machine hangs; reboot is necessary

        Regression:
        I cannot reproduce this on my Late 2014 MacBook Pro.

        Notes:
        The amount of software issues that plague the MacBook 2016 is insane. During a regular day of work I usually have about 5 kernel panics, a couple of hangs, cursor issues, etc:  I am pretty sure you are aware of the full list of issues with the MacBook 2016 and macOS Sierra. This has been going on for months now also. Please resolve these issues so I can use this expensive machine without problems.
