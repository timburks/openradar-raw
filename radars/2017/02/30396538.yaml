    description: "MKDirectionsResponse should have a directionsRequest property.\n\nThe use case: the MKDirectionsResponse API should return you all information required to rebuild that search. For example, I would need access to the arrivalTime or departureTime information — there's a big difference between searching for departures at 3pm and finding the first departure is at 5pm (oh no, 2 hour wait!), verses searching for departures at 4.45 and finding one at 5pm (15 minute wait, that's fine). \n\nI guess the app could separately track the request that was used to produce the response, but it would be way more convenient if the API did that for us.\n\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
