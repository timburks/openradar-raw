    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe bedtime feature in Clock app should allow the user to tap a button to 'check-in' as sleeping.\r\n\r\nThis would show the time in a large font, a Snooze button, and both dim the screen and enable Do Not Disturb.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I can can wake up at 6.30, change my Bedtime wake time to 7.30 in preparation for tomorrow, then it will fire in an hour even though I'm awake. This would solve that issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wake up at 6.30\r\n2. Change Bedtime wake time to 7.30\r\n3. Watch as Bedtime alarm/vibration plays at 7.30 despite being awake\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBedtime actually knows when you are and are not sleeping. Does not have to monitor sleep states, just whether you are or not so as not to fire unnecessary alarms.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBedtime alarm fires even though I am awake.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1 [14D27]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 32GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
