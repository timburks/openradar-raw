    description: "The dyld manpage (at the very least) should warn very clearly about how those environment vars are purged when forking, as explained in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/RuntimeProtections/RuntimeProtections.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016462-CH3-SW1\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: It would be very useful to have some way to print the moment when DYLD env vars are dropped."
