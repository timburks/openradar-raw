    description: "Summary:\n\nI’m using Slack (slack.com) in Safari and when a notification comes in, the notification sound is registered with the system media playback system. This means the play/pause button on the Touch Bar plays the Slack notification sound on demand. This is not a useful behaviour, and blocks the button from doing something useful like controlling iTunes.\n\nI’ve contacted Slack support and they came back with:\n\n> I'm getting back in touch to let you know that I've got some updates from our Mac engineers on this :)\n> \n> We've been able to reproduce this behaviour and I've got confirmation that this is controlled by Safari and so unfortunately, it's not something we can fix on our end.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Be a member of a Slack team\n2. Open iTunes with some music in it\n3. Play in iTunes\n4. Pause in iTunes\n5. Go to your team’s Slack in Safari at https://<teamname>.slack.com/\n6. In Slack, go to Preferences > Notifications > Send test notification\n7. Wait for the sound to finish\n8. Press a system media play button (I’m using the Touch Bar)\n\nExpected Results:\n\niTunes to resume playing. Safari to not be registered with system media playback as this is a short notification sound.\n\nActual Results:\n\nPlays the Slack notification sound every time you press play. Safari also shows up in the Touch Bar media section (the circle with a bar chart in it).\n\nRegression:\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nWorkaround are to use Slack in Chrome or use the Slack desktop app which wraps the webpage. These are not appealing to me."
