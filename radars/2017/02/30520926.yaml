        Summary:
        When the system reboots because of a kernel panic and one uses FileVault, external bluetooth keyboards (like the Magic Keyboard) and trackpads (Magic Trackpad 2) do not work unless connected by cable in the screen were one enters the password for FileVault.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use FileVault and a Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2
        2. Make mac OS reboot because of a kernel panic (easiest is to use an UltraFine 5K monitor for about a day)
        3. In the password screen for FileVault to unlock the disk initially, try to enter your password using the Magic Keyboard

        Expected Results:
        - password can be entered

        Actual Results:
        - keyboard does not work over bluetooth. Tethering by USB-cable is necessary

        Regression:
