    description: "Marked as a duplicate of 27591711 on Feb 10 2017\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nArea:\r\nTouchID\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf we present a Touch ID prompt to our users, pressing in the home button while trying to scan your finger acts the same as pressing the Cancel button. It is not obvious to the user that this will happen and from the app-side we can not distinguish an intentional cancel from a non-intentional one. Many users think you need to press in the home button to do a Touch ID unlock, especially post-iOS10 where you _DO_ need to press in the home button to unlock your phone from the lock screen. \r\nThis behavior should be changed to either: \r\n* Be differentiable from hitting the cancel button\r\n* Process the Touch ID authorization successfully\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any app that secures with Touch ID (eg. Stripe, 1Password) and get to the Touch ID prompt.\r\n2. When prompted to do Touch ID, put your finger on the home button and also press in the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTouch ID will process successfully (either correct auth, or invalid fingerprint)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTouch ID is cancelled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 6, but complaints from users on other Touch ID capable devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
