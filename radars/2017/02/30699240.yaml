    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new API documentation is very nice and very clean. But it lacks one thing that the old documentation had: a condensed view of API changes.\r\n\r\nBefore, in the old documentation site, I could visit a page that listed all the API diffs between two versions, and only the API diffs (Here is an example: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/iOS10APIDiffs/Objective-C/UIKit.html). This provided an easy way to see what has changed in a release without seeing the other APIs listed which had not been changed, which is how the new API documentation site works (Here is an example: https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit?changes=latest_major)\r\n\r\nThis is especially helpful when only a relatively small number of APIs has changed in a framework between versions, as there is less I have to sift through to find what has changed. Compare this API diff of HomeKit from iOS 10.0 to 10.1 on the old site (https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/iOS101APIDiffs/Objective-C/HomeKit.html) with this API diff of UIKit from Xcode 8.2 to the 8.3 betas on the new site (https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit?changes=latest_minor).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at the API diffs on the new documentation site.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee *only* the APIs between two selected versions that have changed, been added, or been removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee APIs that have been changed, added, or removed between two selected versions interspersed with APIs that have not been touched between the two versions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference?changes=latest_minor\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not at all saying that we have to bring back the old documentation site altogether. However, there is this one piece that was better implemented on the old documentation site than the new documentation site.\r\n\r\nI've been able to get something that sorta works using the following JavaScript, but it is certainly not ideal:\r\n\r\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.symbol .symbol-name:not(.changed)').forEach(function(node) { node.parentNode.style['display'] = 'none'; })\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
