    description: "Area: Keyboard\r\n\r\nSummary: In the native keyboard on iOS 10 for iPad, the left and right (single and double) quotation marks are the wrong way round. On iOS 10 for iPhone, however, they are the right way round. This seems to have been the case since around iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Focus on a text input so that the on screen keyboard pops up.\r\n2. Tap the ‘.?123’ key in the bottom left to view the symbol layer.\r\n3. Tap and hold on either the single quotation mark key (’) or the double quotation mark key (”) to bring up the list of alternatives.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The list of alternatives for the single quotation mark should be (from left to right): grave accent (`), left single quotation mark (‘), right single quotation mark (’).\r\n\r\nThe list of alternatives for the double quotation mark should be: left-pointing double angle quotation mark («), right-pointing double angle quotation mark (»), double low-9 quotation mark („), left double quotation mark (“), right double quotation mark (”).\r\n\r\nThis is seen on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The actual list of alternatives for the single quotation mark on the iPad is (from left to right): grave accent (`), right single quotation mark (’), left single quotation mark (‘).\r\n\r\nThe actual list of alternatives for the double quotation mark is: left-pointing double angle quotation mark («), double low-9 quotation mark („), right double quotation mark (”), left double quotation mark (“), right-pointing double angle quotation mark (»).\r\n\r\nThe keys enter the same character that is printed on them, but the issue is that the key ordering is wrong. Because it’s very difficult to tell which way round the quotes are in the system font, people use the wrong ones without realising, which means that if you view e.g. an email from an iPad user on a different device, ”the writing doesn‘t look right ‘cause all the quotes are back to front.“\r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 7 (I think) through 10.2 on iPad only.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration: I’m using the English (UK) locale.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
