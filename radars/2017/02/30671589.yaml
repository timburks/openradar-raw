    description: "The only way to export notes from Notes.app is in PDF format. This is useless if the user wants to move to another notes application, or make a backup, or whatever. There should be a way to export as an XML file, or as a bunch of text files, or any other possibility.\r\n\r\nThis is specially ugly given that Notes does allow importing notes. Makes it look like Apple is eager to trap people into buggy, non-user-listening software."
