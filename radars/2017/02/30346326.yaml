    description: "The AppleScript Pages command 'export' appears to be not functional, due to Sandbox restriction. \r\n\r\nWhile this makes sense to prevent malicious scripts from adding or overwriting any files, it also seriously inhibits any Automator workflows that would make use of the `export` command (or other commands that write to the file system).\r\n\r\nHaving a reliable workaround would greatly improve matters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached workflow.\r\n2. Add a .pages document to the 'Get specified finder item' step at the top.\r\n3. Run the workflow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA PDF file with the same name appears in the same directory as the .pages file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWorkflow stops with the following error;\r\n\r\n> Pages got an error: The document “test” could not be exported as “test”. You don’t have permission.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVarious other ways of specifying the `_location` for the export did not yield any better results. For example, converting it to POSIX just gave other errors.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the following StackExchange question; http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/269539/44633"
