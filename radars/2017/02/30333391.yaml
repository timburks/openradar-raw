    description: "Summary:\r\n(please see attached video)\r\n\r\nI have a playground with this in a page:\r\n\r\n/*:\r\n# Swift TFM n'at\r\n\r\nReading through the Swift Book and playing with stuff \r\nthat looks somewhat interesting\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n/*:\r\n\r\n## typealias\r\n\r\n_Type aliases_ define an alternative naem for an existing type_\r\n\r\nHoover ni bork:\r\n\r\n    typealias AudioSample = UInt16\r\n    typealias AudioSample = UInt16\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe documentation at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/CodeBlocks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH12-SW1 says that code blocks are indented by at least four spaces with a blank line before and after - that's the case here.  The example on the page shows it rendered as just monospace font.\r\n\r\nWhen I try it, I get an \"example\" sigil on the page (see attached screen shot), which I don't want.\r\n\r\nThe \"example\" docs have a pretty baroque example, including a whole lot of escaped newlines led in by \"-example\", which I am not doing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have \"Code Block\" formatting\r\n2. go into markup render mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee code block formatting\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nget example formatting\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'aggressive-example.mp4' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-02 at 2.49.20 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
