    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nLate yesterday, I noticed that MKDirections ETA requests is now ignoring the arrivalDate parameter.  This is unacceptable, as this has caused my app to stop performing as intended.  This is NOT an issue on my end, as I have not made any recent changes to the app (It has been live since December and I have used it daily with no issues), and I created a completely new project to test out my theory about the ETA request issues and once again, the server is not returning a time that factors in traffic properly when the arrivalDate parameter is used.  Instead, it appears as though the server returns a travel duration reflecting the CURRENT traffic, and not the traffic at the time specified by the arrivalDate property.  Please fix this issue as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode app\r\n2. Create an MKDirections ETA request between two points that require going on the freeway (so the travel duration will be subject to traffic) and specify the arrivalDate property to be any time later in the day.\r\n3.  Repeat step two but slightly change the arrivalDate.\r\n3. You will see that the server is ignoring the arrivalDate property and is returning travel durations that reflect CURRENT traffic, not traffic at the specified time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result is to see a travel duration that reflects traffic at the time specified by the arrivalDate property of the MKDirections request.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe ETA and expected travel duration that is returned is reflective of CURRENT traffic conditions rather than those at the specified time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2.1 and 10.3 beta 3, but the iOS versions are irrelevant.  This is a server issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a server issue that you must fix.  Please do so as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 16GB on AT&T using WiFi, iPad mini 16GB using WiFi, Xcode 8.2.1 iOS Simulator"
