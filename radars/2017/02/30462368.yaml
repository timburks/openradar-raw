    description: "Summary:\r\nThe completionWithItemsHandler callback has a parameter \"completed\" that's supposed to report if the activity has been successfully completed.\r\nHowever, this isn't always true, and it definitely isn't with AirDrop.\r\nIf a user attempts an AirDrop transfer, the callback reports to have been completed even when the transfer is declined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install any sample code that makes use of AirDrop on 2 devices\r\n2. On one device, invoke the AirDrop transfer to the second device\r\n3. On the second device, reject the transfer\r\n4. Close the Share sheet\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the sheet is closed, completionWithItemsHandler is called with \"completed\" flag as false, and possibly an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncompletionWithItemsHandler returns \"completed\" as true, and no error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Devices, happens with iPhones, iPads, and even with Macs"
