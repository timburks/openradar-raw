    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nrequestReview() provides no method by which to know whether a user is done interacting with a rating alert, or whether an alert was displayed at all. There should be a way to allow developers to register for a callback, which should be called in two scenarios:\r\n\r\n1) The user is done interacting with the rating prompt, if it was shown.\r\n2) If no rating prompt was shown.\r\n\r\nThis way, developers can plan to display UI correctly around the rating prompt and not degrade the user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the documentation for SKStoreReviewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a method, e.g., `requestReview(completion: (Void) -> Void)`, that allows a developer to register for a callback in the scenarios outlined in the description.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such method exists. The only method on SKStoreReviewController is `requestReview()`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
