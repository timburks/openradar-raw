    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering a non-US address on macOS Sierra, the postal code is truncated to the first 4 characters when sent to the onShippingContactSelected callback. This makes it impossible to use this address to, for example, dynamically determine a shipping cost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a page that integrates Apple Pay. On the ApplePaySession, set this event handler:\r\n\r\napplePaySession.onshippingcontactselected = function( shipping )\r\n{ console.log( shipping.shippingContact ); }\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen this page in Safari on Sierra, open the web inspector (console view), then trigger the Apple Pay payment sheet. Enter a Canadian or UK address for the shipping contact per the example in my screenshot:\r\n\r\nTest Testerson\r\n123 Some Street\r\n3G\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the full postal code to be passed back to the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch what gets logged in the console—you'll see the truncated address. I believe this also affects the address passed to the ApplePaySession's onPaymentAuthorized event.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested in Safari Technology Preview Release 24, as well as Safari 10.0.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo current workaround, and as a result collecting shipping information Apple Pay does not work for international customers. This affects GB / UK addresses, Nederland addresses, etc—any country that uses a combination of numbers and letters and has a space in the postal code.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure whether this is a bug in Safari or PassKit.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis always occurs. I'm unaware of any ApplePay settings that would affect this.\r\n\r\nhttps://cl.ly/0s0g103g2L08/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-27%20at%209.33.59%20AM.png\r\nhttps://cl.ly/091g2d2z1T2F/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-27%20at%209.33.48%20AM.png"
