Once it's saved it's drawn normally\".\r\n\r\nFor storyboards, it's anyones guess.\r\n\r\nSee movie \"dirty-storyboard.mp4\" with a forthcoming dropbox link because radarweb is unreliable (c.f. rdar://30364703)  This is a screen recording of me trying to get some work done, and the storyboard went from non-dirty to dirty.  It never went dirty to non-dirty after a save.\r\n\r\nI tried reproducing the steps (had to close and re-open the project to get it out of \"stuck-on\" mode).  Only now, no matter what I did, it _never_ got marked as dirty.  Video is undirty-storyboard.mp4\r\n\r\nProject is attached too.\r\n\r\n(this is actually the ~second~ _third_ attempt at submitting this, because #lolradarweb)\r\n\r\n(you can see my progress (or lack thereof) in the project - same one that's led to rdar://30364545 rdar://30364640 rdar://30364686 and rdar://30364703 just today)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
