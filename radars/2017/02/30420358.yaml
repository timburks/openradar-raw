    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://30397273\r\n\r\nThis should be an API that takes an MKMapItem representing a transit stop (see radar 30397022 for more info), and outputs a set of MKTransitCallingPoints for that stop (see radar 30396881).\r\n\r\nUse case: to build an app that can show the upcoming departures from a bus stop or railway station.\r\n\r\nThe MKTransitDeparturesSearchRequest should take an MKMapItem, and also a time (so as to be able to query for the past or the future).\r\n\r\nReturned results should include realtime data if such data is available.\r\n\r\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
