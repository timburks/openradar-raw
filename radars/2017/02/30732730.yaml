    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing an app and wanting to use Xcode to launch and run on my device my apple watch udid is required to be on the provisioning profile even if the project contains no apple watch targets\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode\r\n2. Create provisioning profile for new project without including any watches (since project does not have a watch target)\r\n2. Connect phone (with apple watch connected) to computer and try to build project for phone device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the project does not contain an apple watch target it should not require to code sign for the apple watch. It should build fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject build immediately fails because of codesigning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1, OS X 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to disconnect the watch from the phone (turn off bluetooth) but that seems silly and makes the watch not as useful. Turning off bluetooth all day so I can develop apps is inconvenient. I also need to have bluetooth on to test bluetooth speakers and the like and in that case I need to unpair my watch."
