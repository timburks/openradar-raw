    description: |-
        This should be an API that takes an MKMapItem representing a transit stop (see radar 30397022 for more info), and outputs a set of MKTransitCallingPoints for that stop (see radar 30396881).

        Use case: to build an app that can show the upcoming departures from a bus stop or railway station.

        The MKTransitDeparturesSearchRequest should take an MKMapItem, and also a time (so as to be able to query for the past or the future).

        Returned results should include realtime data if such data is available.

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
