    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to plot various MKPointAnnotations. With VoiceOver off, all the pins appear on the map. With VoiceOver running, several never appear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the app with VoiceOver running\r\n2. Pan around the map looking for the pin. It's not there\r\n3. Close the app, turn VO off, restart the app\r\n4. Pan around the map looking for the pin. It's there.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnnotations should appear whether or not VO is enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCertain annotations do not appear when VO is enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLook in ViewController.swift. There are several coordinates saved in a dict. Some work fine, others do not, even though they're totally valid coordinates (proven by the fact that if VO is off, they render just fine). The keys of the dict tell you where the pin should appear, and if it's one that has a problem rendering with VO enabled.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, iOS 10.2, Xcode 8"
