        Summary:
        As mentioned in this discussion forum thread: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30714478, the Finder’s Column view properly (in my opinion) uses monospaced numbers, but the List view uses proportionally spaced numbers, leading to ragged vertical alignment. This is annoying if you have sequentially named files!

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Name a bunch of files with some sort of numbering scheme, as is common in cases like images from a camera, or downloaded bank statements.
        2. View the files in Column view. Note that the numbers line up in neat columns, making it easy to scan the list vertical with your eyes.
        3. View the files in List view, perhaps so you can see more information about each file.

        Expected Results:
        The numbers in the file names continue to align neatly in columns.

        Actual Results:
        The numbers switch to using a proportionally spaced font, leading to ragged column edges and sadness.

        Regression:
        I don’t have a machine to test, but a screenshot posted on the aforelinked Apple discussion thread seems to indicate that List view used monospaced numbers in El Capitan, so this is most likely breakage as of Sierra.
