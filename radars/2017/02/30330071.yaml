    description: "Summary:\n\nI have an application that contains a Safari App Extension. In the Safari App Extension’s Info.plist there is a NSHumanReadableDescription key which is shown in the Extensions tab as documented in the Safari App Extension Programming Guide.\n\nI am trying to localize the string in to the languages supported by my app and Safari App Extension using InfoPlist.strings. This does not work currently.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a Safari App Extension and set the description in Info.plist using the NSHumanReadableDescription\n2. Confirm that the description appears as expected in Safari’s Extensions tab of the Preference dialog\n3. Add to each language InfoPlist.strings the a different string using the string in NSHumanReadableDescription as the left hand side\n4. Look at the description in Safari to see if it has changed\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe right hand side string from InfoPlist.strings to be shown.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThe string from Info.plist is shown instead.\n\nNotes:\n\nI have asked this question on the developer forums at <https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/70912> with no answers. I am creating this bug in response to a question I asked DTS (Follow-up: 657933941).\n\nTo test I tried adding:\n\n  <key>NSHumanReadableDescription</key>  \n  <string>INFOPLIST: Description</string>  \n\nto the Info.plist and then all of the following to InfoPlist.strings:\n\nNSHumanReadableDescription = \"ENGLISH: Description\";  \n\"NSHumanReadableDescription\" = \"ENGLISH: Description\";  \n\"INFOPLIST: Description\" = \"ENGLISH: Description\";  \n\nIn all cases the string from Info.plist was shown."
