    description: "MKDistanceFormatter supports units=MKDistanceFormatterUnitsDefault to automatically select the right unit according to the locale.\n\nHowever, different distance units should be used depending on the *purpose* of the distance:\n\n- For elevation, feet or meters should be used but no miles, kilometers or yards (in the UK elevation is usually measured in meters)\n- For biking or walking purposes in the UK, meters and kilometers should be used instead of yards and miles. However, for driving directions, yards and miles still make sense because UK road signs are overwhelmingly not metric.)\n\nThat's why I propose a `purpose` enum property with the following options: Driving, Walking, Biking, Elevation. The value of the purpose property can then influence the selected unit if units=MKDistanceFormatterUnitsDefault. \n\nThe purpose could also inform rounding behavior. E.g. for elevation I'd propose to always round to the nearest integer, not the currently used rounding to the nearest 20/50/100 m/ft/yd."
