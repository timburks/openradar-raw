    description: "An Exchange account at some point stops receiving messages, without any error message or warning. I only noticed, hours later, that there were waiting messages because iOS's Mail (on the iPhone 7, iOS 10.2.1) does still receive them.\r\n\r\nConnection Doctor reported everything OK.\r\n\r\nThe Activity window in Mail.app showed that there was a large number of messages (about 50) that were being \"Downloaded\", and seemed to stay like that all the time. Similarly, there was a small \"status window\"(?) in the left bottom corner of the Mail.app window, which also said \"Downloading 50 messages\" - and always stayed there."
