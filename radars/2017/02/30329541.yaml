    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm editing prose in playground markup.  I want to see what it looks like.  When I Show Rendered Markup, the insertion point is moved into (usually) regions not inside of any markup. \r\n\r\nWhen returning to Raw Markup, the insertion point doesn't get returned. If I have a fair amount of markup, the distance between where I'm editing and where the cursor gets moved can be non-trivial.\r\n\r\nXcode isn't consistent in scrolling / not-scrolling, so I can't depend on \"ok, exit render mode and be generally where I was\",\r\n\r\nThis makes the editing-exploring-verification workflow pretty non-optimal because I have to keep scrolling to re-acquire where I was.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: when going into render mode (I have a shortcut key defined to make it quick), remember the cursor position. If there wasn't any cursor motion, return the cursor to that point when existing rendered mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEdit playground markup (say line 10)\r\nShow rendered markup (first rendered-playground editable line is line 5000)\r\nreturn to raw markup without any intervening cursor movement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCursor is at line 10\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor is at line 5000 (sometimes 5001)\r\nSometimes it's scrolled to line 10 (but no insertion point). Sometimes it's scrolled to line 5000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'playground-render-cursor-movement.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
