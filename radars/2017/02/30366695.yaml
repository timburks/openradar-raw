    description: "Area:\r\nSecurity Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe use the SecureTransport feature of the Security framework to enable TLS support for our own http stack, which is specifically tweaked to the needs of a media player. We upgraded our stack to support h2 and SPDY. However, after concluding our work, we discovered that SecureTransport does not support the ALPN TLS extension. Therefore, we can't deploy h2 support on appleOS, which is a major feature lacking compared to all other competing platforms.\r\n\r\nWe discovered that NSURLSession supports h2, ALPN and SPDY, so we therefore ask to provide a public API allowing us to access that hidden part of SecureTransport.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Security.framework and locate the SecureTransport.h file.\r\nThere is no API to provide an ALPN string for h2 negotiation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nALPN support in SecureTransport.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no h2 and ALPN support in SecureTransport.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 14E5230e\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s and 13-inch MBP 2015"
