    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe new SKStoreReviewController is great in that it gives the user more control over if apps can ask for review, but it would be great if there was a way for developers to know if they can ask for a review as well, so that we could conditionally display a \"Review the App\" button on the settings page.\r\n\r\nThis would improve the user experience, as the prompt wouldn't seem to randomly interrupt the user flow in the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read https://developer.apple.com/reference/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview\r\n2. Note that it specifically states that \"because the method may or may not present an alert, is't not appropriate to call it in response to a button tap or other user action\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. It is expected that we can conditionally show a Review button if the user is able to review the app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The user must be interrupted with a prompt to review (even if it is, as the document listed in the Steps to Reproduce mentions, at a place that \"makes sense in the user experience\")\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
