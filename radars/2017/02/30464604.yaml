    description: "Area:\r\nCellular Service (Calls / Data)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs far as I know this bug only occurs on Chinese devices, but is a very serious one nevertheless.\r\n\r\nSometimes Chinese iOS 10 devices don't prompt users to allow cellular data usage for newly installed apps, which causes all network requests to fail in these apps with this error:\r\n\r\nError Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1009 \"The Internet connection appears to be offline.\" UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x17405a6d0 {Error Domain=kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork Code=-1009 \"(null)\" UserInfo={_kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=50, _kCFStreamErrorDomainKey=1}}, NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=xxx, NSErrorFailingURLKey=hxxx, _kCFStreamErrorDomainKey=1, _kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=50, NSLocalizedDescription=The Internet connection appears to be offline.}\r\n\r\nWhen a device is in this state the newly installed apps don't show up in system Cellular settings. Neither Cellular Data option appears in the apps' settings in system Settings. So there is no way for users to enable cellular data usage for these apps.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to restart the device. There are other solutions mentioned in this Chinese article: http://www.jianshu.com/p/28e8919a2cae."
