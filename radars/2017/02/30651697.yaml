    description: "Dear Apple Team,\r\n\r\nThis is my request or plea to incorporate the functionality of Running Parallel Integrations on Xcode Server (i.e macOS Server) in your Next Release. \r\n\r\nAs of Now Xcode server doesn't have the ability to run parallel integrations at the same time, it lines up in queue which is too much time consuming and frustrating if there are multiple integrations in Queue.\r\n\r\nOur DevOps Team members have to perform Integrations for Multiple Bots Several Times a Day and Its very much time consuming and frustrating for us to wait for All Integrations to be finished. We have setup a DevOps Environment where No developer can push build to our Deployment Server without performing Integrations. \r\n\r\nSo you can imagine when Multiple teams are working together on Different Bots, they are not able to perform an Integration just because some other Bot's Integration is in Progress and It shows up in Pending State saying that \"There are N integrations ahead of it in the Queue\". So Team Needs to literally wait for all the previous integrations in Queue to be finished. It also delays our QA testing Process and End Client Delivery Process.\r\n\r\nSo, Its my Humble request please enhance the Functionality of Running Parallel integrations in your upcoming release. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Xcode Server Environment\r\n2. Create a Bot \r\n3. Perform Integration\r\n4. Create Another Bot\r\n5. Perform Integration\r\n6. If Initial Bot's Integration isn't finished then Another Bot integration will be in Queue. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be able to Perform Parallel Integrations instead of Queue. At least it should allow minimum  2 - 3 parallel integrations. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't perform parallel Integrations and goes into Sequential Queue."
