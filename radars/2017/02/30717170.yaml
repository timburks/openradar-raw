    description: "Description:\r\nThe section on this page https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/ under Expired or Revoked Certificates / Developer ID Application Certificate and Developer ID Installer Certificate (Mac applications) is incorrect or at least misleading. macOS apps with Provisioning Profiles whose profiles expire (typically in lock step with their certificate) will crash on launch.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nDownload and launch an application with an expired Provisioning Profile. For example, our own PDFpen:\r\n\r\nhttps://smilesoftware.com/downloads/test/PDFpen_8.3.1.zip\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation should explain that macOS apps signed with Developer ID Application Certificates which have Provisioning Profiles will crash on launch once their Provisioning Profiles expire and that the expiration of their Provisioning Profiles is typically concurrent with the expiration of their signing certificates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo mention is made of this particularly serious case in the documentation.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Title & URL:\r\n\"Certificates\"\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/ \r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nBackground on this issue:\r\n\r\nBrief:\r\nhttp://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=fc71b2e97a3e7b5f40ced52ea&id=c51d9ddb6b&e=1f89ce606e\r\n\r\nLong & detailed:\r\nhttps://blog.agilebits.com/2017/02/21/certificates-provisioning-profiles-and-expiration-dates-the-perfect-storm/"
