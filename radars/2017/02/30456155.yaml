    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in St. Louis, I wanted to enter my time zone. I couldn't get geolocated reliably (say a VPN or something), so I tried to type it in.  See attached movie for my attempts - It kept wanting me to visit St. Petersburg.  It is a nice place and my friend Maxim lives there, but alas, it was St. Louis I was interested in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. go to system preferences\r\n2. click Date & Time\r\n3. click time zone tab\r\n4. click lock to make changes\r\n5. Turn off \"set time zone automatically using current location\"\r\n6. Give keyboard focus to \"Closest City\"\r\n7. Start typing \"st. louis\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n8. get \"st. louis\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n8. Something that is not \"st. louis\".  Its actually impossible to type \"st. louis\" - even typing very fast. or all caps.  or pasting.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\nI have heard this problem existed back to 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs everywhere\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'timezones.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
