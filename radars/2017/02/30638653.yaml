    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key in Info.plist, developers can currently restrict app downloads to devices with specific hardware such as a front facing camera, or BTLE.  The full list of restrictable hardware can be found in the documentation for Device Compatibility: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix.html\r\n\r\nFor developers creating apps that require the provisioning of a card in Apple Wallet, it would be ideal to restrict downloads to devices that actually support Apple Pay (iPhone 6 and above).   Without this ability, users with iPhone 5S devices and lower can download and install the app, but end up not being able to use the app because their device does not support Apple Pay.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Download Gane app on iPhone 5S.\r\n2.  Observe a failure during initial app onboarding when prompted to insert a card into Apple Wallet.  This step is a requirement for the usage of the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers with an iPhone 5S or below should not be able to download the Gane app from the App Store\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsers with an iPhone 5S CAN download the Gane app from the App Store, and are presented with a less than optimal user experience.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S and below (devices that do not support Apple Pay).  Developers should be able to prevent downloading from app store for users with iPhone 5S and below.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
