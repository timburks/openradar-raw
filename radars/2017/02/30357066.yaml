    description: "This is a dupe of rdar://30356383\r\nGoogle Maps on mobile devices has a convenient one-finger gesture for zooming both in and out. It’s great in many cases where you would naturally be using Maps, where you might be carrying a suitcase in one hand and your phone in the other, looking for a train station.\r\n\r\nYou can use Google Maps entirely one-handed in these cases, because you can pan, zoom in, and zoom out easily with only your thumb. They use tap-and-a-half-and-drag-vertically to zoom in and out.\r\n\r\nIn Apple Maps, you can double tap to zoom in, but zooming out with one hand requires a two-finger single tap, which is great in the iOS simulator, but is comically difficult to do when you’re actually holding an iPhone in one hand."
