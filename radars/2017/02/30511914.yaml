    description: "Summary:\r\nThe use of proportional numbers in the “time remaining” label on the Now Playing section of the lock screen and Control Center makes the numbers shift horizontally as they count down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a song, podcast, or audiobook an iPhone.\r\n2. Look at the negative number on the right, which counts up to 0, showing the time remaining, on both the lock screen and the Now Playing section of Control Center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs the numbers count down, the width of label doesn’t shift slightly, because the numbers are all the same width.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe labels shift slightly because the numbers are different widths. For example, the “1” is narrower than the “2”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown, but the Now Playing screen in the Music app on the same version of iOS handles this correctly by using monospaced numbers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screen recording also posted at https://cl.ly/jAEu"
