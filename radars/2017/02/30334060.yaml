    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to use playgrounds. Radar number seven for the day. >:-(\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot - \"Failed to launch process. Error returned in reply: Connection invalid\" with a report-a-bug button.  That's why I'm here.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing what I'm seeing. The error happens when I open the playground.\r\n\r\nThe console was full of xcode errors.  See other attached screenshot for a sample.\r\n\r\nThings are happier after relaunching xcode.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if there was a way to tell Xcode to gather a snapshot of interesting stuff when it vomits itself (c.f. rdar://29884107 ), which for me happens quite often.  (c.f. rdar://22524679)\r\n\r\nThe playground in question is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-02-02 at 3.13.37 PM.png', 'file-a-bug.mp4' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-02 at 3.20.24 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
