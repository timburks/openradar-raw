    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached project.  See movie at [REDACTED] because of rdar://30364703\r\n\r\nI have a libxml2 project. I wanted to look at the struct behind an xmlErrorPtr.  The option-click shortcut window is worthless to me because clicking on a type shows nothing (rdar://30043998)\r\n\r\nSo I tried opening the header with command-shift-O.  Due to rdar://27195434, it hung.\r\n\r\nBut there is also no way I can see the unadulterated C header. All the options for seeing the original form are not available.  A simple task like \"I want to see the contents of this header file\" are impossible, so I went to another editor for that basic functionality.\r\n\r\nProject attached.\r\n\r\nAnother plug for rdar://29884107 - Xcode needs a \"collect all pertinent information\" button to ease bug reporting when Xcode vomits on itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 3 (8W132p)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe generated header has been a non-stop source of bugs and frustration.  When/if it works, it's cool, but oftentimes not: This is from some student materials for an advanced iOS course I teach:\r\n\r\n&Xcode; can be pretty flaky. If you see an empty generated header, or you're only seeing about 10 lines worth, or if you're seeing a pile of   Swift, or you're not seeing changes you've made to the Swift file reflected in the generated header, you may need to successfully build and run your project to see the correct version.  If you quick-open an &Objective-C; header and get a generated Swift interface instead of the actual header, quick-open the file again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TextExtractor.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-28 at 12.48.57 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
