    description: "Summary:\r\nI've become an extremely frequent user of the \"Move to…\" suggestion in Mail, particularly from the Touch Bar. It's wonderful.\r\n\r\nA recent beta (I think) seems to have adjusted the sourcing or heuristics for this suggestion to include folders from all accounts, which is unambiguously the wrong behavior*.\r\n\r\n*I and several others, when asked. Gosh, I hope you don't have to introduce a preference for this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail and let it sync.\r\n2. Highlight \"Your Amazon.com order of '800 Pounds of Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears' has shipped!\" in the inbox of my personal accounts\r\n3. Look at the \"Move to…\" suggestion on the Touch Bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe suggestion is \"Orders\" in the folder hierarchy of my personal account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe suggestion is \"Purchases\" in the folder hierarchy of my work account.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail 10.3 (3265); macOS 10.12.4 Beta (16E154a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI swear this didn't occur in previous 10.12 builds, and it definitely doesn't happen on MobileMail.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs > 1 mail accounts\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
