    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing the ARDClient 3.9 update via SUS and a 3.9 Admin tries to connect or observe the client a Keychain prompt appears on the client.  At that time the computer appears as \"Offline\" to the ARD Admin.\r\nAttempting to dismiss it by clicking Cancel 10-12x only delays the issue.  The prompt returns the next time the admin tries to connect or refresh the connection to the client. \r\n\r\nWorkarounds include:\r\n1) Reboot the client computer\r\n2) Issue the command `sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent` via means available (ssh, Terminal.app, etc.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Upgrade ARDClient 3.9 from 3.8 on a test client machine you previously had ARD access with Remote Management settings turned on.\r\n2) Install ARD Admin 3.9 on an admin machine.\r\n3) Connect to the client machine using the ARD Admin 3.9 software\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormal control/observe/report functionality from the admin to the client.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe client computer prompts for a keychain authorization of an unknown password. At that time the client becomes listed as \"Offline\" in ARD Admin and cannot be accessed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not an issue with ARD 3.8 client/admin.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
