    description: "Area:\r\nMaps\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm navigating (car) using Maps. For some days, the voice keeps telling me stuff like \"In 100 Metern, primary instruction\". I have my iPhone set to German. This does not happen at every intersection, but about 2/3 of the time. Sysdiagnose attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a navigation on iPhone\r\n2. Start driving\r\n3. Voice tells about primary instruction, instead of direction.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect something like \"turn right\" or \"turn left\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoice tells me \"primary instruction\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 7 10.2.1 (14D27)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe information displayed on the screen is correct, only the voice is wrong.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 10.2.1 (14D27)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2017.02.25_18-10-57+0100.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded."
