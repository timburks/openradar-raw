        Summary:

        There are two methods called gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:, one on `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` and one on `UIView` — and they have different documentation. The documentation for the delegate one isn’t clear.

        There methods seem to be called at the same time and do the same thing, so they should have more or less the same documentation.

        ‘Asks the delegate if a gesture recognizer should begin interpreting touches.’ Is a misleading since this method is called after the gesture recognizer starts interpreting touches. I would suggest a summary like this: ‘Asks the delegate/view if a gesture recognizer should transition out of the possible state’.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Look at these two documentation pages:

        https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uigesturerecognizerdelegate/1624213-gesturerecognizershouldbegin?language=objc

        https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiview/1622460-gesturerecognizershouldbegin?language=objc

        Expected Results:

        Documentation should be mostly the same, and both should be clear.

        Actual Results:

        Documentation is different, and the documentation of the delegate method is misleading.

        Regression:
