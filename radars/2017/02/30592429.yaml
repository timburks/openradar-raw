    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn some situations, an interface may be served by nesting a UIStackView inside a touchable container view. Currently, if a touch inside a stack view does not pass the hitTest: for any subview, the stack view itself consumes the touch, preventing it from bubbling up to any container view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached Untouchables.xcodeproj\r\n2. Build and run.\r\n3. Touch the button and see that it behaves as expected.\r\n4. Touch either yellow area around the button, which are non-interactive UIView instances.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe touch should have bubbled up to the container Control, which flashes itself red when touched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIStackView consumes the touch, so it can't bubble up.\r\n\r\nNow go into HackStackView.swift, and uncomment the hitTest(...) override. This workaround eliminates the UIStackView itself from consideration as a legitimate hit.\r\n\r\nBuild and run again, and tap the yellow area. See how the background red illuminates behind the button.\r\n\r\nIt seems like UIStackView should always disregard itself as a hit target.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Untouchables.zip' was successfully uploaded."
