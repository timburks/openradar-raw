    description: "Summary:\r\nCalendar invitation reply emails are not sent from the correct account but from an arbitrary email account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- A Google Calendar invitation is received on a (non-Google) IMAP based email account, e.g. with the address foo@bar.com.\r\n- The (first) ICS Attachment of the invitation is double clicked and opened in the Calendar app.\r\n- The calendar is changed from the default Local calendar to an iCloud based calendar (this step doesn't actually make a difference).\r\n- The event is accepted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe reply email should be sent from an email account with the From address foo@bar.com, if available.\r\nAlternatively, it would be fine also if the reply email would be sent from the iCloud server side, the same way as iCloud calendar invites are sent. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe reply email is sent from an arbitrary email account with a completely different From address.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like macOS selects the last account in the list of accounts to send the reply email. When I disable the wrongly selected account, macOS selects the next activated account from the bottom.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work. I checked my Sent folder and the last correct reply was sent in August 2015 (from the then-current Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nrdar://30309747 Calendar replies contain \"(null)\""
