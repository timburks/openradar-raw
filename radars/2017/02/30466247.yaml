    description: "Area:\r\nTV App\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen first presented the UISearchController does not honor the current setting of the User Interface Style set by the user. \r\n\r\nIf the user changes the value from dark -> light -> dark while the controller is still visible *then* the controller correctly draws itself for dark mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Uncompress, build the attached project, and run the app \r\n2. Make sure the TV is in \"dark\" mode\r\n3. Focus and select the single button in the center of the screen\r\n4. Observe that the UISearchController presented is not honoring the mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUISearchController should be presented in dark mode to honor the user setting\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUISearchController always presents in \"light\" mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.1 Simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ntvOS Simulator 10.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestTVDark.zip' was successfully uploaded."
