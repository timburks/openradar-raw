    description: |-
        When displaying public transit directions, many times there is a color associated with a certain subway line or bus route, that matches the branding of the line.

        MKRoute objects should have a color property, so that we can display polylines on the map in an appropriate color.

        MKTransitLine (the class I requested in rdar://30396804) should also have such a property.

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
