        This pair of classes should let you query the calling points for an MKTransitTrip.

        For an example use case, suppose I have used the APIs described in rdar://30397273 to obtain the departure board for Coventry train station. My app might be showing the user all the trains that'll depart soon. If the user taps on one of the trains (e.g. the 5.40pm for Manchester Piccadilly), I now want to show the user that train's calling points, including showing the live progress of the train.

        Thus, I take the MKTransitTrip (described in rdar://30396804) that represents the train the user tapped on, pass that into MKTransitTripCallingPointsSearchRequest, and receive back an ordered set of MKTransitCallingPoints (see rdar://30396881).

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
