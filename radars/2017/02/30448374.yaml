        Using the doesRelativeDateFormatting option in NSDateFormatter is not very useful. It lacks the following features:

        - Return a relative date for anything that is before yesterday or after tomorrow. It should return "last week", "2 months ago", "in 5 days" etc., instead of the absolute date.
          - If the current behavior is considered as intended (looks like Finder uses it), I'd like to lobby for a "limitRelativeDateFormattingTimeInterval" property that limits the interval into the future and into the past where relative formatting is used. Example: Setting it to 7*24*60*60 would limit relative dates one week into the past and into the future; otherwise absolute dates are returned.

        - It doesn't support parsing relative dates. (Of course something like "a year ago" can't yield an exact date. Best-effort would be enough!)

        Btw, the documentation lacks a statement about the limitations.
