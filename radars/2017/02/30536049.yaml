    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's occasionally important to know if the user has 24 hour time enabled. For instance, a device may way to sync the users time preference to a peripheral, or a user may want to present a custom date string or UI element. The only manner to check this using NSDateFormatter:\r\n\r\nNSString *format = [NSDateFormatter dateFormatFromTemplate:@\"j\" options:0 locale:[NSLocale currentLocale]];\r\nBOOL is24Hour = ([format rangeOfString:@\"a\"].location == NSNotFound);\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have something analogous to:\r\n\r\n[[NSLocale currentLocale] uses24HourTime];\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to get 24 hour time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo find a boolean on `NSLocale`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch NSLocale for a solution and fail. Search Stack Overflow and find this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12214398/detect-iphone-24-hour-time-setting. Ask on Slack to see if there's a better way. Receive a general consensus that this is the best way. Be told that you should file a radar to request your enhancement.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
