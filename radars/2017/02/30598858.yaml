        Summary:
        When a conversation in iMessage is synced between devices, an iPad can not recognise phone numbers that donâ€™t have the country code in them.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1 - Add a contact in your phone without the country code (of your current country of residency)
        2 - Start a new conversation on iMessage with that new contact on your iPhone
        3 - Open iMessage on an iPad and wait for the conversation to appear

        Expected Results:
        Contact info should be recognised and used

        Actual Results:
        Number appears with country code and not recognised by the iPad
