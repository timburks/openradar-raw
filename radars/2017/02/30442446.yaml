    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen signing a piece of data, Keychain Services shows *two* identical prompts, requesting the user to authorize the application to access the keychain item. Within the same blocking call to SecKeyRawSign(), two modal UI prompts are displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to sign a piece of data using an application. Two prompts are displayed for the same operation (I can confirm that the prompts are *not* displayed by two different calls to the Keychain Services Framework).\r\n\r\nClicking 'Allow' (not 'Always Allow') causes a second prompt to be shown.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the prompt attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly a single prompt is shown for the operation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra, on Mac Pro and Macbook. Version 10.12.3 (16D32)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to use the good old CSSM API - which is what we used to do before Apple deprecated it and tried to get us to use the buggier SecKeyRawSign API :)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-02-09 at 15.20.16.png' was successfully uploaded."
