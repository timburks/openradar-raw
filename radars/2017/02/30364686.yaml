    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to be a good citizen and including data with xcode radars (such as those I've filed recently. c.f. rdar://22524679), and I want to include derived data.\r\n\r\nSo I go the project settings.  There's the path. Truncated to uselessness. There's an intriguing button that looks like a \"take me to this directory in the finder\".\r\n\r\nOnly, the label eats the mouse clicks and I can't click on the button.\r\n\r\nIf I select the text in there, I get \"/Users/markd/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\", which is not the folder that actually has the derived data for this project.  I have 87 directories in there, many with duplicate names. Would be nice to know which one was the correct one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-02-04 at 5.35.27 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
