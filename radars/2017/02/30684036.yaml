    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you use legacy stdio functions for writing to non-ascii filenames, the filesystem enters a weird state, where NSFileManager can list the file, but checks if it exists fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. write \"hello\" to file named \"acentuação.txt\" with fopen/fwrite/fclose\r\n2. list files available with NSFileManager contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:error:\r\n3. check if the single listed file exists with NSFileManager fileExistsAtPath:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe file should exists, since we had it returned by contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:error:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe file does not exist\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3 (14E5249d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode example has been attached where the error is provoked in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\r\n\r\nProblem seems to happen only on iOS 10.3 no matter what device, as long as it is on device. It does not happen in the simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 1, 32GB cellular"
