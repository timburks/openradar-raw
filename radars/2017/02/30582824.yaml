    description: "If you open a UIDocumentMenuViewController menu while the in-call status bar is shown on an iPhone, the resulting menu is offset down, clipping the content and exposing a gray header area. The view cannot be scrolled up to expose the clipped part. \r\n\r\nI can reproduce this problem in my own apps as well as Evernote, Dropbox and other apps that use the document import file extensions.  This bug was found on iOS 10, but also exists on iOS 9, though in that case it IS scrollable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a call or do something to bring up the in-call (busy) status bar. Tethering to a computer is a good way.\r\n2. Open an app with file import extension support. \r\n(Note the app must open directly to the document menu, not the file picker first - like the mail app does). \r\n3. Open the document menu (usually importing a file) \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document menu should look and behave the same as it does without the in-call status bar showing. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe document menu is shifted down with a gray area. The last item on the menu is clipped and cannot be scrolled into view."
