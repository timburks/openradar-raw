        MKRouteSteps should contain the MKMapItems that they are from/to.

        The use case: if I'm making a public transit app, the user will want to be able to interrogate any given route step, and see information about an relevant transit stop (such as departures, stop name, etc).

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
