    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I am running the iOS Simulator while using BlueTooth connected headphones (I believe a microphone is required), calling UIDevice.current.playInputClick() changes the audio in my headphones.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a BlueTooth headphone that has a microphone to your computer.  (Beats Solo3, Bose QC35, or Bose AE2 Soundlink will work)\r\n2. Start audio from a source on the computer.  (e.g. iTunes)\r\n3. Run the project\r\n4. Click into the TextView\r\n5. Tap the accessory view that will trigger UIDevice.current.playInputClick()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect my audio to continue to play normally and for my microphone to not be turned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio becomes distorted.  It seems like the headphones are going into a call mode or turning the microphone on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode 8.2 (8C38)\r\niOS Simulator 10.2 (iPhone 7 Plus)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015). Beats Solo3.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestInputClick.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n==============\r\n\r\nFurther discussion: https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/issues/770"
