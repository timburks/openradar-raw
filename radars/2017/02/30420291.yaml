    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://30397022\r\n\r\nI've already filed radar 30395905, requesting a way to know if an MKMapItem is a transit stop. \r\n\r\nIf a map item _is_ a transit stop, it needs some more properties:\r\n\r\n- A list of parent stops and child stops. For example, a multimodal transit interchange may have a train station and some bus stops as child stops.\r\n- A bearing. If it's a bus stop, the bearing shows the direction of travel (e.g. \"Northeast\").\r\n- A stop number or stand number (e.g. a bus stop may be stand \"A\" or stop \"B12\"). This is a human readable short code, and the actual name of the stop may be longer (such as \"Warren Street stop B12\").\r\n- A set of MKTransitLineVariations (see radar 30396804) that serve this stop\r\n\r\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
