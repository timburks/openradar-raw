        Summary:
        When disconnecting and reconnecting a Thunderbolt 3 monitor (UltraFine 5K), sometimes the desktop background stays black, instead of showing the desktop picture.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attach an UltraFine 5K monitor to a MacBook Pro 2016 13" in clamshell mode
        2. Set a colorful Desktop Picture
        3. Disconnect monitor
        4. Reconnect monitor
        5. Perform steps 3 to 4 multiple times until the issue shows up

        Expected Results:
        - Desktop Picture is shown

        Actual Results:
        - A black background is shown instead of the Desktop Picture. Running `killall Dock` resolves the issue

        Regression:
