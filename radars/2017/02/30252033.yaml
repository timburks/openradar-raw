    description: "Name of units should be their singular form. Eg. 'meter' instead of 'meters'. It's OK to say '5 meters', but it's completely wrong to call the unit of length of 'meters', because it's 'meter'.\r\n\r\nBIPM is the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards organization established to maintain the International System of Units (SI). From BIPM's website - http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/base-units.html - units are always on their singular form. Example: Unit: meter. Quantity: 5 meters. Unit: kilogram. Quantity 10 kilograms.\r\n\r\nSome examples from the Unit and Measurements API:\r\n\r\n* metersPerSecondSquared -> meterPerSecondSquared\r\n* degrees -> degree\r\n* arcMinutes -> arcMinute\r\n* arcSeconds -> arcSecond\r\n* radians -> radian\r\n\r\nUnitAcceleration.gravity, for instance, uses the singular form (and correct).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niOS 10 SDK, macOS Sierra SDK\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnit names should be in their singular form.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost of them are on their plural form.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 SDK, macOS Sierra SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 10 SDK, macOS Sierra SDK"
