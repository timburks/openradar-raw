    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen presenting the SKCloudServiceSetupViewController instance after the handler sent to \"loadWitihOptions:completionHandler:\" is called with result == YES, the view controller will present but doesn't always finish loading its contents.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot showing the issue as well as a sysdiagnose from a device having this issue. On this device, there were several times that did were then several times that didn't. The last time that didn't occurred at 2:16 pm CST. The sysdiagnose was started about 45 seconds after that occurred.\r\n\r\nChanging networks or turning wifi off and back on doesn't fix the issue.  Once a device gets stuck on this spinner, it seems to always see the spinner when the view controller is loaded.  It will stay this way for a long time.  Have not yet found what gets it unstuck.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSKCloudServiceSetupViewController *setupController = [SKCloudServiceSetupViewController new];\r\nsetupController.delegate = weakSelf;\r\nNSDictionary<SKCloudServiceSetupOptionsKey, id> *options = @{ SKCloudServiceSetupOptionsActionKey : SKCloudServiceSetupActionSubscribe,\r\n                                                              SKCloudServiceSetupOptionsAffiliateTokenKey : kiTunesAffiliateCode };\r\n[setupController loadWithOptions:options completionHandler:^(BOOL result, NSError * _Nullable error) {\r\n    if (result) {\r\n        [weakSelf.viewController presentViewController:setupController animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n        \r\n    } else {\r\n        //There was an error loading the SKCloudServiceSetupViewController\r\n    }\r\n}];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter presenting the setupController in the code above, the screen upselling the trial will fully load.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter presenting the setupController in the code above, sometimes a spinner will display and the screen will never show its contents like the start trial button or the service description. (Screenshot attached)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1, 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 7 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2017.02.07_14-17-13-0600.tar.gz' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-07 at 2.32.22 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
