    description: "As I mentioned in rdar://30395156, I want a transport subtype property, to distinguish between bus/train/tram/etc. \n\nThis radar is to request that MKRouteStep have a transportSubType property, so that the app developer can know what public transit mode to show for this route step.\n\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
