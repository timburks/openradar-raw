        Summary:
        The numbers in the Activity window should use monospace numbers to prevent the numbers from jumping around.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Initiate a large move or copy operation in Mail.
        2. Bring up the Activity window (Command-Option-Zero) to see a more detailed view of progress.

        Expected Results:
        As the numbers change, as long as there are the same number of digits, the label wonâ€™t jump around due to varying number widths.

        Actual Results:
        The labels are using proportionally spaced numbers instead of monospaced numbers, causing jumping slight jumping.

        Regression:
        Unknown.

        Notes:
        This is probably a simple case of needing to use -[NSFont monospacedDigitSystemFontOfSize:weight:].
