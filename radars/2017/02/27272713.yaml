    description: "Playground is not able to display an UIView that was initially created with frame zero (CGRect.zero) and changed afterwards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an UIView with CGRect.zero frame\r\n2. Change the view frame\r\n3. Try do something with the frame (change its color, add a subview, etc...)\r\n4. View will be in unusable state (Playground won't display it).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe view should behave as expected and Playground should display the view.\r\nIt should work as when the same piece code runs on iOS and macOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCurrently, it creates a view in a weird state that cannot be rendered."
