    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nWith Xcode 8.3b1 (not seen prior to this that I can recall), the Leaks instrument (run against simulator, didn't try device) keeps adding a new \"root leak\" every periodic check.\r\n\r\nThe root leak is kind of odd, only showing up when changing view controllers and letting the app idle.\r\n\r\nAttached is the project that shows the problem.  It's a simple app from one of our courses, and it has an intentional NSMutableArray cycle.\r\n\r\nHere's a movie: [REDACTED] (dropbox link because #lolradarweb - c.f. rdar://30364703) that shows exactly what I'm doing from a fresh run in a simulator.\r\n\r\nNotice at the end, while everything is idling, the \"root leaks\" keep building up. Clicking on any of them don't update the callstack .\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Buggy Sieve.zip' was successfully uploaded."
