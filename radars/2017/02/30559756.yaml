    description: "Summary:\r\nI was editing the same file in two different window panes (main editor / assistant editor, manual setting, same file).\r\n\r\nWhen I backspace in one pane, the other pane scrolls, sometimes by 1 pixel. As I was volunteering my time to report this problem, it started scrolling by a whole line.\r\n\r\nI use black-only code colors because of my chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses.  The SourceServer did not crash.\r\n\r\nI see this frequently doing a screenhero share with a junior programmer, but I've been unable to both screen flow it and run screenhero.  It finally misbehaved for me.\r\n\r\ngif attached (https://mobile.twitter.com/borkware/status/832300329895153664).  annotated video at [REDACTED]\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave main/assistant editor up showing the same file. You might have to go through hoops to get it to actually show the same file rather than the interface.  You're looking at different parts of the file\r\n\r\nbackspace over some code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe code backspaces. The other editing pane doesn't move.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe code backspaces. The other editing pane scrolls, eventually scrolling what I wanted to look at.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 2 (8W120l)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've seen this for at least the last couple of years during screenshares with another developer.  I rarely use this configuration myself because I try to do most of my coding in other editors with much better split-screen support.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'scroll-me.gif' was successfully uploaded."
