    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new UserNotification framework provides a nice way to send localized notifications. The NSString category localizedUserNotificationStringForKey:arguments: can be used to set a translation key and arguments for the alert body of a notification.\r\n\r\nThe problem:\r\nIf a watch app uses the UILocalNotification API under watchOS 2.x or 3.x, this auto-magic translation does not work for dynamic notifications.\r\n\r\nI would expect the information provided by the system in UILocalNotification.alertBody is the translated, human readable string. Instead, the localizable key provided to UNNotificationContext by sender is used.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\nWhen the watch shows the static notification, everything is translated correctly.\r\n\r\nSee sample application with iOS app (deployment target 10.x) and watchOS App (deployment target 2.x) demonstrating the issue. (https://github.com/DEAD10CC/radars/tree/master/watchOS2-alertBody-not-localized)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install sample app on iOS 10.x device\r\n- Install sample app on watchOS 2.x or 3.x device\r\n- Start iOS app\r\n- Start watch app at least once to enable dynamic notification handling (correct, huh? if so, please add this somewhere in your docs)\r\n- Press \"send notification in 4sec\" button.\r\n- Press on/off button on iPhone\r\n- wait for notification to appear on watch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Notification UI should show text in red \"Is localized\".\r\n\r\n(An additional orange text \"dynamic long look\" indicates that you see the dynamic UI)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Notification UI shows text in red \"should_be_localized\".\r\n\r\n(An additional orange text \"dynamic long look\" indicates that you see the dynamic UI)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.x, watchOS 2.x, watchOS 3.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and Apple watch"
