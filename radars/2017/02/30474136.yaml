    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe have a podcast app, Castro (app id: 1080840241), in the Store. Some users had mentioned that they sometimes launch Castro when connected to CarPlay but the the interface on the CarPlay unit stays blank until the force quit and relaunch the app.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find steps to reliably reproduce this until today.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to CarPlay device\r\n2. Launch Castro\r\n3. Turn off the CarPlay device\r\n4. Force quit Castro\r\n5. Turn on the CarPlay device and wait for home screen to show\r\n6. Launch Castro again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCastro interface is visible on the phone and on the CarPlay device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCastro interface is visible on the phone but on the CarPlay device the screen in blank (except potentially for a Now Playing button in the top right if Castro was the last app to play audio)\r\n\r\nIf the now playing button is visible tap it and then back: Castro interface shows but thereâ€™s a blank space at the top\r\n\r\nTap it again and then back: now the interface shows correctly\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis only happens when using the new tab based layout with UIBrowsableContentSupportsSectionedBrowsing turned on. With the old drill down layout it works as expected.\r\n\r\nI've verified with logging that we are being asked for and providing the correct MPContentItems even when the screen stays blank.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S. Alpine ILX-007"
