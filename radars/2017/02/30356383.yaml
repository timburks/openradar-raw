    description: "The Google Maps app has a gesture that easily allows a user to zoom in/out of the maps with a single finger by double tapping on the screen and dragging up or down to zoom out or in.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if Apple Maps could implement this, or a similar one fingered gesture to support both zooming in or out of maps.\r\n\r\nApple Maps does support zooming in by performing a double tap, but that is slow, as it requires multiple invocations to zoom in multiple zoom levels. And there is no support for zooming out using a single finger (I am aware of the two-finger single tap to zoom out, but that is hard to use when only 1 hand is available)."
