    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a mis-sized application icon that is generating a warning when building.\r\n\r\nI right-clicked on the warning and saw \"Show in Finder\", expecting it would show me the image in question, or at least the image directory in the asset catalog.  Instead, it just took me to the top level of the asset catalog.  With a large number of assets, perhaps some buried in folders, there's going to be digging around.\r\n\r\nWhatever generated the warning knows what image is bad, perhaps it could emit a path that could then be used to show it in the finder.\r\n\r\nSee attached gif file showing the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 2 (8W120l)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'take-me-to-the-problem.gif' was successfully uploaded."
