    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been trying to work on a project today.  As usual, Xcode is doing what it can to take the joy out of the day (c.f. rdar://22524679)\r\n\r\nThis time, the simulator will refuse to run the app.  I do command-R, everybody sits staring back at me, and then I get an alert (see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\n\"the request to open $APP_BUNDLE_ID failed. The request was dnied by service delegate (SBMainWorkspace) for reason: Busy (\"Application $APP_BUNDLE_ID\" is installing or uninstalling, and cannot be launched\")\"  If I re-run (command-R), it works.\r\n\r\nIt's happened about a dozen times today.\r\n\r\nI'll be uploading a freakload of stuff.  It'd be nice if there were a way for me to conveniently get an upload bolus (c.f. rdar://29884107). They'll be uploaded as separate comments because radar web frequently fails with large uploads (c.f. rdar://8208591 rdar://30336649).\r\n\r\nBut I'll be uploading:\r\n  - the project file\r\n  - A video showing _everything_ I did between the last successful run and when it failed. Includes keystrokes.\r\n  - A sysdiagnose taken.  I removed the log archive and the footprint files (they're huge and I'm on commercial DSL), but \r\n  - a dump of the last hour of the system log\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. work work work\r\n2. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. the app runs in the simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Get a cryptic error.  Have to re-run after wasting a bit of time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassBuilderPlayer.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-04 at 4.38.17 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
