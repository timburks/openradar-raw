    description: "Area:\r\nMenu Bar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt has gotten difficult to get a useful idea of how much batttery life I have left when it gets low. The icon is extremely inaccurate (rdar://30365932), and I don't want to have the percentage always visible. I would like to see the *percentage* remaining when I click on the icon, without having to toggle it on and off all the time just so I can check on it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable the battery menu bar item\r\n2. Click on it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the \"Show Percentage\" option is off, I'd expect to see that data in the menu itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no information about the percentage remaining.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.3 and 10.12.4 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI previously filed rdar://30365957 which was closed with the comment \"This was removed intentionally,\" which doesn't make a lot of sense, because I'm asking for a feature that has never existed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n3.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Intel Iris Graphics 550 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
