    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting with 10.12 Sierra much of the logging that used to appear in in the `/var/log/system.log`, or through `syslog`, is now only available through the `log` command. However, if STDOUT from `log` is anything other than a TTY I am not reliably getting data (possibly buffering?), making it unusable for following low-occurrence events. If I choose a high enough volume stream then it seems to work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open three terminal windows: A, B, and C\r\n2. In A and B run:\r\n  A: `log stream --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS \"elephants love peanutbutter\"'`\r\n  B: `log stream --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS \"elephants love peanutbutter\"'  | tee /dev/null`\r\n3. In window C repeatedly run `syslog -l error -s 'elephants love peanutbutter'` while watching A and B.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see the same messages appear in A and B at about the same time (within a second is fine).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindow A gets the messages immediately, while B either never gets them, or takes a long time to get a clump."
