    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey is deprecated in favour of the new User Notifications framework. We have adopted this framework in our app, but we still need to keep track of launch reasons so that we can make decisions based on that. \r\n\r\nFor example, if our app is launched in the background to perform an interactive notification action, we don’t want to trigger a content refresh over the network, but we would want to do that in some other cases where the app is launched in the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocalNotificationKey is deprecated in the  UIApplication.h header file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to detect (in applicationDidFinishLaunching) why the app launched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere’s no non-deprecated way to know at launch-time why the app launched if it launched from a notification action.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
