    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere's no way in which a 3rd party app can change the device wallpaper using public APIs. \r\n\r\nOn macOS's AppKit there's the [NSWorkspace setDesktopImageURL:forScreen:options:error:] that allows the app to change the wallpaper. \r\n\r\nThere are some applications in macOS that currently use it, such as Snappr <https://francesc.xyz/projects/snappr>, Irvue <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/irvue-unsplash-wallpapers/id1039633667?mt=12>, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to develop a iOS app that changes the wallpaper. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a similar API in iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to update the wallpaper via a 3rd party app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1 Beta 2 (14D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device running the latest OS version\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
