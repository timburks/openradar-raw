    description: "Summary:\r\ntvOS does not provide a mechanism to disable Peer-to-Peer AirPlay. Following the law of unintended consequences, anyone can attempt to connect to an Apple TV using P2P AirPlay, and this causes problems for the Apple TV owner because with support for HDMI-CEC, TVs will randomly be powered on and present a passcode for connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPurchase Apple TV with Siri Remote\r\nPower Apple TV on and perform initial setup\r\nEnable OnScreen Code for AirPlay Security (or don't, the result is the same)\r\nUse iPhone or other iOS device not connected to same wifi network and connect to newly provisioned AppleTV\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that Apple's actions would match its public statements on privacy and security and not allow such a blatant disregard for consumer privacy to be present on its devices. I would expect that this feature could be disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeighbors attempt to connect to my Apple TVs at all hours of the day causing my TVs to randomly power on and consume energy as well as either wake people up or cause other annoyance during the day.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.1.1 / iOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can reproduce this 100% of the time on any of my iOS devices. This question has been asked in public forums, and should be formally addressed by Apple.\r\n\r\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264216/stop-unknown-devices-trying-to-connect-to-apple-tv\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7723176?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7697976?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7763477?start=0&tstart=0"
