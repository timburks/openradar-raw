    description: "Summary:\r\nI purchased a song from a specific album a few months ago. I've decided to complete the album, but when browsing to the album on iTunes and tapping \"Buy\", \"Complete My Album\" has no visible effect besides refreshing the iTunes album page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy \"Chan Chan\" from Buena Vista Social Club (https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/chan-chan/id695571822?i=695571970).\r\n2. Later, browse to the full album for Buena Vista Social Club (https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/buena-vista-social-club/id695571822).\r\n3. Tap the button labeled \"$9.99 Buy\".\r\n4. The attached alert message appears (\"You've already purchased at least one song from this album.\")\r\n5. Tap \"Complete My Album\" in the alert box.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI view the price to complete the album and am given the option to purchase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"$9.99 Buy\" button is briefly disabled, and then the entire album page refreshes to the initial state in (2).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.5.5.5\r\nmacOS 10.12.3 (16D32)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)\r\n4 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nAMD Radeon R9 M295X 4096 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2017-02-09 at 9.26.35 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
