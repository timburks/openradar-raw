        This class will represent the time a certain public transit trip calls at a certain stop.

        It will have these properties:

        - An MKMapItem representing the transit stop.
        - A string representing the platform (e.g. "2" for Platform 2 at a train station, or "northbound" for a tram stop).
        - Six properties representing times:
        	- scheduledArrival/scheduledDeparture — the arrival and departure times according to the timetable.
        	- expectedArrival/expectedDeparture — if realtime data is available and the train/bus has not yet arrived/departed this stop, these show the current predicted times.
        	- actualArrival/actualDeparture — if realtime data is available and the train/bus has passed the stop, this shows the time it actually passed.
        	- cancelled. A boolean showing whether that service is cancelled at this stop. (It's possible for a service to be cancelled only at some stops en route.)
        - A link to the MKTransitTrip (see radar 30396804). From this, the app author can derive the headsign of the trip, etc.

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
