    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf one grabs an item from the Finder (while the Finder is the frontmost application) and while ”holding” the item activates the app switcher (cmd tab) and switches to another app (while still ”holding” the Finder item) it's not possible to cancel the drag in the other application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have the Finder as the active app and at least one other app running.\r\n\r\n2. Grab an item in the desktop (for example) and while ”holding” it (i.e. mouse/trackpad down) activate the app switcher (cmd tab) and switch to another app (for example Safari).\r\n\r\n3. Now, try to cancel the drag using the ”esc” key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing happens when pressing ”esc”, though it should lead to the drag being canceled out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, i.e. the item is still ”held”.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.3 (16D32)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems the ”esc” press still goes through to the application being in front, but I think macOS should first check if any item is currently ”being dragged” and cancel that out first."
