    description: "Area:\r\nCellular Service (Calls / Data)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is a new feature for Chinese user since iOS 10, when user open a new app, iOS will popup a alert view, to ask for network connect permission, just like the camera persmission, but it's limited for China users.\r\nBut there is a serioius bug about that feature:\r\n1. If developer ask persmissions for other privacy setting, like camera, or location, right after the app launches, permission request alert view generated by developer will dimiss the network connection request alert view, which generated by iOS, and user won't get any chance to enable network connect again.\r\n2. Sometimes the alert view for network request just won't show up, for no reason.\r\nThe primary frustration is if the thing I mentioned above happened, there is no way to fix it, there is no setting to toggle in Settings.app, clean it in multi-task mode(by which I mean swipe the app to remove it from the mutli-task app list) and open again, nothing will chanage.\r\nSo far, the only way I found is to reboot iOS, and the dialog will show up, and that is not a solution at all.\r\nI attached a screenshot, which captures the network request alert view, in Chinese.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download a new app into your phone, as a Chinese user. The app must be some app that will connect to the internet.\r\n2. Open it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould show a alert view, says \"Allow 'Some App' to use network connect?\r\nMay contain wifi or cellular connection.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alert view won't show or it'll be dimissed by other alert view, and will never show up again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 in general\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 10, in China"
