        In rdar://30396804, I proposed a new class MKTransitTrip, which represents a journey that one bus makes along one line.

        MKRouteStep should have a link to the relevant MKTransitTrip. Thus, we can render on a map not only the polyline representing the MKRouteStep, but also where the bus will go once you get off it, etc.

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
