    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen deploying new devices with Apple Configurator 2 it is possible to install iOS apps and position them with Modify -> Home Screen Layout... action. However this is not possible for webclip icons since they are installed with configuration profile and \"Home Screen Layout\" does not know about them. Webclips are placed on second screen by default (if there is space).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new blueprint in Apple Configurator 2.\r\n2. Install configuration profile containing webclips to this blueprint\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to position webclips with \"Home Screen Layout\" before blueprint is applied to physical device. When configuration profile containing webclip is part of the blueprint, \"Home Screen Layout\" action should know about those webclips.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWebclips appear on the second home screen. There is no option to configure their placement.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApple Configurator 2.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Configurator 2.3"
