    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you build a project with `xcodebuild -destination 'name=iPhone 7'` when there is more than one iPhone 7 simulator, results in an error. It would be nice if there was a way to not have to worry about which simulator was picked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create multiple iPhone 7 simulators on your machine\n2. Create a new project\n3. Build the project from the command line with `xcodebuild -destination 'name=iPhone 7'`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should succeed by picking one of the 2 iPhone 7 simulators.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build fails and you are told to pick a specific simulator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is more of a problem on CI than anything else. Many CI providers have many simulators for all devices and many iOS versions. This along with having extra simulators for pairing with the watch or not means that many CI setups have multiple simulators of the same device type and the same OS version, meaning the only way to disambiguate is with the udid of the simulator, which obviously cannot be hard coded for builds."
