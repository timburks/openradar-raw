    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://30417363\r\n\r\nWhen displaying public transit directions, many times there is a color associated with a certain subway line or bus route, that matches the branding of the line.\r\n\r\nMKRoute objects should have a color property, so that we can display polylines on the map in an appropriate color.\r\n\r\nMKTransitLine (the class I requested in rdar://30396804) should also have such a property.\r\n\r\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
