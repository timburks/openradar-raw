    description: "Summary:\r\nvideo link because (rdar://30364703 - this is actually the second upload because the first one crapped out after 10 minutes) - [REDACTED]\r\n\r\nWhen storyboards get compiled, there are warnings for stuff. Cool.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately clicking on the warning only opens the storyboard.  If the storyboard is non-trivial, it might be impossible (without grepping the raw XML) to figure out what's wrong so I can fix it.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie.  The second project opened has a large non-trivial storyboard with a warning, and I have _no_ idea where to start looking inside of Xcode to find things, short of clicking on every single UI item.  I did look at the XML and know where it came from, but it'd be nice not have to go to that level.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
