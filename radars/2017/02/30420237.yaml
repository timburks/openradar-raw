    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://30395905\r\n\r\nWe should have a property on MKMapItem that tells the caller if a map item is a transit stop.\r\n\r\nUse case: in an app that performs public transit routing, a transit stop will have some form of arrivals/departures information, so the app may want to present a different UI (such as a disclosure chevron to allow the user to view the public transit information for this stop).\r\n\r\n\r\n(This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)"
