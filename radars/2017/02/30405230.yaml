    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery once in a while, especially after waking my laptop or coming back to it after a period of time, opening a fresh tab in Safari and typing into the now-selected omnibar will cause Safari to begin the search without pressing return.  It also accepts whatever completion appears in that brief period of time between the tab being created and the search being initiated which can lead to garbage search results or visiting unintended websites.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(Preconditions)\r\n0. Open at least 10 tabs.\r\n1. Begin creating tabs \r\n2. Immediately begin typing into the focused omnibar\r\n3. Repeat until premature search occurs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari does not begin a search or accept a text completion option without the user's input.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari begins searches and accepts text completions without the user's input.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 10.0.2 (12602.3.12.0.1)/macOS 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnce this has occurred it seems to take some time to reproduce.  After it occurs it usually disappears until I return to my work some time later and reopen more tabs.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
