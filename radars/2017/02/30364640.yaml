    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached screenshot.  Did a build, and all hell broke loos.\r\n\r\nPretty much this was immediately after rdar://30364545 - simulator vomited on itself.  Was (and still am) doing a lot of uploading for context for that, so I don't have to wait two months for the inevitable \"hey send us a sysdiagnosis\" \"that was two months ago\" \"sorry, can't reproduce, go away\" dance.  c.f. rdar://29884107\r\n\r\nI tried to run again, got an alert refusing to run in the simulator.  Quit xcode and the simulator.  Opened xcode again and opened my project, and got what you see in the screen shot.\r\n\r\nAttached is the saved build log. Attached is the project.  \r\n\r\nI'll attach the other stuff asked for in case it's big.  Radarweb is terrible for large uploads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust be me, apparently. I really wanted to work on my project today, rather than babysitting radarweb.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nrdar://22524679\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassBuilderPlayer.zip', 'ib-fail.rtf' and 'Screen Shot 2017-02-04 at 5.00.17 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
