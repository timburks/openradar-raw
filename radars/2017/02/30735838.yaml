        Summary:

        In Xcode 8.2.1, when declaring an Objective-C @property with the (relatively new) class attribute, the word class is not colored to match the other attributes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In an Objective-C file, create an @property like so:

        @property (nonatomic, readonly, class) id foo;

        Expected Results:
        nonatomic, readonly, and class should all be colored using the color for keywords in the current color scheme.

        Actual Results:
        nonatomic and readonly are colored correctly. class is colored using the plain text color.

        The attached screenshot and project demonstrate this problem.
