    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's a segment of Apple's user base (and engineeers) that won't touch electronics one day a week. We don't turn on lights, use our phones or computers. \r\n\r\nThe laws of Shabbat are nuanced, but to Jewish sabbath observers, they're non-negotiable.It would be amazing if we could still use our watches on Shabbat. Apple can help be inclusive here in a rather simple way. \r\n\r\nThe idea would be to combine the low-power mode with an always on display, temporarily disabling any and all of the sensors on the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put on Apple Watch \r\n2. Attempt to find setting which disables all of the active and passive sensors while keeping the clock and the display on. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be such a mode, enabling the time to stay onscreen while the raise-to-display, pedometer, and other sensors are disabled. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe watch will either keep all of the sensors on, or require a button press to show the display in low-power mode."
