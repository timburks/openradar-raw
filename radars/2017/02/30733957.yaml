    description: "Summary:\r\nContacts.app on OS X gives error\r\n\r\n\"The operation couldn’t be completed.\r\n(SOAPWebServicesErrorDomain error -997.)\"\r\n\r\nwhen syncing with an Office 365 account (please see attached file \"O365 error.png\").\r\n\r\nIt seems that this error prevents Contacts.app to successfully modify contacts created by an iOS device. That is, when modifying an Office 365 contact added to the Office 365 account by an iPhone with iOS 10.2.1, Contacts.app gives no error but the change doesn't get through the iOS device. Addition and deletion of contacts seems to work, both for contacts created on the Mac and on the iOS devices.\r\n\r\nAttached \"Contacts.app.log\" file contains the log lines we see in Console.app when we launch Contacts.app and get the SOAPWebServicesErrorDomain error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. To configure the Office 365 account on the Mac open System Preferences.app --> Internet Accounts.\r\n2. Start the wizard to add an Exchange account.\r\n3. Type the name you like in the \"Name\" field.\r\n4. Type \"XXXX@YYYY.org\" in the \"Email Address\" field (this is the test account you can use to reproduce this issue).\r\n5. Type \"ZZZZZZ\" in the \"Password\" field and click the \"Sign In\" button.\r\n7. In the dialog to select the apps to use the account with, deselect everything except \"Contacts\" and click \"Done\".\r\n8. Launch Contacts.app.\r\n9. Notice the new Exchange account in window's sidebar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warning icon should appear next to the Exchange account name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA warning icon appears next to the Exchange account name and clicking on it displays the message:\r\n\"The operation couldn’t be completed.\r\n(SOAPWebServicesErrorDomain error -997.)\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1217)\r\nContacts.app 9.0 (1679.10)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOffice 365 Support send us this procedure to fix the issue:\r\n1. go to a windows pc which has outlook 2016 installed. configure your exchange account there and disable exchange cache mode. \r\n2. download mfcmapi.exe (https://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/)\r\n3. start this program and click on session - logon to connect to your mailbox with this program. \r\n4. double click on you mailbox name in the main window of mcfmapi.exe\r\n5. a new windows opens, in this window open the root container by clicking once on the navigation triangle near the root container.\r\n6. double click on allpersonmetadata\r\n7. in the new opening window delete all entries\r\n8. after that close mfcmapi.exe and start contacts app on mac\r\n\r\nHowever, we found that it temporarily clears the error but as soon as a macOS or iOS device add or modify a contact, the issue reappears and we need to empty the allpersonmetadata container again.\r\nOffice 365 Support asked us to open a case with Apple to check if there is any pending issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'O365 error.png' and 'Contacts.app.log' were successfully uploaded."
