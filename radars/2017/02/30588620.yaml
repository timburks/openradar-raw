    description: "Apple has published a lot of sample code in Swift that no longer works because of syntax changes.\r\n\r\nCode in WWDC videos no longer works, code in presentation slides no longer works, downloadable sample code no longer works.\r\n\r\nOne good example is the sample code for writing modern Cocoa apps on macOS:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/PhotoEditor/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nThis code can no longer be compiled on the latest version of macOS Sierra with the latest version of Xcode."
