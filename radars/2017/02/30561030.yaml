    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached gif.\r\n\r\nDue to rdar://rdar://30560302\tI need to dig three levels deep into Swift Data objects to quicklook them.  \"oh! I'll just use the standard shortcut of option-click the disclosure triangle\".  I still have to click it three times.  Each option-click adds a new level of depth rather than expanding all the things.\r\n\r\nI realize there are gotchas with recursive data structures, but for the times it's not the case, it'd be nice to have this convenience.\r\n\r\nGranted, it'd be even nicer for a working Data quicklook, so I wouldn't have to do this deep-dive into standard library data structures.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a Swift Data variable.\r\nNeed to get to the underlying NSData to quicklook it (rdar://30560302)\r\nOption-click the disclosure triangle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpand the Data enough to get to the NSData so I can quicklook that.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt expands one level.  closing and option-clicking again opens a second level. closing and option-clicking _again_ gets me to the NSData.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta 2 (8W120l)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'expando.gif' was successfully uploaded."
