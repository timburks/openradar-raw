    description: "Only copyfile() respects COPYFILE_CLONE, fcopyfile() does not. The documentation says nothing about this. Presumably this is due to the underlying fclonefileat() system call not having an overload which takes a destination file descriptor, instead requiring the PATH of a non-existing destination file.\r\n\r\nThe documentation should mention that COPYFILE_CLONE only works with copyfile() and not fcopyfile(), or a new overload of fclonefileat() which takes a destination file descriptor should be introduced and used internally by fcopyfile().\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to call fcopyfile() with COPYFILE_CLONE with two open file descriptors, then call copyfile_state_get() and the out parameter will indicate that the file was NOT cloned.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nfcopyfile() with COPYFILE_CLONE followed by copyfile_state_get() indicates that the file was cloned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nfcopyfile() with COPYFILE_CLONE followed by copyfile_state_get() indicates that the file was NOT cloned.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAny Apple OS with an APFS filesystem."
