    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen kicking off tests from the command line, we are seeing issues with Xcode 8.0.0 and 8.2.1. It appears to be localized to scenarios where we are crashing within a GCD block and we're specifying the `--only-testing` flag.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly bad for us, as it breaks our reporting of failures for our continuous integration system. This makes it difficult for engineers to understand what the cause of the failure reason is, because it shows up as a timeout rather than as a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClone sample project: https://github.com/justinseanmartin/XcodebuildCrashLoopRadar\r\nRun: ./build.sh\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould crash once\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes in a loop forever until CTRL+C aborted"
