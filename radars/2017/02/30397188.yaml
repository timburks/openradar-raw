        We need a way to search for transit stops within a certain region.

        MKTransitStopsSearchRequest should, like MKLocalSearchRequest, take a region. It should also take a property of transitModes, which should be an MKDirectionsTransportSubtype (see radar 30395156).

        When the search is performed, via MKTransitStopsSearch, the completion block should be called with all the transit stops that exist inside the region that are served by that mode of transport. (Transit stops should be MKMapItems — see radar 30397022).

        If the desired region is too big, an error should be returned.

        Note that this API should be exhaustive — if you query a certain region, it should guarantee to return either every matching transit stop in the region, or an error.

        (This radar is part of a series of radars describing the API improvements to MapKit that I would need in order to power my app, UK Transport, solely using MapKit's APIs.)
