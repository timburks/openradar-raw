    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOften, but not always, the small versions of the Japanese characters や、ゆ、よ are mispronounced by AVSpeechSynthesizer as if they were the large versions. A few examples of this are\r\n\r\nはっしゃ which is pronounced as はっしや\r\nなっしゃ which is pronounced as なっしや\r\nじんりょく which is pronounced as じんりよく\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are more cases, but these are reliably reproducible examples.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nlet synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()\r\nlet utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: \"なっしゃ\")\r\nutterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: \"ja-JP\")\r\nsynthesizer.speak(utterance)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should be pronounced \"nassha\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text is pronounced \"nasshiya\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is reproducible both in the simulator and on an actual device.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE"
