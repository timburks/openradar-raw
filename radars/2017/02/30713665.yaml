    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen deploying new iPads with Apple Configurator 2 we install a lot of apps from VPP. Apple Configurator 2 downloads these apps into it's cache and deploys them to connected iPad. When we deploy another iPad few minutes later Apple Configurator 2 redowloads those same apps again even though they are still in cache from previous iPad deployment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new blueprint \"appinstall\" in Apple Configurator\r\n2. Add Apps from VPP programme\r\n3. Connect iPadA\r\n4. Apply blueprint \"appinstall\" to iPadA\r\n5. Apple Configurator downloads apps into cache directory\r\n6. Apps are installed\r\n7. Disconnect iPadA\r\n8. Connect iPadB\r\n9. Apply blueprint \"appinstall\" to iPadB\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Configurator 2 reuses already downloaded apps from cache and installs them right away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Configurator 2 downloads all of apps againg. Cache now contains all apps two times.\r\n\r\nThis is bad for two reasons:\r\n1. Longer deployment time because of redownload\r\n2. Cache size increases with every deployed iPad -> f.e. with 128GB MacBook Air space can run out quickly. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApple Configurator 2.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue can be somewhat mitigated with Caching Server but that only reduces download time.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Configurator 2.3"
