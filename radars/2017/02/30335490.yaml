    description: "Summary:\r\nSimilar to rdar://30329541, but from the other direction.\r\n\r\nWhen going in to rendered markup mode, playgrounds are picking the most inconvenient place to scroll to.  If I have the insertion point  inside of some markup, and I go in to Show Rendered Markup, that area is scrolled out of view.  If I want to do any iteration, I'm in a cycle of edit-enter rendered markup-scroll around and try to find where I was.\r\n\r\nIdeally, if I'm editing some markup, I'd like that to be in the visible region of the window when going into rendered mode.\r\n\r\nSee attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.3 beta (8W109m)\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n(second time filing this from scratch - https://mobile.twitter.com/borkware/status/827270094539534337 - and people wonder why we don't file more radars)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'render-mode-frustration.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
