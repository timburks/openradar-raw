    description: "I'd like to use the image picker from the Contacts app with a circular cropping UI. Please make this public.\n\nI tried to replicate the behavior but it's not really possible because cameraOverlayView is displayed both in the camera preview as well as in the confirmation view and there's no hook that let's us change the overlay when switching from preview to confirmation view. \n\nAlso, the image offset is changed below the overlay: see rdar://30513073"
