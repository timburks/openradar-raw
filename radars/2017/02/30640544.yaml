    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'd like to be able to link to an app in the App Store with a link containing a referrer code. For example:\r\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/app/id0987654321?referrer=1234567890\r\n\r\nNext, upon first launch, the value of \"referrer\", \"1234567890\" would be available via the launchOptions dictionary passed to the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  User clicks a link (http://itunes.apple.com/app/id0987654321?referrer=1234567890) from their iOS device, which opens a particular app in the App Store.\r\n2.  User taps the Download button to open the app.\r\n3.  Upon first app launch, launchOptions dictionary should contain referrer key.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nlaunchOptions should contain referrer information\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nlaunchOptions does not any referrer information\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAndroid provides functionality for this, which they call the InstallReferrerReceiver.
