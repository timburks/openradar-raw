    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using \"prepare\" function in Apple Configurator 2  it's possible to skip almost all steps of Setup assistant. In our deployment scenario we skip all steps (we would like to skip even the license but that is not possible :-()\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had option to preconfigure following:\r\n- language\r\n- region\r\n- location services\r\n\r\nSpecificaly we want to se language to English, region to Czech Republic and turn on location services before we hand iPad to user\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApple Configurator 2.3"
