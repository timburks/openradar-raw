    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn 4.7 inch devices (and possibly 5.5in devices as well - do not own any for testing), when the device is in landscape mode, buttons such as period, comma, undo, forward, back, and dictation are not on the left and right sides of the screen as they were in iOS 10. Instead, they are under the \"123\" button. Additionally, the keyboard does not expand to fill the space left by the absence of these buttons. Instead, it leaves a lot of blank space there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to a place where you can type (i.e. Notes app) and turn device to landscape mode. Observe absence of comma, period, left/right arrows, etc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComma, period, left/right arrows, dictation, and undo buttons would be on the left and right sides of the main keyboard area.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThere is a blank space on the left and right sides of the main keyboard area.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0/15A5354b (Dev beta 6)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
