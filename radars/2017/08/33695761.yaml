    description: "Summary:\r\nUp to b4, the additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItems were shown next to the back button on the left side, starting with b4 the back button is missing. This is a serious regression, as the picker is barely usable without going back up to the containing folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a UIDocumentBrowserViewController as the App’s rootViewController\n2. set any additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe additional item, as the name suggests, shows up in addition to the back button, if you drilled down into a folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce you drill down into a folder, there is no visible back button\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFrom UIDocumentBrowserViewController.h:\n\n/// An array of buttons that will be added to the existing buttons in the UIDocumentBrowserViewController navigation bar\n\n“will be added to the existing buttons” clearly states that it shouldn’t replace the back button."
