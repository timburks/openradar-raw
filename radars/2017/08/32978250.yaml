    description: "Summary:\r\nAs soon as screen recording using RPScreenRecorder starts (either using startCapture or startRecording), the screen rotation is completely turned off. It should still be possible to rotate the screen and developers should get notified about the change, especially since it already is a solved problem for Apple, as the system wide recording from control center allows for screen rotation and adapts the video file appropriately.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers are able to rotate the app to their liking and if possible recording should continue, as it does using the iOS 11 system wide screen recording.\r\n\r\nHere are some possible ways to go about this:\r\n- Use the RPScreenRecorderDelegate to inform the app of changes to the recording and simply stop. The app would then have to restart recording after the orientation changed.\r\n- Just continue recording as if nothing happened, like the iOS 11 system wide recording does, and automatically rotate the new screen orientation to fit the original resolution (i.e., if the recording started portrait on an iPhone, rotate the landscape images to fit the portrait video).\r\n- Continue recording, but in case the startCapturing method with a handler called for each frame is used, simply use the new dimensions for the CMSampleBuffer and let the application decide how to proceed.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nUsers can no longer rotate the app to different orientations.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nApple Developer Relations\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to address this based on the following:  \r\n\r\nThis is not something we can do for for startRecording. Because we use AVAssetWriter, which doesn’t allow us to change the transform after the assetWriter has started writing. Even if we get a rotated screen buffer, we wouldn’t be able to do that.   \r\n\r\nWe already have a bug report on passing back the transform for start capture/ broadcast, which will allow you to handle the transforms correctly.   \r\n\r\nWe are now closing this report.  If you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.  \r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
