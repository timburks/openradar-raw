    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a carsharing provider showing lot of pins on the map, we usually avoid/minimize adding/removing pins/annotations onto the map just to update the (visual) state of an annotation, especially if currently interacted or selected with. But the clustering approach currently allows setting the priority only on creation. Is there a way to alter the priority/identifier after creation?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- create several annotations with low priority\n- show them on map, provoke clustering of them (by zooming out)\n- change priority to maximum of one of the items\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- annotation moves out of its cluster\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- nothing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be super useful to be able to change clusterIdentifier/priority within the lifetime of an annotation."
