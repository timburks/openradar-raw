    description: "Summary:\r\nThe quick look panel that shows for folders is of variable size. The size is based on the size of the icon (constant) and the accompanying “Last modified” text item. This means that as you scroll through a list of folders with quick look enabled, the panel will keep resizing the text and icons will both keep shifting, producing a jarring effect\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open your a in Finder which contains mostly folders\n2. Select an item\n3. Hit space to quick look\n4. Use the arrow keys to navigate the list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe quick look panel should remain the same size, and the text and icons should alter based on file properties\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe quick look panel varies in size based on the value of the last modified timestamp and how much horizontal space it occupies\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
