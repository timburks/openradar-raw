    description: "# Description:\r\nNSFileProviderDomains appear to be unable to persist across installations of the parent app. Installing a new build of the parent application appears to reset the domains to the empty state and repeated domain bootstrapping is necessary. This is a significant problem due to lack of reliable domain state information, as outlined in rdar://33845462.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement rudimentary support for a File Provider in the project\r\n2. Add new NSFileProviderDomains via the NSFileProviderManager\r\n3. Sustain crash described in rdar://33845747\r\n4. Reopen the Files.app\r\n5. Confirm domains appear\r\n6. Reinstall the parent app\r\n7. Reopen the Files.app\r\n8. Concurrently, query NSFileProviderManager for the available domains\r\n\r\n# Expected Results\r\nDomains, as set before the reinstallation, appear as additional \"file providers\" in the sidebar of the Files.app. NSFileProviderManager should return the list of domains registered at the first run.\r\n\r\n# Observed Results\r\nThere is only the original File Provider available in the sidebar, with no additional, domain-specific \"file providers\". Querying NSFileProviderManager returns a nil registration list."
