    description: "Summary:\r\nThe issue sometimes appear when test changes the orientation of the simulator on CI Jenkins and try type text to UITextField. With error:\r\nUI Testing Failure - Neither element nor any descendant has keyboard focus.\r\n\r\nIf I run test locally the test is successful but on Jenkins this issue appear sometimes. \r\nI found that this issue can be resolve if add additional tap on UITextField. I done this. \r\nAfter that I got error:\r\n05:35:46     t =    15.61s     Tap \"EmailFieldID\" TextField\r\n05:35:46     t =    15.61s         Wait for app to idle\r\n05:35:46     t =    16.07s         Find the \"EmailFieldID\" TextField\r\n05:35:46     t =    16.07s             Snapshot accessibility hierarchy for com.sample\r\n05:35:46     t =    16.13s             Find: Descendants matching type Any\r\n05:35:46     t =    16.14s             Find: Elements matching predicate '\"EmailFieldID\" IN identifiers'\r\n05:35:46     t =    16.88s             Wait for app to idle\r\n05:35:46     t =    32.88s                 Unable to monitor animations\r\n05:35:46     t =    47.89s                 Unable to monitor event loop\r\n05:35:46     t =    47.89s         Synthesize event\r\n05:35:46     t =    63.10s             Assertion Failure: SampleUITests.m:184: UI Testing Failure - Failed to get attributes within 15.0s: (\r\n05:35:46     2062,\r\n05:35:46     2021,\r\n05:35:46     2123\r\n05:35:46 )\r\nor\r\n03:52:34     t =    28.73s     Tap \"EmailFieldID\" TextField\r\n03:52:34     t =    28.74s         Wait for app to idle\r\n03:52:34     t =    29.03s         Find the \"EmailFieldID\" TextField\r\n03:52:34     t =    29.03s             Snapshot accessibility hierarchy for com.sample\r\n03:52:34     t =    29.08s             Find: Descendants matching type Any\r\n03:52:34     t =    29.09s             Find: Elements matching predicate '\"EmailFieldID\" IN identifiers'\r\n03:52:34     t =    29.09s             Wait for app to idle\r\n03:52:34     t =    30.15s         Synthesize event\r\n03:52:34     t =    32.86s         Wait for app to idle\r\n03:52:34     t =    47.93s             Unable to monitor animations\r\n03:52:34     t =    62.94s             Unable to monitor event loop\r\n03:52:34     t =    62.94s     Snapshot accessibility hierarchy for com.sample\r\n03:52:34     t =    78.10s         Assertion Failure: SampleUITests.m:185: UI Testing Failure - Failed to get snapshot within 15.0s\r\n03:52:34     t =    78.10s     Tear Down\r\n03:52:34     t =    78.10s         Set device orientation to Portrait\r\n\r\nI found that this is common issue but how to fix this decision is not present.\r\n\r\nThe example of code:\r\n\r\n    XCUIElement *emailField = [[application descendantsMatchingType:XCUIElementTypeAny] objectForKeyedSubscript:EmailFieldID];\r\n    \r\n    [emailField tap];\r\n    \r\n    [emailField typeText:email];\r\n    \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI created test\r\nLaunch this test on CI Jenkins\r\nSometimes this issue reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll test run successful.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSometimes the test failed with reproducible - 80%\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8 \r\niOS 10.0\r\nSimulator: iPhone 6 10.0"
