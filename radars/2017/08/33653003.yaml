    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33652807\n\nWe are using the configuration profile setting to disable storing of Documents and Desktop in iCloud for our users. However, from the Manage Storage dialog which can be accessed from About This Mac > Storage > Manage and also pops up when storage is low, users can click the Store in iCloud button to store desktop and documents in iCloud, bypassing this setting.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the user level preference allowCloudDesktopAndDocuments to false in domain com.apple.applicationaccess\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niCloud Drive preferences should show Desktop & Documents Folders greyed out and unselectable. It should also not be possible to enable this setting from the Manage Storage dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iCloud Preferences dialog for iCloud Drive greys out Desktop & Documents Folders but the Manage Storage dialog allows for this to be activated regardless by clicking Store in iCloud.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is also then difficult to reverse on the computer in question as the iCloud Drive System Preferences for Desktop & Documents are greyed out and cannot be accessed."
