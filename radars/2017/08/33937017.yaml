    description: "Area:\r\nStoreKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe see the following two statements incorrect given the actual data that we receive.\r\n\r\n1)\r\n\r\n\"\r\nweb_order_line_item_id\r\nThe primary key for identifying a subscription purchase. Posted only if the notification_type is CANCEL. See values in Table 6-4.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn the attached file \"Issue-1-and-2.json\" the type is INITIAL_BUY and we DO see the web_order_line_item_id field there.\r\n\r\n2)\r\n\r\n\"\r\nlatest_receipt\r\nThe base-64 encoded transaction receipt for the most recent renewal transaction. Posted only if the notification_type is RENEWAL or INTERACTIVE_RENEWAL, and only if the renewal is successful.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn the attached file \"Issue-1-and-2.json\" the type is INITIAL_BUY and we DO see the latest_receipt field there.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) \r\n\r\n\"\r\nexpiration_intent\r\n> This is the same as the Subscription Expiration Intent in the receipt. Posted only if notification_type is RENEWAL or INTERACTIVE_RENEWAL. See also Receipt Fields.\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn the attached file \"Issue-3.json\" the type is INTERACTIVE_RENEWAL and we DO NOT see the latest_receipt field there.\r\n\r\n4) \"To determine if a status update notifications for a subscription event is in the test environment, check if the value of the environment key in the statusUpdateNotification JSON object equals SANDBOX.\"\r\n\r\nIn the attached file \"Issue-4.json\" the environment is \"Sandbox\", not \"SANDBOX\". At the same in other receipts we do see PROD as advertised by the docs. Please notice asymmetry between Sandbox (first letter capital) and PROD (all capital letters).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart receiving server side notifications for Subscriptions. Observe the results, compare them with what is advertised by the docs: \r\n\"Working with Subscriptions / Status Update Notifications\" \r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/Subscriptions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH7-SW13.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect the docs to describe the actual data we get from Apple servers.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nWe don't see the docs to describe the actual data we get from Apple servers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nDoes not apply.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
