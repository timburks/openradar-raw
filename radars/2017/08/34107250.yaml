    description: "Summary:\r\nHow is a APP suppose to suppress clustering for maximum zoom level?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- create two annotations close to each other but not on the same location\n- provide the same clusteringIdentifier to the views\n- show them on the map and zoom to it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- at a certain threshold (or by any other means) no clustering should happen anymore\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- no matter how close I zoom into the map (up to a maximum) the two annotations are merged into a cluster and hence cannot be separated anymore\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClustering is a great solution to a polluted map region but the current implementation is taking vicinity into consideration only and not \"annotation dense\" around it. For the two annotations on the map there is no need to cluster them.\nUnfortunately this drives the two single annotations \"invisible\" and hence useless."
