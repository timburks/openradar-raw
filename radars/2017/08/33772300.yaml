    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have been using .exists property as well as .isHittable property to check visibility of an XCUIElement on the screen of our app. The .exists property returns true even in the case of hidden elements. So I moved on to using .isHittable property in order to check visibility of the XCUIElement. Instead of giving a false boolean result when the element is not on the screen instead the latter returns an exception saying ->\r\n\"UI Testing Failure - No matches found for \"\r\nIs .isHittable supposed to return an exception upon not finding the element on the screen?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExecute the UI test named testExample in the attached project.\r\nThere are two assert statements in the test. Execute the test and note down the test result.\r\nComment out the first assert statement. Execute the test again and note down the test result for second execution.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth .exists and .isHittable property should deliver the same behaviour of test assert failure.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDuring the second execution of test result, we are actually checking the .isHittable property. \r\nThe element on which we are checking .exists and .isHittable does not exist in the element hierarchy. \r\nOn asserting .exists property, a test failure is recorded whereas on asserting .isHittable and exception are thrown about \"the element not found\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3"
