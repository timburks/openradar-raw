    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe PDFView 'enableDataDetectors' attribute is ignored even though it is described (in the headers, documentation is currently missing) as: \"Turns on or off data detection. If enabled, page text will be scanned for URL's as the page becomes visible. URL's are found, Link annotations are created in place. These are temporary annotations and are not saved.\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Create a simple PDFKit view with the attached document (I can create and provide a sample project).\r\n2 - Set `enableDataDetectors` to False (default?).\r\n2 - Open the attached document. It contains two \"links\". One is a simple text and the other is an actual annotation.\r\n3 - See `[[[pdfDocument pageAtIndex:0] annotations] count]`: 1 (this is correct)\r\n4 - Touch both links (the first one should not be touchable).\r\n5 - Delegates (PDFViewWillClickOnLink) are called for simple texts even though APIs (annotationAtPoint) return no annotations.\r\n\r\nLooks like PDFView is always detecting and converting texts as links (translating to annotations) and not \"exposing\" the annotations. This makes it a little hard to handle annotations (real annotations) and auto detected links.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `enableDataDetectors` should be considered correctly and even when converting texts/links as annotations expose it.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe `enableDataDetectors` is ignored converting texts/links as annotations without exposing it (e.g., annotationAtPoint).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 7 (15A5362a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
