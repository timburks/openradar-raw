    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI was importing a large number of photos from the past year, and noticed some photos marked as \"already imported\" did not seem to be imported at all. In every case they were photos I had duplicated, cropped, and applied filters to. I was able to find the original versions of these photos in my library, but not the modified duplicates.\r\n\r\nIn trying to recreate the problem, found that I get one of two results: either the modified duplicate gets imported to Photos without any edits applied, or photos applies the edits to both versions of the photo.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPhone with iOS 10.3.3, take a photo using the Camera app. (Note: I recommend taking a Live Photo)\r\n2. Open Photos and select the photo.\r\n3. Tap the action button and then Duplicate. (Note: if you choose the \"Duplicate as Still Photo\" option here it will be easier to tell the two apart later.)\r\n4. Swipe over to the duplicate photo.\r\n5. Tap the edit button. Crop the photo to square and apply a filter.\r\n6. On a Mac, open the Photos app.\r\n7. Connect your iPhone to the Mac.\r\n8. Select Import > iPhone in the sidebar. (Note that the thumbnails both display as unedited.)\r\n9. Click \"Import All New Photos\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo different photos should be imported: an unmodified original (live photo) and the modified duplicate (still photo).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nI've gotten either of these two results:\r\n1. The edits made to the duplicate have been applied to both copies of the photo. The live photo should be an unmodified original, but it is cropped and filtered. This is the more common result in my testing.\r\n2. Sometimes I end up with two copies of the original.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI've recreated this issue on macOS 10.12.6 (16G29) with Photos 2.0 (3161.4.140), as well as the latest developer beta: macOS 10.13 Beta (17A352a) with Photos 3.0 (3201.11.120)."
