    description: "Summary:\r\n- Can there be a system level action on a NSFileProviderItem for \"Open In App\", so that the file can be opened in the main app of the File Provider Extension that provided it. That is so that we can give the user more options and information that the Files.app currently doesn't allow us to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf an user long presses an item from the Files.app, there are a bunch of system level actions that appear. It would be nice if there is a \"Open in App\" Action. That let's the main app for that extension show the user their preferred context for that file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat there is a \"Open in App\" Action there.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt is not there"
