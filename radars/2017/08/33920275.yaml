    description: "Area:\r\nSoftware Update\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI was running iOS 11 Beta 5 and downloaded the OTA update for iOS 11 Beta 6. The update screen in Settings.app said \"Preparing Update\" beneath the progress bar, and the table cell (button) said Downloading... \r\n\r\nI rebooted the phone, and nothing happened. Settings.app was in the same state. I also deleted the downloaded firmware from the iPhone Storage screen in Settings, and rebooted. The firmware downloaded again and then failed to update - with the same symptoms.\r\n\r\nFinally, I opened iCloud Storage and deleted a few hundred megs of data. A few seconds later, the phone alerted with the update countdown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign into iCloud on an iOS device running iOS 11 Beta 5. The iCloud account should have all of its storage used. (Backups, photos, etc.)\r\n2. Open Settings.app -> General -> Software Update\r\n3. Download the firmware update \r\n4. Wait...\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should unzip the update and install it.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe OS unzips the update and waits (Perhaps while it tries to do something in iCloud, perhaps related to offloading apps?)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 5 (Not sure how to find the build number - my device is on beta 6. I'm on the 3rd party developer train, if that helps.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'd expect some sort of warning, alert, or feedback about what's going wrong, so I can choose to continue without whatever iCloud changes are happening, or at least to know what is wrong. Silent failure is not helpful. :-)\r\n\r\nI tried to take a sysdiagnose, but I'm not sure if iOS captured it before updating. I'm syncing my device now and will upload if I see one that seems like it is from yesterday when I updated.\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for taking the time to screen this radar. I'm sure you're under a lot of pressure with an impending Fall release and maybe a move to AC2. Good luck!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, Verizon"
