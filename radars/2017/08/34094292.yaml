    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMediaRemote isn't functioning properly because it keeps thinking that QuickLookUIService is generating audio or something of the sort and giving it priority over other apps. As such, it's \"controlling\" QuickLookUIService whenever the media keys are pressed instead of the real audio/video application (iTunes, Safari, etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Not sure. Most of the time it's broken, though.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe media keys control playback of the last used application.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe media keys \"control\" QuickLookUIService.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.quicklook.ui.helper.plist && killall QuickLookUIService && launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.quicklook.ui.helper.plist\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)"
