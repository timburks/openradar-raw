    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “Silence” setting in Do Not Disturb (DND), which lets you toggle whether notifications are always silenced or only when the device is locked, should be made accessible through Control Center by 3D Touching the DND icon.\n\nA user might want to not receive notifications while not using the device and thus set the option to only while using device, but at the same time they might also want to temporarily disable notifications while using the device, for various activities such as watching immersive content (ARKit comes to mind), movies, performing a workout, etc.\n\nThis setting should thus be exposed for quick access via the existing Control Center toggle\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
