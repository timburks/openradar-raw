    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UITextField’s font property is set to nil, it immediately reverts to its default value. On tvOS 11, it reverts to a value that is half its default value.\n\nXcode 9.0 (9M189t) on macOS 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITextField.\n2. Inspect its font and observe that it has a size of 38 points.\n3. Set the text field’s font to something besides the default.\n4. Inspect the text field and confirm that its font is the correct new value.\n5. Set the text field’s font back to nil.\n6. Inspect the text field’s font value. Even though it was just set to nil, it now has a default value. This is expected behavior.\n7. Inspect the new font’s point size.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe point size is the same value as the starting value: 38 points.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe point size is now 17 points - half the original default value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 11.0 (15J5333e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see this all in action in the attached Xcode project. Run the unit tests 4 times with the following settings:\n\nScheme: FontSizer-tvOS, tvOS 11.0\nScheme: FontSizer-tvOS, tvOS 10.2 (the one I happened to be testing on).\nScheme: FontSizer-iOS, iOS 11.0\nScheme: FontSizer-iOS, iOS 10.0 (again, the one I happened to be testing on).\n\nYou will notice that the only time the test fails is on tvOS 11.0.\n\nAttached project also posted at https://cl.ly/ls9j"
