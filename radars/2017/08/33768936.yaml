    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have three MKPointAnnotation objects that are added in the exact same coordinates to an MKMapView and they are each given a unique title.\r\n\r\nMKPointAnnotation *a1 = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];\r\na1.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(45.875684, -122.656254);\r\na1.title = @\"Title 1\";\r\n[self.mapView addAnnotation:a1];\r\n\r\nMKPointAnnotation *a2 = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];\r\na2.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(45.875684, -122.656254);\r\na2.title = @\"Title 2\";\r\n[self.mapView addAnnotation:a2];\r\n\r\nMKPointAnnotation *a3 = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];\r\na3.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(45.875684, -122.656254);\r\na3.title = @\"Title 3\";\r\n[self.mapView addAnnotation:a3];\r\n\r\nWhen adding them to the map, normally you can just tap the annotation, then tap again and again to cycle through the overlapped pins. However, when there are more than two, it seems you are limited to only cycling through two of the annotations, even though there are three that are overlapping. Title 1 is never shown:\r\n\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/AO1CF.gif\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd more than two annotations to the map at the same exact location with different titles, then it will cycle through only two of the annotations.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should cycle through all annotations\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nIt only cycled through two annotations.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10"
