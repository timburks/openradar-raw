    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33670140\n\nCurrently if you search in an xcassets directory in Xcode, if you have spaces in your file names not all words you type taken into account. It appears that only the last word is taken into account\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project, add multiple images with similar names with spaces in them\n2. Search for a unique part of one of the assets, with a shared word as well\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince you typed a unique part of one of the assets, fuzzy finding should exclude all other assets that don't include that name\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMany assets are shown that include one or other of the words you've typed, but not including both.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behavior here is complicated and seems to have changed from Xcode 8 to 9. See the attached screenshot here for an example."
