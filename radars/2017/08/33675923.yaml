    description: "Summary:\r\nAs UICollectionView is a subclass of UIScrollView, it would be very great if support for zooming would be added. While you can give it a minimum and maximum zoom scale, there is no common view available that contains all the collection viewâ€™s content that one could return when the delegate method `viewForZoomingInScrollView:` is called.\n\nAdding such a view that contains all the (visible) cells and decoration views would be an awesome addition to UICollectionView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11b4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
