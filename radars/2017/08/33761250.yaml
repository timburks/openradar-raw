    description: "Summary:\r\nScreensaver fails to start after using profiles to customize the iCloud Settings, Enable Siri, Setup TouchID, and Set Diagnostic and Usage Report Settings. The profiles are to disable the configuration screens when a user logins in. I was able to find the issue by using a default install of macOS 10.12.5. I installed the profiles on the admin account that is first created during system setup. I created a new standard user and logged out of the admin account. I waited for 30 minutes at the loginwindow for the computer to wake up. I logged into the new user and waited for the screensaver to start. The screensaver never started. I logged out of the user and logged back in, the screensaver started shortly. I have also found that if you put the computer to sleep while the screensaver is not working that the screensaver would work again. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI was able to find the issue by using a default install of macOS 10.12.5.
