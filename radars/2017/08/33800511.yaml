    description: "The preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins property doesn't appear to be set correctly from a storyboard when running on iOS 10.x from Xcode 9 beta 1-5. This is particularly visible on a UITableViewCell. Setting the property on a cell and its content view in code results in the correct layout, but having the option ticked in Interface Builder alone only affects iOS 11.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe views respect the layout margins of their superviews (e.g. left padding on iPhone 7 should align with table view cell separator)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe views do not respect the layout margins of their superviews (e.g. left padding on iPhone 7 is 8pt on table view cell)"
