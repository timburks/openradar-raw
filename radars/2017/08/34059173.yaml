    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting CLLocationManager.headingOrientation to its existing value will trigger all of the same behaviors (e.g., a new heading update in -[CLLocationManagerDelegate locationManager:didUpdateHeading:]) as if the value had changed. This negates CLLocationManager.headingFilter if a developer attempts to set CLLocationManager.headingOrientation rapidly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable heading updates in a location manager and configure its delegate.\r\n2. Set CLLocationManager.headingFilter to a large value, e.g., 10°. (Optional, makes it more obvious that the filter is ignored.)\r\n3. Set CLLocationManager.headingOrientation to its existing value rapidly — several times a second, perhaps.\r\n4. Observe heading updates in -[CLLocationManagerDelegate locationManager:didUpdateHeading:].\r\n\r\nSee attached demo project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCLLocationManager.headingOrientation would ignore being set to its existing value. No new heading event would be sent to its delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCLLocationManager.headingOrientation’s setter accepts the existing value and triggers its update behaviors, such as sending a new heading update to its delegate.\r\n\r\nWhile sending a heading update when CLLocationManager.headingOrientation actually changes is desirable, doing this when there is effectively no change is not. If CLLocationManager.headingOrientation is set rapidly, heading updates will be sent/received at that same frequency and CLLocationManager.headingFilter will effectively be ignored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: check that you’re not setting CLLocationManager.headingOrientation to its existing value before you set it.\r\n\r\nIn the wild: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/pull/9845"
