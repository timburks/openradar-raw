    description: "I have a lot of calls per day and I'd like to be able to see who did I call or called me. Since I have more than 100 calls per day, by the end of the day I won't be able see the morning calls. It would be more useful to *limit call history by time instead of number of calls*. Maybe have a setting in the Settings.app like for Messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Have more than 101 unique calls\r\n1. Open Phone.app and tap 'Recents'\r\n2. You won't be able to see the 101st call\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee all calls\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNot all calls will be visible"
