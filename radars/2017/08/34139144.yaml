    description: "Summary:\r\nDragging a table row leaves a visible copy of the row's contents in place until the drag is positioned over a droppable area\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\n1. In a table view with several items viewable, begin a drag & drop operation\n\nResult: There will be a more transparent or lighter version of the row in its initial position for a fraction of a second to a few seconds after the drag begins.\n\n2. Drag the item vertically until your finger is positioned over another item\n\nResult: the \"ghost\" item's row content disappears, but the vertical space for the row does not\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the animation includes only one copy of the row contents, not a placeholder copy and the animating copy\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n the \"ghost\" item's row content disappears, but the vertical space for the row does not\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n15A5368a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
