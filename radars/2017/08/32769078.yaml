    description: "Summary:\r\nFoundation in iOS11 and macOS 10.13 provides some very nice enhancements to Key Value Observing, including block/closure based observers, easy unregistration, the NSKeyValueObservedChange type, etc. Unfortunately, it seems these enhancements are only available when using Swift, despite KVO requiring the use of the Objective-C runtime. Most if not all of these changes would be very useful in Objective-C as well, so I'm requested that they be made available in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use new foo.observe() { } style API in Objective-C\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBlock based KVO API is available in Objective-C.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBlock based KVO API is only available in Swift."
