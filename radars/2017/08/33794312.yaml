    description: "Summary:\r\nThe downloads modal in Safari for macOS restricts the error message for failed downloads to just the one line usually used to show a download’s progress, with no way to read the error message in full as well\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Commence a download in Safari for macOS (Xcode 9 beta in this case)\n2. Have it crash (in this case, I resumed the download after ~12 hours; I’m guessing my permissions had expired by then)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe failed download shows the full error message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the first few words of the error message are visible\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 10.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
