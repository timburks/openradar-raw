    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of macOS the settings from System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General were displaying in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist. \r\n\r\nFrom 10.13 com.apple.screensaver.plist contains only one key and I can see that there is probably a new way to store this values. I did some research and probably it was moved to the private keychain.\r\n\r\nOn 10.13\r\n1. System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General  change some settings\r\n2. I can't see any values in the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist.\r\n3. I can see that  ~/Library/Keychains/CBC86383-C279-5887-A86A-592F7E6FDA0B/User.kb was modified.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like to be able to read values askForPasswordDelay & askForPassword values in the 10.13 via terminal / Objective-C code."
