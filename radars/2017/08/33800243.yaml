    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of NSProgress fractionCompleted states:\n\n> Setting both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount properties to zero indicates that there is no progress to track; in this case, the indeterminate property returns NO\n\nShould say ‘returns YES’ as stated in the documentation for indeterminate states:\n\n> Progress is indeterminate when the value of both totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount are zero.\n\nA trial test in code confirms that this should be YES when both counts are zero.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsprogress/1408579-fractioncompleted?language=objc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould say ‘returns YES’\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSays ‘returns NO’\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNow\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would make more sense to me if the progress was indeterminate whenever the totalUnitCount was zero. Currently a progress with a totalUnitCount of zero and a completedUnitCount above zero has a fractionCompleted of 1 and is not indeterminate, which I find surprising."
