    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode will crash right after launching once it begins indexing my project. It seems to be hitting some sort of abort in _cow_copy due to an \"mcount overflow\". This might be an issue with the new COW Foundation types, but I'm not sure. Attached is a crash log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode? I'm not quite sure how I got Xcode stuck in this state, since it was working fine yesterday.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode opens and runs without crashing.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nXcode crashes when indexing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)/macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.XCode IDEIndexDisable 1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)"
