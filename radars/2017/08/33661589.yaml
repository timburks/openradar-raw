    description: "Summary:\r\nTab key doesn’t consistently move focus between textfields/buttons in Find & Replace within a file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any file\r\n2. Open Find & Replace (click cmd-opt-f)\r\n3. Type a phrase you’re looking for\r\n4. Click tab key three times \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFocus should be on “Replace” text field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFocus is first moved on Aa button, but then to a text view containing code. It’s not clear that happens because cursor is not visible in the text view at that time but if you type something, the text appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0b4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
