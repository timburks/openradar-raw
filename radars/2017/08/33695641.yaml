    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen SFSafariViewController is opened for a URL that returns a 404 page, the delegate callback indicates a successful load. I reported this as a bug, you consider it behaves as intended (rdar://33400536). This doesn't solve my problem as I want to know about such errors, particularly at first page load. So I suggest adding another delegate callback:\n\n- (void)safariViewController:(SFSafariViewController *)controller didFailWithHTTPResponse:(NSHTTPURLResponse*)response;\n\nThis delegate should be called on 4xx or 5xx HTTP responses.\n\nThe purpose of this callback: The app might want to open a backup page instead or dismiss the view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
