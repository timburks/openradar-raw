    description: "This seems to be fixed with the release version, prompt now displays \"Create new keychain\" and \"Update Keychain Password\", thankfully omitting the \"Cancel\" button.\r\n\r\nWhenever there is a mismatch between a user’s AD login password and the keychain password, macOS is automatically renaming the old keychain to login_renamed_#.keychain-dc and creating a new keychain without any user interaction or prompting.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into the Mac with an AD account\r\n2. Either change the directory account’s password on another machine/in the directory (Not on the Mac), or change the login keychain password.\r\n3. Reboot the Mac and log in with the new password"
