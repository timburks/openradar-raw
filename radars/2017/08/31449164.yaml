    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs you can see on image 1.png, iTunes was playing the song “...“.\r\n\r\nAs you can see on the image 2.png, this song isn’t even on my iPhone (cloud download icon). So where does that song come from?\r\n\r\nAs you can see in 3.png, I only have one song from the Album “...” on my iPhone, and as you can see in 4.png, this is *NOT* the song “...”.\r\n\r\nApple Music? Nope, as you can see in 5.png, I don’t have Apple Music. And as you can also see there, the iCloud Music Library has been disabled.\r\n\r\nAnd streaming this song wouldn’t have been possible either. Why? As you can see on all previous images, I was connected by LTE only, no Wifi, and now look 6.png and you see that iTunes has no permission for mobil data access.\r\n\r\nI sync all my songs to my iPhone using iTunes, I always sync only one specific playlist and this song is not on this playlist, never has been on it. To make things perfect, I only play this playlist on my iPhone, the song is also not on this playlist on my iPhone, so why is it even ever playing, despite the fact that I have no idea how it got on my iPhone.\r\n\r\nThis is probably by far the most crazy bug I have ever reported to you! This is not the first time it happens and it’s not the only song I’ve seen this happening, just this time I noticed at once and had time to collect screenshots as proof.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s"
