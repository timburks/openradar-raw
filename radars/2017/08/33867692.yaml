    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached screen shot. Reminders app was not showing up in search, although it’s settings and even ‘Knowledge’ telling me about it was!\n\nThat other stuff in the screen shot shouldn’t be ranking higher than an app with a near-exact name match. The app does show up when I include the ‘s’ to get an exact name match.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMaybe:\n\n1. Don’t use Reminders much.\n2. Search for ‘Reminder’\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReminders app should be at least a result even if not the top one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReminders in not in results unless I type the full name.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 developer beta 15A5341f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happens on my iPhone but the app shows up much more easily (as expected) on my iPad."
