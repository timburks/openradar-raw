    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen requesting for images with depth data, the only option is to ask for photos \"captured with the Camera app's Portrait mode depth effect\". It would be quite useful to be able to ask for any photo that has depth data, since third party apps that take photos along with depth data and store it to the Photo Library doesn't get tagged with the MediaSubtype.photoDepthEffect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a PHFetchOptions() and add a predicate for fetching photos with depth using the following code:\r\n\r\nlet options = PHFetchOptions()\r\noptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: \"((mediaSubtype & %d) != 0)\", PHAssetMediaSubtype.photoDepthEffect.rawValue)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUse the code with a .photoWithDepthData media subtype:\r\n\r\nlet options = PHFetchOptions()\r\noptions.predicate = NSPredicate(format: \"((mediaSubtype & %d) != 0)\", PHAssetMediaSubtype.photoWithDepthData.rawValue)\r\n\r\nGet all photos from Photo Library that has depth data.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThis fail to get all photos that has depth data. It only gets the photos that has a depth effect applied to it from the built in iOS Camera.app."
