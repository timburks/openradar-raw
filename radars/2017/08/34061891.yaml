    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe NSStackView that contains some NSTextViews in the attached application does not render its contents when the window appears–it shows up as blank. Inspecting the text views in the View Hierarchy Debugger shows that they have the correct bounds set, but are just not drawn. This issue is “resolved” once the window is resized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample code.\r\n2. Resize the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe stack view draws itself immediately.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe stack view only draws itself after the window is resized.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMore detailed information can be found on the GitHub issues that track the problem: https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/issues/30, https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/issues/33.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nForce the window to resize programatically.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a)"
