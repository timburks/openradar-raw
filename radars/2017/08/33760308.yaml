    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #32769996\n\niOS 11 shows a blue status bar every time application that is in the background monitors location of the user. The mentioned behavior of a blue status bar is exactly the same in the case of both possible location authorization statuses: “Always” and “While in Use“.\r\n\r\niOS 10 doesn’t show a blue status bar when an application with “Always” access to the location of the user is in the background. It shows a blue status bar only when a backgrounded application that was granted “While in Use“ access monitors the location of the user.  It seems to be a pretty good model as a user that granted application “Always” access to his/her location is aware of the possibility of being tracked by the application at any time. Thus, there is no need for a blue status bar taking additional space at the top of the screen.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Moves app (or any other app that uses “Always” access - for example Google Maps). https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moves/id509204969?mt=8\r\n2. Grant the application “Always” access to your location.\r\n3. Move the application to the background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. A blue status bar isn’t visible at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. A blue status bar is visible at the top of the screen. Applications like Moves app must constantly monitor my location and as a user I don’t want to see a “permanent” blue status bar when they do that.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are no workarounds to the described problem."
