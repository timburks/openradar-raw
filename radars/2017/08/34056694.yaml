    description: "Summary:\r\nIn my app Nozbe, which is a task manager, there are no “lists”, but “projects”.\n\nIt’s confusing to our users to say “add a task to «Marketing» list”, and not “… Marketing project”.\n\nThe word project is common in many todo apps, so it should be accepted as a synonym. Alternatively, there should be a way to specify it as app-specific vocabulary\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
