    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes a CKQuerySubscription won't fire even matching records are created, updated, or deleted. \r\n\r\nThe subscription is a query subscription on the public database. I have a Xcode regression test case to verify notifications should be triggered by manipulating records from the CloudKit dashboard. The test usually passed, until someday suddenly the query subscription won't trigger any notifications.\r\n\r\n+ Since record zone changes notification in private database fires properly, I think it has nothing to do with my entitlement file and notifications registering.\r\n+ Since the query subscription did fire properly before, I think it is not directly caused by the subscription type. Even a TRUEPREDICATE can stop fire sometimes.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy for a query subscription to enter its non-functioning state. Although it works sometimes, given a container, I can usually reproduce the issue in less than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Save a query subscription.\r\n2. Modify a record matching the predicate of the query subscription.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPushes followed by record modify operations from the logs in CloudKit dashboard.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo push followed by record modify operations from the logs in CloudKit dashboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue may be related to radar 30483448, 30003160, and 23804473."
