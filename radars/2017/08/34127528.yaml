    description: "The color of the section titles in the help pop-up (alt-click on variables, functions, etc.) is too light and it's difficult to read since the background also has a light color.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project\r\n2. Press Alt and click on a e.g. function to get the help pop-up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSection titles have the same color as the text (maybe their weight is different).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSection titles' font has a light font color. They don't have enough contrast with the background and it's difficult to read."
