    description: "Area:\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 Notes adds the feature and associated settings of accessing notes from the Lock Screen. This feature can be set to Resume Last Note Viewed in Notes App. This does note interact well with attachments, which is extremely important for document annotation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set Settings > Notes > Access Notes from Lock Screen to \"Resume Last Note Viewed in Notes App\".\r\n2. Set \"Require Passcode\" to something other than \"Always\".\r\n3. Copy a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition PDF character sheet into iCloud Drive.\r\n3a. It is extremely important that follow this step exactly.\r\n4. In Files app on iPad, share the PDF via Add to Notes.\r\n5. Switch to Notes and open the new note.\r\n6. Annotate the PDF.\r\n7. Lock iPad.\r\n8. Wake iPad.\r\n9. Tap on the screen with Apple Pencil.\r\n10. Tap on the document to start annotating\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can annotate the document.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNotes briefly hangs and the document annotation screen shows a blank textured (Notes) background and accepts no annotation input.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 seed 7 (15A5362a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe data protection hole poked open by the \"Require Passcode\" option seems to not extend to attachments of the lock-screen-eligible note.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue occurs rarely when \"Access Notes from Lock Screen\" is not set to \"Resume Last Note Viewed in Notes App\".\r\n\r\nIssue cannot occur when \"Require Passcode\" is set to \"Always\" for Notes, as viewing the note from the prompts for passcode."
