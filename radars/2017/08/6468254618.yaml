    description: "Summary:\r\nA caching server on 10.12.5 with Server 5.3.1 installed will not serve iOS app updates to devices running iOS 10.3.3 or below. It will, however, cache and serve apps (new installs only, not updates) and iOS updates.\r\n\r\nIf an iOS device running iOS 10.3.3 or below requests a new app from the app store, it is cached and served correctly. If it requests an update, the app update is downloaded from Apple. This has been tested on the below devices with their respective results:\r\n\r\niPad 3 - iOS 9.3.5: App updates do not download from caching server\r\niPhone 5S - iOS 10.3.3: App updates do not download from caching server\r\niPhone 6 - iOS 10.3.3: App updates do not download from caching server\r\niPhone 6S - iOS 10.3.3: App updates do not download from caching server\r\n\r\niPhone 6 - iOS 11b3: App updates download from caching server correctly\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download app from app store on iOS device running iOS 10.3.3 or below and ensure it is downloaded on the caching server.\r\n2. Wait for an update to be available and update from the app store. Check the log to see where the update is coming from.\r\n2a. Delete the app and redownload it to ensure caching is working for new installs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS device should download app updates from caching server.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCaching Server doesn't notice a request from the device and the device downloads the app update from Apple.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niMac (10.12.5) running Server.app (5.3.1)"
