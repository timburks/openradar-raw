    description: "Summary:\r\nThe standard system movie playback UI should reposition and scale the video to make it fully visible when the keyboard is shown. This was not a problem historically because apps were always full screen and the keyboard and movie player would not be shown at the same time. This is not the case now we have split screen.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to use the iPad to watch a video and take notes. Currently this means either the video may be obscured partially by the keyboard or you have to use PiP because it has the side effect of putting the video in the corner and avoiding the keyboard. This is poor as: it makes the video smaller; you don’t get all the controls; there’s unneeded distractions on the screen; and it’s fiddly to set up. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a landscape split view with a video playing app such as Videos or WWDC, and an app that can show the keyboard such as Notes or Mail.\n2. Don’t use an external keyboard.\n3. Play video\n4. Start typing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo and associated controls should be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo may be partially obscured. Controls like play/pause are completely hidden by the keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 developer beta 15A5341f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nResponsible public API is AVPlayerViewController."
