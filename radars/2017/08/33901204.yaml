    description: "When setting up a WKInterfacePicker and WKPickerItems in List mode, WKPickerItems are only configurable with a contentImage or title and accessoryImage property. For pickers that show short text like dollar amounts, the interface is crowded and hard to read. The WKPickerItem should support a configurable text size, either in point size or relative size to the WKInterfacePicker itself.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\nSet up a WKInterfacePicker with some sort of small text and either size the interface to be large or small. The larger size makes the text look crowded and the small size doesn't take advantage of the full space that the watch screen provides.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nA full size interface with text that fits to the picker.\r\n\r\nObserved:\r\nAn awkward looking interface."
