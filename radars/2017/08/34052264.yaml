    description: "Area:\r\nSystemConfiguration Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the latest iOS 11, it is still possible to access the WiFi AP and using the Mac Address of the AP, one can approximate user's location without showing the Privacy Prompt.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've made a proof of concept code and attached.\r\nOpen the Xcode project in Xcode 9 beta 6 and run the app on a device.\r\nYou should mostly be able to see user's coarse location without the location prompt.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCNCopySupportedInterfaces and CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo should return nil or randomized Mac Address.\r\nNote that, these APIs are deprecated in favour of NetworkExtension framework which doesn'tâ€‹ have these issues.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nCNCopySupportedInterfaces and CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo are returning correct results and this could infringe user's privacy.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 (Xcode Beta 6)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe device should be connected to WiFi and not a hotspot.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
