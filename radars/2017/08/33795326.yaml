    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 10.3 introduced API to customise the app icons with the help of alternate app icons. The launch screen remains static, however. API should be added to change the launch screen as well.\r\n\r\nThe launch screen is one of the first things someone sees in your apps, so many apps go to great pains to create custom animated ones to ensure a smooth looking transition. Twitter and the latest version of Reddit are some great examples.\r\n\r\nWith alternate icons, however, the transition cannot remain smooth, as the launch screen is fixed at compile time and cannot be altered. If, for example, Twitter were to offer an alternate icon where the Twitter bird glyph were to be dark, the launch screen transition would be a janky one with a transition from a black glyph to a white one.\r\n\r\nThe various animations try to ensure that the launch screen is visually connected to the app icon on one end, thus ensuring a smooth transition from Springboard to the app while the app is still setting up, and then animate from the launchscreen to the app UI, making the transition as seamless as can be. \r\n\r\nAs it stands now, however, the app icon and app UI can be customised as per need, however the launchscreen in the middle cannot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
