    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has had for a long time some undocumented support for applying themes to the IDE itself, not only the text editor. I have written about this at https://gist.github.com/danielmartin/820901f36eb36afc28bed995f7ab4946\n\nApple should clean up, expose and document something like the internal “DVTTheme”, as there’s people interested in changing the font faces of parts of the IDE (to make them more readable), or even having a true “dark mode” that better matches macOS dark mode, for example: https://twitter.com/arekholko/status/888355715680796672\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
