    description: "Since August 1st, I have been unable to receive email from my Exchange account. I started receiving the following messages repeated every second in the Console:\r\n\r\nAug  1 14:05:20 Kobol Mail[850]: -[SOAPParser:0x7fd686c96db0 parser:didStartElement:namespaceURI:qualifiedName:attributes:] Type not found in EWSMeetingRequestMessageType for DoNotForwardMeeting (t:DoNotForwardMeeting)\r\nAug  1 14:05:20 Kobol Mail[850]: Received an unexpected error: Error Domain=SOAPWebServicesErrorDomain Code=-997 \"(null)\"\r\n\r\nThe only way to stop the error messages was to disable Mail and Calendars for the Exchange account.\r\n\r\nThis only happens on my El Capitan Mac. I can receive email on my Sierra Mac, and I get no error messages.\r\n\r\nThis is being discussed here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8021625?start=15&tstart=0"
