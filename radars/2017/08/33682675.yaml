    description: "Using Xcode 9.0 beta 4 (but bug not present in iOS 10 or 9):\r\n\r\nCreate a UIViewController with a UISearchBar as it's header view. Setup several scope titles in the UISearchBar.\r\n\r\nClick the search bar, and note than the scope buttons now appear, and they cover the top of the table view, obscuring the first row.\r\n\r\nRebuild on iOS 10 and note how this does not happen, the position of the table view contents is moved down below the header (in the y axis)"
