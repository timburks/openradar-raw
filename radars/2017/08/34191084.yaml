    description: "In the iOS 11 beta, MKAnnotationView seems to have gained a new backing layer, _MKAnnotationViewLayer, that does not respect the content mode of the view.\r\n\r\nPlaying around with Reveal, on iOS 10.3 MKAnnotationView is backed by a CALayer, and changing the contentMode on the MKAnnotationView affects the drawing.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 11, though, MKAnnotationView is backed with a _MKAnnotationViewLayer, which seems to draw the view as .scaleToFill always, no matter how I change the contentMode on my MKAnnotationView subclass.\r\n\r\nI've attached a project that cycles through some content modes on an MKAnnotationView. Running this code on iOS 10 shows the view change drastically, while running it on iOS 11 doesn't show any view change at all.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the content mode defaults to scaleAspectFit on iOS 10, while it performs scaleToFill behavior on iOS 11."
