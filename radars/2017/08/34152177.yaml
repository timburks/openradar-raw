    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that 10.12.6 is not able to read APFS volumes properly if they contain hard links created on 10.13.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMount attached disk image.\r\nIt has a folder \"hard and soft linked items\".\r\nOpen it on 10.13 - verify that it contains 9 files.\r\nOpen it on 10.12.6 - see that it contains no files (same if you \"ls\" in Terminal)."
