    description: "Area:\r\nServer (macOS Server)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the output of System Image Utility against the latest installer for High Sierra (17A352a) results in a NBI that boots but does not boot diskless even though it is configured to do so.\r\n\r\nThe client Netboots but the local drive is not unmountable. Using the `mount` command shows that the mount path is local instead of the form `//netboot103@192.168.1.8/NetBootClients1 on /private/var/netboot (afpfs, nobrowse)` \r\n\r\nThis is reproduced on the following:\r\nSingle VLAN network on a consumer router using an existing, working Netboot environment for testing\r\nServed from macOS 10.12.6 with Server.app version 5.3.1\r\nClient computer attempting to NetBoot is a MacBookPro9,2, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD\r\nNBI created on a machine running macOS 10.13.0b7 (17A352a)\r\nNBI available over NFS, no model restrictions, Index = 1434, \"Make this image available for diskless booting\" is checked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse SIU on a 10.13 17A352a machine and build a NetBoot NBI. Besides adding the admin account no additional changes are made.\r\nSetup NetInstall on a server and use the new NBI as the default image.\r\nConfigure the image to be offered over NFS and to boot diskless in the image settings.\r\nNetBoot a client machine that is compatible with 10.13.\r\nAfter NetBooting and logging in with the account created during the NBI creation launch Terminal and issue the command `mount` to observe where the shadow image is located.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shadow image would be listed in the form \"//netboot103@192.168.1.8/NetBootClients1 on /private/var/netboot (afpfs, nobrowse)\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe shadow image is listed in the form \"/dev/disk0s2 on /private/var/netboot\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.0 17A352a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCreated the NBI a few times on macOS 10.13.0b7\r\nTried Netbooting both VMs and physical hardware with the same results.\r\nFollowed the instruction at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203638 to reset the Netboot service with no change.\r\nSwitching to a 10.12.6 NBI configured to boot diskless succeeds as being diskless in the same exact environment. The only change is the which NBI to boot from. When Netbooted to 10.12.6 the local drive can be unmounted.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOn the same server, image configuration, network, client machine this issue does not happen with a 10.12.6 NBI."
