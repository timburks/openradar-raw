    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #33762856\n\nIt would be amazing if XCBuild was open source. Currently if you ever have a problem with a bug in the Xcode build toolchain, it's very difficult to track down, reproduce, or workaround. By open sourcing XCBuild not only could developers have a chance to figure out how to fix problems, but they could also submit these fixes upstream, just like people do with the open source Swift projects. Even if developers couldn't submit the fixes themselves, having the ability to gain extra context from the open source repo could improve the bug reports submitted.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to read the source of XCBuild\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe source is available on https://github.com/apple !\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXCBuild is closed source\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's a list of Radars that I have previously filed that possibly (depending on implementation details obviously unbeknownst to me) that could have been fixed from an external contribution to Xcode's build toolchain.\n\nrdar://33583911\nrdar://31522865\nrdar://31521765\nrdar://31383369\nrdar://31372950\nrdar://30725285\nrdar://30725266\nrdar://28292226\nrdar://27516128\nrdar://23225405\nrdar://23224011"
