    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working with Storyboard files from different platforms, the Xcode Object Library will not switch the platform for UI objects until a Storyboard from that different platform is opened in the Main Editor, and not the Assistant Editor. Seemingly, opening a differently-platformed Storyboard file in the Assistant Editor should also trigger this switch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the attached sample project\r\n1. In the Project Navigator, click iOS/Main.storyboard to open it in the Main Editor\r\n2. Observe the Object Library presents a set of iOS-specific UI elements\r\n3. In the Project Navigator, click any non-Storyboard file to open it in the Main Editor\r\n4. In the Project Navigator, Option-click tvOS/Main.storyboard to open it in the Assistant Editor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nObserve the Object Library presents a set of tvOS-specific UI elements\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nObserve the Object Library continues to present a set of iOS-specific UI elements\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.3.3 (8E3004b), macOS 10.12.5 (16F73)"
