    description: "Area:\r\nReminders\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI heavily use scheduled reminders throughout my day. I frequently mark a reminder as complete on my laptop but have to _also_ clear the notification for the reminder from my iOS devices.\r\n\r\nIt would greatly improve the usability of Reminders if the notifications were cleared once that reminder was marked complete from another device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPrerequisite: At least one MacOS and one iOS device.\r\n\r\n1. Create a scheduled reminder. Ex: \"Hey Siri, remind me to send in a bug report in 5 minutes\"\r\n2. Wait for the reminder. Notifications should appear on both MacOS and iOS device(s).\r\n3. Mark the reminder as complete from any one device (ex: from MacBook Pro)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReminder notification for \"Send in a bug report\" to automatically clear on iPhone.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nReminder notification for \"Send in a bug report\" has to be manually cleared from all iOS devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 6"
