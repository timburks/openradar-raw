    description: "I have been using XCUITest for UI tests in Xcode 8 since few months. Xcode 8 had a feature where a system dialog of this type would be handled automatically in the test:\r\n\r\n \"XYZ app\" would like to send you push notifications. \r\n\r\nXcode 8 would auto-click 'Don't Allow' button in this dialog for me, which was perfect.\r\n\r\nNow, I have been using beta releases of Xcode 9 (currently using beta 6). This behaviour is not supported anymore. The test gets stuck at the System Dialog to allow push notifications. Users are being stuck and forced at writing their own UIInterruption handler.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly appreciated if the XCTest team can handle this issue before the GA release of Xcode 9 (or next beta).\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Uninstall app if app instance is installed\r\n2. Run UI test using XCTest for an app that requires push notifications.(This system dialog may be about push notifications, location, etc.)\r\n3. Let the push notification system dialog appear when test runs after installing test runner, and target app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest runner auto dismisses (or auto-accepts) the system dialog.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nTest runner is stuck at the system dialog, and test cannot proceed. Users are being forced to write their own handlers to handle the system dialog.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 6 (9M214v)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\nRunning tests on an iPhone SE"
