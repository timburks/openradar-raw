    description: "I want to hide a MKMapView dynamically at runtime. For this purpose, I attach a NSLayoutConstraint with a height constant of 0. Every time this constraint gets activated the following warning appears in the console:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.\r\n\tProbably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. \r\n\tTry this: \r\n\t\t(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; \r\n\t\t(2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. \r\n(\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x6000004816d0 UILayoutGuide:0x60000019e850'Edge Insets'.top == MKMapView:0x7f96b4054c00.top + 8   (active)>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000286680 UILayoutGuide:0x60000019e850'Edge Insets'.bottom == MKMapView:0x7f96b4054c00.bottom - 8   (active)>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x60800028f0f0 MKMapView:0x7f96b4054c00.height == 0   (active)>\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nWill attempt to recover by breaking constraint \r\n<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000286680 UILayoutGuide:0x60000019e850'Edge Insets'.bottom == MKMapView:0x7f96b4054c00.bottom - 8   (active)>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI can prevent this issue by setting the MKMapView's bounds height manually to 0 before activating the constraint.\r\n\r\nThe issue also occurs when MKMapView is inside a UIStackView and I set the map view's 'hidden' property to 'true'. In this case, UIStackView hides the map view by adding an internal height constraint with a constant of 0."
