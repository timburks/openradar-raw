    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApple is usually great at localization and encourage developer to take care of localization to support more users. However, with more TestFlight features in recent years, there is still no localization support in the whole testing experience. I suggest Apple to create localized TF invitation email and to localize the TF app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Send TestFlight invitation to tester\r\n- User receive email of instruction of downloading and redeeming the test app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- User sees instruction accord with their device language setting or iCloud language preference\r\n- Download TestFlight app with localized UI\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- All instruction display in English\r\n- TestFlight app in English\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS version\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
