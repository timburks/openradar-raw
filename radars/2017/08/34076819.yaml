    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an IMAP account is offline, Mail.app \"Export Mailbox…\" function produces an empty .mbox file.\r\nLikewise, copying messages to a mailbox on another IMAP account does not work (some but not all messages are eventually copied).\r\n\r\nMessages that could not be copied seems to have separate attachments (in Library/Mail/V4/.../Attachments/.../ subdirectory).\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, in case of an IMAP server crash, mail could not be easily recovered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a large IMAP account offline. Try to export a mailbox of this account by control-clicking on it and choosing \"Export Mailbox…\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app should generate a full .mbox file that could be used with another mail software (typically be imported in a new IMAP server).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe .mbox file within the bundle is eventually empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 10.3 (3273) \r\nOS X Version 10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt sounds like Mail.app does not include the required feature of reinflating RFC822 messages by re-encoding attachments that were extracted for Spotlight/QuickView features. Original Content-Transfer-Encoding header and added X-Apple-Content-Length header can be used to build a compatible message but they are actually not sufficient to re-inflate the message exactly like it was initially received."
