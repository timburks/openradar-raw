    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen in fullscreen video, the cursor will disappear after a couple of seconds of inactivity when the controls hide. Unfortunately, however, it appears as though the subtitles cause the cursor to reappear; i.e. whenever subtitles show up (and the the controls are hidden) the cursor will reappear, only to disappear when there is a momentary lull in subtitles (for example, where there's no dialog). I was unable to capture this with QuickTime (which kept the cursor permanently visible) or take a screenshot (since pressing anything on the keyboard causes the controls to show up), so I hope this description is sufficient.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a video.\r\n2. Enable subtitles.\r\n3. Enter fullscreen.\r\n4. Wait for the controls and cursor to hide.\r\n5. Wait for the next set of subtitles to show up.\r\n6. Wait for the subtitles \"box\" to disappear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor remains hidden after step 4.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe cursor reappears in step 5 and disappears in step 6.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRelease 36 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 13604.1.32.0.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A315i)"
