Just observed it once (and now get the sheet every time). I have previously used this feature and it worked flawlessly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn my iPad I went to enter a Wi-Fi password.\nI moved my iPhone (which knew the password) close to provide it\nOn unlocking the iPhone, the sheet asking whether I want to share the password came up\nI shared the password\nNow every time I unlock the iPhone, the sheet asking whether I want to share the password comes up\nThis persists after reboot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither after successfully sharing the password or tapping the cross in the corner of the sheet asking to share password, it should not appear again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am asked about sharing the password every time I unlock the iPhone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 dev beta 4 (15A5327g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven’t found a way to stop this yet. Might try resetting network settings later."
