    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Tweetbot, if you tap a tweet, then choose share, there is a \"Copy Link\" activity in the bottom bar of the share sheet. When you drag to re-order it to be the first item, it disappears and never comes back. Reinstalling the app doesn't restore it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Tweetbot on an iOS device running the iOS 11 beta.\r\n2. Sign in and tap a tweet\r\n3. Tap the share button\r\n4. Scroll horizontally in the bottom row until you find the \"Copy Link\" activity\r\n5. Drag it to be the first position.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can tap the \"More\" button and reorder the activity there. This leads to the same outcome.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe activity should be at the first position\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe activity disappears and can't be restored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWas not a problem in iOS 10"
