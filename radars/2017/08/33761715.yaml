    description: "Summary:\r\nThanks for re-adding code folding into Xcode 9! \U0001F44F\r\n\r\nI often navigate using my keyboard’s arrow keys, including in folded code sections. However, in Xcode 9 beta 5, the left arrow no longer navigates _anywhere_ in folded code sections. See attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fold code section in Xcode 9 beta 5.\r\n2. Using your keyboard’s arrow keys, navigate into the folded code section to the point where it’s highlighted by the source editor.\r\n3. Press the left arrow to navigate to move either within or out of the folded code section.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLeft arrow should navigate within and out of the folded code section.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe left arrow does not navigate _anywhere_ in the folded code section.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached video."
