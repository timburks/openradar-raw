    description: "Area:\r\nQuickLook Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCustomers rely on Excel formats displayed correctly both using standard apps (iCloud Drive, Files, Mail, etc.) and 3rd party apps generating Excel content. While iOS 10 and 9 displayed Excel formatting correctly, iOS 11 really breaks the formatting causing problems and customer support.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Open attached file (QuickLook-Excel-Simple.xlsx) using Quick Look (standard apps like Files).\r\n2 - Compare the result using iOS 10 or iOS 9 and iOS 11.\r\n3 - See attached screenshots: QuickLook-Excel-iOS-10 & QuickLook-Excel-iOS-11.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExcels are pretty common files and should be formatted correctly as this is basic formatting (cells).\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\niOS 11 formats the cells really incorrectly while iOS 10 and 9 do a really good job. This impacts customers using standard apps like Files and Mail and 3rd party apps causing problems and support.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5362a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
