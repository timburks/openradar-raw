    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn some cases, calling Element.scrollIntoView in a JavaScript application running in a WKWebView causes the WKWebView component to become unresponsive to clicks.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached Xcode testcase project, which was created with Xcoe 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild the attached project, and run it on an iPhone 6 simulator with iOS 11 Beta (most recently tested with 11.0 15A5341e).\r\n\r\nWhen running, the application shows a list of 5 step. Click on them in sequence. Do not scroll the content within the app - the app does some scrolling itself, to demonstrate the problem. \r\n\r\nThe app also shows a bordered box with a counter in it. Pay attention to what happens with the counter.\r\nNotice what (does not) happen when clicking on step 5.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe click counter increases on step 1, 3 and 5\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe click counter increases on step 1 and 3, but not on step 5. In fact, the other clickable links, and most of the UI is unresponsive at this point.\r\n\r\nRefer to attached Screenshot-1.png. \r\nInspect the web application with Safari Developer Tools. Use the Inspect tool (1) and click on link 5 in the application (2). Notice how this highlights the HTML root element (3), not the DIV you actually clicked on, in the inspector.\r\n\r\nIf you now manually scroll the web page back to top, the links become responsive again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A5341e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem seems to be related to the scrollIntoView JavaScript DOM method. It does not occur with other scroll methods we have tested, such as setting the scrollTop property.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs in all tested iOS 11.0 beta configurations. This does NOT occur in all tested iOS 10.3.1 configurations."
