    description: "Summary:\r\nSome of Xcode's fixits don't seem to place the text that they're supposed to inset at the correct location. For example, foo[index...]->String(foo[index...]) actually becomes fooString([index]), and @objc is placed in some random spot in the file that is not even close to the actual position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Perform one of the fixits above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new text to replace goes in the correct location.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe text is in the wrong location.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)/macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A344b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A344b)"
