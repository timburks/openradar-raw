    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if a Interface Builder warning is introduced, there is no supported way to fail the build entirely. It would be useful if there was an Xcode build setting / ibtool flag for enabling this behavior, similar to `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\r\n2. Create a storyboard\r\n3. In the storyboard add a label\r\n4. Add constraints to the label such that the layout is ambiguous\r\n5. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is some way to make the produced warning fail the build\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA warning is produced, but the build (or archive) succeeds\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached project for an example of an Interface Builder warning that would case a failure in this case"
