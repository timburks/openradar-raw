    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 added a new important privacy feature: NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription (Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description). When the user disables it (Don't Allow, or switches Settings - Privacy - Photos - App - Never), there is no alert, no message, and even no flags (completionWithItemsHandler) reporting the error. It simply fails silently.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Open an UIActivityViewController (3rd party apps).\r\n2 - Use \"Save Image\" (standard action).\r\n3 - Select Don't Allow (or change afterwards in Settings - Privacy).\r\n4 - Repeat \"Save Image\" - it simply fails silently.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIActivityViewController should present an error/message or developer should be able to handle it through activityError reference in completionWithItemsHandler.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nNo error is reported, presented or offered to developer's handlers/completions. This results in a really bad experience and customer support. The user has no way to know that saves are failing because of (new) privacy settings.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5361a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
