    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iOS 11 App Store app, canceling the interactive dismiss edge swipe gesture midway into the swipe can make the navbar while like with apps that don’t have the header image, thus breaking the layout\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iOS 11 App Store\n2. Go to the Apps, Games, or Updates tabs (this bug does not occur from the Today or Search tabs, presumably because those do not use UINavigationControllers with a visible UINavBar)\n3. Open an app’s page with the large header view (example: Streaks app in the US App Store Apps tab today)\n4. Slide from left to go back, but then quit the gesture such that it fails\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page should snap back, and visually be indistinguishable from when it was freshly presented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UINavBar turns white, as does the text within it. Scrolling down to where it should turn white and then scrolling back up does nothing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
