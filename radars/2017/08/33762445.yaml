    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a follow up to rdar://33501166. It seems like there should not be a warning saying the user \"may not\" be able to download the app *if* it is over 100mbs, when in reality they end up downloading a slice that is smaller than that and therefore downloadable over LTE.\n\nThis appears to result in if your app's universal slice is larger than 100mbs, all users an iOS versions that do handle thinning show a warning, even though they won't be affected by this. It's hard to tell if this is the case, or if it's because our thinned version for plus sized iPhones, which is over 100mbs according to iTC (although we don't see the download warning on iOS 10), forces the modal to be shown even for users on non plus devices. In either case, on iOS 11, plus sized devices or not, the app is still downloaded, even though the warning is displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable WiFi on an iOS 11 device\n2. Navigate to the App Store\n3. Download the Lyft app\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app downloads fine over LTE as it does on iOS 10. Without warning the user, and instead checks to first see if the app will actually be able to be downloaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt warns that it may not be able to be downloaded over LTE, even though it still ends up being downloaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
