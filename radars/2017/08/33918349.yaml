    description: "Summary:\r\nThe official core image filter reference hasn’t been updated for over a year: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004346\n\nThe new documentation pages for CIFilter still link to it, and no other reference of this sort exists. This combined with lack of example code in slides or as example apps, and the generally string-y API make it essentially a game of throwing spaghetti on the wall to try to implement newer CoreImage filters.\n\nCIEdgePreserveUpsampleFilter, for example, was introduced with iOS 10. It was mentioned in session 505 last year, and session 508 this year. It’s pretty essential to be able to create depth photography apps\n\nLiterally no information exists about this online. No official docs, nothing on GitHub except header dumps, nothing on Stack Overflow, nothing on Apple dev forums. All Google results are also just parroting the official “What’s New in iOS/tvOS/etc. 10” release notes from last year listing 5 filters\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
