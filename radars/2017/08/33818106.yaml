    description: "I’ve found a really bad regression with MPMusicPlayerController in iOS 11 beta 3 and onward: after calling prepareToPlay the next call to get the nowPlayingItem will hang indefinitely and cause my app (Picky — https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picky-filter-browse-play-your/id497110916?mt=8) to be terminated by the system. I just tested a build that comments out the prepareToPlay call and the hang went away. I imagine this is related to the known issue that’s been listed in the last few betas: (setting the nowPlayerItem property of MPMusicPlayerController does not work (32258814)). Taking out my prepareToPlay call isn’t ideal because I need that to ensure the nowPlayingItem remains present if the media player has been suspended for an extended period.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Call MPMediaPlayer.systemMusicPlayer.prepareToPlay()\r\n* Do something with MPMediaPlayer.systemMusicPlayer.nowPlayingItem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The nowPlayingItem call returns\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n* The nowPlayingItem call never returns and the app is terminated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI tested this with an iPhone 7 Plus\r\n\r\nHere’s the stack trace for the main thread while it’s hung:\r\n\r\n#0\t0x0000000180b69bc4 in mach_msg_trap ()\r\n#1\t0x0000000180b69a3c in mach_msg ()\r\n#2\t0x00000001835a5eb8 in CPDMTwoWayMessage ()\r\n#3\t0x00000001835a42c0 in -[CPDistributedMessagingCenter _sendMessage:userInfoData:oolKey:oolData:makeServer:receiveReply:nonBlocking:error:] ()\r\n#4\t0x00000001835a3d98 in -[CPDistributedMessagingCenter _sendMessage:userInfo:receiveReply:error:toTarget:selector:context:nonBlocking:] ()\r\n#5\t0x00000001835a3ab0 in -[CPDistributedMessagingCenter _sendMessage:userInfo:receiveReply:error:toTarget:selector:context:] ()\r\n#6\t0x00000001835a3970 in -[CPDistributedMessagingCenter sendMessageAndReceiveReplyName:userInfo:error:] ()\r\n#7\t0x0000000191f4ee28 in -[MPServerObjectProxy _performRemoteSelectorAndReceiveReply:userInfo:timeout:] ()\r\n#8\t0x0000000191f4e980 in -[MPServerObjectProxy forwardInvocation:] ()\r\n#9\t0x0000000181076414 in ___forwarding___ ()\r\n#10\t0x0000000180f5c35c in _CF_forwarding_prep_0 ()\r\n#11\t0x0000000191f23da8 in -[MPMusicPlayerController nowPlayingItem] ()"
