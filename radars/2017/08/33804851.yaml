    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are filing this report to ask for clarity about some iTunes Connect dashboard information/changes, as well as Apple policies about download sizes.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, our app's build size has started growing larger than 100MB, according to the Compressed File Size in the Build Information section of our uploaded iOS builds. Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing the trend. These get flagged with a yellow warning icon, and a message appears with the text \"The variant for one or more device types exceeds the 100 MB download size limit.\". It seems like once the 100 MB limit is crossed, the app should require wifi-only downloads.\r\n\r\nHowever, at least from our testing during this same period, we've never had any trouble downloading our app over cellular, and we're not able to find official Apple documentation about this discrepancy between warning and behavior. We assume the app slices are okay to download.\r\n\r\nSo we're writing seeking out some clarifying information:\r\n\r\n1. Does the \"Compressed File Size\" that shows on the dashboard represent the compressed build size + Apple's encryption on top of it? Which version of the binary is being displayed, is it the Universal IPA? We used to be able to see compressed file sizes for each Device Type, but now can only see the single Compressed File Size value and the individual Install Sizes. Is there any way to see how large each compressed + encrypted build would be per Device Type?\r\n\r\n2. When we see the warning, is it likely that just the universal binary is above the limit, and other app thinned binaries are below the limit (even post-encryption), which is why we're able to download over cellular? And we just haven't encountered a device trying to load the universal binary? How would we force a device to download the universal binary if we wanted to test it?\r\n\r\n3. Up until the previous week, we had never received email warnings about the download limit. Last week we started receiving them for our builds, even ones that were the same size as previous builds that had been uploaded to iTunes Connect without any warnings. Is this email just a new iTunes Connect policy? A change for the upcoming iOS release? Or is there some reason we were not seeing them before?\r\n\r\n4. Possible display bug. For certain of our builds, the display size is drastically different from what appears to be the general size trend. For instance, our app's 3.9.1 and 3.9.0 builds are roughly 60% the size as normal, whereas our 3.7.3 builds are almost twice as large as normal. There were no drastic changes or alterations on our end that account for such large discrepancies. Are these just display bugs?\r\n\r\nIf you could provide us with the answers to these questions, it would definitely help us understand the system and make better plans going forward! Thank you!"
