    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode’s auto completion for image literals stops working when a non [A-Za-z0-9] character is typed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag an image into your Xcode project that contains dashes in the name, ie `my-great-image.png`\n2. In the Xcode source editor, try to assign a new image literal using the filename you just added, ie `my-` - the `-` is important.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode’s source editor continues to show auto-completion options once the `-` is typed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode’s source editor shows auto-completion options until the `-` character is typed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
