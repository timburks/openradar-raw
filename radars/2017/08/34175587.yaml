    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an HTML5 player (like youtube has). If we embed this player in an WKWebView to be displayed in a UICollectionView with autoplay, we are experiencing an unexpected behaviour (please see the video attached). In a nutshell, on iOS 10.3.3 everything looks fine, but on iOS 11 Beta (15A5368a) and the simulator, if the user stop scrolling in the middle of the cell, and even if we set manually the frame of the WKWebView, it doesn't take it in account and give to our HTML5 player as Container dimensions the visible portion of the UICollectionViewCell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch the app on iOS 11.0.\r\nScroll down through blue, white, red cells.\r\nUntil you reached a black cell, a video player should start into it.\r\nScroll down to hide the player cell.\r\nScroll up and stop scrolling in the middle of the player cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKWebView's height should be equal to the manually setup frame\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDepending where the scroll is stopped, WKWebView's frame manually setup is ignored and only visible portion of the cell is taken for layer rendering.(i.e the HTML5 player is then reduced based on this wrong frame)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.0 Developer Preview (Beta) / 15A5368a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the video attached for side by side demo iOS 10 vs 11\r\nSample project also attached for debugging purpose.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not occur on iOS 10.3.3\r\nOccurs on iOS 11.0"
