    description: "Area:\r\nServer (macOS Server)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNetBooting a client against an NBI made with SIU against 10.13 beta7 (17A352a) results in a hang on the progress bar during the boot sequence.  A verbose boot shows the following failures on screen:\r\n - AppleKextExcludeList.kext has invalid signatures: Trust cache is disabled.\r\n - Kext rejected due to invalid sigatures\r\n - Can't load /System/Library/Filesystems/AppleShare/asp_tcp.kext - authentication problems\r\n - /System/Library/Filesystems/AppleShare/asp_tcp.kext failed to load - (lib kern/ketx) authentication failure (file ownership/permisions).\r\n - Error in security framework, error -67674\r\n - Kext rejected due to invalid sigatures\r\n - Can't load /System/Library/Filesystems/AppleShare/afpfs.kext - authentication problems\r\n - /System/Library/Filesystems/AppleShare/afpfs.kext failed to load - (lib kern/ketx) authentication failure (file ownership/permisions).\r\n - Error in security framework, error -67674\r\n\r\nThe boot never completes. I can use the same environment and boot the same client to a 10.11 NBI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a NetBoot NBI against 10.13 beta 7 (17A352a) - no custom settings besides the user account.\r\nSetup the NBI on the server to use NFS, no model restrictions, and boot diskless.\r\nConfigure a client to boot from the NBI and start the boot process.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe client would boot up to the NBI.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe boot process hangs. During a verbose boot the data on screen hints at kext issues.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13 beta 7 (17A352a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n10.11 diskless NBIs hosted via NFS from the same server boot without issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 - Server.app version 5.3.1\r\nClient is a MacBookPro9,2\r\nNBI created macOS 10.13.0b7 (17A352a)\r\nNBI available over NFS, no model restrictions, Index = 123, \"Make this image available for diskless booting\" is checked."
