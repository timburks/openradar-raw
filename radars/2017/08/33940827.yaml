    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a split view, with both master and detail view controllers being the root of navigation controllers.\r\n\r\nMaster has the new large titles enabled, detail has not.\r\n\r\nWhen the master pushes a new view controller from code, the animation doesn't happen smoothly, but jumps at the end (see attached video). Pop animations seem to be fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Launch the attached project on an iPhone\r\n- Tap on the plus bottom in the top right\r\n- Tap on the new cell\r\n- Observe how the navigation bar jumps at the end of the push animation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnimation should be smooth.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAnimation doesn't happen smoothly and jumps at the end.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 6 (15A5354b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI noticed that sometimes showing a detail view controller from storyboard is fine (e.g. when you create a new project in Xcode 9 and select \"Master-Detail App\"), although in my large project something similar happens in one instance even when using storyboards.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on devices where split view controller is collapsed."
