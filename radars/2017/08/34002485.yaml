    description: "The asset catalog compiler command line tool (actool)'s man page is very outdated. According to the footer, it hasn't been updated since December 2011. This is an issue for us at The Qt Company / Qt Project because we invoke actool ourselves instead of relying entirely on Xcode for the development and deployment of macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications.\r\n\r\nIt's clear from the (documented) build options in Xcode that the IDE passes several undocumented command line flags to actool as shown in the build logs, which look like they should be documented and may be particularly relevant to us. In fact, we use several of them in our new build tool despite them being effectively undocumented. It would be nice if the man page was updated so we know which flags are clearly meant for public use.\r\n\r\nA few examples include:\r\n--product-type (PRODUCT_TYPE) - clear what it is, but would be nice to know WHY actool needs this when run under Xcode\r\n--enable-incremental-distill (ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_DISTILL) - no idea what this even does, why is it documented in Xcode?\r\n--compress-pngs (COMPRESS_PNG_FILES) - no longer shown in Xcode UI, but always enabled, so we do it too\r\n--enable-on-demand-resources (ENABLE_ON_DEMAND_RESOURCES)\r\n--optimization (ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION)\r\n--filter-for-device-model (ENABLE_ONLY_ACTIVE_RESOURCES)\r\n--filter-for-device-os-version (ENABLE_ONLY_ACTIVE_RESOURCES)\r\n--sticker-pack-identifier-prefix (ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_STICKER_PACK_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun `man actool`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll relevant options are documented\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe man page was last updated in 2011 and newer options are missing"
