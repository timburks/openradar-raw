    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAny RAW photo taken with a Canon EOS 80D that is converted to DNG with Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop or the standalone Adobe DNG Converter appears to have a purple overlay over the entire image when viewed with an application that uses the Apple Digital Camera RAW Engine\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a photo with a Canon EOS 80D with quality set to RAW\r\nImport photo to any computer (macOS or Windows)\r\nConvert photo to DNG with Adobe DNG Converter\r\nView photo on macOS using Preview or any other app using the built in RAW engine\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDNG version of the image appears the same as the CR2 version\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nDNG version of the image appears to have a pink or purple overlay over the entire image, as if the colour calibration is completely incorrect\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6 (16G29) (Also occurs on iOS 10.3.3 and iOS 11)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI noticed a caveat on the Digital camera RAW format compatibility support article mentioning that the Canon EOS 80D RAW files are supported with Canon RAW format only, so I'd assume this is a known issue, however this does not help my thousands of Canon EOS 80D photos I only have as DNG (I have switched to CR2 going forward). This issue presumably also affecting the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II based on the support document is concerning as it is a professional camera. Attached are some sample CR2 files, converted DNG files, and screenshots of the behaviour (using QuickView, although the issue also occurs in Preview and Photos)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue only occurs with the Canon EOS 80D with macOS. Issue does not occur on Windows, nor with the Canon EOS 750D, and does not occur if I use Adobe applications or Darktable to view the file."
