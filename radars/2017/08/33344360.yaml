    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis is a feature suggestion. There should be a hint if there are login but disabled accounts when opening Mail. Now there are just new login options.\r\n\r\nWhat I encountered:\r\nI've added Google account to iOS but disabled mail, only enabled calendar and contacts.\r\n\r\nWhen I open Mail, I can only see new login options. After I login with the same account, Mail tells me the account already login. I think this can be improved by provide a hint about disabled accounts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- For new device (no mail accounts setup before)\r\n- Login to a mail account in Settings. Ex. Google.\r\n- Disable the account for Mail\r\n- Open Mail app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail tells me I have account disabled, along with new login options\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nMail shows new login options\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11. But this is behavior is exist for years.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
