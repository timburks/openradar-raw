Setting keyboardAppearance on UITextField via UIAppearance works fine as well. The assertion only happens with UITextView. Setting keyboardAppearance directly, without using UIAppearance, on UITextView works fine as well.\n\nThis apparently also only happens if there is a text view in the view hierarchy. When not adding the text view in ViewController.swift in the attached sample project, the assertion is not triggered.\n\nTested on Xcode 8.3.3 + 9b5 / iOS 9, 10, 11b5 on Simulator and device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached sample project in Xcode 8 or 9.\n- Run it on any device or Simulator\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo assertion is triggered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAssertion in UIAppearance.m is triggered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9/10/11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee AppDelegate.swift/ViewController.swift for the UIAppearance/UITextView setup."
