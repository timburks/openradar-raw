    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, the way image literals are displayed in the Xcode source editor makes it impossible to tell which image literal is being used, or even to edit it once it’s in situ. \n\nThey don’t appear to be useful or usable in any context outside playgrounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In any Swift source file in an Xcode project, assign an image literal to a variable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe inline representation of the image literal lets me edit which image it’s pointing to.\n\nXcode’s source editor should also show a meaningful inline representation/preview of the image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe literal cannot be edited in Xcode. It must be deleted and recreated from scratch.\n\nEvery instance also shows the same tiny illustration of a mountain range.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.0 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
