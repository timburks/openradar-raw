    description: "Summary:\r\nWe've encountered a regression between XCode Beta 5 and Beta 6 where we are no longer able to profile our project. Then we created a fresh project and were unable to profile that either.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a fresh iOS Application project (project attached)\r\n- Run \"Profile\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to use Instruments to profile my application\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app launches and fails instantly. Instruments says \"Target failed to run. Permission to debug [app bundle] was denied.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 9 / Beta 6, macOS Sierra 10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis project was simply created from the new project menu. There is nothing we have added or modified about it."
