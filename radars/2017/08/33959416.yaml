    description: "Summary:\r\nTestFlight app should support Universal Links for accepting beta invitations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive an iOS app beta test invitation via an email from TestFlight\n2. Click the blue ‘View in TestFlight’ button in the email.\n3. Go through the steps to redeem it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLink should be a Universal Link handled by the TestFlight app.\nTapping it on an iOS device would therefore open the TestFlight app directly.\nIt would then confirm whether you want to redeem the invitation with the currently signed in account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLink opens in Safari.\nThe most practical next step is to act on the third step first and copy the code.\nThen either navigate to TestFlight via search or home screen, or if you’re lazy tap the link to the App Store then tap the link there to open TestFlight.\nTap redeem in the top corner.\nPaste the code.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
