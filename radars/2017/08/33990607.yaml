    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen switching to emoji keyboard by long-pressing the emoji key to bring up the keyboard picker, and then selecting Emoji, the app does not receive any notifications. This makes it hard (impossible?) to respond to changes in the keyboard size. If I simply tap the emoji key, the notifications arrive as expected.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when switching to a different keyboard (in my case, back from Emoji to Norwegian), notifications are received.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single-view iOS app using Xcode 9. Add a text field to the view controller in the storyboard.\r\n2. In ViewController's viewDidLoad, register as observer for the UIKeyboard{Did,Will}Show, UIKeyboard{Did,Will}ChangeFrame notifications and log these events.\r\n3. Deploy to a device (iPhone 6 in my case) running iOS 11 beta 6.\r\n4. Tap the text field to bring up the keyboard.\r\n5. Notice how the keyboard notifications do occur.\r\n6. Long-press the emoji key to bring up the keyboard picker and choose Emoji. This keyboard is larger than the normal keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the notifications to be received by the app as they were in iOS 10.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe keyboard is resized but the app doesn't get notified.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0 (15A5354b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn iOS 10 I get notifications regardless of how the Emoji keyboard is selected."
