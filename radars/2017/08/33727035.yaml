    description: "Area:\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn the first boot of macOS High Sierra, the user is asked to log in with their Apple ID. However, if Wi-Fi had been turned off before the upgrade or installation, the connection wizard will freeze/hang.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install macOS High Sierra.\r\n2. Before the set-up reboots your Mac, while still in the old system, disable Wi-Fi from the menu bar icon.\r\n3. Wait until the installation is done and the first-run wizard appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmacOS should detect that Wi-Fi has been turned off, and ask the user if they would like to turn it back on, in order to sign in with their Apple ID.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAfter choosing the sign-in option for Apple ID, the first-run wizard will freeze.\r\nThe only way to continue working is to hard-reset the Mac by holding the Power button for longer than 5 seconds and powering it back on afterwards.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13 Developer Beta (17A315i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see attached what the wizard looks like when it freezes. Taking the screenshot was still possible.\r\nPlease note: The progress spinner icon is not animated in this window."
