    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn the 9.7\" & 10.5\" iPad, using a VC's view as an input view, the view is dropped/moved from the view hierarchy after resizing multitasking panes. If using a UIView that is not owned by a VC, the input view works as expected.\r\n\r\nNote: this issue does _not_ happen on the 12\" iPad's. \r\nProject demonstrating bug is here: https://github.com/bummytime/InputViewTest\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTest this on the iPad 9.7\" or 10.5\" device/sim:\r\n\r\n1) Instantiate a UIViewController and assign it's view as the inputView on a UITextField.\r\n2) During runtime tap the text field so it becomes 1st responder. InputView will appear as expected.\r\n3) Swipe in a secondary app pane and anchor it. Input view will disappear and reappear (expected). When the input view reappears here, the VC's view is not in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nAlternative Flow:\r\n1) Already In multitasking mode, tap the textfield again. Input view appears as expected. \r\n2) Resize the multitasking panes. Input view will disappear and reappear (expected).\r\n3) When the input view reappears here, the VC's view is not in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe VC's view should not be dropped from the view hierarchy after any multitasking user activity.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe VC's view is no longer in the view hierarchy. The keyboard displays an empty grey rect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.3.3 and iOS 11 Beta 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDemo project is located here:https://github.com/bummytime/InputViewTest (also attaching it to this bug report).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDevice and Sim (7.9\", 9.7\", and 10.5\" iPads only). This issue does NOT occur on 12.9\" iPads. In addition, I tested this on iOS 11 Beta 7 and saw similar issues."
