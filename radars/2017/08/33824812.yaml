    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen (e.g.) scanning for peripherals on a `CBCentralManager` that is not powered-on one gets a warning in the console:\n\n```\nCoreBluetooth [API MISUSE]  can only accept commands while in the powered on state\n```\n\nThere are in fact over a dozen of methods on `CBCentralManager`, `CBPeripheralManager`, `CBPeripheral` that emit these console warnings.\n\nIt would be much more useful if there was an internal method that one could place a breakpoint on for debugging, similar to how things work with malloc:\n\n```\nmalloc: * error for object 0xc6a3970: pointer being freed was not allocated * set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug.\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse any of the Methods in CoreBluetooth while in an invalid state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect availability of breakpoint target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSadness.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
