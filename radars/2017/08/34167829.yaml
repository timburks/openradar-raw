    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading our builds to testflight, with no changes to our Siri AppIntentVocabulary.plist, we've started getting these warning messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"Call a Lyft\" was not classified as a INRequestRideIntent intent\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is part of our main target, and has this phrase, along with a few others, in the correct keys according to the documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with Siri support\r\n2. Add a custom AppIntentVocabulary.plist with custom phrases\r\n3. Build and upload it to testflight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are no warnings, as there haven't been for the past 6 months or so\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe get this warning\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Our plist hasn't changed for the past few months\r\n- We have 5 custom phrases but this is the only one in the error message\r\n- The plist is in our main target, and localized for english (not base)"
