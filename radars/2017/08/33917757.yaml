    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a playground in Xcode within the context of a project, the playground does not automatically show itâ€™s live view in the assistant editor. To open it one has to OPTION-CLICK the live view under the little related files button in the jump bar. This required finicky mouse/trackpad interaction. Suggestion: a keyboard shortcut would improve speed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project that contains a playground\n2. Open the playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a keyboard short cut to show the associated live view in assistant editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such keyboard short cut.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn addition toggling the assistant editor via the assistant editor button when there is currently no assistant editor shown should show the live view by default, when having a playground open."
