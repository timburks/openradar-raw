    description: "Area:\r\nActivity\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn Apple Watch, it is often common to perform exercise near the end of the day to \"close rings\". Occasionally this activity takes place very close to midnight, and it can often lead to situations where the number of calories burned barely meets the day's requirements. Unfortunately, there appears to be a small issue here where the real value for the number calories burned is not consistent with the displayed value in the Activity appâ€“since it is refreshed once every couple minutes, it will be a bit lower than the real value. This can lead to strange results like the Activity app showing, at 12:02 AM, that the goal from yesterday was not met, but then \"receiving new calories\" from the day before, leading to it showing that the goal was met when checked at 12:03 AM. This can lead to considerable distress from users who believed they might not have met their goal when in reality they were able to. I see how frequent updates can be detrimental to battery life, but I'd like to suggest that you temporarily increase this update frequency if the user is close to their goal near midnight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Come reasonably close to your day's calorie goal near midnight (for example, 20 calories short at 11:55 PM).\r\n2. Start exercising so that you're on track to meet your goal by midnight.\r\n3. Check the number of calories you've burned at 12:01 AM the following day (you'll need to open the Weekly Summary in the Activity app to do this).\r\n4. Check a couple minutes later, for example at 12:05 AM.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Weekly Summary will show that the goal was met at step 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe Weekly Summary will only show the goal was met in step 4, due to the calories burned in the last couple minutes being propagated to the UI.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport Series 2 running watchOS 3.2.3 (14V5751a)"
