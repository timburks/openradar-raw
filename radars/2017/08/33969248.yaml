    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 10.1.x running macOS 10.12.x, if a user attempts to print a webpage at a scaled value that is greater than 100%, the content no longer properly flows from one page to the next. Instead, images and text will be chopped, as it seems that Safari is trying to use two pages to print the content at the enlarged width, rather than reflowing the content to all fit within a single page at the enlarged scale. Google Chrome does not exhibit this same bug under macOS 10.12.x at this time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLoad any webpage in Safari\r\nAttempt to print loaded content scaled to any value greater than 100%\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrint preview, printed output, and saved PDF will reflow from one page to the next.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nPrint preview, printed output, and saved PDF will be cut between pages, cutting images and text. (see attachments)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 10.1.2, macOS 10.12.16"
