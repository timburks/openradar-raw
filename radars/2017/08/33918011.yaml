    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be very convenient if there were a menu option to simulate the iOS Simulator being disconnected from the network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Simulator\r\n2. Attempt to simulate an offline scenario\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a menu item for it, either in the Simulator menu, or in the Xcode Debug menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to either (1) disconnect your entire macOS, or (2) use the network link conditioner which also affects your entire system. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would also be handy when debugging an App on the device. Same as with the simulator, currently one has to do this system wide, or create an in app option for it. It could be a menu item under the Debug menu of Xcode."
