    description: "Summary:\r\nApple's News app offers 3 actions on iOS when it sends a push notification: Read Story, Save for Later, and Share. However the same notification when displayed in watchOS has only one action: Save for Later, because you can't read or share from the watch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no API available to 3rd party developers to modify the actions available on a per-OS basis. So we are left with the decision to either limit notification actions to those that can be executed on a watch, or give our iOS users a better experience but have actions in watch notifications that are no-ops.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRegister UNNotificationActions for a UNNotificationCategory\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to specify actions or categories that are specific to each platform\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe same actions are associated with push notifications on both iOS and watchOS\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI pointed this out in a DTS ticket, and they responded with the following:\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Apple Developer Technical Support (DTS). Our engineers have reviewed your request and have concluded that there is no supported way to achieve the desired functionality given the currently shipping system configurations."
