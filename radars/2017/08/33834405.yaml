    description: "Area:\r\nReplayKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAlthough the broadcast upload extension (NSExtensionPointIdentifier: com.apple.broadcast-services-upload) can function as a screen recorder, the user-facing language that the OS presents to the user assumes a \"broadcast\".\r\n\r\nThis can be disorienting for users who are expecting to use the extension for some kind of screen recording but instead see a message like \"Start Broadcast\".\r\n\r\nCould some kind of method or { get } property be added to RPBroadcastSampleHandler that lets the extension indicate its intent to the OS for either broadcasting or recording the samples? It could be something as simple as returning an enumerated value (like the way UIViewController. preferredStatusBarStyle does).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the attached SuperCoolCapture project to install the SuperCoolCapture app and associated \"Recorder\" extension on an iOS 11 device. (The project is empty boilerplate with a few of the bundle display names changed.)\r\n- Install the Screen Recording button into your Control Center if it's not already installed.\r\n- Bring up the Control Center.\r\n- 3D touch the Screen Recording button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The Screen Recording control shows some localized equivalent of \"Start Recording\" when the \"Super Cool Recorder\" is selected.\r\n- After Recording starts, the control shows some localized equivalent of \"Stop Recording\".\r\n- While recording, exiting the Command Center and tapping on the red status bar at the top shows an alert with some localized equivalent of \"Screen Recording: Stop recording screen with Super Cool Recorder\"\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\n- The Screen Recording control shows some localized equivalent of \"Start Broadcasting\" when the \"Super Cool Recorder\" is selected.\r\n- After the recording starts, the control shows some localized equivalent of \"Stop Broadcasting\".\r\n- While recording, exiting the Command Center and tapping on the red status bar at the top shows an alert with some localized equivalent of \"Screen Broadcasting: Stop broadcasting screen with Super Cool Recorder\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n- iOS 11 beta 5 (15A5341f)\r\n- Xcode 9 beta 5 (9M202q)"
