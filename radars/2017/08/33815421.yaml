    description: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI noticed my laptops fans had revved up, and noticed two \"Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool\" processes each at 150%, and had been running for awhile.\r\n\r\nAttached to this (hopefully) are two samples taken from Activity Monitor.  Also attached is a screenshot. And the storyboard.\r\n\r\nWhat may have triggered it was this sequence of events (I haven't tried to repro yet):\r\n\r\n* Edit a file\r\n* Cmd-shift-O to go to the storyboard. Make an edit.\r\n* Cmd-shift-O to go to another file.  Remembered I forgot to save. (thanks to rdar://33393295, I've lost lots of data, so I really hammer the cmd-S these days)\r\n* Go back a history in the editor (command-control-left-arrow)\r\n* Before the editor fully reloaded, cmd-S and then return with command-control-right arrow\r\n\r\nI've got a sysdiagnose, but it'll take a long time to upload, so filing this now with the smaller attachments, and will add a dropbox link (because rdar://30364703)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nsee summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome ranchers have seen ibtool lockups with Cocoa desktop projects in b4. Dunno if there's any relationship.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
