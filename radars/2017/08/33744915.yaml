    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen moving a non-folder group from one folder-group A to another folder-group B, Xcode moves the entire originating folder A to folder B.\n\nThis breaks the build on the project, because the original folder and file references in the project are lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start new project.\n2. Create a group ‘SomeFiles’ with a Folder.\n3. Add a file in the group ‘SomeFiles’.\n4. Create a group ‘SomeOtherFiles’ with a Folder.\n5. Create a file in the group ‘SomeOtherFiles’.\n6. Prepare some data files in the project root folder. Don’t add them to the project yet.\n7. Create a ‘Group without a Folder’ named ‘Data’ in the group ‘SomeFiles’.\n8. Add the data files to the group ‘Data’ without copying them. Uncheck ‘Copy items if needed’.\n9. Move the folder ‘Data’ from the group ‘SomeFiles’ to the group ‘SomeOtherFiles’.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n*The group ‘Data’ with its contents gets moved to the group ‘SomeOtherFiles’.\n* No other changes are made to the project and folder structure.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* ✅ The group ‘Data’ with its contents gets moved to the group ‘SomeOtherFiles’.\n* ❌ The entire folder ‘SomeFiles’ is moved to the folder ‘SomeOtherFiles’\n* ❌ Because the folder ‘SomeFiles’ along with the file ‘SomeFile’ has moved, the project loses the reference. The project wouldn’t compile anymore.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 4 (9M189t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdded a .zip with an example Xcode project. It includes the git repository with a 'before' and 'after' commit and two screenshots illustrating the folder structure 'before' and 'after'."
