    description: "When validating a receipt against the validateReceipt endpoint, we receive a JSON response containing a new section called \"pending renewal info\". This section seems to include an entry for every original transaction ID of a subscription that exists in the latest receipt info section. However, while the latest receipt info includes the transaction and original transaction IDs, the entries in the latest receipt info do not which makes it very difficult to match a pending renewal info entry to the right receipt transaction.\r\nSpecifically, if the latest receipt info includes 2 subscriptions with the same product ID (purchased one after the other), we can't tell which pending renewal info entry belongs to which transaction.\r\nGiven the above summary my question is: Is there an educated way to match a pending renewal info to a transaction? Why not already return a response that includes the transaction ID and the original transaction ID in the pending renewal info entries?\r\n\r\nNew fields reference:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW20\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nValidate a receipt that includes an auto-renewable subscription with the validateReceipt endpoint. Better to use a receipt that has 2 subscriptions purchased under it with the same product ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe JSON response includes a pending_renewal_info section with as many number of entries as there are original transaction IDs of auto-renewable subscriptions in the latest receipt info. If there are 2 distinct original transactions with the same product ID, the pending renewal info section will include 2 entries with the same product ID. I expect those entries to include 2 more fields - transaction_id and original_transaction_id of the transaction they correspond to.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe JSON response includes a pending_renewal_info section with as many number of entries as there are original transaction IDs of auto-renewable subscriptions in the latest receipt info. If there are 2 distinct original transactions with the same product ID, the pending renewal info section will include 2 entries with the same product ID."
