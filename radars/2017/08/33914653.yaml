    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile using the beta is noticed that my hard drive kept running out of space. Every time I cleared more space, I would be out of space again within a few hours. I ran daisy disk and tracked down a lot of large files. All of the files are inside directories named \"(A Document Being Saved By Xcode X)\" where X is an incrementing number every time a new one is created. The folders containing the files are located in the directory at path \"/private/var/folders/fn/zl6yy3ln68q26v7x_xn4ncsr0000gn/T/TemporaryItems\"\r\n\r\nThe file it creates is called \"dyld_shared_cache_arm64\" and is always exactly 1.07GB, but has a unique md5 hash every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install and use Xcode 9 beta 5\r\n2. Observe hard drive filling up\r\n3. Browse to directory listed above and see that Xcode has been creating a new 1.07GB file every few minutes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should not create endless new large files\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode consumes my entire hard drive space until everything stops responding and I have to reboot and clear files.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.0 beta 5 (9M202q)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
