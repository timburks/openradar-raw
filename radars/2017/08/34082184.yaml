    description: "** Steps to Reproduce\r\nThere is no direct way to duplicate a selection of lines of codes in Xcode.\r\n\r\n** Expected Results\r\nXcode should include a command to duplicate lines of codes.\r\n- either the lines that are currently selected\r\n- on the one line which the text cursor is on\r\n\r\nThis could be attached to the \"Duplicate\" command and its current Command-D shortcut.\r\n\r\n** Observed Results\r\nSuch a command does not exist.\r\nDuplicating lines requires selecting the lines up to their end, then copy and paste.\r\n- This is a tedious process\r\n- The content of the Pasteboard is lost\r\n\r\nEvery serious code editor that I know does provide such a command, along with a \"Delete Line\" command.\r\n\r\n** Xcode Version/Build & macOS Version/Build\r\n Xcode 9, but also every other previous versions of Xcode."
