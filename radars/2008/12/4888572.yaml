    description: "18-Dec-2006 04:17 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen Internet Sharing is turned on, Mac OS X always assigns the same IP addresses to the interfaces used to share Internet access, regardless if that IP is already used by another client's NI or if an interface has already a manual IP address assigned to it.\r\nThis implementation is bound to cause collisions with the default settings in a large number of consumer routers and with settings in a large number of LAN subnets since the IPs ranges used by Internet Sharing is very common (192.168.2.x for Ethernet interface and 10.0.2.x for AirPort interface).\r\nInternet Sharing should use something odd (or better, random, or best of all, probed to avoid duplication) to minimize the risk of collision.\r\nInternet Sharing should also respect and use the manual IP addresses already assigned to the interfaces or ask the user the authorization to change those settings.\r\nThe actual IP address should always be visible in the System's Network preference pane of the interface, too. At the moment, the last assigned IP is shown, even if it has been automatically changed by turning on Internet Sharing."
