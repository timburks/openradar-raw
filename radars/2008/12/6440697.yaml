    description: "Summary: \r\nSearch fields created in HTML (using Dashcode, hand coding or any other method) are not rendered in a consistent way in Safari for iPhone and iPod Touch:\r\n\r\n- The magnifying glass and drop-down for history access is absent\r\n- The input field has no \"clear\" button on the right hand side\r\n- The field does not have the same kind of rounded corners as a native search field\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create any input HTML tag with type=\"search\"\r\n2. View on mobile Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- Search fiend rendering and interaction should be consistent with the desktop version of Safari.\r\n\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\n\r\n- A curved text field with identical look and functionality to the native Cocoa Touch should be displayed, allowing users to pick from recent queries, clear last queries, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- A vanilla text field (indistinguishable from any other input) was displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Since iPhone 1.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis hampers usability of web applications and forces ugly workarounds with additional images and JavaScript to provide appropriate visual cues (otherwise users cannot figure out that it is a search field)."
