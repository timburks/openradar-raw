    description: "30-Nov-2008 01:32 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's not possible to remotely install \"Safari 3.2.1 for Leopard\" [1] on Mac OS X Leopard Server using Server Admin.app 10.5.3 (279.1.1).\r\n[1] <http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safari_3_2_1_for_Leopard>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure that the server doesn't automatically download the update and eventually uncheck the \"Download important updates automatically\" in Server Preferences.app --> Software Update --> Scheduled Check.\r\n2. Open Server Admin and connect to an unpatched Mac with OS X 10.5.5 Server.\r\n3. Go to the Server Updates pane.\r\n4. Try to install \"Safari 3.2.1 for Leopard\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe security update should correctly download and install.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe download completes then the installation gets stuck showing \"Unknown (75.18%)\" in the Status column.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Mac OS Server on which I tried to install the update is running on a PPC machine (Power Mac G5 2x2GHz) and it's in Advanced configuration mode.\r\nI connected to the server over the network (i.e. I wasn't physically sitting in front of the server's screen).\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Sep-2009 10:25 PM YVONNE  VILLA  :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nIf this is reproducible with 10A222 or later, then please provide a /var/log/install.log and a sample of the softwareupdate process.  Thanks!!\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Sep-2009 01:40 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nFeel free to mark the bug with the \"Insufficient Information\" state, I didn't save the install log the time I had this issue and it's not relevant anymore.\r\nThat said, I got the point and will save the install.log file and a sample of the softwareupdate process the next time I'll face an installation bug like this.\r\nBest regards."
