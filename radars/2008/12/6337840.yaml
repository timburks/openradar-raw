    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a UIView is added to a UIWindow using -[window addSubview:], the associated UIViewController will set the UIWindow's delegate using -[UIWindow setDelegate:]. If this UIViewController loads further subcontrollers, those subcontrollers may also call -[UIWindow setDelegate:].\r\n\r\nIf the original UIViewController's view is then removed from the UIWindow using -[view removeFromSuperview], the removed UIViewController will not call -[UIWindow setDelegate:] to reset the delegate.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because -[UIView viewWillMoveToWindow:] checks the current window delegate, finds that the delegate does not match the to-be-removed UIViewController, and does not set the delegate.\r\n\r\nIf a delegate event occurs before a new view controller is added to the window, the UIWindow will attempt to send a message to a potentially deallocated UIViewController via its now-stale _delegate instance variable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have attached an example application which replicates this problem using the UIImagePicker view:\r\n\r\n1) Run the application and click on \"Take a picture\". The UIImagePicker's view is added to the UIWindow, setting the UIWindow's delegate.\r\n2) Select an available photo album and a picture. In image editing mode, select \"Choose\". In selecting the image editing view, a new UIWindow delegate is set.\r\n4) Once you have selected \"Choose\", a black screen will now appear -- the UIImagePicker delegate removed the original UIImagePicker from the UIWindow, leaving the now invalid delegate reference.\r\n5) Rotate the device to trigger a notification that will result in the UIWindow sending a notification to its delegate. This delegate reference is invalid, and the application should now crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIWindow _delegate instance variable should be set to nil regardless of the method used to add the UIImagePicker delegate to the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe delegate is not set to nil.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing -[UIViewController presentModalViewController:] sets an internal UIViewController instance variable (isPerformingModalTransition), which causes sub view controllers to -not- set the UIWindow delegate."
