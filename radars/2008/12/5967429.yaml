    description: "STR:\r\n- Make sure your Mac is set to 24-hour time\r\n- Take an NSDatePicker that is set to show only time\r\n- Make sure the NSDatePicker's value is 01:00\r\n- Select the hour and type 1 and then 0\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nThe date picker should end up being 10:00\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nThe date picker first changes to 11:00, then to 00:00\r\n\r\nSame happens for 02:00 -> type 2, type 4 -> gives 04:00, not 24:00 as expected, and the same also happens for the \"minutes\" section. This is inconsistent with all other text fields on the Mac.\r\n\r\nRequested fix:\r\nThe algorithm should be changed to always remove the lefttmost digit and add a new digit on the right of the selected two digits. I.e.\r\n\r\n01:05 -> type 1: 11:05 -> type 0: 10:05\r\n\r\nand the likes."
