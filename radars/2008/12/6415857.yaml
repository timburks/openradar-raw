    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nWhen selecting \"Other…\" for Code Signing Identity, if a provision has been set it can be hard to un-set it. If you delete the UUID for the provision entirely and save, only your changes to the certificate name are actually saved. If you delete the UUID but leave the linebreak in place, then the provision changes are also saved.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open an iPhone project\r\n2. Edit project settings\r\n3. Select a valid provision/cert combo for Code Signing Identity\r\n4. Select Other… for Code Signing Identity\r\n5. Delete the second line (with the UUID), including the linebreak\r\n6. Hit OK\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nThe provision info should be removed from the current Code Signing Identity setting\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe provision info is left assigned. Only the cert name is changed."
