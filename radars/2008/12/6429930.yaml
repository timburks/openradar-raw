    description: "Summary: \r\nOn PPC, 10.5.5's firewall does not automatically allow essential services as it is supposed to, breaking network connectivity that relies on DHCP.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable \"Allow only essential services\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConnecting to a network via DHCP will work normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe firewall blocks processes that are required to negotiate an IP address via DHCP, as well as other essential services. These include: mDNSResponder, configd, nmblookup etc.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorkaround: with \"Set access for specific services and applications\" chosen, Leopard's firewall prompts you to allow connections to the daemon processes required for DHCP, Bonjour etc. to operate correctly (this may also be considered part of the bug, as I think the services in question should automatically be allowed with this setting). However, non-technical users may not understand what these do and choose to block them and thus the problem may persist.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAppears to affect only PPC machines (discovered the bug on two different PowerBook G4s)."
