    description: The problem of locale-dependent phone number formatting is a huge one for any single developer or company, and given that this would be a frequently used tool and that there already exists at least a partial implementation in the undocumented UIKit functions UIFormattedPhoneNumberFromString() and UIFormattedPhoneNumberFromStringWithCountry(), it would be great to either have these functions completed and exposed for developer usage or some other equal solution added for our use.
