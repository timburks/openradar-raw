    description: "28-Dec-2008 03:52 PM Vincent Gable:\r\nSummary: \r\n@encode(long double) and @encode(double) both result in \"d\", when building for 32-bit x86.  But a long double is not the same as a double.  sizeof(long double) = 16; sizeof(double) = 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNSLog(@\"sizeof(double) = %d @encode(double) = %s\", sizeof(double), @encode(double));\r\nNSLog(@\"sizeof(long double) = %d, @encode(long double) = %s\", sizeof(long double), @encode(long double));\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nif sizeof(long double) != sizeof(double), I expected @encode(double) to be distinct from @encode(long double).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n@encode(long double) and @encode(double) both were \"d\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown."
