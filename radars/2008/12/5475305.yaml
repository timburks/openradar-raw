    description: "11-Sep-2007 02:51 PM Brian Webster:\r\nSummary:\r\nDashcode does not provide any way to be included in an automated build process, either via a command-line tool like xcodebuild or via Applescript.  This is a problem for applications built using Xcode that wish to include a Dashboard widget developed using Dashcode.  \r\n\r\nThe build process should ideally include an up to date version of the widget as provided by the \"Deploy Widget...\" item in the File menu in Dashcode, but currently, that step of the build process has to be done manually, which is undesirable when using an automated build system.  \r\n\r\nThe three possible ways I can think of to provide this functionality are:\r\n\r\n1. Integration of Dashcode projects with Xcode.  A Dashcode project could be included into an Xcode project in a similar to the way other Xcode projects can now be included.  Dependencies could be based on the Dashcode project, and its products would be available for inclusion in other targets being built in the project.\r\n2. Providing a command line tool, dashcodebuild or something similar, that could allow for deployment (and perhaps other operations) on a Dashcode project without having to open Dashcode itself.  This tool could then be used in a shell script phase from Xcode to perform any necessary build functions.\r\n3. Add Applescript support to Dashcode, including a command for deploying a Dashcode project's widget.  An Xcode Applescript build phase could then be used to integrate the widget into the build process."
