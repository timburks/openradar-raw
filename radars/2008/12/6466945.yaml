    description: "In a tab bar Cocoa Touch app, you can't run two modal views back-to-back.\r\n\r\nThis is a big problem for me. In my Cocoa Touch app, I put up a modal view when the users requests a network operation. Once connected, some of the possible actions require a different modal view to track progress and results. I can't switch from one modal view to another, so both the network security and user experience are compromised.\r\n\r\nSTEPS:\r\n\r\n1. Download, build and run the attached app: ModalViews. It's based on the Tab Bar Application template.\r\n\r\nAlso available at http://www.idleloop.com/programs/ModalViews.zip\r\n\r\n2. Tap on the \"Go Modal\" button, which will bring up a \"Modal 1\" view.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the view covers the entire screen, including the tab bar, as expected.\r\n\r\n3. Tap on the \"Continue\" button, which will dismiss the \"Modal 1\" view and bring up the \"Modal 2\" view.\r\n\r\nRESULT: the \"Modal 2\" view does not cover the entire screen, the tab bar is now available.\r\n\r\nEXPECT: the second modal view to also cover the entire screen covering the tab bar.\r\n\r\n4. Tap on the \"Second\" tab.\r\n\r\nRESULT: the second tab view activates, breaking the modality.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the second modal view did not get released.\r\nNOTE: switching back to the first view shows no sign of the modal view, but tapping on the \"Go Modal\" button doesn't work."
