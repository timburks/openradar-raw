    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven an RRULE with both BYMONTHDAY and BYDAY keywords, iCal displays the recurring event on all days specified by the BYMONTHDAY clause without considering the BYDAY clause. \r\n\r\nFor example, attached is a .ics file containing an event representing Grandparents' Day.  It falls on the first Sunday after Labor Day in September, so that works out to the Sunday that falls between the dates September 7 and September 13.  So the RRULE looks like this:\r\n    RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=9;BYMONTHDAY=7,8,9,10,11,12,13;BYDAY=SU\r\n\r\nThis rule represents exactly one day per year.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Import a .ics files containing an appointment with both BYMONTHDAY and BYDAY keywords in the RRULE for a particular event (see attachment)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niCal should display the event exactly once per year, on the Sunday occurring between September 7 and September 13.  (9/7/2008, for example).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCal displays the event seven times per year, on the dates September 7-September 13.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor comparison:\r\nSunbird 0.8 on Mac OS X: displays the attached .ics file correctly -- once per year.\r\nGoogle Calendar: displays the attached .ics file correctly -- once per year."
