    description: "22-Sep-2007 05:35 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nEmbedded Quicktime player in webpage only allows 31 char for the filename when saving as a Quicktime movie using the \"Save As Quicktime Movie...\" menu item in the dropdown menu located in the righthand corner underneat the clip.\r\n\r\n22-Oct-2007 12:02 PM Elena Leyfman:\r\n*enclosure database error: files not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Jan-2008 12:04 PM Stoney Gamble:\r\nEngineering believes that this issue is resolved with QuickTime 7.4.\r\n\r\nThis application is available for download at \r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime74forleopard.html (for Mac on Leopard, 10.5.x)\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime74fortiger.html (for Mac on Tiger, 10.4.x)\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime74forpanther.html (for Mac on Panther, 10.3.x)\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime74forwindows.html (for Windows)\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether or not you continue to experience this issue with the newly released software by updating this bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Jan-2008 07:34 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nHi thanks for the update.\r\n\r\nI just tested it (with Mac OS X 10.5.1 and Quicktime 7.4) and unfortunately it has NOT been solved. The limit is still 31 char....\r\n\r\n\r\nI tested it as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Go to a website with video like: http://www.uitzendinggemist.nl\r\n\r\n2) Select a video and let it load in the new web page.\r\n\r\n3) When it has been totally downloaded select the dropdown menu on the embedded Quicktime player bar and choose \"Save as QuickTime Movie\"\r\n\r\n4) As file name try to enter numbers so it is easy to keep track of how many characters you have entered: 12345678901234567890... etc.\r\n\r\n5) What I am seeing is that the \"save\" button in the dialog greys out when you enter character number 32.....\r\n\r\n15-Jan-2008 10:36 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nHi I have an extra observation.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the video I downloaded from http://www.uitzendinggemist.nl was in fact a .asx file and Quicktime plays it through Flip4Mac WMV (2.2.0.49)\r\n\r\nI was wondering if that might have something to do with it so I looked for other quicktime files to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI tried this trailer from the Apple website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/caramel/trailer/ \r\n\r\nAnd I tried it with a Quartz Composer Quicktime from: http://www.zugakousaku.com/index.php?ref=project-quartz-en-quicktime-29_Jellywing\r\n\r\nWhen saving these files it turns out I can in fact use  more than 31 characters for the filename.\r\n\r\nSo my conclusion seems to be that Flip4Mac has got something to do with it....\r\n\r\n\r\n08-Dec-2008 04:09 PM Stoney Gamble :\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in Mac OS X Leopard, v.10.5.5.  Please verify with this release, and update this report with your results.\r\n\r\nMac OS X Leopard, v.10.5.5:\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosx1055update.html\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macosx1055comboupdate.html\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Dec-2008 08:30 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nHi thanks for the update.\r\n\r\nI just tested it with Mac OS X 10.5.5 and 10.5.6 using Safari 3.2.1 and Quicktime 7.5.5 and unfortunately it has still NOT been solved. The limit is still 31 char....\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2009 07:27 AM YVONNE  VILLA  :\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue:\r\n\r\nIf you are seeing this when opening wmv content, then that is using the flip4mac plug-in. And we too see the 32 char limit. That is an issue you will need to submit to the flip4mac team. The QT Plug-in has no control over that plug-in or it sub-menus. If you open a .mov movie in the browser, like the apple trailer movies, then you should be able to save a movie with a file name greater hen 32 char.  If that is not the case, please return bug. Otherwise this issue is considered fixed. With the remaining open issue to be resolved by flip4mac. thanks."
