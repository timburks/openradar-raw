    description: "When you update a device's ID in the Program Portal, it removes that device from any provisions that device is in. It also invalidates the provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, users (who own named device) change devices fairly frequently (replacement units, upgrading to new devices, etc.) When this happens, we replace the device's ID but do not rename the device itself (each user has a unique name.)\r\n\r\nBecause the device has been removed from the provisioning profile, you have to remember to go into all the provisioning profiles where that device is located and re-add it. There is no visual clue to the user that this needs to be done (only that the provisioning profile needs to be recreated.) This makes the process tedious and error prone.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to see this process changed so that when the device's name AND ID changes it gets removed from the provisioning profile. When just the ID changes, the device remains in the profile and will be present when it's recreated."
