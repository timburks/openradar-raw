    description: "02-Dec-2008 04:21 PM Kevin Ballard:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\niPhone applications cannot take advantage of the modern Objective-C runtime available on the iPhone without breaking the ability to test them in the Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone Simulator runs in 32-bit mode only. The modern Objective-C runtime is not available in 32-bit mode, so iPhone applications that use it cannot be built against the iPhone Simulator. I regard this as a bug, as the iPhone Simulator is meant to replicate the iPhone as closely as possible.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution is to build the iPhone Simulator as a 64-bit app and allow projects to target either iPhone Simulator (32-bit) or iPhone Simulator (64-bit). The 64-bit target would then use the modern obj-c runtime and the 32-bit support would not (32-bit support obviously intended only for non-64-bit machines). And to make things even more transparent for the user, there could be a meta-target called just \"iPhone Simulator\" that selects the appropriate bit-depth target, and this would be the default for new projects."
