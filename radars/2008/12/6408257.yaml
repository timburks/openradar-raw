    description: "Summary:\r\nThe System Image Utility that is part of Server Admin Tools version 10.5.5 fails to create a viable mach.macosx.mkext file for NetBooting/ NetInstalling Late 2008 MacBook Pros.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch System Image Utility (v10.5.5) on a Late 2008 MacBook Pro.\r\n2. Insert OS X 10.5.5 Install DVD that shipped with the computer.\r\n3. Create a standard NetInstall set using the DVD as source.\r\n4. Copy NetInstall set to a NetBoot Server and activate it.\r\n5. Try to boot a Late 2008 MacBook Pro using the new NetInstall set.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComputer boots successfully into OS X Installer.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nComputer fails to NetBoot. Globe blinks once, then computer reboots itself. In verbose boot mode, the last two lines of information on the console before the computer reboots itself are:\r\n\r\n   Loading drivers...\r\n   Loading mach.macosx.mkext...\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn addition to using the bundled OS Install DVD as a source, I also used an installed instance of OS 10.5.5 on a Late 2008 MacBook Pros internal hard drive as a source. This NetInstall set also appeared to build normally, but the resulting set failed to NetBoot with identical symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo verify that a bad mach.macosx.mkext file is to blame, I used NetRestore Helper (NRH) (from bombich.com) to create a NetInstall-Restore set. I then copied the mach.macosx.mkext file from the i386 folder of the NRH-created set into the i386 folder of the SIU-created set. The resulting set is able to successfully NetBoot Late 2008 MacBook Pros."
