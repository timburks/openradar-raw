    description: "Summary: \r\nThere is no way to specify on a per-file or per-volume basis that the Finder should display files that whose filename begins the \".\" character.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany users of remote file system would like to be able browse and manipulate files hidden by the \".\" prefix using the Finder. At present the only way to do this is to set \"AppleShowAllFiles YES\" for the Finder (for example, with \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES\" at the command line), but this has the undesirable side effect of exposing hidden files on the local system as well. Often users only want hidden files to be visible on remote volumes (where the hidden files are likely to be server settings or configurations, and unlikely to be cruft such as .DS_Store or .Trashes).\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial to users if files or volumes could be marked in metadata (a standard xattr, perhaps) to be displayed in the Finder, even if their filename begins with \".\"."
