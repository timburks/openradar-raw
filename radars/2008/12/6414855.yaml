    description: "Summary: \r\nAn command line tool embedded in a Cocoa application bundle fails codesign verification when built using the Release configuration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Expand the attached archive to a Xcode 3.1.2 project.\r\n2. Import the Codesign Test Certificate.p12 into your login keychain.\r\n3. Build the Debug configuration and verify the signature (using codesign -vvvv) of both CodesignTest.app and both executables in the CodesignTest.app/Contents/MacOS/ directory.\r\n4. Now build the Release configuration of the CodesignTest target and verify the signatures again. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect all executables' & bundles' signatures to pass verification regardless of the build configuration used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsing the Debug configuration, the bundle and the executables in the MacOS/ directory all verify. Using the Release configuration, CodesignTest.app/Contents/MacOS/cstool fails with \"code or signature modified\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt always occurs using Xcode 3.1.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't figured out a workaround yet, but it may be possible to use a Run Script build phase to manually codesign instead of using Xcode's built-in support."
