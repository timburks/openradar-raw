    description: "21-Nov-2008 07:28 AM Juan De Dios Santander Vela:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe sorting of the printing job start and completion date columns is performed alphabetically instead of chronologically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open printer queue\r\n2) Select Jobs > Show completed jobs\r\n3) Click on When or Completed dates table headers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJobs should appear ordered in chronologically ascending or descending order of start or completion date.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJobs appear with an alphabetical order of the date strings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested in other Mac OS X versions, but cannot remember it happening in Tiger. Happens also with the English localisation, and with different printers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee screenshots.\r\n\r\n'CompletedTasksBadSortScreenshots.zip' and 'jdsantpbg4.spx' were successfully uploaded"
