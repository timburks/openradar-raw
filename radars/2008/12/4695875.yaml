    description: "23-Aug-2006 10:51 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nThe intro(2) man page contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n[BEGIN MAN PAGE QUOTED TEXT]\r\nParent process ID\r\n\tA new process is created by a currently active process; (see\r\n\tfork(2)).  The parent process ID of a process is initially the\r\n\tprocess ID of its creator.  If the creating process exits, the\r\n\tparent process ID of each child is set to the ID of a system\r\n\tprocess, init.\r\n[END MAN PAGE QUOTED TEXT]\r\n\r\nI actually found that there isn't any system process on Mac OS X 10.4.7 named init. I wrote a simple C program to experiment and when the creating process exits, the parent process ID of a child process becames the ID of the launchd process (that is, 1).\r\nI think that the intro(2) man page should be changed to reflect this.\r\n\r\n05-Feb-2012 04:35 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nIt seems that the intro(2) man page is not part of OS X Lion anymore.\r\nIf it has been a deliberate decision and it's not a new bug instead, this bug is somewhat \"resolved\"."
