    description: "SUMMARY:\r\ngcc does not check calls to NSLog when -Wformat is specified, even though NSLog is declared with the appropriate __attribute__((format))\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open the attached folder in Terminal\r\n2. Type `make`\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nIt should warn about both the call to NSLog and the call to printf. The output should look something like:\r\n\r\ngcc -o test -Wformat -framework Foundation main.m\r\nmain.m: In function ‘main’:\r\nmain.m:4: warning: format ‘%s’ expects type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’\r\nmain.m:5: warning: format ‘%s’ expects type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nIt only warns about the call to printf. There is no warning at all on line 4 (the NSLog)."
