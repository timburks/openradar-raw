    description: "The perl script located at /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/iPhoneRemoteDevice.xcodeplugin/Contents/Resources/symbolicatecrash, more commonly referred to just as \"symbolicatecrash\", does not correctly find symbol file + executable matches that in fact exist. I've attached a modified script that fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nhttp://apogee-dev.com/randomstuff/symbolicatecrash.zip attached."
