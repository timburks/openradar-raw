    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAn Airport network interface can be taken down (i.e. \"sudo ifconfig en1 down\"), but not brought back up (i.e. \"sudo ifconfig en1 up\"). This only occurs under 10.5.6. All previous version work perfectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Bring the wireless network interface down (e.g. \"sudo ifconfig en1 down\"). The interface will become inactive, and the airport menu icon report Airport is off (as expected).\r\n2. Attempt to bring the wireless network interface back up (e.g. \"sudo ifconfig en1 up\").\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe wireless network interface should come back up (i.e. become active as reported by ifconfig, and the Airport menu bar icon should report the Airport as being On).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens when attempting to being the interface back it. It stays as inactive as reported by ifconfig, and the menu bar icon reports Airport as being Off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem only occurs with Mac OS 10.5.6. All previous versions work fine."
