    description: "07-Dec-2008 01:19 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nBasing popularity on number of downloads, may work for music or something that is all priced the same, does not work for applications.\r\n\r\nNot every application is the same price. It stands to reason that a $1 is more likely to get more downloads than a $10 app.\r\n\r\nThe current system discriminates against higher priced applications.\r\n\r\nIt would be more reflective of popularity if rankings were calculated by some combination of total sales value, download numbers, and recent ratings.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, it is almost impossible to find good applications as the \"top\" list is full of bad but cheap apps, instead of good applications, and with so many apps in the store it is hard to find anything just by \"browsing\" categories."
