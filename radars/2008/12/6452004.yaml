    description: "Summary: \r\nThere's no easy way to clear the history of items entered in Safari's Search field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Safari and search for something using the Search field at the top-right.\r\n2. Go to Settings > Safari and click the three Clear buttons (History, Cache, & Cookies).\r\n3. Go back to Safari and re-enter the first few characters of the previously searched-for text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe item shouldn't re-appear in the list of previously searched-for items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe item does reappear.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've read that it's possible to clear the search history by opening Safari's bookmarks, navigating to History and clicking Clear, but that's extremely convoluted.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a significant privacy/security issue. The Clear History button in Safari's settings should also clear the search history. Even better, instead of having the three separate Clear buttons, perhaps there should be one Reset> button with persistent On/Off switches to clear various items, like the desktop version's Reset Safari... window."
