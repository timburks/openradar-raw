    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a bottom to top swipe begins within a tabbar then the swipe registers as a click on the tabbar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Starting within the tabbar control swipe your finger up the screen as if scrolling a list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the iPod application the swipe behaves as expected, ie it scrolls the view above the tabbar, in any SDK generated app I would expect the same results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe swipe is treated as a tap in the tabbar and not as a swipe in the list view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have tested this on my own application \"IceTV\" and also demonstrated it to Matt Drance during the iPhone Tech Talk in Sydney, Australia. He found the same issue in the New York Times App."
