    description: "10-Oct-2008 09:58 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's not possible to remotely install \"Security Update 2008-007 Server (Leopard)\" [1] on Mac OS X Leopard Server using Server Admin.app 10.5.3 (279.1.1).\r\n[1] <http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/securityupdate2008007serverleopard.html>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure that the server didn't already automatically downloaded the update and eventually uncheck the \"Download important updates automatically\" in Server Preferences.app --> Software Update --> Scheduled Check.\r\n2. Open Server Admin and connect to an unpatched Mac with OS X 10.5.5 Server.\r\n3. Go to the Server Updates pane.\r\n4. Try to install \"Security Update 2008-007\" v1.0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe security update should correctly download and install.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe download gets stuck showing \"Unknown (75.18%)\" in the Status column.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Mac OS Server on which I tried to install the update is running on a PPC machines (Power Mac G5 2x2GHz) and it's in Advanced configuration mode.\r\nI connected to the server over the network (i.e. I wasn't physically sitting in front of the server's screen).\r\nI tried two times to perform the installation and I always got the \"Unknown (75.18%)\" message in the Status column.\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Jan-2009 12:23 AM Vanaja Pasumarthi :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nPlease provide an install.log.\r\n\r\n\r\n07-Feb-2009 02:44 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI didn't save an install.log.\r\nHow can I reproduce the problem since you removed almost all the Leopard security updates after releasing Mac OS X 10.5.6?\r\nCan you provide me the URL of a software update server with \"Security Update 2008-007\" or \"Security Update 2008-008\" that can I point my server to?\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2009 01:22 AM Vanaja Pasumarthi :\r\nHere is the URL you requested for Security Update 2008-007 for the server.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/security_updates/securityupdate2008007serverleopard.html\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2009 03:52 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nMy bug report is about the Software Update feature of Server Admin, so it's clear that I need a working Apple Software Update server with \"Security Update 2008-007\" for the server to reproduce the problem."
