    description: "04-Oct-2006 10:31 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nTerminal.app's \"Prompt before closing window:\" preference doesn't work as expected when it's set to \"If there are processes other than:\". Actually, the window is _always_ closed without prompting for it, regardless of the processes effectively running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Terminal.app window.\r\n2. Set the \"Prompt before closing window:\" preference to \"If there are processes other than:\" and empy the process list.\r\n3. Try to close the Terminal.app window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTerminal.app should prompt for confirmation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTerminal.app closes the window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug could lead to important informations loss if there are important information in the Terminal.app window and the closing window command is inadvertedly triggered.\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Jul-2012 04:51 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in OS X 10.8.
