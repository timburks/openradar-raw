    description: "03-Dec-2008 12:37 PM Kevin Ballard:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nWhen changing the Code Signing Identity build setting in order to set a provision, Xcode forces you to select the full name of a valid certificate. This makes it much harder to share the same project among multiple developers. It also makes it much less obviously that the name \"iPhone Developer\" is sufficient to find the appropriate certificate (at least one developer I've talked to didn't know that was possible)\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution I can think of is to add a second entry under each provision that says just \"iPhone Developer\"."
