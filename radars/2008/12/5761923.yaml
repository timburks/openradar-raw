    description: "23-Feb-2008 03:25 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nI imported a wedding's worth of photos, many taken in portrait mode.  Most of these images are landscape, requiring me to rotate about 250 of them :-(   Attached is a three screen shot sequence.\r\n\r\nThe first (Picture 7) shows a Portrait lying on its side.\r\nThe second (Picture 8) shows a Portait mode shown correctly\r\nThe third (Picture 9) shows a landscape mode shown correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Feb-2008 03:48 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nPicture 9.\r\n\r\nOBTW, when I rotate the images (luckily the list view saved me a lot of problems), they all now display as portrait, but the metadata is now landscape :-(\r\n\r\n\r\n(apple comment elided)\r\n\r\n14-Mar-2008 05:52 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nThat's the whole point.  The NEF file is *fine*.  Nothing wrong with the original image.\r\n\r\nAperture got really confused somehow over whether the image was portrait or landscape.  The image says \"I am portrait\", Aperture displays it landscape.  The metadata in aperture says \"portrait\" but it's displayed landscape.  I need it to be portrait so I can publish it on the web without having to manually rotate a dozen or more images on a website one-by-one, so I have to rotate it in Aperture.   The metadata in Aperture says \"landscape\" now, but it gets displayed as portrait.  I get the results I want, but now the metadata as far as aperture is concerned is wrong.  If later on I want to sift for portrait images, I'm not going to get the portrait-orientation from this batch.\r\n\r\nThe image was imported into 2.0, because this is a Nikon D3, which pre-2.0 did not support.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n++md\r\n\r\n(back and forth, nothing resolved)\r\n(upgrade to Aperture 2.2)\r\n(problem returns)\r\n\r\n\r\n04-Dec-2008 04:49 PM Mark Dalrymple:\r\nThis is happening to me again a *lot* in Aperture 2.2.  Attached is a project that shows the problem - the image metadata says \"protrait\", but displayed in landscape.  My last shoot was about 1000 images, and having to scroll through all of them and fix the orientation was unfun, since, some were rotated correctly, but most weren't.\r\n\r\nThe project was created like this:\r\n\r\n1) New Button on toolbar -> Project\r\nRenamed to \"brokenOrientation\"\r\n\r\n2) Plugged in card reader with CF card from my camera.  Images came up.  They're not displayed rotated in the import dialog either.\r\n\r\n3) selected one image, clicked Import.\r\n\r\n4) looked at project, image has bad orientation still.\r\n\r\n5) looked at metadata, says \"portrait\"\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n++md"
