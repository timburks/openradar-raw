    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen an AMWorkflow is run by sending an AMWorkflowController a run: message, sending the AMWorkflowController a -stop: message does not stop the AMWorkflow from completing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample project at http://vgable.com/code/AutomatorTestProject.zip\r\n1) in Automator create a workflow, \"test.workflow\" that has a 10-second pause, then displays a dialog or does something else noticeable.\r\n2) Create an AMWorkflowController, that controls test.workflow.\r\n3) Send the AMWorkflowController a -run: message to start executing test.workflow\r\n4) Before the pause in test.workflow completes, send the AMWorkflowController a -stop: message\r\n5) Note that test.workflow completes it's final action.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-[AMWorkflowController stop:] should immediately stop the workflow from running.   Any actions after the pause should not be executed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-[AMWorkflowController stop:] did not stop the workflow from running.  Actions after the pause should were executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project at http://vgable.com/code/AutomatorTestProject.zip"
