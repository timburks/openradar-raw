    description: "Summary: \r\nIf a user has a \".magic\" file in their home directory (used by the \"file\" command-line tool for custom file-format detection), Archive Utility will no longer unarchives files it should know about (ZIPs, etc.). Instead, it archives them (e.g., \"foo.zip\" becomes \"foo.zip.cpgz\", etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Terminal, type \"touch ~/.magic\".\r\n2. Attempt to unarchive a ZIP archive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive should be unarchived.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe archive was instead *re*archived.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis didn't occur under 10.4.x with a .magic file in the user's home directory.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe obvious workarounds are:\r\n1. Remove the .magic file.\r\n2. Use something else to unarchive."
