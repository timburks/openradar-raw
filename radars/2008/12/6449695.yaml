    description: "XCode seems to be querying/interacting with p4 every save.  With a decent sized depot, this means saves can block XC for several seconds.  Attached is the Shark profile - specifically, the extractPerforceRevisionFromMessage method, which takes 88% of the sample.  I'm not even clear why a XCode save should even touch p4.  Regardless, turning off p4 in the XC project makes saves instant, but on they take about 10 seconds (for a depot of about 150 files).  See attached Shark.\r\n\r\n\r\n'XCode Perforce on Save file.mshark' and 'Matts-Mac-Pro 8800.spx' were successfully uploaded"
