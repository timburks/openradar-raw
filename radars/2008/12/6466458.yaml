    description: "I have a PDF created from PowerPoint/Windows. On the PC, it looks fine, but in Preview (on an iMac and an MBP) it has several evenly spaced horizontal lines. In Acrobat/Mac it looks fine. I resaved the original PowerPoint file, and saw the same white lines in the new PDF.\r\n\r\nAttaching the PDF, then a screenshot showing the white lines in Preview.\r\n\r\n\r\n'holiday2008.pdf' and 'reppep.prowler.9G55.2008-12-24.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n23-Dec-2008 09:21 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nscreenshot\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 1.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n23-Dec-2008 09:22 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nAnd here's the PDF I created saving the same doc from PowerPoint 2007. This one has an additional comma, and also displays the white lines in Preview but not in Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n'holiday2008-1.pdf' was successfully uploaded"
