    description: "On my brand new MacBook Pro, I can't make any iPhone certfificate because the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority is \"signed by an unknown autorithy\". Comparing it to my Mac Pro, it turns out the Apple Root CA is missing from the System on the MacBook Pro, and trying to install it manually doesn't work since It wouldn't install it in the \"System Roots\".\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTurns out this was fixed the 10.5.6 - Somehow the Apple Root certificate was not delivered with my MacBook Pro's 10.5.5 :("
