    description: "16-Dec-2008 10:58 AM Ian Eiloart:\r\nSummary: \r\nDespite the fact that Apple provides Cyrus IMAP mail store software in OSX Server, Apple Mail client ignores the quota warning messages that IMAP servers give.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure Cyrus IMAP server with, eg \"quotawarn: 90\" in imap.conf\r\nSet a user quota at 5% above the current usage.\r\nOpen a mailbox with Apple Mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Mail should warn that the user is close to quota threshold. For example, a pop-up dialog box or a warning triangle could be presented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Mail gives no warning.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that this warning mechanism is not a warning by email, which is the Postfix option configurable in OSX Server Admin tools.\r\n\r\n16-Dec-2008 11:08 AM Ian Eiloart:\r\nNB. The alert mechanism I refer to is an RFC 3501 IMAP ALERT response. RFC 3501, section 7.1 says:\r\n\r\nALERT\r\n\r\n         The human-readable text contains a special alert that MUST be\r\n         presented to the user in a fashion that calls the user's\r\n         attention to the message."
