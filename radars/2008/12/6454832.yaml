If the delegate does not implement -document, then the action is not deleted from the view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nProject demonstrating the issue: http://vgable.com/code/AutomatorTestProject.zip\r\n\r\n1) Create a project with an AMWorkflowController that controls an AMWorkflowView, which is set to be editable, and has a workflow with at least one action.\r\n\r\n2) Set the delegate of the AMWorkflowController to any object that does not implement\r\n-(id) document;\r\n\r\n3) Remove an action from the workflow by clicking on the (x) button on the action's view inside the AMWorkflowView.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe action is removed from the workflow without error.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the AMWorkflowController has a delegate that does not implement -document, then the action is NOT removed from the view.\r\n\r\nProject demonstrating the issue: http://vgable.com/code/AutomatorTestProject.zip"
