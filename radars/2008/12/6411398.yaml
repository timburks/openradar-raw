    description: "02-Dec-2008 06:45 AM Brian Webster:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen importing photos into iPhoto using the \"import\" command in its Applescript dictionary, there is currently no way to control whether iPhoto imports duplicate photos or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nRun the following Applescript, choosing several photos that are already in the iPhoto library when prompted:\r\n\r\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\r\n\tset fileList to choose file with multiple selections allowed\r\n\timport fileList\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected results/actual results:\r\nWhen importing these duplicates, iPhoto will display a dialog to the user asking them whether or not they want to import the duplicate photo(s).  This requires user intervention in the process, which can seriously disrupt performing automated tasks with iPhoto.\r\n\r\nThe \"import\" command should take an additional parameter that allows the scripter to decide how to handle duplicates when importing.  It would working similarly to the \"saving\" parameter to the standard \"save\" command, with three values: \"yes\", \"no\", and \"ask\".  Passing in \"yes\" would import all the photos, regardless of whether they're duplicates, \"no\" would skip importing all duplicates, and \"ask\" would perform the current behavior, asking the user to decide.  So for example, an Applescript that would always import duplicates would look like:\r\n\r\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\r\n\tset fileList to choose file with multiple selections allowed\r\n\timport fileList importing duplicates yes\r\nend tell"
