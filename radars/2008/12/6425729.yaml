    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation states that ABAddressBookCopyPeopleWithName() (and, indeed, it makes sense that) it will match records based on composite name, which should be the value returned by ABRecordCopyCompositeName(). Instead, this function ignores properties such as kABPersonPrefixProperty and kABPersonSuffixProperty in the composite name that it matches against for each record in the address book.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add two records to the address book of the testing device or simulator with composite names \"Mr. Bart Simpson\", \"Bart Simpson\", and \"Bart Simpson Jr.\"\r\n2. Call ABAddressBookCopyPeopleWithName(), giving it a suffix of \"Bart Simpson\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe resulting CFArrayRef should only contain a single ABRecordRef. That is, it should only match the second record with the composite name \"Bart Simpson\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe resulting CFArrayRef contains three ABRecordRefs - one for each record. The ABAddressBookCopyPeopleWithName() function's matching completely ignores the values for properties like prefix and suffix, and uses a non-standard composite name instead of the standard value returned by ABRecordCopyCompositeName() that includes all proper property values."
