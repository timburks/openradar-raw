    description: "05-Dec-2007 04:54 PM Juan De Dios Santander Vela:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSafari 3.x should allow for synched session restore from other Macs using .Mac. The mechanism for storing locally the open windows and tabs could be enhanced to allow the restoring of sessions initiated on other Macs, allowing to continue research on different Macs.\r\n\r\nAdditional features that might use an enhancement to this capability:\r\n\r\n- Safari Workspaces, where sessions can be open and saved for later reuse\r\n- .Mac access, where by accessing the dotMac website a user can open workspaces/sessions on non-Mac browsers"
