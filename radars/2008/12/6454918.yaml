    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen an AMWorkflowView is NOT editable, the (x) button that modifies a workflow by removing an action from it is still enabled, but has no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild the \"AutoSample\" project: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/AutoSample/index.html\r\nNote that the workflow view is explicitly made non-editable in awakeFromNib;\r\nNote that the (x) buttons are still enabled in every workflow, but have no effect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you can not edit a workflow, I would expect widgets that edit the workflow to be visibly disabled or hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe (x) is enabled and clickable, but it does nothing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see this bug in the \"AutoSample\" project: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/AutoSample/index.html"
