    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen one of the Simulator SDKs is selected as the active SDK for an iPhone project rather than a Device SDK, no compiler-specific options are displayed in either the Project or Target settings. Switching to a Device SDK results in the compiler options reappearing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is (I believe) new in Xcode 3.1.2 / iPhone SDK for OS 2.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attachment uploaded shows the appearance of the Project settings panel when a Simulator SDK is choosen - there are no compiler settings displayed, and any compiler settings that were set are displayed as User-defined options with their corresponding raw settings names.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.skitch.com/20081208-11ebj45hgnp8u4jdd13uh3jhbh.png attached."
