    description: "27-Oct-2007 05:02 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe attached movies, one with premultiplied black alpha and one changed to no alpha, both play in QT Player correctly. The transparent one doesn't play in Front Row. This completely prevents the use of subtitles in a separate track.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place attached Perian.component (universal) into ~/Library/QuickTime/.\r\n2. Play ssa.mov and ssa-opaque.mov in QT Player to verify they work.\r\n3. Put them in ~/Movies/ and play them in Front Row.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should show up starting at about 00:01. (with the wrong fonts, but nevertheless)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText displays under QT Player, but not in Front Row.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nReported by multiple users with unknown hardware and 10.5.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDue to the design of the subtitle codec there is a blank \"sample\" displayed at all times after the first actual sample. Therefore, the entire movie after the first subtitle is unwatchable in Front Row.\r\n\r\nPremultiplied black alpha is the only kind of alpha CG will happily render to, so changing it isn't an option.\r\n\r\n(The alternative is inserting holes into the track via edit lists, but QT behaves weirdly under that, and I haven't reduced it enough to file a bug yet)\r\n\r\n'frontrow-no-transparency.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n05-Feb-2008 11:03 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nIt seems that rendering to a 2vuy QTVisualContext when you have to blend movie tracks breaks CoreVideo: http://groups.google.com/group/perian-discuss/t/37da547205da3a4c\r\n\r\n04-May-2008 04:52 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nUsing 'transparent' as the blend mode shows the movie and the subtitle track, but coercing Quartz to not render the transparency color would be quite hard. Besides that, it also makes it start rendering in software or something - it starts using nearest-neighbor scaling and goes down to 1-5 fps."
