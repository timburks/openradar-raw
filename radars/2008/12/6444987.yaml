    description: "Summary: \r\nIn my application I'm using UIImagePickerController to pick an image from device gallery or device camera. When user picked an image application uses UIImage class to display selected image and to send an image to the photohosting. Uploaded photo doesn't contain any EXIF information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pick an image with UIImagePickerController\r\n2. Store picked in UIImage class instance.\r\n3. Use UIImageJPEGRepresentation to access NSData of selected image and upload gathered data to photohosting.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUploaded image should contain EXIF data\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUploaded image doesn't contain EXIT data\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem occurs from iPhone SDK 2.0 till now.\r\nXcode Version 3.1.2\r\nComponent versions\r\nXcode IDE: 1149.0\r\nXcode Core: 1148.0\r\nToolSupport: 1102.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo workaround this problem I need to write a bunch of code wrappers for libexif or any other EXIF library."
