    description: "I just had a Screen Sharing session with a friend using the AZERTY keyboard layout. While connected to my computer, his keyboard typed QWERTY, which meant he could not type. He changed my keyboard layout to AZERTY, which let him type, but meant I was unable to type, since many of the keys were not where I expected, and of course mis-labeled.\r\n\r\nScreen Sharing should let both users use their native layouts."
