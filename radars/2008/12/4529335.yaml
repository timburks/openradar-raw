    description: "27-Apr-2006 05:50 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode deletes the files listed in the \"Output Files\" section of a Run Script Build Phase if it finds a sintax error in the shell script.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Xcode prokect.\r\n2. Notice there is a \"testfile\" file in the project folder.\r\n3. Build the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should error because the run script build phase of the only target in the project doesn't contain a valid shell script but it should NOT delete the \"testfile\" file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode signals the sintax error in the shell script and deletes the \"testfile\" file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'TestShellScript.zip' and 'SystemConfiguration.spx'were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Mar-2009 11:08 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI wonder why and when this bug got the \"Feature (New)\" classification, it appears a serious bug to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple\r\nJan 15, 2020 at 8:17 PM\r\nThank you for your feedback. \r\n\r\nThere have been many changes in Apple platforms since this was filed. If your feedback is still relevant to current software, please update this feedback with recent diagnostics, sample code and screenshots, as appropriate. Otherwise, please close your feedback."
