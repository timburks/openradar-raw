    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be very useful for offline browser type applications to allow for the creation of webarchive files from an NSURLRequest or similar object.\r\n\r\nI am working on an application that allows for offline view of a web-based magazine that would really benefit from this capability. I am also interested in creating an offline RSS reader that would again benefit from this capability.\r\n\r\nI understand that there is a private framework that has classes to do this very thing, opening it up to 3rd party developers would open the door for a host of interesting applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
