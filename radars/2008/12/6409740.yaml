    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn the simulator, NSFullUserName returns the name of the logged-in user.  On the phone, it returns a zero-length string.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCall NSFullUserName and examine the return value.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNSFullUserName should return the user's first + last name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNSFullUserName returns a zero-length NSString.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI've been told that this has never worked, so no regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSomeone with more experience than I with iPhone says that the reason it does not work is that the concept of a logged-in user does not exist on the iPhone, and it has no way of knowing which of the Contacts is the phone's owner.  This makes sense.  So it seems that either this function (and its sibling NSUserName) should be removed for iPhone, or else they need to be made aware of which Contact to look for."
