    description: "05-Nov-2008 03:30 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nI found that the login dialog box that iTunes shows when I want to report a problem about an item I purchased is badly and incompletely translated to Italian.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the system language to Italian.\r\n2. Open the iTunes Store and buy an item.\r\n3. Wait for the purchase receipt to be delivered to your inbox.\r\n4. Open the e-mail and click on the \"Report a problem\" link (\"Segnala un problema\" in Italian).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should show you a dialog box, asking for your Apple ID and password, correctly translated in Italian.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog box main text is badly translated in Italian and the \"Report a problem\" button isn't translated at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached a screenshot of the Italian dialog box.\r\n\r\nThe main text is: \"Inserisci ID Apple e password e clicca su Segna un problema.\".\r\nIt should be: \"Inserisci l'ID Apple e la password e clicca su Segnala un problema\".\r\n\r\nThe default button contains the following text: \"Report a problem\".\r\nIt should be \"Segnala un problema\".\r\n\r\n\r\n'Report a problem.png' and 'System Profile.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n07-Nov-2009 10:52 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI've just tried to reproduce the problem on iTunes 9.0.2 (25) and I've found that the dialog window is now correctly translated. So, this issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
