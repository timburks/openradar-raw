    description: "I have a laptop set to require a password on wake and my keychain is set to lock on sleep. This means that when I wake the laptop I have to enter my password at least three times: \r\n\r\n1) Unlock the screen saver\r\n2) Unlock the keychain for the MobileMe sync agent\r\n3) Unlock the keychain for pubsubagent\r\n\r\nThis appears to be timing-dependent as most of the time I will also get the unlock dialog for at least one additional app (e.g. Mail or iTunes) if it triggered the keychain dialog. In some cases these dialogs appear to interfere with the normal screen-saver unlock: the screen powers on but remains black until the system returns to sleep; during this time the cursor will be the beachball and hitting any key will trigger the standard system error noise (⇪⌘Q, ⇪\x0F⌥⎋, etc. do nothing different). Waking it again will usually get the unlock dialog to be displayed. Every time this happens, the unlocked desktop will have a keychain unlock dialog for an application such as Mail behind either the pubsub or filesync keychain unlock dialogs.\r\n\r\nThis situation should not be possible: unlocking the screen saver should also unlock the keychain when the login password is the same and in any case unlocking the keychain for one item should automatically close any other keychain password dialogs and unlock the keychain."
