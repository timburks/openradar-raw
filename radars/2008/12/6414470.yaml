    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting a window to the kCGDesktopWindowLevel level causes said window to appear on all spaces, regardless of the collection behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nSet a window's level to kCGDesktopWindowLevel, then try to move window to another space.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nWindow is shown only on the space on which it was created, and can be moved between spaces.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nWindow is show on all spaces, and cannot be moved to a single space.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'd be happy for a workaround such as using CGSClearWindowTags() with the right flags - any chance of that?"
