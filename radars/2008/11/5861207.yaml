    description: "13-Apr-2008 11:49 PM Jens Ayton:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nNew windows created by the AppKit document classes are named “Untitled”, “Untitled 2” etc. This is a contravention of the Apple Human Interface Guidelines:\r\n‘Name a new document window “untitled”; leaving it lowercase makes it more obvious that the window doesn’t have a name and encourages people to save the document. … Do not capitalize “Untitled”.’\r\n-- HIG, Windows, Window Behaviour\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGWindows/chapter_18_section_5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF55\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Create a new application based on the Cocoa Document-based Application template.\r\n2. Without any code modifications, run it.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nThe template application has one window, incorrectly labelled “Untitled”. This name is generated by the AppKit framework, not the template code.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nThis bug has existed in all versions of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nThe HIG was recently extensively revised, and the guideline in question was retained, for the simple reason that it is the right thing. The AppKit document architecture does not make it particularly easy to work around this bug."
