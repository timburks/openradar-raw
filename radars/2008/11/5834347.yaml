    description: "01-Apr-2008 07:33 AM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nIt would be nice if a subclass of UIViewController could specify an unloadView method to do cleanup before the view is removed from the controller.\r\n\r\nThe current mechanism works great for building a view object graph on-the-fly, but has problems if you want to remove those objects. If you have a reference to one of the subviews that's used in some other part of the controller, that reference can potentially point to an object that no longer exists (because the view was unloaded without your controller's knowledge.) Likewise, if you retain the subview object, you're left holding onto memory that's not really needed.\r\n\r\nA simple call to unloadView before releasing self.view would make it possible for controllers to do whatever is necessary to achieve a consistent state."
