    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the iPhone volume keys are used to adjust volume while listening to a preview in the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, the slider moves abruptly from one stop to the next, unlike elsewhere in the interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select \"iTunes\" from the Home screen.\r\n2. Navigate to an album or other list of songs.\r\n3. Tap a song to play the preview.\r\n4. Adjust playback volume using the keys on the left side of iPhone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVolume slider transitions from one stop to the next, as in iPod, YouTube, and Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVolume slider jumps each time a volume key is pressed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a. This is the first version of iPhone software to include iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store.\r\n\r\n28-May-2008 06:06 PM [redacted]:\r\nEngineering has determined this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nThis is by executive design. You will also  notice that we don't fade in controls in the iPod app when you tap on the album art to bring up the controls.  This is similar here.\r\n\r\n16-Nov-2008 08:40 PM Sidney San Martin:\r\nI realize this is a stale bug at this point, but I just took a look at it and realize there may have been a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI don't mind non-animated transitions and am not using this bug report to challenge design. I submitted it because every other volume control in iPhone OS behaves one way (to transform from one position to the next when hardware volume switches are used) and the iTunes Store behaves another (to step from one position to the next).\r\n\r\nIf that inconsistency was a design decision, I'm fine with it."
