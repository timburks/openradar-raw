    description: "Summary: \r\nNSSegmentedControls in the NSSegmentStyleRounded style are almost, but not quite, identical to tab control tabs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Interface Builder, create a new Cocoa Window document.\r\n2. Add a tab control.\r\n3. Add a segmented control. It will use NSSegmentStyleRounded by default.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne of the following:\r\na) Clearly distinct control appearance, to signify that they are different controls.\r\nb) Identical appearance, to signify that they work in the same way from a user perspective.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe controls appear the same at first glance, but actually differ. In particular:\r\n* The line between adjoining segments is heavier in the segmented control.\r\n* The selected segment is much darker when the window is inactive in the segmented mode. Non-selected segments are also somewhat darker.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested on other system versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile this is an extremely nit-picky when considering the controls in isolation, it makes it harder to provide a consistent UI when both types of control are on screen, even if theyâ€™re in separate windows or separate applications."
