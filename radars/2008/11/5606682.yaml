    description: "Summary:\r\nIn 10.4 pressing Spacebar selected the first item in a folder, following type-ahead conventions. With Leopard, the Spacebar is reserved for Quick Look. The legacy behavior remains, however, when the Desktop has focus and  nothing is selected: pressing spacebar selects the first item on the Desktop. If the spacebar continues to be pressed in less than one second intervals, it is ignored. After a one second pause, pressing the spacebar activates or deactivates Quick Look.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Focus the Desktop, ensuring that nothing is selected (Quick Look may be open or closed at this point)\r\n2. Press the spacebar\r\n3. Wait one second and press the spacebar again\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nQuick Look activates or deactivates on the first press, displaying details for the Desktop\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first item on the Desktop (alphanumerically â€” not the first volume, if any are displayed) is selected. Quick Look only triggers after a one second delay. This applies regardless of Quick Look's state: if it's displaying details for the Desktop, pressing spacebar still selects the first item instead of hiding Quick Look.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf an item is already selected on the Desktop, the spacebar behaves normally, triggering Quick Look. If the Desktop folder is opened in a Finder window, the spacebar behaves normally.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found the old spacebar behavior useful, allowing me to return to the top of a name-sorted window with a single key press. I would welcome its return as a checkbox in Finder preferences, but as it stands spacebar behavior on the Desktop is inconsistent with the rest of the Finder."
