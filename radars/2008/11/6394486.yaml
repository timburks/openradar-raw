    description: When uninstalling an application on iPhone OS 2.2 the springboard prompts a user to provide a rating.  While it is clear that the intention behind this is to foster enhanced user activity within the AppStore, it is rather likely that a user who is uninstalling an application is dissatisfied with it and is therefor more likely to provide a low rating.  While it may be true that a large quantity of low ratings for an application could be indicative of it's overall quality, it is also likely that the average user is also lazy and would not return to the applications page on the store to provide a rating after having installed, used, and considered the application.  What I propose is a means for the springboard to prompt the user for a rating on a launch of the application after either a given number of executions or after an interval of time following installation.  Thereby providing equal access to the rating system to all applications - those both excellent and poor.
