    description: "18-Apr-2006 12:13 PM Nello Lucchesi:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to select certain traditional Chinese characters using the pinyin Input Method (IM) even though they are displayed as available selections.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Select Pinyin IM and make sure that \"show input key\" is selected.\r\n\r\n2.  Type in the pinyin for bed ( 床, chuang tone 2).\r\n\r\n3.  A row of selections beginning with 創is displayed.\r\n\r\n4.  Go to the next row of input selections by pressing the down arrow.\r\n\r\n5.  A row of selections beginning with 刱 is displayed.\r\n\r\n6.  Use the right arrow key to move to the last character which is 床 and press enter (or the 9 key)  Instead of selecting 床, the preceding character,  橦, is selected.  There is no way to select the last character, 床.\r\n\r\nFor further information, see:\r\n\r\n  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=2162207#2162207"
