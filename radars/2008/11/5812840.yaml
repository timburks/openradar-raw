    description: "21-Mar-2008 10:02 AM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nA Macintosh developer's ability to produce world-class products is inhibited by the lack of desktop virtualization.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n   1. Create a virtual machine using VMware or Parallels on your desktop.\r\n   2. Try to install Mac OS X on this virtual machine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to install and run any version of Mac OS X on this virtual machine as long as the host is a Macintosh.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe installation does not work.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis ability has never existed, but ever since the arrival of virtual machines in Mac OS X, developers have dreamt of being able to do this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe ability to run multiple versions of Mac OS X has many benefits for a Macintosh developer and for Apple:\r\n\r\n    * Being able to run any version of Mac OS X in a virtual machine makes it much easier for a developer to create features for both older and newer versions of the operating system. Many developers need to support their existing applications on the current platform, while at the same time developing new applications for an upcoming version of Mac OS X. For example, developers would like to have virtual machines that would allow Tiger and Leopard to run at the same time. The benefit to Apple is that there will be many more applications available at each new OS launch because the barriers to developing on that new OS are much lower.\r\n    * Developers constantly need to test their products on various versions of Mac OS X. If a customer reports a problem on 10.4.11 and the developer is running 10.5.2, there is a significant amount of effort required to bring up a system that allows investigation. The result is that many problems are ignored or deferred. With virtualization these barriers are removed and fixing bugs becomes much easier. The benefit to Apple is higher quality software for the Macintosh platform.\r\n    * Apple often releases beta versions of development tools that are not compatible with older versions. One such example is the current Xcode 3.1 releaseâ€”it cannot be run simultaneously with the 3.0 release. This creates a situation where a developer working on iPhone applications cannot work on their current Macintosh applications at the same time. Again, developer productivity suffers and the availability of products for both of Apple's platforms is affected.\r\n\r\nVirtualization is currently being made available for the Mac OS X Server product. We respectfully ask that Apple make the same features available in the desktop version of the operating system.\r\n\r\n21-Mar-2008 12:03 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nI have been informed that you can run Xcode 3.0 and 3.1 side-by-side. While this is true, I have heard that there are also some problems:\r\n\r\n<http://twitter.com/ddribin/statuses/775044242>\r\n<http://twitter.com/rentzsch/statuses/774562409>\r\n\r\nI appreciate the excellent job the developers at Apple do with Xcode and the other fine tools we work with, but there will always be growing pains as these tools advance. Virtualization will lessen the impact of change on our development environments."
