    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the user has set iTunes' preferences to buy items from the iTunes Store using a Shopping Cart, and then goes to buy an iPhone app from the iTunes App Store, iTunes presents a note informing the user that “Application purchases cannot be placed in Shopping Cart; they must be purchased by 1-Click”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Store pane of iTunes' Preferences, set iTunes to “Buy using a Shopping Cart”.\r\n2. Visit any iPhone application's page in the iTunes App Store.\r\n3. Click “Buy App” or “Get App”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes adds the app to the shopping cart.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes presents an error message:\r\n\r\n> Applications cannot be purchased with Shopping Cart.\r\n> \r\n> Your preferences are currently set to buy using Shopping Cart. Application purchases cannot be placed in Shopping Cart; they must be purchased by 1-Click. Select Buy if you'd like to purchase <application> by using 1-Click and your credit card will be charged immediately.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niTunes also disobeyed the preference in 7.7, but did so silently.\r\n\r\nPrior versions of iTunes did not support the App Store, so they did not have this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf there is a good reason for iTunes to not allow the user to use a Shopping Cart on iPhone apps, the message should state that reason.\r\n\r\nAlso, the message claims that “your credit card will be charged” even if the user has no credit card on file (is using prepay cards only)."
