    description: "I have an iPhone App who is distributed via Ad Hoc with the SDK 2.1 (compiled for 2.1) on devices running 2.2. Once I compile it with the 2.2 SDK it reports an error when the user tries to sync its iPod/iPhone with iTunes.\r\n\r\nUninstalling the SDK 2.2 and reinstalling the 2.1 solved the problem, even tough the devices are still in 2.2"
