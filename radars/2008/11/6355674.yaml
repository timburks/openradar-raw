    description: "08-Nov-2008 06:38 PM Jehiah Czebotar:\r\nWhen an application is published in the iTunes Connect app store interface, there is an 'availability date' which allows a developer to submit applications to apple and still control the date that they are released.\r\n\r\nWhen an update is submitted, all the same fields that are used for the original version are displayed and editable for the update, however some parameters (like availability date) do not apply just to the update.\r\n\r\nThis means that a developer setting an availability date for an update, is really unknowingly setting an availability date for the whole application. Fields should be labeled as to which application version they will be applied to."
