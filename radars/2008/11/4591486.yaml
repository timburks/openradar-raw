    description: "19-Jun-2006 08:37 AM Jens Ayton:\r\nThe Human Interface Guidelines say: “Pressing the Help key may invoke the application’s help in Help Viewer. The key combination Command-Shift-/ (sometimes shortened to Command-?) should always display the application’s help in Help Viewer.”\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect in that Command-Shift-/ and Command-? are not equivalent. They merely happen to use the same set of keys on some keyboard layouts, notably US ones. In many keyboard layouts this is not the case. For instance, in the Swedish layout I’m currently using, / is shift-7 or / on the numerical keypad, while ? is shift-+.\r\n\r\nBased on essentially universal precedent, Command-Shift-/ is not a correct choice of keyboard shortcut, and Command-? is."
