    description: n an application developed via the iPhone SDK one is unable to obtain the WiFi SSID or network name.  Understandably the user has chosen or setup to allows the iPhone to choose a WiFi network in the Settings application.  For some enterprise applications it would be beneficial to be able to query for the WiFi network name to know if you're on the correct internal network.  Without that first step is is much harder to query and determine if the servers you need are reachable correctly or not.
