    description: "Cocoa/AppKit\r\n\r\nA number of issues disclosed by the ongoing Month of Apple Bugs project -- including one in Apple's Software Update -- are caused by unsafe use of the NSRunAlertPanel() family of functions, declared in NSPanel.h. The problem stems from the fact that these functions take printf()-style format string arguments, but this is not apparent from the names of the functions, and the documentation for the functions does not point out the danger such functions pose.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the NSAlert class has existed since Mac OS X 10.3 and provides a superset of the functionality of these functions. Its convenience factory method, +alertWithMessageText:defaultButton:alternateButton:otherButton:informativeTextWithFormat: is also potentially vulnerable, but the use of the WithFormat suffix does at least serve as a reminder that a format string is used.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it would be reasonable and desireable for these functions to be deprecated in the Mac OS X 10.5 SDK, and be unavailable in 64-bit Cocoa. This applies to all functions (not methods) in NSPanel.h, since they are all either vulnerable or dependant upon vulnerable functions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-07-01-2007.html\r\nhttp://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-16-01-2007.html\r\nhttp://projects.info-pull.com/moab/MOAB-24-01-2007.html\r\n\r\n\r\n31-Jan-2007 03:32 AM Jens Ayton:\r\nAdditional examples of this issue have been posted to http://www.digitalmunition.com/MOAB-30-01-2007.html ."
