    description: "10-Apr-2008 04:21 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nUpgrading a Mac which previously ran Mac OS X Tiger and had the Airport Disk Utility installed to Leopard deletes the utility.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no replacement functionality is provided by Mac OS X Leopard.\r\n\r\nAfter re-installing the utility from the installation disc, the utility does not function correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Configure an Aiport Disk on an Airport Extreme Base Station\r\n2. On a Mac running Mac OS X Tiger, install the Aiport Disk Utility and configure it to automatically connect to the Airport Disk.\r\n3. Upgrade the Mac to any shipping version of Mac OS X Leopard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEither\r\n\r\n(a) Airport Disk Utility is present and functions correctly\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n(b) The functionality is provided by a feature provided by Mac OS X Leopard itself\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe auto-connection facilities of Airport Disks, as detailed in the product packaging, manual and promotional materials, no longer function.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nInstalling any shipping version of Mac OS X Leopard triggers this regression,\r\n11-Apr-2008 08:07 AM TED FAWCETT:\r\nEngineering needs a full System Profiler Report to investigate this issue. \r\n\r\nTo obtain a full System Profiler Report, select \"About This Mac\" from the Apple Menu and click the \"More Info\" button. This automatically launches the System Profiler application. Once the System Profiler application has been launched please follow the steps below: \r\n\r\n1. Select \"View > Full Profile\" from the File menu (cmd-3)\r\n2. Select \"Save\" from the File menu (cmd-s)\r\n3. Keep the format as 'System Profile'\r\n4. Click the \"Save\" button\r\n\r\nA System Profiler Report can also be obtained via Terminal using the following command:\r\n\r\n/usr/sbin/system_profiler -detailLevel full -xml >mymachine.spx\r\n\r\nThis command will create a full System Profiler Report, named \"mymachine.spx\", which will open in System Profiler on another machine.\r\n\r\nPlease attach the file to this bug report.\r\n\r\n11-Apr-2008 04:37 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\n'melo.spx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Apr-2008 04:39 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nI don't know if this is a bug, (and so one which should be filed against system_profiler), but the following was sent to stderr while system_profiler was running:\r\n\r\nSystemFlippers: didn't consume all data for vers ID 1 (pBase = 0x1639a210, p = 0x1639a21d, pEnd = 0x1639a21e)\r\n\r\n15-Apr-2008 06:51 AM Vanaja Pasumarthi:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended.  AirPort disks should show up in the Finder sidebar.\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Apr-2008 06:59 AM Mo McRoberts:\r\nSo, do I have to submit a new bug about the fact that:\r\n\r\n(a) Airport Disks do not appear in the Finder sidebar. The Airport itself does (under “Shared”, but given that I have more than one disk, this is not the same as the volumes themselves appearing under “Devices”. Is the description given here incorrect (in which case, what hope do us normal end-users have?) or is my Mac not behaving as intended?\r\n\r\n(b) The product does no longer functions as advertised, and the behaviour is a departure from that under Mac OS  X Tiger and changed without warning.\r\n\r\n…or will this suffice?\r\n\r\n23-Apr-2008 11:18 AM Vanaja Pasumarthi:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n \r\nAirPort Disk Utility has been replaced by integrating AirPort Disk functionality into the sidebar on Leopard.\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Apr-2008 11:34 AM Mo McRoberts:\r\nNot wishing to be rude, but today's response is nearly word-for-word identical to the response on the 15th, and provides no new information whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMy Airport Extreme is displayed in Finder's sidebar, as are other Macs and PCs on my network.\r\n\r\nMy _Airport Disks_ are NOT displayed in Finder's sidebar unless they are mounted. The disks are inaccessible to applications, and from the Terminal, until they are (manually) mounted.\r\n\r\nThe advertised functionality—the automatic mounting of Airport Disks, if configured to do so—was a major selling point of the AEBS and has been removed. How, exactly, has the enhanced Finder sidebar replaced the Airport Disk Utility without regressing?\r\n\r\n02-May-2008 03:45 PM TED FAWCETT:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
