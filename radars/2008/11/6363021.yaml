    description: "11-Nov-2008 07:45 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nIn the Finder Find/\"Searching\" window, if you choose to add a filter by \"Kind\" there is no preset value for \"Mail Message.\" It would be helpful to add this to the preset options, especially because it's one of the distinct categories in the spotlight in-menu search results.\r\n\r\nThis could also apply to any other kinds that are listed in System Preferences --> Spotlight --> Search Results, like:\r\n\r\n- Contacts\r\n- Events & To-Dos\r\n- Webpages\r\n- Fonts"
