    description: "Summary:\r\nchmod (-h) does not set ACL on symbolic links\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. $ touch A\r\n2. $ ln -s A B\r\n3. $ chmod -h +a \"everyone allow delete\" B\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ACL is set on \"B\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe ACL is set on \"A\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on Mac OS X 10.5.5 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe man page is not very clear about the -h option. Indeed, the first two synopsis do not have the -h, the last three have the -h option.\r\nBut doing 'chmod -h 000 B' (as in first synopsis) works as expected, i.e. mode is set on B.\r\nUnfortunately, doing 'chmod -h +a \"everyone allow delete\" B' does not work as expected, i.e. ACL is set on A.\r\nBy looking at /bin/chmod source code, this is understandable:\r\nthe \"hflag\" is not passed to the modify_file_acl function, so it always ends up calling acl_set_file instead of choosing between acl_set_file and acl_set_link_np based on the -h option (hflag)."
