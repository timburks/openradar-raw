    description: "29-Jan-2004 03:23 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nIn the search field on the toolbar of Mail.app, enable one of the choices as \"headers\", meaning all message headers (to, from, subject, date, etc) or perhaps just what is currently visible in the tableview.\r\n\r\nI find myself frequently flipping back and forth between \"From\" and \"Subject\" to get the search results I really desire, and combining the indicies would make things significantly easier for me."
