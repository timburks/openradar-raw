    description: "21-Nov-2008 02:55 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nThere is no permanent link for applications to embed into their applications.\r\n\r\nInitially, a link in the following format worked in the 2.0 firmware:\r\n\r\n<http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=296581959&mt=8>\r\n\r\nThis stopped working in the 2.1 release. The workaround was to use a link in this format:\r\n\r\n<http://www.itunes.com/app/Frenzic>\r\n\r\nThis workaround was unsatisfactory because it opened Safari prior to opening the App Store (on the device.)\r\n\r\nNow with the 2.2 software release, the phobos.apple.com link is working again. But iTunes produces a link like this when you control-click on the application icon and select “Copy iTunes Store URL”:\r\n\r\n<http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=296581959&mt=8>\r\n\r\nAnd that won't work with the 2.2 software release.\r\n\r\nI don't care what the link is or how it is formatted. All I care about is that the link remains permanent. Since these links are embedded into software that can not be updated quickly (because of iTunes Connect lead times) having a link that never changes is very important.\r\n\r\n21-Nov-2008 03:04 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nAlso, please document the proper URL format so developers know what to put on their websites and in their applications."
