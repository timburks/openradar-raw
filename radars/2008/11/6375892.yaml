    description: "16-Nov-2008 10:43 AM Bryan Henry:\r\nDevelopers should have some way to contact users posting reviews for their products. Developers should also be able to mark reviews for Apple review, since its frequently the case that users will post reviews that are completely factually incorrect...yet developers have no recourse for such matters. The \"Report a Concern\" option for reviews does not appear to go anywhere except into a black hole.\r\n\r\nSee rdar://problem/6069285"
