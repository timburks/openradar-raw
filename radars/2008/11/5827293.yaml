    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I cmd+return in the address field of the toolbar to open a new tab, it retains a blue outline and the address is highlighted in grey. It retains this appearance until I focus and blur it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select the address field in the toolbar\r\n2. Enter an address (ex. \"http://apple.com\")\r\n3. Type command+return\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe address field loses its highlight, as when I just press \"return\" to go to the address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe address field retains a blue outline and its contents becomes selected, highlighted in grey.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBug appeared in Safari 3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I click in the address field and then tab out or otherwise deselect it, it returns to normal appearence. Otherwise it retains this faux-selected look and the load progress bar isn't displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n'SafariHighlightBug.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n01-May-2008 07:41 PM Sidney San Martin:\r\nThe issue is present on a clean system running Safari 3.1.1, but I made an error in the original submission. With Safari in its default configuration, the necessary key command is \"command+shift+return\", making the steps to reproduce...\r\n1. Select the address field in the toolbar\r\n2. Enter an address (ex. \"http://apple.com\")\r\n3. Type command+shift+return\r\n\r\nThe rest of the submission remains accurate.\r\n\r\n25-Apr-2008 01:11 PM [redacted]:\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nWe are unable to reproduce the problem.  Can you please upgrade to Safari 3.1.1 and see if you can reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/application_updates/safari311.html\r\n\r\n24-Jun-2008 11:52 AM [redacted]:\r\nThank you for this additional information.  With this clarification we are now able to reproduce the issue, and will continue to work to address it."
