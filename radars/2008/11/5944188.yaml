    description: "17-May-2008 03:13 PM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nI generally write my e-mails by writing my comments between quoted lines of the previous message, like:\r\n\r\n> Hello, HAL do you read me, HAL? \r\nAffirmative, Dave, I read you. \r\n> Open the pod bay doors, HAL. \r\n I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. \r\n> What's the problem? \r\nI think you know what the problem is just as well as I do. \r\n> What are you talking about, HAL? \r\nThis mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it. \r\n> I don't know what you're talking about, HAL? \r\nI know you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen. \r\n>  Where the hell'd you get that idea, HAL? \r\nDave, although you took thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.\r\n\r\n(where the '>' gets replaced with a vertical bar by Mail) Now, generally what I do is put the cursor at the start of the next line and hit return to get a new line that's not quoted. Sometimes when I do that (it may be related to having text that is two quote-levels deep, or being on a boundary between two quote levels), what happens is that, while I get a new line, the quote level of the block below magically increases by one. That is:\r\n\r\n > Hello, HAL do you read me, HAL? \r\nAffirmative, Dave, I read you. |\r\n> Open the pod bay doors, HAL. \r\n I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that. \r\n\r\n(the pipe is supposed to indicate the cursor) after pressing return, becomes:\r\n\r\n> Hello, HAL do you read me, HAL? \r\n|\r\n> Affirmative, Dave, I read you. \r\n> Open the pod bay doors, HAL. \r\n I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.\r\n\r\nIt's a little weird and unpredictable, and I tried recording a movie of it, but couldn't reproduce it readily with any example e-mails I'm allowed to disclose. In the latest occurrence of this, there were a few more oddities:\r\n\r\n1) Occasionally, when I tried to insert a new line in the middle of a quoted paragraph using the return key, it would not add the new line. Nothing seemed to happen when I pressed return. However, if I copied a line break and pasted it, that worked. Maybe the e-mail had inconsistent line endings or something?\r\n\r\n2) A bit later, I changed the colors used for displaying the three quote levels to ever lighter levels of grey. Some of the quotes' bars still had the original blue color (although the text was the correct grey). Also, when I un-indented one of the lines that had magically gotten indented one level too deep after I'd typed a return, it still had its blue color, and wasn't quite indented correctly. While it went from two levels to one, it still had a 2nd-level blue bar, and the baar was offset a few pixels to the right compared to the grey bar of a proper first-level quote.\r\n\r\n3) Sometimes, when I hit return, the grey bar at the side indicating the quote level would go away, but the text itself would still be that color.\r\n\r\nAll of these issues appeared around the time I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.5, so are probably new in that version of Mail or WebKit, in case that helps track down anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17-May-2008 04:47 PM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nIt seems the mail messages that I have this issue with have to be HTML e-mails. So, take an HTML e-mail, reply to it and try to edit two levels of quotes. I have mail set to always send plain text e-mails."
