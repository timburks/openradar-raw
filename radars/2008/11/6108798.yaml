    description: "Summary: \r\nThe display of paths in Terminal when mixing left-to-right scripts, right-to-left scripts and digits is confusing and misleading, because the path components are not treated as individual units.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Terminal window.\r\n2. enter the following sequence of commands:\r\n  - \"mkdir A1\"\r\n  - \"cd A1\"\r\n  - \"mkdir بب\" (two Arabic beh characters; option-0628 with the Unicode Hex Input keyboard layout)\r\n  - \"cd بب\"\r\n  - \"mkdir 2B\"\r\n  - \"cd 2B\"\r\n  - \"pwd\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe working directory path should be displayed as a slash-delimited sequence of components: “...A1/<bet><bet>/2B”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe path is displayed as “...A1/2/<bet><bet>B”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n—\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis example is taken from http://stupid.domain.name/node/682 .\r\nNo complete solution can involve only Terminal; pattern matching would also catch mathematical expressions where this kind of transposition is correct (as per UAX #9). The correct behaviour would be for shells – and any software dealing with paths – to recognize this situation and insert appropriate directional embedding characters."
