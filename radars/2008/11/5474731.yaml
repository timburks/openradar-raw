    description: "11-Sep-2007 12:26 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nCertain JavaScripts can prove to be extremely annoying, such as when sites resize the browser window or mask the status text of the status bar. It would be nice to have \"Advanced\" JavaScript customization options like there are in Firefox. Firefox has the following JavaScript options:\r\n\r\n\"Allow scripts to:\r\n- Move or resize existing windows\r\n- Raise or lower windows\r\n- Disable or replace context menus\r\n- Hide the status bar\r\n- Change status bar text\"\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Safari had those options to disable annoying JavaScript behaviors."
