    description: "NSOperationQueue provides a method to wait until all operations in a queue are complete. However, there does not appear to be a way to wait until a specified NSOperation is complete.\r\n\r\nAn example of where this would be useful is a program which loads a number of files which may not be immediately required. When a file is required and not yet available, the code requiring it should be able to wait (without polling) until it has loaded.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: this behaviour can be implemented by having an operation set a condition on an NSConditionLock when it completes. The disadvantage is that it requires the wait-until-done behaviour to be implemented in each NSOperation, or an intermediate class. An alternative is to implement the waiting as a separate operation dependent on the first, with maximum priority, but this has added complexity, and there is no guarantee of the “watcher” operation running immediately when the “watched” operation completes."
