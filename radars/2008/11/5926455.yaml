    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nWhen a file is renamed in the Finder in icon view by use of the return/enter key, the rename box is shown even if the file's name has been scrolled out of view (see screenshot).\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open a folder containing more than one windowful of items.\r\n2. Ensure the folder is set to icon view, and that you are able to rename items.\r\n3. Select an item in the window, then scroll such that is slightly out of view.\r\n4. Press return or enter, and observe that the window does not scroll to bring the item in view.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nThe file rename box appears where the file's name would be, floating above the Finder window. In other views, the window scrolls to bring the file icon fully into view.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nNone\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n'finderRenameBug_Sidney_San_Martin.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n[Mirrored at http://external.sidneysm.com/radar/finderRenameBug_Sidney_San_Martin.png]"
