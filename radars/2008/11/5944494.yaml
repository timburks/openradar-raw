    description: "17-May-2008 04:12 PM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nI have a control where I need to clip a focus border, sadly, the Cocoa calls set up their own clipping to draw outside the view, ignoring my current clipping region. I've found a workaround using the HITheme APIs, which get clipped, but it would really be useful to be able to pass in a clipping region into Cocoa's focus-drawing calls, particularly since you seem to be eager to kill off HITheme.\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2008 03:51 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nForgot to mention why I would want to clip the focus border: I have a view that contains several parts, some of which overlapping. When my view gets a redraw request for one part overlapping the currently focused part, the focus ring doesn't honor the clipping, and instead redraws the whole focus border. Thus, the parts that didn't need to be redrawn get a \"thicker\" focus border, which keeps growing with each partial redraw of the focused part.\r\n\r\nSo, in the name of effective redraws of multi-part views, please provide alternate ways to draw focus borders that can get clipped."
