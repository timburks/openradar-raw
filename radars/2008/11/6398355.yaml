    description: "Currently Emoji are only supported on iPhone when using a Softbank SIM. As Emoji are pictograms which are easily-recognised globally, it strikes me that it would be useful if they were supported across all regions by iPhone OS (whether on an iPhone or an iPod touch).\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Emoji are implemented as characters from the “private-use” area of Unicode; while possibly less than ideal (in other words: the ideal would be a dedicated Unicode range), this would likely suffice for most intents and purposes—server-side software could perform translation to either ASCII or rich-text containing images as necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease see rdar://problem/6395684 for further reference."
