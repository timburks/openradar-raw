    description: "18-Mar-2008 07:19 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nPages 3.0.2 with Mac OS X 10.5.2.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nInserting a special character into a table cell has an incongruous UI to merely typing into a table cell. When merely typing, double-clicking a cell (so that the cell is highlighted but the cursor is not inserted in the cell) will allow text to be typed into the cell. However, if you choose to insert a special character with only the cell selected (and the cursor not inserted), it will replace the entire table with that character. Instead, to insert a special character, you have to triple-click so that the cursor is inside the cell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new, blank, word processing document in Pages\r\n2. Choose Insert -> Table\r\n3. Click out of the table to put the cursor back in the main document\r\n4. Double-click one of the cells of the table, note how the outline of the cell is highlighted but the cursor is not inserted into the cell\r\n5. Start typing and note how text is properly inserted into the cell\r\n6. Click out of the table to place the cursor in the document again\r\n7. Choose Edit -> Special Characters...\r\n8. Double-click in another cell, again the cell will be highlighted but the cursor will not be in the cell\r\n9. Insert a special character, note how the entire table is replaced with that character\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInserting a special character with only the table cell highlighted (and the cursor not in the cell) should insert that character into the cell rather than replacing the entire table.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTriple-clicking is required to insert a special character into the cell.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown if this was a bug in previous versions."
