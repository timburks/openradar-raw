    description: "Summary: \r\nThere aren't headers for neon included in the base system, even though libneon itself is present.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Terminal:\r\n1) svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk svn\r\n2) cd svn\r\n3) ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-apxs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSubversion builds with libsvn_ra_neon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSubversion fails to find neon because the headers aren't there.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known, Mac OS X never shipped with neon before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to grab neon sources and stuff them in the svn source tree as explained by the configure script. This is undesirable because the included version of neon would work just fine."
