    description: "The ABPersonViewControllerDelegate delegate protocol has a handy method for customizing what happens when a piece of information (address, phone, URL, etc) is selected:\r\n-personViewController:shouldPerformDefaultActionForPerson:property:identifier:\r\n\r\nHowever, ABUnknownPersonViewControllerDelegate and ABNewPersonViewControllerDelegate, which present the same information and take the same actions, do not have this method.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it could be added to these classes."
