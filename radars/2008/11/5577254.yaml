    description: "02-Nov-2007 01:42 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nSummary: \r\nNSPathControl’s default drag and drop filtering does not work when the view is restricted to directory types. It functions as expected when unrestricted and when restricted to specific file types.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Interface Builder 3.0, create a Cocoa window document.\r\n2. Add a Path Control.\r\n3. Run the nib in the simulator.\r\n4. Drag some files and folders to the path control. Note that it accepts both files and folders.\r\n5. Quit the simulator.\r\n6. In the inspector, change Types from “Allow all” to “Restrict to specified.”\r\n7. In the type list, add “public.folder”.\r\n8. Run the nib in the simulator again.\r\n9. Drag some files and folders to the path control again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe control should accept dragged folders, and reject files and packages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe control rejects all dragged items.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe same error occurs when the public.directory UTI is used.\r\nImplementing workaround of filtering drops manually."
