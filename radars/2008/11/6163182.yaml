    description: When detecting network connectivity, it is only possible to determine if a "cellular" network is being used or not - not which type of "cellular" network is in use.  The speed differences between 3G and EDGE are significant and enable the transmission of higher quality audio and video content, it would be extremely helpful if a flag was added to SCNetworkReachability to allow for this determination.
