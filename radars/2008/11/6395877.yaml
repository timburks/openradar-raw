    description: "Summary: \r\nUsing the default Xcode iPhone project settings, if you specify a Product Name that ends in the + character, the application will not install on an iPhone. It builds successfully, but the installation fails during the Verifying Application stage with the following error:\r\n\r\n0xE800003A\r\nApplicationVerificationFailed\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a iPhone project named Test+\r\n2. Configure the codesigning for the project to run on your iPhone\r\n3. Build and run the application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the application to install and run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application fails to install with the 0xE800003A / ApplicationVerificationFailed error.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis previously worked with the iPhone 2.1 SDK.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe I've worked around this by removing the + character from the Product Name value and including the + in the CFBundleDisplayName value of Info.plist and the localized InfoPlist.strings files."
