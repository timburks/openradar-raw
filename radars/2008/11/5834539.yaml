    description: "01-Apr-2008 09:15 AM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nBoth UILabel and UITextView implement a setText method. Unfortunately, without a NSAttributedString implementation in the iPhone SDK Foundation, there's no way to style text within these controls.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases in my application where I would like style a run of text within these controls. The styles would include text color changes (NSForegroundColorAttributeName), fonts (NSFontAttributeName) and adding links (NSLinkAttributeName).\r\n\r\nPrevious (unreleased) versions of the iPhone SDK supported a setHTML method on the UITextView control. This was a simple way to achieve the same goal without the overhead of attributed strings. In my opinion, it didn't unduly expose the underlying implementation.\r\n\r\nAlso, with the current inability of UIWebView to open external links (rdar://problem/5801242) and disable the scroll view (rdar://problem/5801194) there is no acceptable workaround to the issue of styled text with embedded links within a single control.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge usability issue. Imagine having a Mail application without styling and embedded links."
