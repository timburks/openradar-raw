    description: "Summary:\r\nASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX is an operator unto itself, but should actually be a modifier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a query message using asl_new.\r\n2. Set a property of the message with the value set to a regular expression and the operator set to ASL_QUERY_OP_NOT_EQUAL | ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX.\r\n3. Pass the message to asl_search.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe response contains messages where the value of the searched-for property does not match the regular expression.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe response contains messages where the value of the searched-for property matches the regular expression.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. It was the same way on Tiger (except that Tiger's ASL did not presume ASL_QUERY_OP_SUBSTRING, as Leopard's ASL correctly does).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe most obvious use case defeated by the current nature of ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX is that you cannot search for messages that don't match the expression.\r\n\r\nThe manpage lists ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX as an operator, which matches reality as of Leopard. However, the header lists it among the modifiers of other operators.\r\n\r\nFor compatibility, ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX alone should remain a valid operator value, equivalent to ASL_QUERY_OP_EQUAL | ASL_QUERY_OP_SUBSTRING | ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX. Also, for compatibility with Leopard (if not Tiger), ASL_QUERY_OP_SUBSTRING should be presumed whenever ASL_QUERY_OP_REGEX is present, unless either ASL_QUERY_OP_PREFIX or ASL_QUERY_OP_SUFFIX (or both) is also present, or the expression says otherwise (^, $, or both)."
