    description: "Summary: \r\nTime Machine backs up intermediate and final build products. This is redundant, because as long as the sources are backed up there's no need to spend backup space on the build products.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Write an app or checkout the source code to some large project, like Adium.\r\n2) Build the app\r\n3) Connect your Time Machine disk and allow it to back up\r\n4) Edit some sources, or run svn update and receive loads of changes\r\n5) Build again\r\n6) Have Time Machine back up again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Machine correctly backs up the changed source files, but not the built products.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime Machine backs up the changed source files *and* the built products.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. TIme Machine is new in 10.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can work around this by building everything to the same directory and telling Time Machine to ignore that directory, but this can be inconvenient or potentially dangerous if you build multiple branches of the same application.\r\nBackup Core provides the call CSBackupSetItemExcluded() which would allow Xcode to disable backups of build products directories."
