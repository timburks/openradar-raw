    description: "05-Jun-2006 03:25 AM Jens Ayton:\r\nSummary: \r\nCocoa floating panels (palettes) respond to File->Close commands. However, established Mac behaviour is that the Close command does not affect palettes but goes to the frontmost document window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nOpen TextEdit and create a new document if necessary. Open the Font panel (cmd-T). Click in the font panel. Press cmd-W.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThe frontmost document window - the “main” window in Cocoa parlance - should close, or, if it has unsaved changes, a confirmation sheet should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nThe Font panel closes.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nAs far as I am aware, this has been the case in all versions of Cocoa. It appears to be a side-effect of retrofitting the Mac concept of palettes onto Nextstep.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nThe current Human Interface Guidelines do not seem to cover this issue. However, many Carbon applications, including major productivity applications, continue to implement the correct Macintosh-style palette behaviour. For consistency and usability reasons, Cocoa should follow this precedent.\r\n\r\nWhen the Character Palette is key, the Close command is disabled. It should still affect the frontomst document window."
