    description: "05-Jan-2007 04:23 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nImageIO is being pushed as the standard way of reading and writing multiple graphics file formats for OS X. As such, it replaces the ImageCompression component of QuickTime, which has been with us for around a decade. It would be reasonable, then, to expect it to cover the same high-level feature set.\r\n\r\nOne significant design feature of QuickTime is its modularity; in the context of ImageCompression, this primarily means its ability to use components to handle new file formats. It seems natural that a replacement for ImageCompression would similarly allow the use of plug-ins to handle new, custom or specialist file formats, and in fact the idea that it wouldn’t didn’t strike me until I sat down to write an ImageIO importer module, and discovered that there was no such thing.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a widely-deployed file format, it would be reasonable to request that built-in support be added to ImageIO. However, in the case of a specialised format that’s unlikely to be used directly by more than a few thousand people, this is clearly not reasonable; however, for such specialist formats to be useable in common software such as Preview would clearly be useful.\r\n\r\nIt is my suggestion and request that ImageIO should be extended to support loadable modules for importing and exporting graphics. In addition, developers of software using custom graphics formats should be strongly encouraged to develop such modules to simplify exchange of graphics between programs. To avoid placing a complexity burden on the user, such modules should be loadable from within an application bundle in the same way as a Spotlight metadata indexer plug-in is. In fact, the metadata indexer is a good metaphor: in the same way that custom data formats should be searchable and introspectable by generic tools like Spotlight and the Finder, custom image formats should be at the very least viewable by generic tools like Preview and iPhoto."
