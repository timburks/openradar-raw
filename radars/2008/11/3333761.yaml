    description: "The errors and warnings list in the project window of xCode is useless to me, the way it is now. Most error messages that GCC produces are long and do not fit on a single line in that window (especially when working with C++ and templates, e.g. how std::string does its iterators). Please change the list so the text is wrapped and we can see the entire error message.\r\n\r\nIt took me quite a while to realize the old Errors & Warnings window was still there, where I can open the split pane to see the raw, wrapped compiler output. But this is nothing you can expect new users of xCode to find out of their own."
