    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is currently no SDK-supported way to apply text styling to selected portions of a UILabel or UITextView, and the only way to achieve selective formatting is with a UIWebView which is not ideal or usable is a vast number of situations because of limitations specific to UIWebView (such as the inability to make it transparent, for one). This keeps developers from doing a wide range of things with their applications or makes them rely on much less efficient and unnecessary hacks.\r\n\r\nSee rdar://problem/5834539."
