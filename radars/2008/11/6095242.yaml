    description: "22-Jul-2008 06:05 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode 3.1 (iPhone SDK) does not provide an error in the logs when building a distribution binary and the build settings point to a non-existant provisioning profile. The binary package gets created, but the file \"embedded.mobileprovision\" is never included - preventing the AppStore from accepting that binary. No error points to what the issue might be, even though an incorrect profile (non-existant in my case) was referenced \r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nI had set a target-level build setting that was overriding a project-level setting for the distribution profile. While the project level settings were correct, the target level setting (set to a no-longer-existing or valid provisioning profile) was overriding it. There was no way to determine from the build log that the file \"embedded.mobileprovision\" had not been included in the application bundle.\r\n\r\nXcode should at least provide a warning that a referenced file does not exist, if not completely error out and fail the build. More beneficially, a validation component or application  would be much better that could validate a distribution application package and provide detailed error messages for why it will not be accepted in the AppStore."
