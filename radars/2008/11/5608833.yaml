    description: "The following errors and omissions can be found in the section ‘Property List Key Reference’ of the document ‘Runtime Configuration Guidelines’, found at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/PListKeys.html .\r\n\r\nUnder LSHasLocalizedDisplayName:\r\n‘If this key exists and is set to “1”,…’\r\nIn conjunction with the style used elsewhere in the document, this suggests that the key cannot be set to a boolean type. If this is the case, it should be explicitly documented (and considered an implementation bug). It is also unclear whether the “1” should be a string or a number.\r\nAdditionally, it is unclear whether setting this to 0 or false would avoid the slowdown incurred by having CFBundleDisplayName in Info.plist but not InfoPList.strings, which would be useful information even though that usage is discouraged.\r\n\r\nUnder CFBundleDocumentTypes:\r\n‘When registering document types, you must specify at least one of the keys LSItemContentTypes, CFBundleTypeExtensions, CFBundleTypeMIMETypes, or CFBundleTypeOSTypes along with the appropriate data. If you do not specify at least one of these keys, no document types are bound to the type-name specifier. You may use all three keys when binding your document type, if you so choose.’\r\nShould say ‘…all four keys…’. (Using all four keys would still be relevant for an application supporting Mac OS X 10.3.9 and earlier.)\r\n\r\nUnder CFBundleExecutable:\r\n‘If the keys are not the same, the target system may incur some launch-performance penalties. for launch-performance reasons. The value should not include any extension on the name.’\r\nAt a minimum, this should be re-punctuated as ‘If the keys are not the same, the target system may incur some launch-performance penalties. For launch-performance reasons, the value should not include any extension on the name.’ However, ‘the keys’ is inaccurate in context. It appears that the author was distracted at this point.\r\n\r\nUnder NSHumanReadableCopyright:\r\n‘This key replaces the obsolete CFBundleGetInfoString key.’\r\nUntrue. CFBundleGetInfoString still (in 10.5.1) takes precedence for the Get Info window in the Finder. As it is prefixed with the label ‘Version:’ in this context, but the version is displayed separately in the About panel, it is generally desirable to keep these strings separate.\r\n\r\nUnder NSMainNibFile:\r\n‘This key contains a string with the name of the application’s main nib file (minus the .nib extension). … The main nib file is automatically loaded when an application is launched. Mac OS X looks for a file whose name matches the name of the application.’\r\nIt is unclear what the last sentence means. Presumably it should say, ‘If no NSMainNibFile key is found, …’.\r\n\r\nUnder NSPersistentStoreTypeKey:\r\n‘This key contains a string that specifies the type of Core Data persistent store associated with a document type (see “CFBundleDocumentTypes”). See NSPersistentStoreCoordinator_Store_Types for possible values.’\r\nBroken cross-reference, should link to http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSPersistentStoreCoordinator_Class/Reference/NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Store_Types"
