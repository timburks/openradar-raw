    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Date header in email messages from the Radar system does not include the century. As such, Mail displays such dates as being from the 20th century.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive an email from Radar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDate: 12 Feb 2008 10:16:58 -0800\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDate: 12 Feb 08 10:16:58 -0800\r\n(which Mail shows as “February 12, 1908” in the preview pane and message window, and “February 12, 2008” in the viewer window's list of messages)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot that I know of.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to be either an implementation oversight or a configuration error in the software that Radar uses to send emails, XMail."
