    description: "16-Jan-2008 02:32 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nWhen my MacBook Pro running 10.5.1 is sleeping with or without the lid closed, at midnight local time, the iCal dock icon does not update to the new date.\r\n\r\nEven once the macbook pro comes out of sleep it still never updates.\r\n\r\nI have tried opening iCal to fix the issue, however when iCal opens it changes to the correct date, but once iCal is closed it goes back to the wrong date.\r\n\r\nIf this happens several days in a row, the iCal icon can show as being several days off.\r\n\r\nI have found no way to fix this, except waiting until 12:01am to put the laptop into sleep mode, but this is not even an acceptable work around.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot attached shows the output of the date command along with iCal's dock icon showing the wrong date.\r\n\r\n\r\n'wrongicaldate.png' was successfully uploaded"
