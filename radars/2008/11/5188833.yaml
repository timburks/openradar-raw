    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nNSURLConnection does not support the \"Expect: 100-continue\" header.  Without this header, uploading a file using POST to server that uses HTTP authentication results in uploads taking twice as long as necessary.\r\n\r\n  <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.20>\r\n\r\n  <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3>\r\n\r\nWithout 100-continue, the HTTP client uploads the whole file, only to get a 401 response from the server.  The client then needs to upload the file *again*, this time with the proper credentials.  With 100-continue, the HTTP client pauses before sending the body.  This allows the server to respond with a 401 before \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\nUpload a file using NSURLConnection and POST against a server with HTTP authentication.  I've attached a small PHP app that contains a form and PHP script to accept the upload.  The script, `private/uploader.php` is protected with the username \"foo\", password \"bar\".  A small Cocoa app that POSTs to \"private/uploader.php\" using NSURLConnection is required.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\n\r\nWhile running a network trace, such as tcpdump or Wireshark, the upload should only occur once, with the first upload interrupted with a 401 response, instead of a 100 Continue.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\n\r\nThe network trace shows the file uploaded twice.  The first one is discarded and wastedful since the server responds with a 401.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nOther HTTP client libraries like libcurl and .Net support 100-continue.  However, they usually allow a way to disable this behavior in case a program needs to work around a buggy server that does not implement HTTP 1.1 correctly.\r\n\r\n  <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTPOST>\r\n\r\n  <http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepoint.expect100continue.aspx>\r\n\r\n\r\n'php-upload.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded"
