    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen sending the STOP signal to a process in order to temporarily pause it (perhaps because it's doing something expensive and I need to temporarily be able to use my computer), the system notices that the process is \"not responding\" and subsequently runs spindump on it (which uses a significant amount of CPU, nullifying the advantage of STOPing the process)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Find the PID of your annoying process\r\n2. kill -STOP [PID]\r\n3. Watch spindump dutifully logging nothing\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n3. Spindump notices that the reason the app is not responding is because the kernel has STOPed it, and thus doesn't launch"
