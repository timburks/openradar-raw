    description: "Summary:\r\nNeither the system nor Property List Editor specifies a UTI for property lists. This is desireable because it would allow the type of plist-derived formats to be specified more accurately, and should allow arabitrary property-list files to be opened in Property List Editor from the Finder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: n/a\r\nExpected Results: n/a\r\nActual Results: n/a\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nIt would be good if there were a general property-list type (public.property-list, conforming to public.data), and subtypes for specific property-list formats (public.xml-property-list = {public.property-list, public.xml}, public.text-property-list = {public.property-list, public.text} and public.binary-property-list = {public.property-list}). This would allow an application that always writes documents as XML property lists to specify such, so said documents could be edited with XML or plist editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n28-Oct-2007 04:11 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nAs far as I can see, this issue has _not_ been addressed in any way in Leopard.\r\n\r\n29-Oct-2007 04:16 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nOK, confirmed.\r\n\r\n(Comment: UTIs exist – com.apple.property-list, com.apple.xml-property-list, com.apple.binary-property-list – but are undocumented; see rdar://5662775)"
