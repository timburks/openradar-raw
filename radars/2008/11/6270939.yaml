    description: "05-Oct-2008 11:32 AM Eric Blair:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen the topmost view controller in a UINavigavitonController contained in UITabBarController has hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES and displays a ABNewPersonViewController controller, the tab bar can be redisplayed when the ABNewPersonViewController is dimissed.\r\n\r\nThe key for reproducing the bug is displaying the edit interfaces for one of the contact card details. You do not have to save either the detail or the entire contact.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached NewPersonViewControllerExample implements these steps.\r\n1. Push a view controller subclass onto the the navigation controller that has self.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES\r\n2. DIsplay a ABNewPersonViewController from the top view controller.\r\n3. Edit one of the details in the new person contact.\r\n4. Cancel the ABNewPersonViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the new person view controller to dismiss and tab bar to be hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new person view controller is dismiss and tab bar is displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n'NewPersonControllerExample.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n05-Oct-2008 01:49 PM Eric Blair:\r\nThe attached NewPersonControllerExmaple demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n21-Nov-2008 07:11 AM Eric Blair:\r\nStill present in 2.2.\r\n\r\nI suspect what happens is that one of view controllers in the the ABNewPersonViewController hierarchy sets hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES to true. When that view controller gets popped off the stack, the bottom bar of the view displaying the modal ABNewPersonViewController gets restored. (Thus the change in title).\r\n\r\nMarked as a dupe of 6603713"
