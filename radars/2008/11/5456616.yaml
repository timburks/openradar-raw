    description: "01-Sep-2007 04:42 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCurrently Safari respects the non-standard “autocomplete” form attribute, refusing to prompt a user to save their form password in the Mac OS X Keychain in line with user preferences.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour means that Safari allows a site author's preferences to override those of the end-user, which is contrary to most other Safari preference options (pop-up windows, Java, JavaScript, plug-ins, etc.)\r\n\r\nSuggested fix:\r\n\r\nEither ignore the “autocomplete” attribute altogether; or\r\nignore the “autocomplete” attribute when applied to input fields of type “password”; or\r\nadd an addition preference of “Also save usernames and passwords for sites which disable AutoComplete”.\r\n\r\n04-Sep-2007 05:09 PM SABRINA FULLHART:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
