    description: "08-Mar-2008 03:47 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nBeing able to automatically test iPhone applications in the Aspen Simulator would be greatly enhanced by enabling scripted tests against the simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a feature request to enable scripted UI interations for testing 3rd party applications through the UI simulator. Opening up either AppleScript dictionaries of the simulator, or a plugin model to enable PyObjC or RubyCocoa to do the same work - generating events on the application - would be very valuable."
