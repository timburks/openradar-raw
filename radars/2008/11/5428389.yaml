    description: "22-Aug-2007 03:03 AM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nXcode has \"build errors and warnings\" smart group and a \"build progress\" window. The former can be clicked in the \"groups and files\" pane to be shown on the right, however it is fairly useless to keep oneself apprised of build progress:\r\n\r\nIt only shows the file and the error message. There is no option to show the errors in the order they occurred, and there's no way to show errors grouped by the target or sub-project in which they occurred. When several people are working on one project, and with some third-party code in my project, I want to ignore warnings in certain targets (because they're up to someone else to fix).\r\n\r\nPlease add at least a \"Target\" column to the errors and warnings smart group, and add a way to have errors sorted in the order they came back from the compiler. Bonus points for actually giving us the \"build progress\" window's contents in the details pane, but with sorting like in the \"errors and warnings\" smart group. If I need to have that second pane open because otherwise the smart search field is useless (see other bug), I'd prefer if it showed some more useful info during builds.\r\n\r\nThanks."
