    description: "17-Jun-2008 04:36 PM Alex Curylo:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nThere is (apparently) no way to access the user's Address Book entry on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Look for an equivalent in the iPhone SDK to\r\n\r\nABPerson* iPhoneUser = [[ABAddressBook sharedAddressBook] me];\r\n\r\n2. FAIL.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo find some way to access that information, which really shouldn't be that difficult, you'd think.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCould not find any way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is with beta 7 released at WWDC.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNo notes, that's pretty much it."
