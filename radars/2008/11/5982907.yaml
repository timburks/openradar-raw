    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen trying to rearrange the default layout of a toolbar in Interface Builder, change are not saved unless an item is added to the toolbar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new IB project with a Window\r\n2. Add a toolbar to that window\r\n3. Add some items to that toolbar\r\n4. Click done\r\n5. Double click on the toolbar and then try to rearrange or remove items from the toolbar (do not add any items)\r\n6. Click done and close the window\r\n7. Re-open the window to find the toolbar reverted back to it's previous arrangement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe toolbar should have been updated and retain the changes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe toolbar has reverted to it's previous state\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've tested this on beta 5 and had it confirmed to occur in beta 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs long as you remove and re-add an item it will update so it is possible to work around it, though obviously this is not the ideal scenario."
