    description: "28-Oct-2007 04:28 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nAs demonstrated in the attached screen shot, the baselines of NSButtons and NSSegmentedControls of Round Rect style do not align properly. The text baseline of the NSSegmentedControl needs to be raised by one point.\r\n\r\nProperly-written bug report lost due to the incompetence of the drunk monkeys who maintain this travesty of a web app. However, it should take about 40 seconds in Interface Builder to confirm the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n'segmented-control-alignment.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n[See: http://jens.ayton.se/pictures/segmented-control-alignment.png]"
