    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nIn a past rev of My Info (https://myinfo.apple.com/), there was a single information page instead of the current \"address book\" model. This featured a company field, which no longer exists. However, data from \"company\" (and possibly other fields) have been retained, and are displayed in Bug Reporter.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nThis bug can only be \"reproduced\" by examining old Apple IDs which had a \"company\" set before this field was removed.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nIn my contact information for this bug, for instance, my company is listed as \"Montclair Public Schools\" â€” which hasn't been true for years, though there's been no way to change it.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nUnless I'm totally missing the place to update this, the last time I saw a company field in My Info was years ago, but it's continued show up here. I'm also associated with a different company in GSX, but this hasn't affected anything. I'm a little bit surprised that the information's still there, more surprised that Bug Reporter pulls it and includes in in Contact Information. The bug is even more annoying now that Bug Reporter has been updated and no longer lets me edit my contact info before submitting a bug report.\r\n\r\n16-May-2008 03:20 PM [redacted]:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate. We are tracking this known issue under the Bug ID listed above in the bug State (Duplicate/XXXX). To check the status of the original bug report, please send an email to devbugs@apple.com referencing your Bug ID."
