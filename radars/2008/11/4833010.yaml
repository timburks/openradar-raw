    description: "12-Nov-2006 08:48 AM Mo McRoberts:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Get Info window title treats contact IDs as printf-style format strings.\r\n\r\nWhen connected to a Jabber server, it is possible that a contact ID (sign-in name) may contain a percentage sign (%). This character is both legal, and is used to substitute the at-sign (@) in places where an at-sign is not legal. One example of this is where a user's contact list contains contacts from a remote service, such as MSN messenger. In this instance, user@hotmail.com is typically returned in the user's roster as user%hotmail.com@msn.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nAdd a contact containing a printf-style format specifier (e.g., test%scenario@apple.com) and choose ‘Get Info’ after highlighting the contact in the list.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe ‘Get Info’ window title should, in the absence of appropriate Address Book information, show the contact ID exactly as it is in the roster.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nWhen highlighting a contact with a percentage sign in their ID and who does not have an Address Book card and choosing ‘Get Info’, the '%ho' is replaced in the window title as though it were being parsed as a printf-style format string with a random 16-bit octal number presumably passed on the stack somewhere (for example, ‘user57650tmail.com@msn’).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, adding a contact containing '%s' and choosing ‘Get Info’ causes random characters to replace the ‘%s’ part of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n08-Dec-2007 02:47 PM Mo McRoberts mailto:mo@nevali.net:\r\nI can confirm that this bug has been resolved in Leopard."
