    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nSafari 3.1's \"Open Page With...\" menu should not list the MobileSafari included with the iPhone SDK since it just bounces in the dock and quits immediately.  An alternative would be to launch MobileSafari in the Aspen Simulator. Either way, the current behavior is less than ideal.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Install iPhone SDK.\r\n2. Open Safari 3.1.\r\n3. Go to Develop -> Open Page With... -> MobileSafari.\r\n\r\n* EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nMobileSafari to not be listed or to open it in the Aspen Simulator.\r\n\r\n* ACTUAL RESULTS\r\nMobileSafari appears in the dock, bounces, and quits.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nNone."
