    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iTunes does not have focus, controls and chrome to change to a dimmed state, but text and images (Apple logo, playlist icons, button labels) stay fully visible. In the iPod/iPhone summary view, blurring iTunes causes the device picture to become dimmed. This is inconsistent with iTunes' behavior as a whole and distracting to the user (because the picture takes up a sizable chunk of the iTunes window, even on larger displays, and also because it generally has high contrast to the rest of the interface).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure iTunes is launched, an iPhone or iPod is connected, and the device's Summary tab is active\r\n2. Switch to another application (by clicking on the Desktop, for instance)\r\n3. Switch back to iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device picture keeps full opacity throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device picture becomes dimmed when iTunes is not the active application.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI first noticed this after upgrading to iTunes 8. The issue may have existed earlier.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy main point here is consistency: no other image or image-like elements in iTunes have this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n'iTunes Device Picture Dimmed.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n20-Oct-2008 10:49 AM [redacted] :\r\nWe believe that this issue is resolved with iTunes 8.0.\r\n\r\nThis application is available for download at \r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/itunes8formacintosh.html (for Mac)\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/downloads/itunes8forwindows.html (for Windows)\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether or not you continue to experience this issue with the newly released software by updating this bug report.\r\n\r\n25-Oct-2008 02:45 PM Sidney San Martin:\r\nThanks for addressing it.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
