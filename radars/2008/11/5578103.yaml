    description: "03-Nov-2007 02:46 AM Antonio Malara:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn some applications such as Safari or Adium, when pressing the Shift + Up Arrow + Backspace key combination, common when deleting the last line, the text system will input an annoying invisible 0x7f character, while it should only delete the selection.\r\nIt seems that all the applications affected use the Cocoa text system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Open Safari\r\n• In the url bar or in the search bar press the Shift+Up+Backspace\r\n• Hit Enter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat keystroke should be interpreted as \"delete an empty field\", so the result should be the same as issuing an empty url or an empty search.\r\n\r\nActual Resuts:\r\nNotice that Safari will try to access http://%7f/ if tried in the address bar, or it will try to search google with the url http://www.google.com/search?q=%7F.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe issue is present in both OS X 10.4.x and 10.5.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n21-Nov-2007 02:30 PM SABRINA FULLHART:\r\nPlease know that our engineers have not been able to reproduce this reported behavior.\r\n\r\nShould you continue to encounter this issue, please provide any information that would assist engineering in reproducing this reported behavior.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n04-Sep-2008 04:01 PM Antonio Malara:\r\nI've made a couple new tests, the issue is not fixed and 100% reproductable.\r\n\r\nNow i'm running os x 9E17.\r\n\r\nThe issue is present in brand-new machines and it's not related to localization, i can reproduce it with an Italian OS, and with American English installations.\r\n\r\nDuring WWDC08 i've reported the issue directly to an Apple Engineer at the Foundation Lab, and he could reproduce the issue on his machine.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with this area of os x, if you can point me to any documentation or tests i can do for helping."
