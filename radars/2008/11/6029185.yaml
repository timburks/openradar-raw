    description: "23-Jun-2008 03:43 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nYou should be able to choose which email account to send emails from when composing a new message in MobileMail. Also, if you have a dummy address set up, that should be selectable. A \"dummy address\" is where you have multiple email addresses attached to the same account; in Apple Mail on Leopard you specify this by separating multiple addresses with a comma in the Account Settings preference. For example, you could set up in Apple Mail one account a@example.com but then also have b@example.com just be a mask for that account, so you could send mail from either address using one set of server settings."
