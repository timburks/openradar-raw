    description: "06-Nov-2007 11:18 AM Robert Sesek:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe confirmation dialog for removing a system font does not properly bind the escape key to the \"Cancel\" button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Font Book, select a system font\r\n2. Press the \"Delete\" key to delete the font\r\n3. In the error dialog that pops up (\"Are you sure you want to remove the selected fonts? The current selection contains system fonts. Disabling system fonts may adversely affect some applications.\"), hit the ESC/escape key on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dialog sheet should be closed and the font should not be removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead of canceling the operation, hitting escape removes the font.\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.5.0, with Font Book 2.1 (123)."
