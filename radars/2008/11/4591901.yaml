    description: "19-Jun-2006 12:10 PM\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen in fullscreen mode, iPhoto hides inactive controls, such as the editing tools at the bottom, or the picture selector at the top of the screen. If a second screen is present either above or below the one showing iPhoto, not only do these controls appear on that screen, but hovering over them causes them to bounce back and forth between 'shown' and 'hidden' wildly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n0. Use more than one monitor, positioned so that one is above the other.\r\n1. Launch iPhoto, and click the Full Screen button.\r\n2. Position the cursor in the middle of the iPhoto monitor, and wait for the controls to recede from view.\r\n3. Move the cursor to the other monitor, where you can see one of the controls.\r\n4. Hover over the 'off-screen' control.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nI expected the controls to disappear when they recede from the full screen iPhoto, not just move off screen in such a way as to be displayed on another screen. Additionally, if the cursor is anywhere above or below the 'trigger line' for the control, I expect it to be displayed. With multiple monitors, the screen edges aren't always as easy to hit as they would be with a single screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nBy hovering over a 'hidden' control, visible on another monitor, the control will transition into 'visible' on the full screen monitor, and then, as the mouse is still on the other monitor, it will transition back, only to hit the cursor again, and repeat this action as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nIf you position the Apple menu bar such that it is at the top of the full screen, it is not possible to  trigger this problem with the photo selector. The control will still be displayed on the other monitor however, but the 'bouncing' cannot be triggered, although if you move your cursor to the other screen before iPhoto has gone full screen, you can interact with the control somewhat while it is 'off-screen'.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nIt is possible to access the controls, either by not causing the bouncing by hitting only a single pixel line at the top or bottom of the screen, or by 'guiding' the controls onto the screen by dragging (not via clicking, just moving) after hovering over them."
