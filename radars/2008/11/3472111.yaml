    description: "The header NSGraphics.h contains a number of functions for drawing various graphics primitives:\r\n\r\n NSDrawWhiteBezel, NSDrawButton, NSDrawLightBezel, NSDrawDarkBezel, NSDrawGroove\r\n\r\nThese functions would be very useful for drawing various parts of custom views. However, the actual drawings they produce still look like MacOS 9's Platinum appearance (or NextStep's grey window manager?), and look out of place in the fresh and new Aqua experience.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to adjust some of the colors used by these routines to fit the softer and lighter color scheme of MacOS X, or to even make them the equivalent of the Appearance Manager's drawing calls for drawing buttons, sliders, image wells etc."
