    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging the UI scale factor while the Application Switcher is open causes it to change size in the wrong direction (bigger instead of smaller, or vice versa).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Quartz Debug.\r\n2. Set the UI scale factor to 3.0.\r\n3. Make sure the “Restore scale factor to default (1.0) on quit” checkbox is checked.\r\n4. Wait for the Dock to change size.\r\n5. Press and hold down ⌘⇥.\r\n6. Use ⇥ or ⇧⇥ to select Quartz Debug, if necessary. Continue holding down ⌘.\r\n7. Press Q (that is, ⌘Q).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs Quartz Debug quits and sets the scale factor back to 1, Dock again resizes its windows, including the Application Switcher. It shrinks the Application Switcher down from 3x to 1x.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs Quartz Debug quits and sets the scale factor back to 1, Dock again resizes its windows, including the Application Switcher. It blows the Application Switcher up from 3x to 9x.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTiger's Dock didn't react immediately to scale-factor changes, so this problem is new in Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
