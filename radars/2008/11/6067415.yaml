    description: "10-Jul-2008 01:57 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nThe AppStore needs a Demo/Trial feature.\r\n\r\nThis could work much like renting movies on a AppleTV.\r\nYou download a free demo and then either from the time you download, or the time you first open the application, you have say 24 hours to test the program.\r\n\r\nAfter that set amount of time, the application no longer works.\r\n\r\nThis would allow users to know if an application is worth paying for before actually spending the money."
