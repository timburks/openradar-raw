    description: "The Spotlight menu extra's menu in the upper right of the screen only contains a search field when nothing has been entered, but once results are coming in, it suddenly gains a \"Show all\" menu item to bring up the Spotlight Results window, and another menu item to bring up the Spotlight pane in System Preferences.\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent, and makes it unreliable for users to find the Spotlight Preferences or bring up a Spotlight search in a window without having memorized the Command-Option-Space shortcut.\r\n\r\nPlease change the menu to always contain a \"Spotlight Preferences...\" item, and add a \"Show Spotlight Window\" menu item to take the place of \"Show All\" in the case that no search results are currently being shown."
