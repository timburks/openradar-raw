    description: "11-Jul-2004 01:01 AM Joseph Heck:\r\nGood evening,\r\n\r\nThis is a request to consider adding functionality to .MAC to enable it to act as a subversion server. I am already a .mac subscriber, and would really like the additional functionality so that I could have a software repository \"in the sky\" and universally available to all my workstations.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
