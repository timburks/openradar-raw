    description: "12-Feb-2008 04:23 PM Nicola Del Monaco:\r\nThis happens when I burn more than one disc at once (I have a SuperDrive and an External Samsung DVD Recorder).\r\n\r\nI start the burning of a dmg image, then I start burning another dmg image with the other recorder.\r\n\r\nThe status window doesn't work well and if the SECOND started writing ends BEFORE the first one, you got this strage status window behaviour, where you can't check progress on writing...\r\n\r\nI hope it's easy for you to reproduce...\r\n\r\n\r\n'Immagine 5.png' was successfully uploaded"
