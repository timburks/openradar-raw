    description: "Summary: \r\nOn Tiger, we can select a portion (containing both text and images) of webpage and then invoke the application service called \"Make New Sticky Note\", it will make a new sticky with the selected text and images. However, on Leopard the service no longer copy images. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select some text and images of webpage in Safari.\r\n2. Press Cmd-Shift-Y or select the Services menu: Make New Sticky Note.\r\n3. There's no step three.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStickies.app launch with a new sticky containing the text and images selected in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly text were copied. Images were lost.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn Tiger, this function works well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHowever, if I manually select, copy and paste into a new sticky, it works."
