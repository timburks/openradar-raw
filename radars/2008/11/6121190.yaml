    description: "02-Aug-2008 01:02 PM Martin Pilkington:\r\nThere seems to be a funky redrawing bug in the fonts & colors table in Xcode 3.1's prefs. To reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Make sure the Prefs window is small enough to require you to scroll the fonts & colors table\r\n- Scroll to the bottom of the table\r\n- Make the Prefs window taller\r\n- Scroll up\r\n\r\nBelow are screenshots of the bug in two builds of Xcode on two machines:\r\n\r\nMacBook C2D 1.83GHz (950GMA graphics, 2GB RAM, 10.5.4, Xcode 3.1 build 1078): http://dropbox.mcubedsw.com/skitchpics/Xcode_1078-20080802-215110.png\r\n\r\niMac CD 1.83GHz (ATI Radeon X1600, 2GB RAM, 10.5.4, Xcode 3.1 build 1099): http://dropbox.mcubedsw.com/skitchpics/Xcode_1099-20080802-215227.png\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Aug-2008 01:22 AM Martin Pilkington:\r\nI've just checked for all input managers and such, there were 3 on my iMac which I removed and restarted Xcode but I'm still having the same problem. On the MacBook there haven't been any.  As for any sort of Xcode extension, I didn't know you could have them so unless someone has installed something in the background and extensions are installed in some hidden place then it should be a bog standard Xcode install."
