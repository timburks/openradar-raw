    description: "21-Nov-2008 03:31 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nThere is currently no location in an application bundle where one can put a helper application (like a daemon that launches the main application when a certain scheduled time has been reached) that should be quit when the application is removed. It would be nice to have a bundle sub-folder to hold helper executables that will automatically get quit when the enclosing bundle is deleted.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, every time the user tries to delete the application, they get an error message saying 'the file XY is in use and could not be deleted' until they log out or restart.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only workaround is installing the helper in Application Support, which means it is left behind when the user deletes the application."
