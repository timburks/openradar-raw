    description: "11-May-2008 12:11 PM Joseph Heck:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nPlease backport the UIImageView properties and functionality into NSImageView.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nThe ability to define an array of UIImage objects to a property for animation within an UIImageView is incredibly neat. From reading the details in NSImageView, the core functionality is in there already to animate a set of images, but it's not available as a property setup along with the animation timing and looping. Instead, it appears to \"get that information from the image data\" - nothing further documented about it.\r\n\r\nI'm relating this to the iPhone OS SDK beta 5 (5A274d) implementation of the UIImageVIew class."
