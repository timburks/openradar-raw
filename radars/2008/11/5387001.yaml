    description: "05-Aug-2007 12:29 AM Robert Sesek:\r\nWhen working with a bound NSTreeController and an NSOutlineView, all the elements in the NSOutlineView are of the type _NSArrayControllerTreeNode which Cocoa developers do not have access to. Because of this, programatically manipulating an NSOutlineView that is bound to an NSTreeController can become difficult without having to use the private _NSArrayControllerTreeNode methods (which are unsupported or documented). Therefore, it would be nice to just have this class exposed publicly.\r\n\r\nOne key example of why this is needed is that the NSOutlineView's delegate method -[outlineViewItemDidExpand:] has an NSObject key in the userInfo of the NSNotification. This object is of the type _NSArrayControllerTreeNode which leaves the developers with two options: take a risk and use a private API or render many delegate methods useless.\r\n\r\nThe key functionality that should be exposed is: -[NSArrayControllerTreeNode indexPath] and -[NSArrayControllerTreeNode observedObject]."
