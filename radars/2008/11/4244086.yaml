    description: "When I drag a smart folder to the dock, it behaves like a file, not a folder. In particular, if I control-click the dock icon, I do not get the items inside the folder listed in the popup menu.\r\n\r\nPlease fix that, so I can finally have my /Applications, ~/Applications and /Developer/Applications smart folder in the dock and open apps using the popup. Thank you.\r\n\r\n11-Jun-2007 03:27 PM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nNow that 10.5 doesn't show the contextual menu anymore, smart folders still aren't first-class citizens because they don't ehave as stacks like regular folders in the dock."
