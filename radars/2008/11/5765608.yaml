    description: "26-Feb-2008 07:50 AM Benjamin Willmore:\r\nSummary: \r\nTerminal application fails to set window bounds correctly in response to Applescript\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Terminal\\\" to set bounds of front window to {200,300,1000,800}\"\r\n(or any other rectangle)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindow resizes to the requested rectangle\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window resizes to an incorrect rectangle. For example, compare:\r\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"iTunes\\\" to set bounds of front window to {200,300,1000,800}\"\r\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Font Book\\\" to set bounds of front window to {200,300,1000,800}\"\r\nBoth correctly resize the window to the requested bounds. Terminal doesn't.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe error is equal to the height of the window, and so the following applescript gives the desired behaviour:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Terminal\"\r\n\tset winBounds to bounds of front window\r\n\tset height to (item 4 of winBounds) - (item 2 of winBounds)\r\n\tset bounds of front window to {200, 300 + height, 1000, 800 + height}\r\nend tell"
