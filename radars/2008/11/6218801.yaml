    description: "14-Sep-2008 02:32 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nUntil recently, I was in the process of discussing with senior management team at the company I work the plan to commit resources to the development of an iPhone-native client for our hosted e-commerce and CRM platform. These discussions, at their request, have been mothballed, thanks to the now fairly well-publicised AppStore rejections.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\n1. The acceptance policies are not disclosed by Apple. This makes it impossible to determine in an advance whether an application will be accepted or not.\r\n\r\n2. An application is not reviewed until after its development has been completed.\r\n\r\n3. The rejections publicised to date are impossible to justify from a business perspective.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these three factors means committing resources to such a project is now impossible: as well as there being no guarantees of the software itself being a success (as with any development), there are no guarantees that it can even be made available at all (ignoring jailbroken devices), and this is after the product has been developed. There is no business case that I can make while this situation remains the case.\r\n\r\n15-Sep-2008 08:08 AM Stoney Gamble :\r\nWe are always looking for ways to improve our products and services. Please know that we have forwarded your comments to the appropriate group for review and consideration.\r\n\r\n23-Sep-2008 03:40 AM Mo McRoberts:\r\nJust as a follow-up, the below-linked blog post from Mac and iPhone developer Wil Shipley tallies pretty closely with both my feelings, and that of my employer:\r\n\r\nhttp://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/09/iphone-app-store-let-market-decide.html\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful if this could also be passed on.\r\n\r\n21-May-2009 06:41 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nThis issue remains unresolved.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nhttp://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/106345745/apple-rejected-an-iphone-app-that-remotely\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blog.montgomerie.net/whither-eucalyptus\r\n\r\nSeasoned Mac and iPhone developers are now incredibly critical of the App Store process, and rightly so.\r\n\r\nNew developers are left with the impression that it's difficult to get into the App Store, and looking at the applications which have been approved, can only be left with the impression that it's for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nTo compound matters, there appears to be a virtual brick wall between Developer Relations and the App Store Review Team - the latter might as well be outsourced to a separate company for all the consistency and communications afforded.\r\n\r\nThe need for transparency has not lessened in the six months since this bug was filed."
