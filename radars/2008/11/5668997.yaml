    description: "03-Jan-2008 02:30 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nICM defines the flags \"codecConditionCatchUpDiff\" and \"codecFlagCatchUpDiff\" for when a decompressor is falling behind during decode, but under QT7 this flag is apparently never sent to imdc delegates.\r\n\r\nIt also defines ImageCodecDroppingFrame(), which like many other interesting things in ImageCodec.h is undocumented. otool reveals that this one is called by the base codec, but it's not really useful for knowing if the video is going out of sync - dropping some frames might have brought it completely back to normality.\r\n\r\nKnowing if the decoder should try to catch up can be really useful for any codec with nonref B-frames or postprocessing, since they can turn off the filter or leave out stages of the decode instead of having to drop frames entirely.\r\n\r\n(Of course, this isn't as useful on OS X since the mandatory on-CPU YUV->YUV conversion takes more time than decode for any reasonable video...)"
