    description: "Summary: \r\nFor communication apps like Adium, it would be very nice to be able to hook into the parental controls framework, whether to offer our own (ideal), or just use the existing IM settings. I've been unable to find any API for doing this in the seeds so far.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe (Adium) intend to offer our own parental controls UI in a future version regardless of this, so it's not hugely urgent. It would just be nicer to have a centralized place to control these things."
