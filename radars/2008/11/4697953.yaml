    description: "I am trying to accept drags from AddressBook.app and an ABPeoplePicker. I register for the NSFilenamesPboardType and create a ABPerson instance with the VCard files dragged by using -initWithVCardRepresentation:. \r\nThis works fine when a single person is dragged. If multiple people or groups are dragged, instead of getting a separate VCard for each person, a single VCard containing every person dragged is returned.\r\nIf I attempt to use -initWithVCardRepresentation: the returned ABPerson only has the data for the first person in the VCard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register a view for the NSFilenamesPboardType\r\n2. From an ABPeoplePicker or AddressBook.app, drag either a group or multiple people at the same time on the view.\r\n3. Create an NSData instance containing the data in the single returned filename. (The filename is something like \"[First Person] and X others.vcf\")\r\n4. Create an ABPerson instance with -initWithVCardRepresentation:, passing the data from the previous step\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs an ABPerson instance is only designed to hold data for a single person, only the first person is read from the data.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\nIf the option key is held down during the drag, a separate VCard for each person is posted on the NSFilenamesPboardType. Then, a separate ABPerson can be created for each file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nABGroup should implement an -initWithVCardRepresentation method that would read every person stored in the data."
