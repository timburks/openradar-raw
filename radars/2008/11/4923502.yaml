    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen viewing a largeish QuickTime file such as [url removed for openradar to avoid too many people downloading it] in Safari, there's no indication of how the download is progressing or when it will be done.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1) Go to the URL above (or any other large quicktime movie file on the web)\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nSome indication of download progress\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nNo such indication is visible\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nPerhaps the QuickTime logo could fill as the download progresses, along the lines of the Classic Startup icon."
