    description: "Steps to Reproduce: \r\n1) create a layer-backed view\r\n2) call [view translateOriginToPoint:] with some non-(0,0)-point\r\n3) NSRectFill the view's bounds black\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThe whole view appears black\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nEverything in the view's bounds that is up and right of its new origin is filled black, the rest is filled with random stuff from vram.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nThis only occurs when using a view with both wants layer set, and a translated bounds origin. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nEvents appear to be translated similarly to the rect fill, which does not occur without wantslayer."
