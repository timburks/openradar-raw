    description: "When the desktop picture is set to a white or very bright image, the selection rectangle that occurs when dragging on the desktop is nearly invisible. This makes selecting multiple items like stabbing in the dark.\r\n\r\nA possible fix would be to just draw the outline of the rectangle darker than the body. Since the body area of the rectangle brightens whatever it covers and the outline would darken whatever it covers, you'd always see either the outline or the inner area of the rectangle, no matter whether the background is very bright or very dark.\r\n\r\nThis could also be a matter that may cause issues for the \"Accessibility\" team."
