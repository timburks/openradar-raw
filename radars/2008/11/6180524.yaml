    description: "Summary:\r\nThe QT dialog \"Standard Video Compression Settings\" has some settings which seem to be miscategorized or overly restrictively labeled. This could lead to confusion of ideas or encourage unnecessarily bad codec implementations.\r\n\r\n1. The keyframe rate and bitrate boxes don't indicate how hard they restrict rates. Keyframes should be \"at most every...\", since generating a keyframe outside a scene change is typically a bad idea. The data rate box is presumably the target average bitrate, since \"optimized for...\" controls the maximum rate, but \"restrict to X\" sounds like a max rate option to me.\r\n\r\n2. \"Frame reordering\" is actually a codec option enabling B-frames, and isn't related to motion. This isn't really a big problem. It would be nice if there were more options for this, but I guess the included H.264 encoder doesn't support variable B-frame counts or pyramids.\r\n\r\n3. \"Automatic\" key frames is much too vague to use, since in H.264 an I-frame doesn't have to be a keyframe. For all I know it would never generate them.\r\n\r\n4. The \"Quality\" slider is definitely confusing. It could mean two different useful things:\r\n* Quality of the output, allowing constant-quantizer output. This is a really useful option; when using a good codec people almost always set their target bitrate much too high. In this case the slider should be under Data Rate, should have a tooltip indicating QP, and should conflict with being able to enter a data rate.\r\n* Quality of the encoder analysis, allowing quicker encodes for lazy people. This is also useful, especially if the encoder is not well optimized.\r\n\r\n5. Encoders that support multi-pass encoding allow choosing multiple passes without a target bitrate and a single pass with one. Neither of these are particularly useful, and the second can cause quite bad quality problems if there's a sudden complexity increase. This setting is really related to data rate, though it seems wrong to put it there."
