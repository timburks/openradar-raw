    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only access available to the photo library, UIImagePickerController, does not provide developers with sufficient access to EXIF data for the images that are chosen by the user. There would be multiple ways to implement a fix for this - the UIImagePickerController could return a UIImage that preserves the EXIF tags (this would require making the ImageIO framework public again, a decision that should have been made in the first place), or the delegate could someone otherwise get a dictionary containing the tags.\r\n\r\nThe tags should be accessible by some means, however, as currently applications that could leverage EXIF data, such as the geotagging data on photos taken with the iPhone's camera, are currently impossible. Making this improvement will allow for more innovative and useful applications on the iTunes App Store.\r\n\r\nAttached: http://apogee-dev.com/randomstuff/EXIFBug.zip"
