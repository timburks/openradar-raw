    description: "Summary:\r\nOn using the newest Google Mobile application I discovered that it appeared to be using the proximity sensor to switch into voice mode.  When I search the public APIs in the iPhone SDK, I found no API to do this. Vic Gundotra at Google has acknowledged using the proximity sensor. Please document this call so that my application can have the same UI advantage as Google."
