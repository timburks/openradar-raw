    description: "Summary:\r\nMy application has a UITableView below a NavigationBar. On the NavigationBar there is a button which toggles the data for the tableView, part of this is updating the table's index. The index displayed to the user does not change though until it is interacted with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nChange the array returned by sectionIndexTitlesForTableView, call reloadData on the tableView, note that the index does not update until the index is interacted with.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nreloadData should also update to reflect changes to the index\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe index remains constant until the index is interacted with.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can see that sectionIndexTitlesForTableView is called when reloadData is called on the table, but the index displayed to the user stays the same until it is interacted with."
