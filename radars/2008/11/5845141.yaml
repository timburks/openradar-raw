    description: "Summary: \r\nNSDate's dateWithNaturalLanguageString doesn't handle the European date format of dd/mm/yyyy, simply returning null.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnter any European format date that isn't ambiguous and could be read in US format eg. [NSDate dateWithNaturalLanguageString:@\"25/12/2006\"];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSDate object is returned initialised to the 25th of December 2006, for ambiguous dates (eg 4/7/2008 could be 4th of July or 7th of April) the system should take into account the user's date format set in system preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNull is returned\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a quick foundation tool that shows it failing on European formats."
