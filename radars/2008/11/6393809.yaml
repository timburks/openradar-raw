    description: "Mac OS X has at least three (or four) default root certificate stores -- /System/Library/Keychains/System Roots, /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/security/cacerts, and /usr/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt, plus the legacy X509Anchors keychain. In addition, Server Admin can store root certs in /etc/certificates.  If you have added a trusted root certificate to any of non-Keychain locations, a system update can wipe out the addition. This can be extremely disruptive to server operations (a Java update at one of my clients trashed a Zimbra installation that depended on a GoDaddy intermediate certificate), and also impacts workarounds for the Open Directory client bug that is publicly documented at http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=20071203011158936. \r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, how about creating a read-only file system plug-in that uses the Keychain APIs as a backing store, to present trusted root certificates as files on a mounted file system. These can then be symlinked to the expected locations, thus providing a unified view of root certificates to both native apps and legacy apps. \r\n\r\nPlease run this by the server team folks before dismissing it -- they'll get it right away. \r\n\r\nIf I have some time over the holidays I may create a proof of concept based on MacFUSE."
