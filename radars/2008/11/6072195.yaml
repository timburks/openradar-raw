    description: "13-Jul-2008 08:52 AM Rhett Sutphin:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe sync service menu bar item is enabled by some installers.  For instance, the iPhone 2.0 firmware updater turned it on for me just recently.  (I've seen it happen one other time, but I don't recall the details.)  However, if you don't have a .Mac/MobileMe account, the control (in System Preferences / MobileMe) to turn it off is hidden.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n0) Verify that the sync services menu item is not displayed\r\n1) Update an iPhone to firmware 2.0.  The sync status menu bar item will appear.\r\n2) Go to System Preferences, looking for a way to turn off the sync menu bar item.\r\n3) Enter \"sync\" in the System Preferences search box\r\n4) Select \"Show sync status in menu bar\".\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe \"show sync status in menu bar\" control should be available, even if you don't have a MobileMe account.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThat control is not available.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nCommand-dragging to remove the menu bar item works."
