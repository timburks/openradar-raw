    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone OS 2.0 was touted as a business-friendly upgrade, but iPhone's Mail application is still missing an essential feature for anyone who uses business and personal accounts together: multiple signatures. Currently, iPhone supports a single signature, which is always sent unless the user manually deletes it from every outgoing message. Business email signatures can get long and this isn't an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA facility to enter signatures per-account in \"Accounts\" settings which override the default signature.\r\nAlternately, a menu to select a signature from Mail's compose view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n24-Aug-2008 02:09 PM [redacted] :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
