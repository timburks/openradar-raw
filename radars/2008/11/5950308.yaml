    description: "20-May-2008 01:36 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nIf you have a modal window and a floating panel containing a graphical date picker, and the floating panel is set to worksWhenModal, the date picker will work, but the three little grey buttons in its upper left will not work anymore.\r\n\r\nSee attached sample application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'WorksWhenModalDatePicker.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n20-May-2008 01:38 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nOh, if there's a workaround to make this work, it'd be appreciated if you could share that until this issue is fixed."
