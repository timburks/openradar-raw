    description: "22-Nov-2008 04:41 PM Nicola Del Monaco:\r\nSummary: \r\nThis issue appears when you insert a number in a text field (I tried it in Text - SMS in Italian language-, but it seems to appear everwhere): if you start inserting a short number (say 7 21 - note the space between 7 and 21), when you tap the 1 on the keyboard, it stays selected and the number is not actually typed until you tap anywhere else on the keyboard. See attached screenshot for a visual evidence of it happening. It happens both in ENGLISH language setting and in ITALIAN language setting, with single keyboard selected and multiple too; and it happens both with autocorrection ON and OFF. It is always reproducible (try to start a new sms text message, and insert, say, 921 or 721. The 1 appears as in the screenshosts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open Text application (SMS application in italian)\r\n2. create a new message\r\n3. try to insert a number, like 721 or 9 21 (note the space); if the number ends in 1, the problem appears\r\n4. the number 1 stays selected, without it being actually sent to the text box, until you push any other place on the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe number 1 gets typed and you can normally go on\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe number 1 stays selected while not being typed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt hasn't ever happened in 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.1; I use a service that gives timetables for buses and so I always used this type of numerical text messages; this morning I updated to 2.2 and I istantly noted the issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n'IMG_0002.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n22-Nov-2008 04:41 PM Nicola Del Monaco:\r\n'IMG_0001.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
