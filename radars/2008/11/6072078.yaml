    description: "13-Jul-2008 02:02 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\niCal's icon in the dock sometimes stops updating. The date on the calendar will show a day or more behind. (For example my iCal shows July 5th, but it is July 13th)\r\n\r\nIf I restart, the icon reflects the correct date; at midnight, though, the date changes, and the icon does not. If I start iCal, the date in the icon is correct again, but once I quit iCal the date reverts to whatever inaccurate date it was before I opened iCal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis happens randomly and has no known steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iCal icon should reflect the day everyday as expected, and not get \"stuck\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iCal icon gets stuck on a day and does not update.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have had this happen to me many times on my MacBook Pro, and now once on my new Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can get it to update by restarting, or removing iCal from the dock and re-adding it, neither of which are acceptable solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 3.png' and 'tesseract.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n14-Jul-2008 09:50 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nAttached are the system logs still on the computer. They go back to July 6th which is the first date that it did not update to.\r\n\r\n\r\n'system logs.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Jul-2008 10:20 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nIt happened again after I set those defaults.\r\nHere are the logs from the 14th until now.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Jul-2008 10:21 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nAlso should say that right now it is stuck on the 15th and it is the 17th. Screen shot attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 8.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-Jul-2008 10:52 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nI ran them both and did not get an error.\r\nDo they get get reset on a reboot, because I did reboot.\r\nI ran them again and they both completed with no output.\r\nI have also attached the prefs file.\r\n\r\nAs for the coreservicesd, I am not sure what that is or what you mean by running a supported version. (since I dont know what it is exactly)\r\nFrom running a google search for what you sent me, all the results seem to be related to the screen saver. My main screen saver of preference is the default Shell screen saver that comes with 10.5. I do occasionally use a screen saver called ArtSaver (http://zach.in.tu-clausthal.de/software/index.html#screensaver) I don't know if that could be causing those errors.\r\n\r\nMy machine is a Mac Pro running 10.5.4\r\nProcessor: 2 x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon\r\nMemory: 10 GB 800 MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM\r\n\r\n\r\n'com.apple.iCal.plist' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n31-Jul-2008 06:31 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nIt happened yet again. This time it is the 31st today but it is stuck on the 28th.\r\nYour last message was on the 25th so this should include the second time around of running those terminal commands.\r\n\r\nAttached are the log files from the 28th to today, and a screen shot, zipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n'iCal Stuck on 28th.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n15-Aug-2008 04:45 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nInteresting...\r\nI had never heard of MenuCracker before.\r\nAfter some searching I found that iStat Menus (http://www.islayer.com/index.php?op=item&id=28) uses this.\r\nAfter some more googling I found a post on iStat Menu's support site about an unrelated issue. The interesting part was that in the tips for this other issue it talked about MenuCracker and said to try changing the menu extra that MenuCracker acts as. So I thought before removing iStat Menus (since I like it) I would try changing this value and see if it had any effect, and if not then remove it and see if it solved the problem. When I look at the value it by default uses, it is set to: CHUD Tools CPU Extra. The other possible options are Ink, and IrDA. Since I am on a Mac Pro with no IrDA I selected this value and iStat Menu refreshed. When it refreshed my calendar icon (which was stuck on a past date again) auto-magically updated to the correct date.\r\n\r\nSince this issue has been happening to me every few days now, I am going to try leaving it set to this value for a couple of days to see if the error still happens.\r\nIf it does, I will completely remove iStat Menus and see if that fixes the error.\r\nEither way I will report back here in a few days with either the good news that it seems to be fixed (at which point I will mark this as resolved) or an update that I removed iStat Menus and am waiting a few more days to see if the error still happens.\r\n\r\nI don't know if you can answer this next question, but my question would be why do these apps need this type of a hack to work? From my googling it seems that this was not needed in 10.1. It sounds like what ever this hack is doing should be made available to developers without the use of a hack. I know this is unrelated to this item and probably not in your area, but thought I would throw it out there.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help, I will report back in a few days.\r\n\r\n28-Aug-2008 08:16 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nChanging the menu extra that MenuCracker acts as did not fix the problem. It happened again. I have removed the program using MenuCracker, and will now wait a few days to make sure it does not happen again, and if all is good I will come back and close this issue. Thanks again for all your help. I will get back to you soon.\r\n\r\n01-Oct-2008 10:06 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nI am afraid this did NOT solve my problem.\r\nI now have NOTHING installed that uses MenuCracker and my iCal icon is stuck again.\r\nI have attached a screen shot showing the iCal icon and the system clock, as well as showing that MenuCracker is not installed.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like MenuCracker is not the problem...\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 1.png' was successfully uploaded"
