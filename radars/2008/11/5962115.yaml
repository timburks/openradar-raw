    description: "25-May-2008 02:10 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nAutocompletion is great, as long as it stays out of my way when I do not need it, and doesn't change what I am typing.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation of auto-completion, while in responsiveness and general appearance a great improvement over the previous implementation, auto-completes when I hit the tab key. This is problematic, as it often triggers while I'm typing text. I've already typed the correct identifier, hit tab to align something, and bang, it inserts some function prototype because if you uppercase my variable name or whatever, it looks like a function that's defined elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate if tab, spaces and other characters commonly used in source code for indentation and separation of identifiers didn't cause auto-completion. Return is very dangerous in this context as well, as I may have finished an entire line, hit return, and Xcode chooses to morph it into something else. Maybe you could use some other key or key combination to accept an auto-completion?"
