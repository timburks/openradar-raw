    description: "Summary:\r\nFilling a rectangle using the kThemeBrushMenuBackgroundSelected brush under 10.5 does not produce a blue color (or blue gradient) in 10.5, as expected (and as in 10.4).  Instead, it appears to draw a white rectangle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  In a copy of the standard example project HITestView (with a copy of HIFramework at the same level), edit the function HITestViewDraw in the file HITestView.c by replacing lines 341 to 365 inclusive (i.e. the line \"red = inData->red;\" to the line \"CGContextStrokeRect( context, bounds );\") with the following lines:\r\n\r\n\tHIThemeSetFill (kThemeBrushMenuBackgroundSelected, NULL, context, kHIThemeOrientationNormal);\r\n\tCGContextFillRect (context, bounds);\r\n\r\n2. Build and run the HITestView program.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe left-hand rectangle should appear in a blue color that matches the color of a selected menu item, as it does in 10.4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe left-hand rectangle appears to be white (a slightly brighter white than the window background).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs stated above, kThemeBrushMenuBackgroundSelected appears to work properly in 10.4.\r\n\r\nupdated 18-Mar-2008 10:28 AM:\r\nThe problem still appears to exist in OS X 10.5.2 (build 9C31).\r\n\r\nI realize that the selected menu background in Leopard is more complex than just a solid blue color (it appears to be a gradient, with a subtle border at top and bottom), but drawing with white instead seems inadequate.  Maintaining the same blue color as 10.4 would be sufficient, if it's not possible to replicate the gradient.\r\n\r\nOf course, when I say \"blue\" color or gradient, this applies only to the standard \"Blue\" appearance choice; selecting \"Graphite\" instead in the Appearance preference panel should naturally use a gray color or gradient.\r\n\r\n01-Mar-2009 04:27 PM:\r\nI have reason to believe that this issue will be resolved in a future version of the operating system."
