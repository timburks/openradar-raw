    description: "Summary:\r\nAsking the role description of the system-wide AXUIElement always gets the string “need to implement”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create the system-wide AXUIElement using AXUIElementCreateSystemWide.\r\n2. Copy its role description by passing the AXUIElement from step 1, and kAXRoleDescriptionAttribute, to AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe variable to which you directed the output of AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue accurately describes the role of the system-wide AXUIElement (which role, for easy reference, is “AXSystemWide”).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe variable contains the string “needs to implement”, seemingly unconditionally.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known. This has existed in at least several Tiger versions (possibly all of them), but I've never tried it in Panther.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe docs for kAXRoleDescriptionAttribute say that it is localized, so I tried changing my preferred language in the International pane of System Preferences and re-running the test case. It still says “need to implement”.\r\n\r\nA test case is included. Simply hit ⌘R in Xcode; the output will appear in the Run Log. If you prefer to not use Xcode, type this into a Terminal (all one line):\r\n\r\n\txcodebuild && build/*/AXSystemUIElementRoleDescTest\r\n\r\n[Attachment: http://boredzo.org/stuph/AXSystemUIElementRoleDescTest.tbz ]\r\n\r\n[Added later]\r\nAs of Leopard, the role description has changed, but the bug has not been fixed. The new role description is CFSTR(“”), which is at least as unuseful, possibly moreso. The new description is every bit as non-descriptive of the role as the previous description was; it does not satisfy the Expected Results, a truly descriptive description."
