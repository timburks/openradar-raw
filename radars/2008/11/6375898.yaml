    description: "Crash reports that are logged on device to /private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/ should be accessible to developers inside the application sandbox. This would allow developers to provide their own mechanisms for crash log submission.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Apple could provide their own mechanism to deliver crash reports that are collected from users after being synced off the device to ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice. This would be similar to the solution suggested by rdar://problem/6073498"
