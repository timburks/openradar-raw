    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Image Capture API provides no function like ICAImportImage that displays the Image Capture window as a sheet on another window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assign a WindowRef to a member of the parameter block.\r\n2. Call ICAImportImage or its sheet-enabled equivalent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe function unrolls a sheet upon the destination window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing, because no sheet-enabled function exists in the Image Capture API.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. Image Capture has never supported this.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nRoll your own using Image Capture's lower-level API, as described in the Image Capture Applications Programming Guide.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor some applications, such as image editors, it's more appropriate to present the Image Capture UI as a sheet on another window, such as a document window. (See the HIG.) This allows the user to import an image into one document while doing other work in another document.\r\n\r\nThe current Image Capture window blocks the UI of the entire application, which, for a document-based application, is a UI failure."
