    description: "Summary:\r\nThe XML in PackageMaker 3 documents contains no newlines; as such, version-control systems cannot merge it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a document in PackageMaker 3.\r\n2. Save it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPackageMaker outputs a document that I can add to my version-control system and that it can easily diff, merge, and store as a delta.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPackageMaker outputs a document on one enormous line, leaving the version-control system unable to do anything with it but replace all at once.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown. I don't know what PackageMaker 2's document format was like.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA diffable document format is especially important for developer tools, so that we can easily see what changed from one revision to another, and so that it makes practical as well as descriptive sense to keep commits atomic (one feature or fix per commit)."
