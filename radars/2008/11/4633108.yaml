    description: "16-Jul-2006 05:03 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen one attempts to view an RSS feed in Safari that is hosted on any http://localhost/ address, Safari fails to open the feed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Setup a feed on localhost.\r\n2. Navigate to feed://localhost/yourFeed.xml\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nTo get a normal RSS display as you would with any other URL in Safari. You can still achieve this, however, by using feed://127.0.0.1/yourFeed.xml or feed://ComputerName.local/yourFeed.xml and it works just fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nSafari redirects to various locations and ultimately stops at http://yourFeed.xml/ with a \"Safari canâ€™t find the server.\" error."
