    description: "01-Dec-2003 01:29 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nThe Cocoa \"Sketch\" sample application that comes with the Developer Tools has a bug in its drawing code. It draws on \"whole\" coordinates instead of x.5, thus causing the lines to look blurry. This can be fixed easily by having the -(NSBezierPath*) bezierPath; method of the SKTGraphic-derived classes use a slightly adjusted rectangle, e.g. by replacing [self bounds] with UKAdjustRectForDrawing([self bounds]) in the code, where that function has the following implementation:\r\n\r\n/* Moves the box *onto* the pixels. This also makes the rect smaller by one pixel\r\n\tin each dimension, to ensure any clipping done to the original rect doesn't\r\n\tclip this rectangle.*/\r\n\r\nNSRect  UKAdjustRectForDrawing( NSRect oldBox )\r\n{\r\n\tNSRect\t\tbox = oldBox;\r\n\t\r\n\tbox.origin.x += 0.5;\r\n\tbox.origin.y += 0.5;\r\n\tbox.size.height -= 1.0;\r\n\tbox.size.width -= 1.0;\r\n\t\r\n\treturn box;\r\n}\r\n\r\nPlease add this fix to a future version, as this is a woefully underdocumented pitfall of Quartz drawing."
