    description: "If an HTTP authentication password changes on a server, next time you visit the server Safari does not prompt you to enter a new password but instead tries to load the page without timing out\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit a site that requires HTTP authentication and enter in your password\r\n2. Change the password on the server\r\n3. Re-visit the site\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafari should state that the authentication has failed and ask for the user to re-enter the details\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBlank page with the progress bar not moving at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by going into the keychain and changing the password there, but this requires a trip away from Safari\r\n\r\n11-Jan-2008 11:27 AM Martin Pilkington:\r\nThese are university pages so unfortunately I can't give you any log in details but some examples are:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~hepple/campus_only/\r\nhttps://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~guy/campus_only/com1010/\r\n\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 12:52 PM Martin Pilkington:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
