    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nAfter using the iPhone as iPod and removing the headset, incoming calls sometimes have no audio and must be restarted. When called/calling back, callers complain of loud white noise.\r\n\r\nThe phone then mutes all audio output until you use the volume controls or attempt to use speakerphone mode. Attempting to toggle mute has no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use iPhone as iPod\r\n2. Remove headset\r\n3. Ask someone to call you\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to receive the call without problems\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn a few instances, I was unable to hear or speak to the callers, and had to call them back repeatedly until I found that toggling speakerphone mode seemed to reset the audio.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDid not occur in firmware 2.1"
