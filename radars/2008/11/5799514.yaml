    description: "14-Mar-2008 01:24 AM Nicola Del Monaco:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you install Windows Vista using Boot Camp on a new MacBook Pro (Early 2008) 2.5 GHz Penryn, there's a key on the MacBook keyboard (I use the ITALIAN layout) that doesn't work. It's the key immediately at the left of Backspace, and is the key with the symbols ì^. It does type an = sign, both with the shift key pressed and not. I tried restarting the system several times and updating windows vista, but the problem is still here. There's no way to stop the issue, and I don't know how to remap keys.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Boot Camp to partition Hard Drive\r\n2. Install Windows Vista\r\n3. Install Drivers from Mac OS Restore Disc\r\n4. Open notepad\r\n5. Type the \"^ì^\" key, with or without shift key pressed. On the screen, = appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n^ or ì should appear on the screen, depending on the shift key being pressed or not\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n= appears on screen, both with shift key pressed or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem didn't occur on my MacBook, on which I installed the same Windows Vista disc, using Boot Camp. It's a MacBook Pro with Penryn issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think an update to Boot Camp keyboard drivers can fix the issue.\r\nI'm attaching a picture of the key position on the keyboard with the ITALIAN layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n'erratic_key.jpg' was successfully uploaded"
