    description: "Summary:\r\nAppleScript always joins strings with \"\", regardless of what the script sets the text item delimiters to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the text item delimiters to any non-empty string.\r\n2. Coerce a list of strings to text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new string is the concatenation of all the strings, with the delimiter in between each consecutive pair.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new string is the concatenation of all the strings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work in Mac OS 9. My guess is that it broke in Leopard.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nJoin the strings manually by iterating on the list yourself and concatenating each string to a string-so-far.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe ability to use the text item delimiters in this way is a documented, supported part of AppleScript. Source: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH218-SW22\r\n\r\nI've attached a test script. The script attempts to join a short list of strings with \"-\", but that doesn't work: AppleScript joins them with \"\", instead.\r\n\r\nThe test script restores the original value of the text item delimiters after attempting to join the strings. This is good AppleScript citizenry. The step is optional: I can reproduce the bug with or without the restoration statemnt.\r\n\r\n[Attachment: http://boredzo.org/radar-attachments/6405860/Join-broken.applescript ]"
