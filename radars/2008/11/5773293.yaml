    description: "29-Feb-2008 03:29 AM Martin Wennerberg:\r\nSummary: \r\nI render a CIFlashTransition to opengl. The parts of the outputImage that isn't covered by the input images should be transparent but if the input images are in CbYCrY format I get black instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Compile and run the attached modified version of the CIVideoDemoGL sample code.\r\n2) Load a small movie, such as the Sample.mov attached to this case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the movie to be rendered on the red background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's rendered in a black rectangle on the red background as in the attached image blackBackground.tiff\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThere are a few tricks that all seem to avoid the problem: \r\n1) Use the software renderer\r\n2) Load a movie that's in RGB format\r\n3) Draw the image a a point != {0,0}.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample code fails both on Leopard and Tiger. The code in my app (Norrkross Movie) works on Tiger only has the problem on Leopard though and I have not figured out the difference.\r\n\r\nThis is fairly annoying to me so I'd be happy if we could find out what's wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'ModifiedCIVideoDemoGL.zip' and 'imac.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Feb-2008 03:34 AM Martin Wennerberg:\r\n'Sample.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Feb-2008 03:34 AM Martin Wennerberg:\r\n'blackBackground.tiff' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-Feb-2008 04:23 PM Martin Wennerberg:\r\nI tried running the sample on a MacBook (first generation) and a PowerBook G4 and both had the same problem as the iMac."
