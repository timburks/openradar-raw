    description: "06-Feb-2008 09:32 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nWhen a data detector locates a phone number, iPhone turns it into a clickable link. This link, when clicked, brings up a dialog. The dialog has two options: \"Cancel\" and \"Call\". However, it would be very helpful to have a \"Assign to Contact\" button that would allow you to attach the phone number to either an existing contact or create a new one with that phone number."
