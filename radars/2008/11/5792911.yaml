    description: "11-Mar-2008 11:14 AM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease enable the Aspen Simulator to produce location updates through CoreLocation API.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm developing an application that makes light use of CoreLocation, but I don't have any way of testing my application with different location data in the simulator.\r\n\r\nI would love a scripted mechanism (AppleScript or other) or a flat file/config file mechanism to change where the simulator \"thinks\" it is and respond appropriately with different results for the CoreLocation data. (different ranges of lat/long/alt and accuracy values).\r\n\r\nI only need a single location location, but I can conceive of others wanting a series of updates - enabling a file with time based updates to pass into the phone would be exceptionally useful as well."
