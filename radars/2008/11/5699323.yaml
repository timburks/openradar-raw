    description: "21-Jan-2008 11:02 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe ImageSubCodecDecompressCapabilities struct, which is passed to the Initialize call of an image decompressor component, has a lot of undocumented flags which can cause major behavior changes to how a component is called, as well as triggering various apparent bugs in QT. If these were documented as to what they actually did, it would be much easier to get the right behavior out of QT, plus I'd be able to file even more bugs about them - nearly my favorite hobby.\r\n\r\nThese have explanatory comments in ExampleIPBCodec (http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/ExampleIPBCodec/listing6.html):\r\nsubCodecIsMultiBufferAware (has TN2148)\r\nsubCodecSupportsOutOfOrderDisplayTimes\r\nbaseCodecShouldCallDecodeBandForAllFrames\r\n\r\nThese have sometimes cryptic comments in ImageCodec.h:\r\nsubCodecFlushesScreen (\"only used on Mac OS X\", seems like the sort of thing that doesn't apply to CoreVideo)\r\nsubCodecSupportsDrawInDecodeOrder (useful comment, except for not explaining what \"other circumstances\" are)\r\nsubCodecSupportsDecodeSmoothing (useful comment)\r\n\r\nThese are a mystery:\r\nsuggestedQueueSize\r\ncanProvideTrigger\r\nsubCodecSupportsScheduledBackwardsPlaybackWithDifferenceFrames\r\nsubCodecNeedsHelpReportingNonDisplayableFrames\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomething useful in http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/Reference/QTRef_ImageCodec/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003436-ImageCodecTypes-ImageSubCodecDecompressCapabilities\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't contain any fields added since QuickTime 4.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI haven't read any books on the assumption that 120% of the QT API is about GWorlds and direct screen access and is probably deprecated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\"subCodecSupportsScheduledBackwardsPlaybackWithDifferenceFrames\" especially worries me, since turning it on seems to encourage crashes in malloc()/OpenGL after about half an hour or so playing avis (which have B-frames marked by the codec BeginBand, but no sample dependency tables). Since neither of these should be crashing anyway, I'll only investigate further after 10.5.2.\r\n\r\nThis guy is rather upset about it, though: http://blog.so-net.ne.jp/MyCometG3/2008-01-20\r\n\r\n\"subCodecSupportsDrawInDecodeOrder\" seems to cause a more unstable framerate on 1080p video."
