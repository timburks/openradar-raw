    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using iPhone 3G, if the device has an active passcode lock and a call is received shortly after the auto-lock, sometimes it becomes impossible to unlock the phone to answer it. The touch screen is unresponsive and swiping a finger has no effect.\r\n\r\nThe only possible action is to reject the call using the power button, upon which the screen blanks. Tapping the power button again makes the device responsive. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Let the phone auto-lock\r\n2. Get a second person to call you\r\n3. Try to answer the call\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne should be able to answer the call.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn 10% of incoming calls, the screen froze and it was impossible to accept the call.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis was present on firmware versions 2.0 and 2.1."
