    description: "30-Jun-2008 04:04 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you include your own Font family (.TTF file) within an iPhone Application bundle, you can't establish a UIFont with which to generate NSStrings for view on various elements.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nWe tried including a TTF font file and using [UIFont fontWithName:size:] as documented under Creating Arbitrary Fonts within the UIFont Class Reference. We were unable to get the font from the family we included in the bundle."
