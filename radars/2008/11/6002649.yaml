    description: "11-Jun-2008 09:09 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe attached file has a 2vuy video track and an ARGB premultiplied-black-alpha track that starts at 5 seconds in. Neither of them have color atoms and neither of their imdc decompressors implement any of the component calls related to gamma. After exporting to mp4/H.264, there is a noticeable color shift in the video as soon as the overlaid track starts.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Move attached Perian.component into ~/Library/QuickTime/.\r\n2. Open rms.mov and Export to MPEG-4 with H.264 as the codec.\r\n3. Open result and seek 5 seconds in.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe frame with \"subtitle\" on it and the one immediately before should look the same except for having a subtitle on it.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nAs soon as the overlay appears the frame becomes brighter.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshots attached; these use Perian's h.264 decoder, which doesn't specify gamma levels, so they may look different from the movie being viewed with Perian removed.\r\n\r\nI would guess that the export is blending in RGB space and has mismatched RGB<>YUV conversion matrices. Without a GPU it would obviously be faster to convert the overlay track to YUV+alpha and blend there, which would also avoid conversion errors like this.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7318373.\r\n\r\n--\r\nhttp://img361.imageshack.us/img361/1456/noblendhg8.png\r\nhttp://img78.imageshack.us/img78/9130/withblendza5.png"
