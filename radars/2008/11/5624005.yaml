    description: "01-Dec-2007 03:56 AM Drew Saur:\r\n\r\nEver since Mac OS X 10.3, if a computer is configured to enable Fast User Switching, if a *non-administrative* user logs out and logs back in, that user will often lose sound effect support (e.g., sounds in Mail and in Desktop file moving actions, etc.). The only remedy is to restart the machine.\r\n\r\nThis still happens, surprisingly, in Leopard.\r\n\r\nThis bug has been around for a *long* time and I have reported it before (but not to this list). It's really annoying, because I rely on these sounds and I sometimes do have to log out for one reason or another, and I don't want to have to reboot my machine just because I had to log out. I expect the sound to work reliably.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (key: \"User X\" is a *non-administrative* user):\r\n\r\n1) User X has \"user interface sound effects\" enabled in System Preferences | Sound | Sound Effects\r\n\r\n2) User X hears sound effects during normal operations. These sound effects include sounds in Mail, and when deleting files and folders in the Finder, including emptying Trash.\r\n\r\n3) User X logs out.\r\n\r\n4) User logs in as another user (try a combination of users who have sound effects disabled and users who have them enabled to expedite seeing this issue,)\r\n\r\n5) User X logs back in. \"User interface sound effects\" are still enabled in System Preferences | Sound | Sound Effects, *but* no sound effects can be heard. Volume adjustment makes no difference. Other sounds (music, media players, speech, etc.) can still be heard, however.\r\n\r\n5) If this does not happen after one log out/log in cycle, it can typically be seen after another one or two additional tries.\r\n\r\nThis happens on multiple systems, including a Power Mac G5, a G3 iBook, and a Late 2008 MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nAdministrative users never experience this problem (UPDATE: see below).\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDrew\r\n\r\n\r\n01-Dec-2007 03:58 AM Drew Saur:\r\nDeleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemsound.plist has no effect. Here is what that file contains on one system where I was able to produce this error:\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n        <key>com.apple.sound.beep.sound</key>\r\n        <string>/System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff</string>\r\n        <key>com.apple.sound.beep.volume</key>\r\n        <real>1</real>\r\n        <key>com.apple.sound.uiaudio.enabled</key>\r\n        <integer>1</integer>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Sep-2008 05:03 PM Drew Saur:\r\nThis bug appears to have gotten worse since Mac OS X 10.5.4 (including 10.5.5), and it now occurs with administrative users as well, if the administrative user is the last user logged in."
