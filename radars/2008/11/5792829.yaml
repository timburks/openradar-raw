    description: "11-Mar-2008 10:45 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nPlease allow iPhone and iPod Touch applications to run in the background.\r\n\r\nNot allowing this option highly cripples the software that can be developed.\r\nThis has both hurt and killed apps I was planning on creating.\r\n\r\nWithout this ability an RSS reader can not auto grab updates, and an IM app can only run when its up and open.\r\n\r\nThere are many many apps that need this ability to be any good and for users to even want to bother with them."
