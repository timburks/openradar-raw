    description: "* SUMMARY \r\nThe font panel is nice for people with lots of fonts, but a font menu is a little more convenient, especially when you're on the road with a small TFT and you don't use more than five fonts all day.\r\n\r\nSo, it'd be nice if the new \"Font\" menu could be set up to display one of the Font Panel's Collections (simply append it to the font menu after a separator line). This way, users could use the already existing method of creating a collection to pick the fonts they use most and simply designate it as being the \"menu collection\", thus having quick access to their fonts even when the font panel is closed (and menus are a lot more convenient than that huge panel on small laptop screens).\r\n\r\nNote that this shouldn't be done by simply having a special Collection that takes the fonts for the menu. Rather, users should be able to take any existing collection and designate it it their menu collection.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get fancy, you could even allow selecting more than one collection (which would probably be put in the font menu as sub-menus then), or specifying a default menu collection for all applications and an override menu collection on a per-application basis (e.g. the default collection is my favorite fonts, but in an HTML editor I only get the \"Web\" collection).\r\n\r\nIf this was accompanied by a nice API that let Carbon programmers handle font panel selections *and* the font menu just like font menu choices of old, this would help in making Carbon developers adopt the font panel and the \"correct\" font menu more quickly.\r\n\r\nCocoa programmers would get that feature for free, anyway...\r\n\r\nThanks for giving it a thought :-)\r\n\r\n02-Jun-2005 03:19 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nI wrote my own class for this. UKFontMenuController. It's at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zathras.de/angelweb/sourcecode.htm#UKFontMenuController\r\n\r\nStill, it'd be nice to be able to have a \"show in font menu\" checkbox in the Font Panel itself, instead of having to put this in a separate window."
