    description: "17-Jun-2007 10:23 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Safari 3.0, you can no longer view the source (View -> View Source) of a page if you use the back/forward buttons. The page must be reloaded in order to view the source.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a website\r\n2. Continue onto another website\r\n3. Hit the \"Back\" button\r\n4. Attempt to go to View -> View Source\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Safari 2.x, you were able to view the source of pages in the back/forward cache. This has been removed in Safari 3.0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari prohibits you from viewing the source a web page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was possible in Safari 2.0 that ships with Mac OS X 10.4.9.\r\n\r\n\r\n12-Jul-2007 12:11 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nThere is no error, but Cmd+Op+U produces a beep sound and the View->View Source option is not enabled in the menu. Here's a more detailed walkthrough on a specific site:\r\n\r\n1) Open new tab\r\n2) Go to www.apple.com\r\n3) View -> View Source works\r\n4) Click on the \"Support\" link at the top of the page\r\n5)  View Source works\r\n6) Press the \"Back\" button\r\n7) View Source does *not* work\r\n8) Refresh the page\r\n9) View source works again"
