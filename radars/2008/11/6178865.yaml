    description: "* Summary:\r\nXcode should have an Emacs-like minibuffer so that you can enter editing commands from the keyboard. This is particularly important if anyone does anything about rdar://6178857\r\n\r\nIt would also enable various other useful tricks from Emacs. For instance, in Emacs I can switch to another buffer by hitting C-x B and then completing the buffer name. AFAIK the best I can currently do in Xcode is âŒ˜-`."
