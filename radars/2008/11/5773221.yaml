    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nNSDrawWindowBackground() draws incorrectly in 64-bit AppKit applications, appearing to be a shade darker, or not drawing the window gradient. As per the attached images, the exact same code (here drawing the Tab Bar and Bookmark Bar of a web browser) produces vastly different results.\r\n\r\nIn the attached image, the window toolbar gradient ends with the color rgb[169 169 169] and in 32-bit code NSDrawWindowBackground draws a continuous gradient starting with that color, however in 64-bit code NSDrawWindowBackground draws a flat color rgb[150 150 150] and not the required gradient.\r\n\r\nAffects:\r\n\r\nIssue affects v10.5.2 Intel (x86_64). I have not tested this issue against PowerPC (ppc64).\r\n\r\n'screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded"
