    description: "25-Jun-2007 07:30 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nThere is no NSURLConnection delegate for upload progress.  For large POST uploads, this provides a bad user experience, since there is no way to use a determinate progress indicator.  The only work around I could think of was to use an NSInputStream callback, which keeps track of how much data has been sent, but this is not possible, as per this thread:\r\n\r\n<http://lists.apple.com/archives/Macnetworkprog/2007/May/msg00051.html>\r\n\r\nI would like a delegate method along the lines of connection:didSendDataOfLength:, which gets called periodically.  There would also need to be a way to figure out the upload Content-Length so a running percentage could be calculated.  It's possible this could be gotten from the connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse: delegate (via valueForHTTPHeaderField:), but I have not verified this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nThis was such a show-stopper for my application, which had to deal with large file uploads, I decided to switch to using libcurl for the uploads:\r\n\r\n<http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>"
