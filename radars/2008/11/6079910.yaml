    description: "16-Jul-2008 09:55 AM:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen iTunes window is zoomed to the mini controller, and another application has focus, using the mouse to pause or skip tracks results in a double-click being registered by iTunes. The song is paused and restarted instantly, or two tracks are skipped. If the mini controller is given focus each mouse click registers as a single event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start iTunes, set it to use the mini controller (^âŒ˜Z).\r\n2. Open another application (Safari).\r\n3. Position the mini controller so it can be seen outside the other application.\r\n4. Give secondary application the focus (click in the Safari window).\r\n5. Attempt to use the mini-controller to begin playing music, or pause currently playing music.\r\n6. Click on mini-controller window (not a button) to give it focus.\r\n7. Buttons and mouse clicks now work as expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking the buttons in the mini controller, even when it doesn't have window focus, would act similarly to keyboard controls (F7-9) for controlling iTunes Library playback. OR mouse clicks would fail silently as they do in the full window (unzoomed)-instead just giving focus to the iTunes mini controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInabilty to use mouse to control iTunes playback from the mini controller when iTunes is not the frontmost application, instead play pauses and restarts instantly, or two tracks are skipped.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown. Only own two macs and both are updated fully. Unable to test on previous versions of iTunes. I THINK it used to work differently (otherwise muscle memory wouldn't automatically go there, right?)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkarounds include: using keyboard controls exclusively, giving focus to the window before clicking buttons.\r\n\r\n'******.spx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2008 10:01 AM\r\nThis is reproducible using just the Finder and iTunes.\r\n\r\nI used multiple mice and different USB ports (both on the keyboard and the iMac) to attempt to sort out the issue."
