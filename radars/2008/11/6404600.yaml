    description: "Summary: \r\nA feature I miss from another IDE I've used (Adobe Flex Builder) is the ability to find all uses of a particular class, method, or function. This is particularly handy when deciding how to refactor, and for finding dead or almost-dead code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Attempt to find all callsites for a particular method\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA quick way to find the callsites that takes into account (as much as possible) the types involved, rather than just the name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI generally have to use project-wide find, which is not very fast and difficult to use for commonly used method names (or methods with commonly used prefixes and multiple arguments).\r\n\r\n(Additional comment, Dec 25th, in response to a reply that \"find as symbol\" is the way to go)\r\nAs far as I can tell that searches by symbol name, but does not take types into account. i.e. searching for the 'addObject:' method on NSMutableArray will find uses of addObject: on other classes as well."
