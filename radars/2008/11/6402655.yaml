    description: "26-Nov-2008 03:51 AM Aaron Freimark:\r\nSUMMARY\r\niPhone OS 2.1 introduced a new feature to remind users of unread SMS messages 5 minutes and 10 minutes after receipt. But the SMS preview feature allows me to read text messages without unlocking the iPhone. Therefore this reminder is redundant and causes unnecessary user aggravation, stress, and premature hair loss. \r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be an assumption on Apple's part that every SMS requires a response, or at least thoughtful contemplation. However, there are plenty of people who use SMS simply for notification, and the preview feature is sufficient. (c.f. Twitter, or system administrator server alerts.)\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nLock your iPhone. Have someone send you a short SMS. On receipt, glance at your iPhone (read the preview), but do not unlock. After 5 minutes, notice the SMS alert. After 10 minutes notice a second alert.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\nOne of the following:\r\n1. An option to turn off the SMS reminder\r\n2. Refine the feature so that the message is marked as \"read\" if the any iPhone button has been pressed, even without fully unlocking the iPhone. That is, as long as I have activated the backlight on the display, you can assume I have read the SMS preview, so I don't want to be reminded about the message.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS\r\nThe aforementioned user aggravation, stress, and premature hair loss. \r\n\r\nREGRESSION\r\nThe feature seems to have been introduced in iPhone 2.1. iPhone 2.2 did not change the feature.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\nOther users have commented on this issue.
