    description: While the ability to switch spaces when clicking on an application has benefits for new users, it becomes a huge problem when users start placing application windows on various spaces. When I simply want to bring an application to the front to add a new window or document in the current space, I get taken to another space, in which I have to create the document and then drag it back to the space I wanted it on. This could easily be solved by allowing users to opt out of this flying around and only have Spaces switch workspace when a user presses one of the hotkeys
