    description: "30-Jul-2006 12:38 PM\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nSelecting \"Sync Now\" from the iSync menu item does not sync my phone when iSync is not running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Setup iSync to synchronize contacts and calendars with a phone\r\n2. Enable the iSync menu item (iSync -> Preferences -> Show status in menu bar)\r\n3. Quit iSync\r\n4. Select \"Sync Now\" from the iSync menu item\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\niSync should connect to my phone and update my contacts and calendars.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nThe menu item icon spins like it's updating, but does not connect to my phone, and doesn't last as long as a normal sync would take.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nIf iSync is running, selecting \"Sync Now\" will preform the same function as clicking the \"Sync Devices\" button in iSync. That is, it will synchronize my contacts and calendars with my phone.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nI have a Motorola E815, which I can successfully sync via bluetooth through iSync. However, it would be nice to use the menu item to sync so I could free up space in my Dock."
