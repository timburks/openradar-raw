    description: "18-May-2008 01:27 PM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nI have some cases where I need to draw various theme elements in windows and graphics. Some are for e.g. a GUI builder that shows windows inside another window, while other cases are e.g. bugfixes like having a view that draws a standard window background inside a brushed metal window so I can put my own, arbitrary content into an area at the top and bottom window (i.e. have a top and bottom bar of arbitrary size, and with arbitrary content that isn't a toolbar and isn't configurable).\r\n\r\nNSColor sadly sees the windowBackgroundColor as a symbolic constant that always has the color of the window it's drawn in, so I had to resort to using the now-deprecated HIThemeSetFill API to get the content color set to the one of an Aqua window. It would be greatly appreciated if NSColor and similar AppKit classes provided the means to draw colors and parts of a window using the themes available for windows. You could probably do this by providing NSColors and other calls that take a window style mask to decide what to draw, and also calls that provide the rects in which it is recommended to draw these items.\r\n\r\nOr alternately, you could at least let us keep HITheme."
