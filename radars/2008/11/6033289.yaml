    description: "25-Jun-2008 06:21 AM Martin Wennerberg:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the date and time mode of the UIDatePicker, it would be good to be able to expand the picker in Landscape mode to be able to pick a full year, month, day, hour, minute etc. time.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, the UIDatePicker always retains a fixed size, equal to the width of the portrait view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReproduce by launching the UICatalog samle code in the iPhone simulator, click Pickers and then rotate the phone by pressing command+right arrow on keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe date pickers should be nicely sized and positioned in both Portrait and Landscape mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date picker as all pickers fill upp 2/3 of the width and are vertically clipped by half.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt might be nice to optionally have two pickers side by side in landscape mode, and have the date picker adjust it's presentation to whatever width is set for it."
