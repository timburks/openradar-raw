    description: "Summary:\r\nMany users are accustomed to \"fixed\" scheduling systems, i.e. event times are literal, not relative to GMT. An event entered for a given time (ex. 7:00 AM) will stay at 7:00 AM regardless of the time zone setting of the viewing computer or device. This allows for events to be entered without consideration for time differences. If a person schedules a meeting for a certain time and a colleague inquires about the meeting, he will be able to read off the time without consideration for his current time zone.\r\n\r\nThe Time Zone Support feature introduced in iCal makes dealing with events outside of the user's current time zone (say, a conference call between different parts of the country). The trade off is that dealing with local events becomes confusing, as an event may be shown many hours before or after its actual time.\r\n\r\nUsers expect disabling Time Zone Support to fix their events to the given time, but this feature instead schedules all events in the local time zone â€” still accounting for changes when the user moves to another time zone!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable Time Zone Support in iCal and set the system time zone to America/Chicago (\"Chicago - U.S.A.\")\r\n2. Create an event in iCal going from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.\r\n3. Change the system time zone to US/Pacific (\"Cupertino - U.S.A.\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith Time Zone Support disabled, the event should stay at 12:00-1:00, regardless of system time zone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe event shifts to 10:00 AM.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a workaround, individual events may be set to the \"Floating\" time zone with Time Zone Support enabled, but this has been reported (unconfirmed) to be incompatible with some devices (including iPhone and Palm OS).\r\n\r\nI fear that this bug might be closed with \"Behaves Correctly,\" but in the eyes of many users disabling time zone support should cause iCal to ignore all time zone changes.\r\n\r\n14-Feb-2008 02:28 PM [redacted]:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n \r\nTime zone support is intended to allow users to set a time zone for iCal independent of the system time zone and to set time zones on events independent of iCal's time zone.  It is not intended to make all events in iCal time zone agnostic.\r\n\r\n10-May-2008 08:40 PM Sidney San Martin:\r\nI would like to reopen this bug as a feature request/Enhancement. Many users still consider iCal Time Zone handling a bug, and consideration of a feature to emulate desired behavior would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if I should open a new Enhancement bug with this information.\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2008 11:35 AM [redacted]:\r\nYour feedback and suggestion is appreciated. This request has been forwarded to the appropriate engineering team for review and consideration and will be closed and tracked offline.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check the seed notes and release notes for any updates that might affect this issue."
