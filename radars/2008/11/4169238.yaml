    description: "03-Jul-2005 11:22 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nSummary: \r\nIf you have multiple accounts in Mail with multiple signatures per each account, a bug occurs when you reply to a message. The default signature for a certain account will not be selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Create multiple email accounts with multiple signatures. In the \"Signatures\" pane of the preferences, for each account, select a different default/chosen signature.\r\n2. Reply to a message. The signature that is placed at the bottom of the message is not the one that is selected in the \"Choose Signature\" option for that account. In fact, the signature selection menu in the new reply screen is focused on \"None,\" yet there is a signature--the wrong signature--in the message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThe chosen signature for the account that the original message was sent to would be the one selected in the new reply, not the other account.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nThe signature that is used is selected as \"None\" but the default signature for the other account appears.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nThis occurs with Mail 2.0 build 727/730 under Mac OS X 10.4.1 build 8B15. I have only tested this issue with the steps I provided for reproduction.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere may be other conditions that I have not taken into account with this bug report. It is, however, reproducible at all times under my conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Ra.spx' was successfully uploaded"
