    description: "Summary: \r\nUIActionSheet's cancel button presses not detected properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app which uses UIActionSheet, using SDK 2.2 (and for OS 2.2).\r\n2. Run it in simulator or phone and invoke the UIActionSheet.\r\n3. Press the lower bottom half of the cancel button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIActionSheet should close.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIActionSheet should doesn't close. It looks like the \"touch area for the button\" is shifted slightly up and is smaller. Because touch slightly above the Cancel button actually cancels the UIActionSheet.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSDK 2.2 building app for OS 2.2, both in simulator and phone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
