    description: "19-Nov-2008 02:20 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nThe unique URL for an app submitted via iTunes Connect is not know until the product appears in iTunes.\r\n\r\nAn example of this URL is:\r\n\r\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=296581959&mt=8\r\n\r\nNot knowing the URL makes it difficult to prepare websites and other collateral in advance. Without this link, buy buttons for the App Store won't work.\r\n\r\nAdding an interface for the developer to acquire this URL in iTunes Connect would be VERY helpful.\r\n\r\n19-Nov-2008 03:30 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nIt turns out the \"Apple ID\" in the App Details in the Manage Your Applications list can be used to construct the link by hand. It would be much better if this was called out explicitly somewhere on that page (constructing the link for an easy copy & paste.)"
