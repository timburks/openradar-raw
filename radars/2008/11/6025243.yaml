    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the .growlRegDict file format is associated with Property List Editor, Mac OS X throws a quarantine warning when Firefox tries to open its Growl registration dictionary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get Info on a .growlRegDict file.\r\n2. Associate it with Property List Editor.\r\n3. Click Change All and assent to Finder's confirmation dialog.\r\n4. Launch Firefox 3.0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirefox launches normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user gets a warning:\r\n\r\n“Firefox-[UUID omitted].growlRegDict” may be an application. It was downloaded from the Internet and will be opened by GrowlHelperApp. Are you sure you want to open it?”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTiger didn't have this problem, since it didn't have the quarantine feature.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Growl framework registers with Growl by writing out a .growlRegDict file, and opening it with GrowlHelperApp using Launch Services. *It does not download the file.*\r\n\r\nTranscript of me retrieving the quarantine property:\r\n\r\n% xattr -l /private/var/folders/Mc/McGDP31wEp03-NURZUyN8U+++TI/-Tmp-/Firefox-B34AB9FB-7358-4FDB-9E22-535DC3FA064A-1426-00000C0C8704DDF9.growlRegDict \r\ncom.apple.quarantine: 0000;485c22bb;Firefox.app;|org.mozilla.firefox\r\n\r\nI don't know why this file has the com.apple.quarantine property in the first place. The file does not exist inside Firefox: the framework writes it out from a plist that, in Firefox's case, exists only in code.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nDon't assign the .growlRegDict type to Property List Editor, or assign it to Growl Registration Dictionary Editor."
