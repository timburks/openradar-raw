    description: "05-Sep-2008 03:50 AM Antonio Malara:\r\nSummary:\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI've a UITableView with UITextFields in its cells managed by an UITableViewController. I've registered the table view controller to the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification and UIKeyboarWillHideNotification notifications in order to resize the tableview frame to make scrolling possible.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the notification will fire in a pattern that render that resizing behaviour almost impossible to implement using only the notifications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardWillShowNotification should fire only if the keyboard is not on the screen and it's about to slide up.\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardDidShowNotification should fire only if the keyboard was not on the screen and has finished the animation\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardWillHideNotification should fire only if the keyboard is about to slide down to hide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardWillShowNotification fires even if the keyboard is already on the screen and it's not about to perform any animation\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardDidShowNotification fires even if the keyboard was already on the screen and it has not performed any animation\r\n\r\nThe UIKeyboardWillHideNotification fires even if the keyboard is not about to slide down, for example when changing the first responder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n---------\r\n\r\nN/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere could be a simple workaround if the notification userInfo contains an \"animating\" boolean key\r\n\r\n05-Sep-2008 09:36 AM Antonio Malara:\r\nI've made this sample application that shows the issue and a workaround i've implemented. To test it, select the rows in the lower part of the screen\r\n\r\nThe workaround is turned on by defining the macro WORKAROUND in the prefix header file.\r\n\r\n\r\n'KeyboardNotificationTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
