    description: "Summary: \r\nThe iCal AppleScript dictionary does not presently expose the occurrence property that a CalEvent has in CalendarStore.  It would be beneficial to have this for someone who wants to open a specific instance of a CalEvent in iCal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen I'm wanting to show a specific instance of an event in iCal, I'd like to be able to pass the UID and the occurrence date.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPresently, there is no easy way to get an specific instance of a recurring event as the UID only displays the original event. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
