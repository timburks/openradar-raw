    description: "20-Aug-2008 06:22 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nIf you specify an LSMinimumSystemVersion of \"10.4.11\" (as a string) in your app's Info.plist, Mac OS X 10.4.11 will refuse to launch your application, claiming it couldn't run on this system version.\r\n\r\nLSMinimumSystemVersion has been broken since 10.2 in various ways. Please, *finally* fix it. It'd really be great to be able to use it in a few years...\r\n\r\n With new bugs in Xcode 3.0, it's currently impossible to build an application under 10.5 that will run on 10.4.8, and there's no way to prevent the application from just silently crashing by using LSMinimumSystemVersion."
