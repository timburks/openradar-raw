    description: "03-Jun-2008 03:05 PM Nicola Del Monaco:\r\nSummary: \r\nI own a MacBook Pro Penryn 2.5 GHz (bough on March, 2008), updated with Mac OS X10.5.3.\r\nIt has a multi-touch trackpad, and so the preference pane for it is different from the one pictured in http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304052.\r\nThe worst thing is that it lacks the \"Ignore accidental trackpad input\" option, while the \"Ignore trackpad when mouse is present\" option is there and works, but the pref pane wrongly tracks its setting: you can disable or enable it and the setting is respected, but when you open the trackpad pref pane the checkbox always seems disabled, even with the setting active.\r\nI've filed a report for apple support site article 304052, too, thinking it would have been useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open system preferences\r\n2. open Keyboard and Mouse pref pane\r\n3. select Trackpad tab\r\n4. the option \"Ignore accidental trackpad input\" is not there.\r\n4b. the option  \"Ignore trackpad when mouse is present\" always appears unchecked, even if it was checked before (and the option is correctly applied).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHaving the option to \"Ignore accidental trackpad input\"; getting feedback on  \"Ignore trackpad when mouse is present\" option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n/\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem was present in Mac OS X 10.5.2 too; it works on my MacBook with Mac OS X 10.5.2 and 10.5.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo workaround for the \"Ignore accidental trackpad input\" issue. Option \"Ignore trackpad when mouse is present\" works, it just doesn't give the correct checkbox feedback\r\n\r\n\r\n'Immagine 5.jpg' and 'Alexis.spx' were successfully uploaded"
