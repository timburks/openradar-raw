    description: "03-Sep-2008 08:53 AM Tim Burks:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nThe embedded.mobileprovision file is not correctly generated for the second, third, etc. targets in an Xcode project with multiple iPhone app targets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an Xcode project with a single iPhone app target. Create a new target for another iPhone app (or two, in my case). Build the first target for distribution. Build the second target for distribution. Check the second target for embedded.mobileprovision -- it's not there. Delete the build directory, clean everything, and then build the second target. Find the embedded.mobileprovision file in an app directory for the original target. When I tried copying this to the second target and submitting the app, the app was rejected as improperly provisioned. The workaround was to delete the original target, clean everything, quit Xcode, delete my personal files in the Xcode project, restart Xcode and build my second target. Fingers crossed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI think Xcode should be able to correctly build multiple iPhone targets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSee above. embedded.mobileprovision was not correctly generated.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSee above."
