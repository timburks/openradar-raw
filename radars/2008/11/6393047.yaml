    description: "21-Nov-2008 11:50 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nThe Region 2 PAL DVD of \"Ghostbusters 2\" as sold in Germany (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish sound tracks, barcode has the number 4030521117549) by Columbia Tristar has an issue:\r\n\r\nIf you enter the \"extra features\" menu, the navigation arrows on the apple remote (and the arrow keys on the keyboard, as well) do not work reliably. Occasionally, I can get one keypress on the keyboard in, and move the selection down by one item, but usually it just sits there, and I am unable to use this menu to actually view/activate the extra features. The only thing that works is hitting the menu button and then choosing 'DVD menu' from front row's menu, to get back to the top level menu.\r\n\r\nI've seen similar navigation issues with other DVDs. Sometimes the volume controls would activate while in a menu, so it seems Front Row wasn't aware there was a menu currently being displayed, but this time there is no volume overlay or 'plopp' sound indicating a volume change."
