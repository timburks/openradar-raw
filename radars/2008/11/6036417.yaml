    description: "26-Jun-2008 05:49 AM Martin Wennerberg:\r\nUIKeyboardTypeNumberPad lacks support for returnKeyType\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nUITextField *myTextField = a text field...\r\nsnip\r\n\r\nmyTextField.keyboardType = UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad\r\nmyTextField.returnKeyType = UIReturnKeyDone;\r\n\r\nLaunch and click on the text field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA keyboard is shown. I expect it to have a button called \"Done\" in the lower right corner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard only has a backspace key in the lower right corner. The lower left is empty.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll the other keyboard types supports the returnKeyType property. I propose to move the delete key to the lower left corner and display the set returnKey in the lower right.\r\n\r\nSometimes a workaround can be to somehow end the editing by pressing some other button (eg \"Done\" in navigation bar) or outside the text field, but I think this isn't always practical and it's less obvious and inconsistent with the other keyboards."
