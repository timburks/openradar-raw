    description: "25-Jun-2007 07:19 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe URL downloading system does not have support for multipart POST upload directly.  It is possible to do this manually, by creating the multipart body inside an NSData instance, and then setting the body of an NSMutableURLRequest.  However, there are a number of issues:\r\n\r\n1) It's a pain to create the multipart body.  You have to become very familiar with RFC 2046 in order to do it correctly.\r\n2) If the body is created in an NSData, then the whole body must exist in memory.  For uploads of large files, this can be impractical.\r\n3) In order to get around issue 2, I tried to create an NSInputStream subclass.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to use an NSInputStream subclass with NSURLConnection, as per this discussion thread:\r\n\r\n<http://lists.apple.com/archives/Macnetworkprog/2007/May/msg00051.html>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nN/A"
