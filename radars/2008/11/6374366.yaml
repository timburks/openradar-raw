    description: "Summary:\r\nNSUserDefaults ignores plist files in /Library/Preferences when collecting the application's preferences.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] for the value of a preference that is only defined in a plist in /Library/Preferences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSUserDefaults, having included that plist when collecting the user's preferences for the current application, returns the value for the preference.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSUserDefaults returns nil, 0, or NO.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis first broke in Mac OS X 10.5.3. Prior to that version, it worked.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nUse CFPreferences.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA test app is included. In with the Xcode project is a plist file, which you should copy to /Library/Preferences (NOT ~/Library/Preferences) for testing.\r\n\r\nWhen you run the application, it presents two editable fields for you to set the bundle identifier and preference key to look up. Their values default to look up one of the keys from the provided plist file; thus, if you have installed that file in the correct location, you should see the value “Foo” show up in the “Local” output field.\r\n\r\nThe test app uses NSUserDefaults' persistentDomainForName: to retrieve the whole preferences dictionary, and then uses dictionary access to retrieve the preference. This is not the only way to reproduce the problem; two others, including the one I wrote in the Steps to Reproduce, are included in the source code, commented out.\r\n\r\n[Attachment: http://boredzo.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/PreferencesChecker-r6.tbz ]"
