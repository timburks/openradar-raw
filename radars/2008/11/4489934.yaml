    description: "Summary:\r\nSpeech Synthesis Manager does not support IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call a function such as CreateIPAStringFromString, which converts natural-language text into IPA.\r\n2. Call a function such as SpeakIPAString, which speaks the text represented in IPA aloud.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCreateIPAStringFromString returns a CFString containing the IPA version of the text.\r\nSpeakIPAString parses the IPA text in the CFString passed in, and speaks it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe program fails to compile because Speech Synthesis Manager has no such functions.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIPA is a standard alphabet for representing pronunciation. It has its own block in Unicode, making CFString a natural fit. Thus, this report extends #4489914, “Speech Managers do not support Unicode” (rdar://4489914).\r\n\r\nIPA used in this context would be a substitute for the phoneme syntax currently used in Speech Synthesis Manager (specifically, TextToPhonemes[1] and SpeakBuffer[2]).\r\n\r\n[1] file:///Developer/ADC%20Reference%20Library/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Speech_Synthesis_Manager/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/TextToPhonemes\r\n[2] file:///Developer/ADC%20Reference%20Library/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Speech_Synthesis_Manager/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/SpeakBuffer\r\n\r\n[Added 23-Mar-2006 04:11 PM]\r\nI should clarify that I simply made up the names CreateIPAStringFromString and SpeakIPAString. I am not under a belief that those functions are supposed to already exist. I'm requesting functions that do those things, whatever they end up named."
