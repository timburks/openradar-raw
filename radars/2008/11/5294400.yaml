    description: "Summary: \r\nIn Tiger the arrows under running applications in the dock are easy to notice at a glance; I've found that the \"blue light\" used in Leopard 9A466 requires a more deliberate look to notice. Presumably this would be the case even more for people with worse eyesight than mine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1) Open a number of applications on a large dock\r\n2) Attempt to note which ones are running out of the corner of your eye\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nRunning applications have a high enough contrast indicator to be easily noticeable\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nI've had to look again, or missed running apps, on several occasions"
