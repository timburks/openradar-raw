    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, Installer throws an NSInvalidArgumentException and fails the installation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Growl 1.1.3 from http://growl.info/files/Growl-1.1.3.dmg .\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe installation succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOccasionally, “Install Failed”. Installer tells the user that “The Installer encountered an unknown error that failed the install”, and to “contact the software manufacturer for assistance”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know, this only affects Leopard users (all four of the users who reported it were on Leopard). Also, we never had this problem before PackageMaker 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA second attempt at the installation worked for two of the users who reported this.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching the install.log (for the first, failed attempt) from one of those users. Additionally, another user reported the same problem on our forums, and attached his install.log:\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=16033\r\n\r\n[Added 14-Jun-2008 10:00 AM]\r\nI found the problem: If the preflight script deletes the previous version out from under Installer (as ours did), Installer essentially goes “I wanted to do that!” and fails the installation. (Strangely, this only applies to installation to /Library. When the user installs to ~/Library, it works fine.)\r\n\r\nInstaller should check whether the previous-version file still exists before attempting to remove it, and if it doesn't, not complain.\r\n\r\n[Added 06-Jul-2008 12:59 AM]\r\nI said previously:\r\n\r\n> I found the problem: If the preflight script deletes the previous version out from under Installer (as ours did), Installer essentially goes “I wanted to do that!” and fails the installation.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the only cause of the problem. We still get complaints about this from people installing 1.1.4 wherein I fixed the unexpected-deletion problem. Fortunately, it's not as common as before."
