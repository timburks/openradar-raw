    description: "* SUMMARY\r\nWhen the close button of one window overlaps the title bar of another, a \"double click\" on the close button causes the top window to close (as expected) and the bottom window to minimize. Only the second click should affect the bottom window.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open two windows in any application (for example, Finder)\r\n2. Position one window such that its close button is directly on top of the title bar of the other window\r\n3. Double click\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nOn the first click, the top window closes and the mouse pointer is now over the title bar of the bottom window. On the second click, the bottom window is minimized. I expect the second click to be treated as a single click on the window.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nThis works consistently even across applications.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nNone"
