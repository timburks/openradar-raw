    description: "25-Aug-2007 12:29 PM Robert Sesek:\r\niWork 2008 does not display icons for Microsoft Office documents (.doc, .ppt, .xls, .docx, .pptx, and .xslx). This could be confusing for new users who do not have Office:Mac installed as it only shows the generic document icon, which is generally an indicator that there is no available application to open them. Therefore it would be helpful to have icons for these file types to indicate which application they're opening with."
