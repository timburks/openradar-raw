    description: "23-Apr-2002 01:21 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nI often have to stop working on a project just after having built it and after having received lots of error messages I'd like to fix. When I re-open the projects, those are of course all gone, and I have to re-build to get them back.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible that you add an option to save the list of errors and warnings (and the console output they're built from) so I can resume where I left off?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
