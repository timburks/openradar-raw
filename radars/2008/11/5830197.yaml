    description: "It would be extremely helpful to be able to store some sort of identifier data with an NSURLConnection object to allow a developer to uniquely identify a connection. If many connections are created at once and they receive a lot of data that needs to be combined (in my case XML files arriving in multiple packets) then the ability to tell which connection is which is vital.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm having to create a new class to hold the information I need along with a reference to the connection so I can check that the connection passed to the delegate methods against it to get the information I need. The problem is that beyond this rather convoluted method there is no way to tell connections apart."
