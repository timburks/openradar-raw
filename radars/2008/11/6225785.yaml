    description: "17-Sep-2008 05:20 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nThe contextual menu for Xcode's 'Groups and Files' pane has an Add > 'Existing Frameworks...' submenu item. When choosing this menu item, the open panel points at the /System/Library/ folder, with the 'Frameworks' folder selected. This means people using list view or icon view always have to explicitly open the frameworks folder to get at the files in it. Only people who use column view in the open panel immediately see the contents of this folder.\r\n\r\nI filed this bug ages ago (back in Project Builder days) and it was fixed for one version, then got 'un-fixed' again. I can't find the bug in the bug database anymore, and it's still annoying me, so I guess you lost it, so I'm re-filing it again.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, you could remember the last directory viewed in this open panel *separately* from the one used for opening source files, and then it'd at least not always reset itself for me."
