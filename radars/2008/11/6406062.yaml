    description: "* Summary:\r\nObjC currently supports NSString constants, with the syntax\r\n\r\n  @\"This is an NSString\"\r\n\r\nhowever it doesn't support NSNumber constants, which leads to an awful lot of code like\r\n\r\n  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:\r\n    [NSNumber numberWithInt:43], @\"MyCount\",\r\n    [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], @\"MyBool\",\r\n    nil];\r\n\r\nwhich is somewhat tedious to type.\r\n\r\nIt'd be helpful if ObjC could also support\r\n\r\n  @43\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  @yes/@no\r\n\r\nwhich would turn the example above into\r\n\r\n  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:\r\n    @43, @\"MyCount\",\r\n    @yes, @\"MyBool\",\r\n    nil];"
