    description: "14-Nov-2008 02:16 PM Tim Burks:\r\n\r\nMost developers are now aware of the restriction on background tasks. \r\n\r\nAn API for setting alarms programmatically would cover a lot of use cases. \r\n\r\nThis would allow 3rd party apps to create alarms and timers that would be displayed by the Clock app.\r\n\r\nThe interface would be very simple, something like this:\r\n\r\n[someManagerObject addAlarmAtTime:(NSDate *) date withLabel:(NSString *) label soundNamed:(NSString *) soundName repeat:(BOOL) repeat];\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n[someManagerObject setTimerCountdown:(NSTimeInterval) withLabel:(NSString *) label soundNamed:(NSString *) soundName];"
