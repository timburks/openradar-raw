    description: "22-Jul-2008 11:17 AM Maurice Cusseaux:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\niPhone OpenAL 8-bit FAIL\r\n\r\nI've got a set of sounds that work just fine under OpenAL on desktop OS X, and on the iPhone it seems that only the 16-bit ones play correctly, the 8-bit ones are garbled. Mono/stereo and sample rate appears to make no difference. \r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be any documentation that 8-bit does not work/is not preferred."
