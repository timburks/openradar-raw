    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Alarm will sound while a phone call is in progress.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set an alarm via the clock app. (5 min from now)\r\n2. Just before the alarm is due to fire make a phone call.\r\n3. The Alarm will sound while the phone call is being made.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarm should not interrupt the phone call. My suggestion is to delay the alarm until the phone call is finished, Or to make a single beep and then to automatically snooze the alarm.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarm will sound over the top of the phone call."
