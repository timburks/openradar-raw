    description: "01-Nov-2007 12:42 PM Jens Ayton:\r\nSummary:\r\nAs of Leopard, NSBundle provides the method -executableArchitectures to identify the architectures of a bundle. It would be desirable to have a companion method (in NSBundle or NSApplication) to find the architecture of the running application. Specifically, for a plug-in host I am writing, I wish to be able to provide debug messages, aimed at plug-in developers, of the form “Plug-in FooPlug could not be loaded, because it does not contain a compatible architecture. Architectures in plug-in: ppc, x86. Architecture of running application: ppc64.”\r\n\r\nA logical addition would be a method to retrieve the architectures that can run on the current machine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nInapplicable in previous system versions\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not an urgent requirement, as it can be achieved through the preprocessor. However, that method is more cumbersome, involves duplication of effort and someone somewhere will get it wrong. Additionally, it may not be an option for applications written (partly) in scripting languages.\r\n\r\nThe architectures-supported-by-this-machine method is harder to approximate, since the correct answer may change in the future. However, I personally have no need of such a method at this time; it just seems like a logical extension."
