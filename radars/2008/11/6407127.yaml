    description: "Summary: When performing a Consolidate Library operation, the progress meter seems to be tied to the number of items being copied rather than the size of the data being copied. This provides a less than accurate picture of the copy progress and can be misleading when waiting for a consolidation to complete. I would like if the number, size, and/or kind of items remaining to be copied were displayed as well. For instance, I was performing a consolidate operation with about 4,500 items. The last 10-20 were video files, some even HD. The progress meter showed that the operation was nearly complete because so many of the items it had copied were audio items, but this was misleading because there was still a significant amount of data to be copied. The reverse could also be true. The first 10-20 items of a consolidate operation could take a long time and the progress meter would display little progress so the user might abort the operation, but when the operation began copying audio files, the meter would move much faster.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n1) Launch iTunes.\r\n2) Perform a consolidate library operation on a library that contains video and audio files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a"
