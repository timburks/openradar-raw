    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using a ABUnknownPersonViewController to display information (a phone number, web URL, and address) about people who are not currently in the user's address book (like the class is intended for). The information all displays properly. However, tapping on the address produces a URL that is not valid. The Maps application launches, but does not understand the URL, so it simply ignores it and does not show the address.\r\nFor example, if the address for the person is \"1 Infinite Loop Cupertino CA 95014\", the resulting URL that is launched looks like: \"maps:address=1%20Infinite%20Loop%20Cupertino%20CA%2095014%20United%20States&abPersonID=-1&abAddressID=0\"\r\n\r\nThe important part is \"&abPersonID=-1&abAddressID=0\". Obviously, since the person is not yet stored in the address book, it has no abPersonID. Maps launches and simply displays the last viewed location, not the Apple Headquarters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a ABRecord with at least the kABPersonAddressProperty set.\r\n2. Create a ABUnknownPersonViewController and set the allowsActions property to YES\r\n3. Display the ABUnknownPersonViewController in any manner and tap the address\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nThe Maps application is launched, but it does not zoom to the ABRecord's address\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo work around this, I created a UIApplication subclass that overrides -openURL: to launch a working URL."
