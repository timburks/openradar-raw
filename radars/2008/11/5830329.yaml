    description: "29-Mar-2008 05:19 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease provide a keyboard specific to entering monetary values.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe various UIKeyboardType's are wonderful - but there's a missing hole where it comes to entering money-specific values. UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad is what I'd like - with the simple addition of being able to add a \".\" character to represent the division between dollars & cents (or the \",\" where appropriate localized).\r\n\r\nThe option for UIKeyboardTypeNumbersAndPunctuation provides much smaller targets, where I'd like to keep the number targets highlighted, but enable the single punctuation mark. I believe a variation on the UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad with one of the values in the lower left being a \".\" (or \",\") would be about ideal."
