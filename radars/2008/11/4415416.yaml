    description: "19-Jan-2006 03:15 PM\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nAmazonClient, an example Web Services client referenced in the WebObjects documentation, is not present in the most recent release.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall latest xCode\r\nOpen /Developer/Examples/JavaWebObjects\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nAmazonClient should be a subfolder of /Developer/Examples/JavaWebObjects\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nAmazonClient is not listed among the examples given.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nApparently older versions of WebObjects included the example, but it is no longer is working, and has been removed from the current distribution, but will not be deleted if you install a newer version over an older one.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nA working web services example, especially interacting with Amazon.com, would be most helpful. A summary of the old functionality was given as, \"The AmazonClient application is a simple application that asks you to enter the name of an author. Then it uses the Amazon web service to request a list of books by that author, and displays the result. This example shows how to use the WebObjects Web service client to access a third party Web service.\""
