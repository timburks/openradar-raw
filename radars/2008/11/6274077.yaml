    description: "06-Oct-2008 10:09 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen syncing an iPhone 3G in iTunes (8.0.1) you are unable to fully open and use Xcode (3.1.1)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode when an iPhone 3G is syncing and the Xcode menu bar will appear but then Xcode hangs until the iPhone has finished syncing.\r\nWhen moving the mouse over the menu bar you get the spinning color wheel and if you control-click on the dock icon it says that Xcode is not responding.\r\n\r\nIf you force quit Xcode and restart it the same thing happens.\r\n\r\nOnce the iPhone is finished syncing Xcode will unfreeze and is then usable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should be able to be started and used while syncing a iPhone 3G.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode freezes and is unable to be used until the iPhone 3G has finished syncing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is happening to me on a Mac Pro (2 x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon, 10 GB RAM) running 10.5.5 with Mac and iPhone developer tools installed, and with an iPhone 3G running 2.1. This does not happen on the same computer with a iPhone 2G running 1.1.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'tesseract.spx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n04-Dec-2008 06:10 PM Dallas Brown:\r\nIt seems this bug is fixed in Xcode 3.1.2.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
