    description: "11-Apr-2008 04:55 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen launching another application on another space (e.g., via a dock icon, or Spotlight), Mac OS X will switch to the space the application is opening its windows on as soon as it does so. If I then switch back to the previous space, Mac OS X will often switch back to the new applicationâ€™s space, even though it doesn't not require attention. The focus does not change when the application is launched on the current space.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n\r\nThis varies between applications, but probably the best (but by no means only) example of NetNewsWire with many subscribed feeds. After the NNW window has initially opened, NNW will begin to process its feeds. During this process, Mac OS X will switch back to the NNW window and space several times. If NNW is opened on the current space (either deliberately tethered to that space, or not assigned any specific space), Mac OS X does not cause the window focus to shift to NNW while it is loading.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe launched application steals focus, shifting spaces in the process. This should never happen.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\n\r\nUnder Tiger, applications extremely rarely steal focus. The only exception that I can think of are system dialogs (e.g., keychain prompts). This is compounded by the fact that it's not just switching windows, but switching Spaces too. If an application requires attention, its dock icon should bounce. Application should not be able to steal focus (and definitely not switch spaces) except in critical situations; an application being in the process of launching, or having simply completed launching, is not a critical situation which requires immediate user attention.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\n\r\nMy apologies for not being able to describe exact circumstances in which this definitely occurs: I have experienced it with a number of applications, and because it can occur in the middle of typing a sentence, I've inadvertently deleted things as a direct result of this. On the positive front, it does only appear to occur while an application is launching, however it's possible to end up switching back and forth between spaces four or five times if an application takes a long time to launch (with Mac OS X repeatedly switching focus back to the new application even though it hasn't finished launching yet).\r\n\r\n14-Apr-2008 04:12 PM JOHANNA LUCAS:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.

Immediately switch to a different space. As soon as the application finishes launching, you will be switched to the space the application launched on.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, as per my e-mail earlier today, applications which are already running are able to steal focus, which may involve switching spaces if the new window opens on a different space to the one which is currently active. Applications should _never_ be able to steal focus; that is what dock bouncing is for.\r\n\r\n03-Nov-2008 06:22 PM JOHANNA LUCAS :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
