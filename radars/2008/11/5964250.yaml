    description: "27-May-2008 06:06 AM Alex Curylo:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n<audio> HTML tag is not supported in iPhone OS 5a274d seed like it is in current desktop Safari 3.1.1 (5525.18)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGo to the page \r\n\r\n*** PAGE NO LONGER EXISTS ***\r\n\r\nwhich has in the header this bit intended to start a background track playing immediately\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nvar audio = new Audio(\"shakethat.mp3\");\r\naudio.play();\r\n</script>\r\n\r\nand as the first thing in the body has this bit\r\n\r\naudio tag test:<br>\r\n<audio src=\"totheground.wav\" autostart=\"false\" controls=\"true\">FAIL</audio>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nListen, and look.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSomething similar to current desktop OS X Safari 3.1.1, which is\r\n\r\n1) the 'shakethat.mp3' file starts playing in the background on load\r\n\r\n2) after \"audio tag test:\" in the body is a QuickTime audio playback control bar which does indeed control playback of the 'totheground.wav' file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1) The debug console on the 5a274d device (iPod touch 32GB) brings up\r\n\r\nJavaScript Error on Line 21\r\nTypeError: Value undefined (result of expression Audio) is not an object. Cannot be used with new.\r\n\r\n2) The actual appearance of the screen begins with\r\n\r\naudio tag test:\r\nFAIL\r\n\r\nwhich is as expected from the source above if the <audio> tag is not handled I believe.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n5a274d is the first and only version of Mobile Safari we've tested this with."
