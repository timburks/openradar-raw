    description: "18-Nov-2008 12:53 PM Michael Akers:\r\nSummary: \r\nUICoverflow is a really nice API and there are alot of place where it could be used by 3rd party applications. It's probably better for the iPhone as a platform for there to be one very high quality implementation of Cover Flow that all 3rd party app developers could use rather than a variety of inconsistent independent implementations of the same thing. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app that uses UICoverFlow\r\n2. Try to get it into the App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app will be accepted into the app store, people will buy it, everyone (Apple, and 3rd party devs) are happy, and UICoverFlow is supported in future released os iPhone OS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app will be rejected by Apple with extreme prejudice for using an undocumented API.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUICoverflow has existed since before iPhone OS 2.0 and the SDK"
