    description: "30-Jun-2008 04:51 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nWhen an application is deleted, it's URL scheme is also unregistered from some internal database. Unfortunately, this can result in a situation where a previously installed application which supports the same URL scheme will no longer be registered in that internal database.\r\n\r\nFor example, say we have two applications \"Alpha\" and \"Baker\" that both support the \"foo://\" URL scheme. The following sequence of events will result in invalid registration:\r\n\r\n1) User installs \"Alpha\" and happily processes \"foo://\" URLs with it.\r\n\r\n2) User installs \"Baker\" and it now becomes the application that handles \"foo://\" URLs.\r\n\r\n3) User decides they don't like \"Baker\" and deletes it.\r\n\r\n4) From this point, anytime the user taps on a \"foo://\" URL, they will see \"Unsupported URL\" even though \"Alpha\" is still installed and able to handle \"foo://\".\r\n\r\n\"Alpha\" should be registered as a valid URL scheme at this point.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get \"Alpha\" to be registered is by deleting it and re-installing. This will delete user data in the process."
