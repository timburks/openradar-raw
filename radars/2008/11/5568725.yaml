    description: "30-Oct-2007 12:03 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nWhen writing a message, Mail creates tons of drafts in the \"Drafts\" box which are not removed when the message is finally sent. This is under OS X 10.5.0 with Mail version 3.0 (912.1/912). All my accounts are setup as IMAP and it occurs on all of them. My installation was an upgrade from 10.4.10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup an IMAP account setup to store drafts on the server\r\n2. Compose a new message\r\n3. Make changes sporadically over the course of a about 20 minutes (immediate changes do not appear to create separate drafts, but prolonged ones do)\r\n4. Observe drafts collect in large numbers in the \"Drafts\" box\r\n5. Send the message\r\n6. The drafts remain in the folder, even though the message is sent\r\n\r\nThis does not happen every time, however. I cannot find any differences between when I can reproduce and when I can't.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly one draft should be saved, and then removed once the message is sent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA multitude of drafts are saved and are retained even after the message is sent. They are made every minute (or less).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem did not occur in Mail under OS X 10.4.10.\r\n\r\nI attached Instruments to Mail when I experienced the multiple draft saving. I let it run through sending a message to see if it would clear the drafts, which it didn't. I have attached the trace file."
