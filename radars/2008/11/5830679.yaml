    description: "30-Mar-2008 12:03 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile using the tab key to flip to the next entry field when specifying an outlet, the wrong area becomes Key/Active\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n * Open a class in IB 3.1 to add outlets into. In my case, it was a UIViewController instance. \r\n * hit the plus item to add an outlet (Picture 1, attached), enter the data\r\n * hit \"tab\" to switch to the type field. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\n * The type field becomes editable, but a lower view labelled \"Class Multi-Outlets\" gets made key - so typing doesn't work for entering the type of outlet (Picture 2, attached)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n * The type field should become editable and key, enabling immediate typing to enter the data\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n * manually select the type field to make it active and key"
