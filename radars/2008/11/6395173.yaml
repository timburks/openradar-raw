    description: "It seems there's no way to create a UIFont object based on an truetype/opentype (or anything else) font included in the applications resource bundle. Neither does the ATSApplicationFontsPath Info.plist key seem to be supported.\r\n\r\nI can load (some) fonts using CGFontCreateWithDataProvider+CGContextSetFont, but frankly, I've not been able to produce results that looks acceptable for the human eye. Not to mention that the entire approach isn't too friendly either (finding and interating over glyphs and drawing them with CGContextShowGlyphsAtPoint).\r\n\r\nIs there's a magic Info.plist key along the lines of ATSApplicationFontsPath that I can use to add fonts to my application only (and not the rest of the system)?"
