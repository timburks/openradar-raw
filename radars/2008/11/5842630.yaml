    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen we are using input methods in Terminal.app, normally the users input results a text candidates buffer the waiting for submit into the application. Upon certain screen redraw by the command line program running at the time, the buffer of the input method waiting for submit would be flushed. In some case of the Chinese input, that could be a whole sentence that got drop without any possibility of recovering the data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n    The simplest (but rare) scenario is you launch vim and hit a to append text. Try to input some Japanese but don't hit return to submit it into terminal.app. Now drag the lower right of the terminal.app window to resize the window, now you see the input method buffer is gone without a trace.\r\n    A slightly complicated but (more possible) scenario is when users are using w3m (a text-based browser that can be installed through MacPorts.) on for example http://www.google.com.tw/, a user can try to use one of the Chinese or Japanese input method entering long text inside the search keyword field. (you need to move the cursor with arrow keys and press return to start entering text.) As you type more and more without submission the candidate buffer, your text buffer gets longer until the number of character is greater than the maximum candidate number and the earlier text will be automatically submitted into the search keyword field. Continue to do so until the search keyword field is full enough to push the text to the left of the field. And now the candidate buffer is gone.\r\n    The most common (but complicated) scenario is when users are using Terminal.app --> screen --> irssi (an IRC client for chatting that can be installed through MacPorts.), the input field of the message is stationary while other people's dialogues are scrolling up. The input method buffer waiting for submission will be lost. This has been tested with Japanese Hiragana input method and Traditional Chinese Hanin input method (both are bundled leopard input method.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen users are typing something with input method, terminal.app shouldn't flush the buffer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe input method buffer got flushed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot all kind of redraw events trigger the buffer flushing behavior."
