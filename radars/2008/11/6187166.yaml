    description: "Summary:\r\nPlayback of trailers inside Front Row is not smooth.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Front Row\r\n2. Navigate to Movies -> Theatrical Trailers\r\n3. Watch a trailer (for example WALLâ€¢E)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\LThe trailer should buffer for some time, then start playing and play smoothly until the end.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe trailer buffers for some time, then start playing and periodically starts buffering again, thus stopping playback for about 10 seconds each time. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\LThis seems to happen on \"middle\" speed internet connections.\r\nTo ensure you experience the erroneous behaviour described above, you may have to cap your connection speed at 200 KB/s by issuing the following terminal commands:\r\nsudo ipfw add pipe 1 ip from any to any\r\nsudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 200KByte/s\r\n\r\nThis only happens in Front Row 2.1.3 (and previous) on Leopard. The same trailers are playing fine in Front Row 1.x on Tiger.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have noticed (sniffed network traffic with wireshark) that CFNetwork is requesting the mov files by chunks of 65535 bytes by sending succesive GET requests with the http \"range\" option:\r\n...\r\nRange: bytes=65536-131071\r\nRange: bytes=131072-196607\r\n...\r\nThis seems odd to me, but I'm not sure how much it relates to the bug I described.\r\n\r\nAlso, here is a list of forum posts of people complaining about this problem. No reply provides a solution.\r\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=375439\r\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=476295\r\nhttp://www.123macmini.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=19770\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6558358\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7774746\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7651276\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7485081\r\nhttp://mac.justanswer.com/questions/1crzd-problem-front-row\r\nhttp://macosx.com/forums/mac-os-x-system-mac-software/298524-front-row-stopping-reloading.html"
