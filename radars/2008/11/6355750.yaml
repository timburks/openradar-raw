    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you call -insertObject:atArrangedObjectIndexPath: in an NSTreeController which is managing an object hierarchy, the new object is not inserted at the correct location in the model object's hierarchy if the indexPath has a length greater than 1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached project. This project uses a very simple model object with an NSMutableArray to hold the children of the object, and a subclass of NSTreeController that modifies the -add: method.\r\n2. Disclose the second level of both outline views\r\n3. Select SubItem 0\r\n4. click the Add Item button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new item should be added directly after the selected item, in both the NSTreeController's arrangedObjects hierarchy of NSTreeNodes and also in the underlying Item object hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, the new item should be added directly after SubItem 0 and before SubItem 1.\r\n\r\nThe resulting hierarchy should be the same in both NSOutlineViews, as both NSTreeControllers are bound to the same model.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new item is added in the correct location in the NSTreeController's arrangedObjects hierarchy, which you see in the left-hand NSOutlineView. \r\n\r\nHowever, the actual model objects are not updated correctly - the item is always added as the last item in the children array, which you can see in the right-hand outline view, which uses a separate NSTreeController for observation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested on other hardware or OS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem also occurs when using -moveNode:toIndexPath: which I assume uses -insertObject:atArrangedObjectIndexPath: under the hood.\r\n\r\nThis problem renders NSTreeController totally useless to me. Please let me know if there's something I'm doing wrong, but I can't see it. The model is just about as simple as it gets.\r\n\r\nUpdate for OpenRadar: project file for this bug is available at http://menumachine.com/quickies/TreeControllerFail.zip"
