    description: "I have an app that makes use of CoreLocation. It first checks CoreLocation for the current location when the application starts up. This works fine, and the app proceeds as normal. Later in the app we perform another location check. If the user selected \"Don't Allow\" in the first instance, then without fail, this time there are TWO dialogs presented. It appears that CoreLocation only pays attention to the button press of the second dialog. \r\n\r\nI'm using only a single instance of CoreLocation (I have a global variable, and instantiate it only once). If I disable the first location call, the second one still generates two alerts. \r\n\r\n\r\nClosed. \r\nNotes:\r\nOf course, after filing this bug, I found the problem (at least in this instance). It's due to the Medialets library. This call:\r\n\r\n      [[MMTrackingMgr sharedInstance] startDefaultTrackingWithoutLocation];\r\n\r\n\r\nseems to indicate that it won't affect CoreLocation calls, but the problem went away when I took it out."
