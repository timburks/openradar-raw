    description: "16-Nov-2008 07:26 PM Layton Duncan:\r\nPopularity rankings are currently calculated on number of downloads. \r\n\r\nI think it would be more reflective of popularity if rankings were calculated by some combination of total sales value, download numbers, and recent ratings.\r\n\r\nBasing popularity on number of downloads, while reflective for say song sales, has a number of drawbacks for applications. First not every application is the same price. It stands to reason that a $1 is more likely to get more downloads than a $10 app. The current system discriminates against higher priced applications."
