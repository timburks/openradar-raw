    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen saving the dueDate value of a CalTask object, it does not respect the time value in the NSDate and instead reverts it to 12:00PM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nCalTask *newTask = [CalTask task];\r\nnewTask.dueDate = [NSDate dateWithNaturalLanguageString:@\"November 15, 2008 11:00PM\"]\r\nNSLog(@\"dueDate = %@\", newTask.dueDate);\r\n// outputs: dueDate = November 15, 2008 12:00PM\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, I should be able to set the dueDate to be any time during the day that I want.  There are quite a few instances where being able to have a task be due at 3PM and then be notified via an alarm 15 minutes before that would be ideal.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time is set to 12:00PM so the only way to properly set an alarm is with an exact date & Time, which seems counterintuitive to the way it is done for CalEvents.  \r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
