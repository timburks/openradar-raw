    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe iSync status menu reappears sometimes after rebooting, even though I have unchecked the relevant checkbox in iSync prefs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an intermittent problem.  It doesn't reappear after every reboot.  Unable at this time to determine a common theme of the reappearance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUnless I specifically check the checkbox labelled \"Show status in menu bar\" (iSync/Preferences), the menu should not appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe status menu appears after rebooting, even though I have not checked the relevant checkbox."
