    description: "11-Jul-2008 08:12 AM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nThere is no way for developers to reply to reviews of our applications on iTunes. In some cases this is required because the review points to a misunderstanding or a feature that the user hasn't found.\r\n\r\nThe review system is obviously modeled after the one used for music. However, there is one key difference: people don't have functional problems with music.\r\n\r\nThey do with software and we need a way to address this fundamental difference."
