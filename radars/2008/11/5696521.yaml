    description: "Summary:\r\nTN2083 <http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html> lists only four of the five session types that the launchctl(1) manpage lists.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load up manpage for launchctl.\r\n2. Load up the launchd Agent section of the technote <http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html#SECLAUNCHDAGENT>.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nlaunchctl(1) lists the known session types as “Aqua, LoginWindow, Background, StandardIO and System.” The table of session types defines Aqua, StandardIO, Background, LoginWindow, and System.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nlaunchctl(1) lists the known session types as “Aqua, LoginWindow, Background, StandardIO and System.” The table of session types defines Aqua, StandardIO, Background, and LoginWindow.\r\n\r\nSystem is left out.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTiger had a different set of session types entirely, and its manpage for launchctl did not name them (because launchctl did not have any options that accepted session types). TN2083 also does not list Tiger's session types."
