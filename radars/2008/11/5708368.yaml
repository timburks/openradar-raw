    description: "25-Jan-2008 06:12 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nMany sites (annoyingly) redirect Mobile Safari to an iPhone version of their site. While I'm sure they are trying to be helpful in doing this, it often cripples the usability of their site in the name of making an \"iPhone Version.\" The point of the iPhone is to not need a crippled version of the web. Please make it an option in Safari's preferences to spoof the user agent string as Safari on Mac OS X and not as MobileSafari. Additionally, multiple options such as IE7, Firefox, or Opera would be helpful as well."
