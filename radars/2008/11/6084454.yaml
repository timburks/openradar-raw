    description: "17-Jul-2008 02:50 PM Joseph Heck:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIImageView animation doesn't have a call back to enable sequencing of animation\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUIImageView enables setting an array of UIImages for sequencing in a simple \"flip-book\" style animations. You can set a number of repeat times, but there isn't a call-back or delegate function that enables the system to switch into a different animation should you wish to sequence the animations without glitches and stops.\r\n\r\nI tried using an NSTimer, but (I believe) because the animation timing and NSTimer timing aren't related, you can run into an inherent race condition for matching up animations.\r\n\r\nI tried using KVO to get a notification callback on @\"animating\" - but the UIImageView method isAnimating doesn't trigger that path and not a property.\r\n\r\nI believe a delegate style callback function like as described with CAAnimation is a good solution:\r\n  - (void)animationDidStart:(CAAnimation *)theAnimation\r\n  - (void)animationDidStop:(CAAnimation *)theAnimation finished:(BOOL)flag\r\n\r\nThe notification system would work, but with obvious additional (and likely unneeded) overhead of routing through the notification system."
