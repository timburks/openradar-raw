    description: "Summary: \r\nThe Xcode Developer Documentation (window) has a few docs sets that cannot be removed/hidden from the source list view. This makes the source list crowded - there's no need for e.g. multiple versions of the iPhone OS doc set (since the latest version contains the most up-to-date documentation).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\na. Open the Developer Documentation window\r\nb. Look at the source list view [1]\r\nc. Try to remove the documentation set \"Apple iPhone OS\", or \"Apple iPhone OS 2.1\", either by bringing up the context menu for the item or by pressing the delete key on the keyboard (with or w/o combining it with the command modifier key)\r\nd. Notice that all the items in the context menu are disabled [2], and that the delete key does not remove/hide the item\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.grabup.com/uploads/452ed900ff06a68bbb27c5e63362c442.png?direct\r\n[2] http://www.grabup.com/uploads/d5b89ab5f9e94531b1d480f8f07a9d09.png?direct\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the item would be removable or hidden, either through an item in the context menu, or by pressing the delete key on the keyboard when the item has focus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe item cannot be deleted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've discussed this issue on xcode-users, and was encouraged to report this as a bug. See:\r\nhttp://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/xcode/2008/11/25/25983\r\n\r\nXcode Component versions:\r\nXcode IDE: 1149.0\r\nXcode Core: 1148.0\r\nToolSupport: 1102.0"
