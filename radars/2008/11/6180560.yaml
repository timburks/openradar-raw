    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a directory is expanded in the Xcode Organizer window, running a terminal command which changes a large number of files in it can lead to this assertion being shown several times:\r\nFile: XCConfigurableDataNode.m\r\nLine: 289\r\nObject: XCConfigurableDataNode\r\nMethod: replaceNodeFor:withNodeFor:at:\r\n\r\nCould not find the sub-node whose rename was requested.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce it reliably.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Compile a large project in its source tree and add the directory to the Xcode organizer.\r\n2. Expand its tab and some sub-folders so that source and object files are showing.\r\n3. Run \"make clean\" or equivalent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly seen on 3.1."
