    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of iTunes' note messages claims that iTunes will use a credit card to buy an iPhone app, even if it will actually use store credit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Store pane of iTunes' Preferences, set iTunes to “Buy using a Shopping Cart”.\r\n2. Visit any iPhone application's page in the iTunes App Store.\r\n3. Click “Buy App” or “Get App”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWell, truthfully, my expected result is that it just uses the shopping cart (x-radar://problem/6302641).\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, the note message should not mention a credit card: either it should say something generic, like “… and iTunes will complete the purchase immediately”, or it should specifically and accurately say which payment method—something like “… and iTunes will deduct the price from your store credit immediately”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt says “… and your credit card will be charged immediately”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior to iTunes 7.7, this message did not exist, so it could not have been wrong.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe full message:\r\n> Applications cannot be purchased with Shopping Cart.\r\n> \r\n> Your preferences are currently set to buy using Shopping Cart. Application purchases cannot be placed in Shopping Cart; they must be purchased by 1-Click. Select Buy if you'd like to purchase <application> by using 1-Click and your credit card will be charged immediately."
