    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Quick Look is activated and made full screen on a machine with multiple displays, the cursor hides after a few seconds even if it is actively in use on a different display. The cursor stays hidden until moved (with difficulty) onto the monitor with the Quick Look window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Finder, activate Quick Look.\r\n2. With the Quick Look window in any connected display, click the Full Screen button\r\n3. Move the cursor to another display, but do not allow it to idle\r\n4. Move the cursor back to the display with Quick Look\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor stays visible when active.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor is treated as idle when out of the Quick Look window, with the timeout beginning as soon as it moves to another display. The cursor is still usable, but does not show unless it is moved over the Quick Look window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone; Quick Look was introduced with 10.5. I do not have a 9A581 build to test with, but have no reason to believe the bug was introduced in 9B18 (10.5.1).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's acceptable, even desirable for the interface overlay in Quick Look to hide when the mouse is on another monitor, but the cursor should never hide when it's active. It's debatable whether it's desirable to hide it when idling with Quick Look in fullscreen on another monitor, but if you want to stay consistent with QuickTime Player, etc. the cursor should hide.\r\n\r\n04-Dec-2007 05:34 PM [redacted]:\r\nhis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
