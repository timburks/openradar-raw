    description: "01-Apr-2008 02:36 PM Mo McRoberts:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nSticky notes written with Stickies.app do not scroll except through keyboard navigation or by extending a selection\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch Stickies.app\r\n2. Create a new note\r\n3. Type more text into the note than will fit within the note's visible dimensions\r\n4. Use two-finger-scrolling on a MacBook, a Mighty Mouse scrollball, or similar, to scroll the viewport of the note\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe viewport should be adjusted in accordance with the HID scroll events\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe viewport is not altered.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nScrolling using PgUp/PgDown works as expected; scrolling by moving the cursor works as expected; scrolling by extending the selection works as expected.\r\n\r\n02-Apr-2008 03:32 PM JOHANNA LUCAS:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
