    description: "In the MacOS X Font Panel, the presence of the fourth column (the leftmost one) is too well-hidden. It is hidden by default, and can only be shown by enlarging the window using the grow box. Users would never expect that to give them an additional column with more functionality.\r\n\r\nPlease make this more obvious, e.g. by using a disclosure triangle instead."
