    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a Flash object has been in full screen mode (for example, a YouTube video), focus is not returned to the parent window. Pressing command+` to cycle through open Safari windows doesn't work until a window is clicked, and if the window is tabbed, pressing command+W prompts to close the entire window instead of just the active tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open two Safari windows\r\n2. In the first, create several tabs and load a page with a Flash object that supports full screen mode in the first; the other tabs may be empty\r\n3. Enter full screen mode in the Flash object\r\n4. Press escape\r\n5. Type command+W\r\n6. Repeat steps 2-4, or, if Safari prompts to close the frontmost window, press Cancel and proceed from step 3\r\n7. Type command+` several times\r\n8. Click a Safari window and repeat step 7\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen coming out of full screen mode, focus is retuned to the window containing the Flash object and Safari behaves normally. In the first test, the active tab is closed. In the second test, command+` cycles through the two Safari windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 4, neither window appears to have focus (i.e. interface widgets are grayed out, drop shadows are small). Pressing command+W on step 5 focuses the foremost window and prompts to close the entire window, as if command+shift+w had been pressed. Pressing command+` in step 7 is useless until a window is activated using the mouse.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI do not have a Tiger install on hand without Safari 3 (beta or release) installed, so I'm unable to test if this is new in Safari 3. I have been unable to prevent the bug in Safari 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n17-Jan-2008 03:25 PM [redacted]:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
