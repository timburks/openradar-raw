    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Rate on Delete feature targets dissatisfied users disproportionately, lowering overall ratings by urging users who delete to rate, while users who love the app have no interruption to rate.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Put app on store.\r\n2. 100 people download.\r\n3. 50 people (early adopters who buy everything mostly) delete the app.\r\n4. 15 of the deleters give 1-star.\r\n5. 35 who delete skip rating.\r\n6. 2 of the 50 who keep the application rate it 5 stars through the app store.\r\n7. 48 of the 50 who keep the application use it regularly and love it.\r\n8. Now you have a majority of users who are very satisfied with the application, but a 1-star rating.\r\n9. Potential new customers avoid your application because of the 1-star rating.\r\n\r\nNot only this, but established applications already have higher ratings and won't suffer from the early adopter issues, so their rating stay consistently high no matter what. Thus newer apps are even more disproportionately affected."
