    description: "Summary:\r\nInstantMessage.framework assumes that iChat is being used, and has no API for other applications that provide presence information to use. This results in (for example) Adium not being able to provide presence information to (for example) Mail, so the status indicators in Mail show only when iChat is being used. As well as crippling the system integration of third party clients, this also limits the adoption of InstantMessage.framework, since it will not work unless iChat is being used.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Adium\r\n2) Connect an IM account\r\n3) Open Mail.app\r\n4) Note that contacts who are online and have sent you mail do not have a green dot next to their name in Mail\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nAn API for presence providers should be available, as well as the existing API for presence consumers.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nNo such API is available.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of iChat/InstantMessage.framework have had this issue."
