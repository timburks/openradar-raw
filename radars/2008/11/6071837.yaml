    description: "12-Jul-2008 05:15 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nSometimes Console.app will only show a single line of the \"Log Database Queries\"; this affects all the queries. This did not happen on Tiger, probably because Leopard introduced the new ASL mechanism (and query system).\r\n\r\nDoing some research reveals that the culprit could be an oversized or corrupt /var/log/asl.db file. According to http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=400765, moving the asl.db file out of the way and restarting syslogd can fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThis has worked on a few occasions to correct the issue. I have attached one of the asl.db files of when this was happening. I moved this file out of /var/log, restarted syslogd, and had the asl.db file regenerate."
