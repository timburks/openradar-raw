    description: "27-May-2008 01:47 AM Jens Ayton:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen scrolling a message in Mail using the arrow keys, or when moving the insertion point in a new message using the arrow keys, the cursor is not obscured.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.\r\n2. Select a message.\r\n3. Press any of the following keys: up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, page up, page down, home, end. Observe that the cursor remains visible.\r\n4. Create a new message.\r\n5. Enter some text. Observe that the cursor is hidden.\r\n6. Move the mouse. Observe that the cursor becomes visible.\r\n7. Press the arrow/navigation keys. Observe that the cursor remains visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen navigation keys are pressed, the cursor should be obscured, i.e. hidden until the mouse is next moved or the user switches applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor is not obscured.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested with other versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSafari displays the correct behaviour when scrolling pages, but not in editable text fields. TextEdit displays the correct behaviour for editable text, as do the address and subject text fields in Mail itself."
