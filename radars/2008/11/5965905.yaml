    description: "27-May-2008 01:32 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nThere is no way to set a breakpoint in an application launched via a URL scheme.\r\n\r\nSince it is impossible to run more than one application at a time, you can't preload your application and attach to the process before application:handleOpenURL: is called.\r\n\r\nThere is also no way to hook into the launch process with gdb."
