    description: "15-Apr-2006 11:38 AM\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nProgrammer View in Calculator.app truncates decimals but this is not mentioned in the documentation, for example in \"The results of my calculations aren't correct\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. In Calculator.app, select \"Calculator Help\" from the \"Help\" menu\r\n2. In Calculator Help, select \"See all Calculator topics\"\r\n3. Select \"The results of my calculations aren't correct\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nOne of the options relating to the Programmer View should mention that decimals are truncated, not rounded as in the other views.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nOne of the reasons given is \"If you're using the programmer's calculator, values may not be displayed in the format you expected. Use the buttons marked Hex, Oct, and Dec to choose the correct format.\"\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nWith Precision set to 0, Basic View will calculate 2/3 as 1, but Programmer View will calculate it as 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2007 08:14 AM\r\n\r\nBug fixed in Calculator Version 4.0.5 (4.0.5) (Mac OS X 10.4.8 - Build 8L2127) on Intel Core 2 Duo iMac"
