    description: "17-Sep-2008 05:09 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nWhen I select a bunch of views at the top of a window (they're all well inside my window, none 'hangs off the edge'), and then choose Layout -> Embed Objects in -> Custom View from the menu bar, the view enclosing the views is often bigger than the window, i.e. its top and left lie outside the window and are clipped. If I really just wanted to embed the views in another without moving them, it gets very fiddly to get at the resize handles of the view (because the ones I'd need are off-screen now), make the view smaller, and restore the view's position.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could put a less huge margin around views, when wrapping them in another, or even better, to notice when a view would end up offscreen and constrain its rect to be inside the window (unless the views being wrapped are already offscreen, of course)"
