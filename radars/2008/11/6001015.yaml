    description: "11-Jun-2008 11:34 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nSome kinds of profiling (like Time Profile of Everything) can take a very long time to analyze, especially when they start paging. In some cases it might not even be worth waiting for it to complete, when you could just do a new profile on only one process, but Shark can't cancel out of creating a profile session. This would be a nice feature to add.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the profile mode to Time Profile and Everything in Shark.app.\r\n2. Start and stop profiling.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\"Start\" to change to \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\"Start\" is grayed out, and the only way to stop the profile analysis is to force-quit Shark."
