    description: "Summary:\r\nOne piece of documentation claims that you can't use a sdef directly; the other claims that you can since Tiger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the TN2106, the Scripting Interface Guidelines (http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html).\r\n2. Read man 5 sdef (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/sdef.5.html).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou learn nothing from either document that contradicts what you learn from the other.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTN2106: “While you cannot currently use an sdef directly, you can turn it into either of the other two formats using the sdp tool.”\r\nman 5 sdef: “If you are using Cocoa, Cocoa Scripting as of Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) supports using sdefs directly rather than preprocessing them with sdp(1)…”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe documentation was not wrong before Tiger granted the ability to use sdefs directly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTiger was released on 2005-04-29, and the manpage was updated on 2005-09-27. It seems that TN2106 was not updated to match it."
