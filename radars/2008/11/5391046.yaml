    description: "06-Aug-2007 10:38 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf both the X and Y Fixed coordinates to ATSUDrawText() calls are non-integer numbers, then drawing filled text over stroked text (for an outline effect) causes them to be visually misaligned.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached ATSTest.app. The topmost text should appear misaligned; compare with wrong.png and right.png.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nAll three lines to appear the same.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe bottom two text lines (one non-integer coordinate and no non-integer coordinates) appear correct. Outline seems thin on some letters (left side of \"k\") but not badly.\r\n\r\nThe filled text is visibly more to the lower left than its outline.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSimple to work around, just by rounding input coordinates; even if letters have fractional advances they don't seem to misalign.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nhttp://img141.imageshack.us/img141/2454/rightlq5.png\r\nhttp://img179.imageshack.us/img179/5062/wronggg7.png"
