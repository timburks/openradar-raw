    description: "18-Aug-2008 12:58 PM Zac White:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe 2.1 beta 4 breaks support for reading 3rd party applications data in /private/var/mobile/Applications/. This is a proposal for a compromise that should please everyone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet a directory enumerator on /private/var/mobile/Applications and you can only see your own app's folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nData should be able to be private in third party applications. But applications should also be able to opt-in to sharing data. This is why I propose that 3rd party applications have a folder in /private/var/mobile/Public/. Applications that would like to write data that other apps can see can easily write to their sandbox folder in Public and read from other folders in it. For example:\r\n\r\n/private/var/mobile/Public/B0DABFC9-33B3-48F8-A6C5-1E78F5F9A4CA/data.db\r\n/private/var/mobile/Public/1E78F5F9-48F8-33B3-A2D5-B0DABCH7D442/otherdata.db\r\n\r\nApplication 1 could read and write to the folder B0DABFC9-33B3-48F8-A6C5-1E78F5F9A4CA, but application 2 could only read from it. And vice-versa.\r\n\r\nObviously this idea can be applied in different ways. Perhaps /private/var/mobile/Applications/B0DABFC9-33B3-48F8-A6C5-1E78F5F9A4CA/Public/ could be accessible to other applications. So apps doing a directory enumerator on the apps folder would see:\r\n\r\n/private/var/mobile/Applications/B0DABFC9-33B3-48F8-A6C5-1E78F5F9A4CA/Public/\r\n/private/var/mobile/Applications/1E78F5F9-48F8-33B3-A2D5-B0DABCH7D442/Public/\r\n\r\nSo apps would just see Public for apps other than their own.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo user created data in 3rd party programs is accessible to other apps.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem does not occur in 2.0.1 and before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know this is an engineering decision and a security decision. Allowing opt-in public folders still allows apps to protect data from other applications, but if the developer wants, she/he can create public data that increases interoperability between apps and greatly increases the user's experience. Please consider this proposal."
