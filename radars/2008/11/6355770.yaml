    description: "Summary:\r\nOSA Kit, a public API since Mac OS X 10.4, comes with no documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit the Leopard Reference Library Revision List (http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/index-rev-date.html).\r\n2. Type “osascript” into the search box and press Enter.\r\n3. Flip through the pages of results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn or near the first page, you find a class reference for OSAScript, the most important class of the OSA Kit framework.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll references to “osascript” are talking about the command-line utility osascript (or its MPW ancestor, OSAScript), except for the AMAppleScriptAction class reference, which mentions the OSAScript class several times, but does not link to any documentation for it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. To my knowledge, OSA Kit has never been documented.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOSAScript appears to be the successor to NSAppleScript. However, it won't gain popular acceptance with app developers until there is documentation for it (especially the methods and related classes that it does not have in common with NSAppleScript)."
