    description: "10-Jun-2008 07:13 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nWhen I use the \"Open Quickly\" window in Xcode, it sometimes doesn't list anything for quite a while. When I then enter a full file name and hit return, nothing happens. It would be appreciated if in such cases where the list doesn't show anything, the window would still allow opening the file. Sometimes I just type faster than Xcode can build its list, and in those cases it could just accept my entry and that I want to open it and try to find and open the matching file.\r\n\r\nSTR:\r\n- Search Project panel is front most (not sure that's relevant or exclusive)\r\n- Hit Cmd-Shift-D to open \"Open Quickly\"\r\n- Type in \"CarbonEvents.h\".\r\n- For some reason the list of matches stays empty\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\n- Should behave like the old \"Open Quickly...\" panel and just let me click \"Open\" or hit return to open that file.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour:\r\n- \"Open\" button is disabled. I can do nothing.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n- If I delete a few characters off the end and type them in again, the list sometimes updates and \"Open\" enables.\r\n\r\nI've checked, and I definitely didn't mis-spell the text, it's pixel-exact the same."
