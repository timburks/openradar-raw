    description: "11-Mar-2008 10:40 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nPlease allow for applications to be installed on a iPhone and/or iPod Touch other then by the App Store.\r\n\r\nI understand that Apple doesn't want to allow some apps into their store and have those apps associated with Apple, but that does not mean that people do not want those apps or have the right to install and use those apps.\r\n\r\nApple can go as far as saying apps that are installed by other means besides the store are not supported, or even that before Apple will take a support case on an iPhone that it must be clear of non-store loaded apps. This way if someone has a problem they must remove the other apps and see if that fixes their problem, before bothering Apple."
