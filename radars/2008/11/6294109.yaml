    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nActivity Monitor.app shows incorrect VSIZE until the process is selected and inspected. The VSIZE then immediately changes to match the output of top. The process owner does not matter: root, user, daemon, etc. all all affected. The problem is also present in the System Memory summary at the bottom of Activity Monitor.app's main window where an incorrect (and rather large) VM size is reported (currently 30x larger than reported by top)\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open Activity Monitor\r\n2. Sort by VSIZE (unnecessary, but easier to see the change) & select System Memory (also unnecessary, but easier to see the immediate change)\r\n3. Select _any_ process and inspect (either via âŒ˜I or the UI Inspect button)\r\n4. The VSIZE changes to a much smaller value.\r\n\r\nAlso to try: open a new application (I used Dictionary) the VSIZE at creation in Activity Monitor is incorrect (963MB vs 394MB (in top))\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nActivity Monitor's reporting of VM size would match what is actually being used\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nIt doesn't.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nAffects both my 20\" iMac Core Duo and my Macbook Core 2 Duo (4GB RAM), with Leopard and all updates installed.\r\n\r\n16-Oct-2008 07:11 AM \r\nREGRESSION addendum:\r\nIf several process are inspected so that the VM size more closely matches reality (or the output from top) and Activity Monitor is quit and then reopened the VSIZE amounts revert to almost exactly the same number as before (1st instance). Also the VM size briefly flashes the correct size (or one closer to correct as defined as the output of top)-in my case 10.25 GB before reverting to a ridiculous size 42.15 GB.\r\n\r\n12-Nov-2008 05:14 PM \r\nACTUAL RESULTS / WORKAROUND Addendum:\r\nIf any other additional column is selected to view (# Ports, Private Memory, Shared Memory, Messages Sent / Received), Activity Monitor.app works as expected, showing relaistic numbers for VSize and for VMSize. This workaround carries over into a new session of Activity Monitor."
