    description: "* Summary:\r\nXcode's current script facility is OK, but it's a little weaker than it might be, I think because scripting is all done by running external scripts.\r\n\r\nWhat would be *really* cool is if Xcode exposed a Python object model and had a built-in Python interpreter. (I chose Python as a suggestion for a variety of reasons, not least the fact that it's relatively easy to integrate into other programs.)\r\n\r\n* Notes:\r\nIf someone decides to do this, it would be an extremely good idea to take a look at the model used by Emacs for Emacs Lisp, and to make sure that the Python objects exposed by Xcode have broadly equivalent functionality."
