    description: "Summary:\r\nPackageMaker ignores the permissions of the input contents as well as the permissions in the .pmdoc document, and always sets g+w on the files in the output package (non-flat), in both its bill-of-materials file and its archive file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build your product.\r\n2. Set the build product's owner to user root, group admin.\r\n3. Set the build product's permissions mode to go-w (neither group nor others have write permission).\r\n4. Run packagemaker: /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker --doc GrowlSafari/GrowlSafari\\ Installer.pmdoc --out build/Growl/Extras/GrowlSafari/GrowlSafari.pkg --version 1.1.3 -v\r\n5. Using lsbom and pax, or Pacifist, inspect the permissions of the contents of the package.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDirectories: drwxr-xr-x\r\nExecutables: -rwxr-xr-x\r\nOther regular files: -rw-r--r--\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDirectories: drwxrwxr-x\r\nExecutables: -rwxrwxr-x\r\nOther regular files: -rw-rw-r--\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPackageMaker 2.x didn't have this bug, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nAfter building the package, manually re-create the BOM file (with mkbom) and archive file (with pax), overwriting PackageMaker's broken output.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you'd like to try this out for yourself, use this command:\r\n\r\nsvn co -r4856 svn://src.growl.info/growl/trunk\r\n\r\nThe workaround is r4857."
