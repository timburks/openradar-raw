    description: "04-Aug-2008 08:58 AM:\r\nThe iPhone SDK lacks a documentation set for the OpenGL ES framework. The tutorial covers only a small subset of iPhone 3D graphics development and is unsuitable as a reference manual. It also does not explain in detail how frame and render buffers work with respect to the OpenGL ES implementation on the iPhone/iPod Touch.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a docSet that covers the basic gl* and egl* commands based on the html files available on http://www.khronos.org/opengles/documentation/opengles1_1/gl_egl_ref_1_1_20041110/\r\nThis does not cover any extensions though.\r\n\r\n\r\n'org.khronos.OpenGLES.zip' was successfully uploaded ()\r\n\r\n20-Nov-2008 01:06 AM:\r\nUpdated docset generation script and removed outdated HTML documents. The new XHTML ones are downloaded via wget -r now.\r\nRegressions:\r\n- docsetutil complains that it can't create a directory, but doesn't say which one\r\n- egl* functions are included in the manual but not available in Apple's GLES implementation\r\n- f/x/v postfixes are not recognised when searching, the index only includes the basename\r\n- Safari doesn't support MathML, thus formulas in the manual are not rendered correctly\r\n\r\n\r\n'org.khronos.OpenGLES.docset.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n(http://rapidshare.com/files/165578637/org.khronos.OpenGLES.docset.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nComment by Apple:\r\nEngineering has reported that this documentation has been updated and released for your viewing. Please verify with the latest release of this documentation.\r\n\r\n http://developer.apple.com/documentation"
