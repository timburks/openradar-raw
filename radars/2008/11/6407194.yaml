    description: "(This vanished from Radar and was re-submitted with ID #6477981, together with a set of power logs and screenshots).\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nIn some instances, iPhone 3G becomes very warm and drains the battery quickly (down from full to 20% in less than two hours) without user intervention. Phone is, in every instance, locked and in pocket, becoming noticeably warm to the touch after a while.\r\n\r\nUnlocking the device in that state is slow and overall interaction seems slightly degraded, which would be consistent with high CPU load and/or data traffic being generated.\r\n\r\nPowering down the phone and restarting it yields a cool phone within less than 5 minutes, which would be consistent with some kind of \"stuck\" process hogging the CPU.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be a specific set of circumstances that yield this behavior. It happens more than once a week, and without any discernible variation in usage patterns. The battery usually lasts a full working day when this does not occur, and charging patterns are regular (every night).\r\n\r\nIt has also happened at home, which is in an area with excellent 3G coverage and without the device moving from the table top during an afternoon (i.e., I set it down after locking it and came back to find it nearly drained) - this should exclude any radio signal level/repeated handover issues.\r\n\r\nA typical use case that _appears_ to have bearing on the problem is locking the phone by tapping the power button while reading e-mail or using an application.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, I shut the phone after reading e-mail or an SMS, and the e-mail components (which would be some of the very few bits of code allowed to run in the background) would, ordinarily, be my primary suspects.\r\n\r\nHowever, the phone is configured in the following way:\r\n\r\n- Multiple IMAP accounts + one Yahoo account + one Exchange account (all using SSL)\r\n- All accounts manually set to fetch, with no check intervals set on e-mail\r\n- Push services _OFF_ \r\n\r\nSo there would seem to be no reason for the e-mail client to maintain a connection or keep using CPU and radio resources.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niPhone 3G should not warm up and drain the battery in such an abrupt manner while locked and without any user interaction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe situation described in the summary happens more than once a week. It should be noted that iPhone 3G spends a considerable amount of time idle and is more often used for handling e-mail and SMS than handling calls.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have no firm recollection of this happening in firmware 2.1, but cannot say it is 2.2-specific."
