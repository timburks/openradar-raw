    description: "It would be nice to have a mutableCopy option for Obj-C properties. It's a rather large hole in the capabilities of the properties. It seems odd that you can do a straight copy but not a mutable copy when writing the accessor methods yourself you just have to change half a line of code. Example of syntax:\r\n\r\n@property (mutableCopy) NSMutableArray *array;"
