    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nNormally, when you click-and-hold on a button in OS X and its built-in apps, you can avoid issuing the click by moving the cursor out of the button area. For example, if you click-and-hold on the Back button in Safari, then change your mind, you can just move your cursor out of the button area. The problem is, in Mail.app, there's a specific part of the Send button that *will not* let you do this. This is a serious problem: as you're re-reading an e-mail you wrote, and you get ready to send it, and you click-and-hold on the Send button, then spot an error in your message that you want to correct... you can't. There's no way to get out of the stuck Send button. You can't Force Quit. (You could always kill the power to your computer, I guess!)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nClick-and-hold, then drag, in various spots in the lower-right section of the Send button in Mail.app 3.0. (It will require a few tries to nab the right area. See the included video for the area that you need to hit.)\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to move the cursor out of the Send button area, avoiding issuing the click.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThe button, and hence the window, gets stuck to the cursor. You can't mouse-out of the button area. No matter what you try to do, the message is going to get sent. Switching apps, force quitting, nothing prevents the message going out. (At least, nothing we tried! There's probably a way to finagle out of it, but we haven't found what that is yet...)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on all copies of Leopard from 10.5 through 10.5.2, all hardware."
