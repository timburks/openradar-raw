    description: "Summary: \r\nIt's very useful for users to be able to submit crash logs to developers when a crash occurs; however, currently there are four options for doing so, all of them bad:\r\n\r\n1) Apple's built in crash reporter. This is bad because the developer of the application never has access to the reports, rendering them essentially useless for fixing application bugs.\r\n\r\n2) Unsanity's Smart Crash Reports. This is bad because many users don't trust it at all, possibly for good reason (it uses an InputManager to insert itself into Apple's reporter). Adium currently uses this approach if the user has already installed it for another app.\r\n\r\n3) A custom crash reporter that suppresses Apple's. This is bad because Apple never receives the reports, and presumably that's something that's wanted (otherwise the built-in one wouldn't be needed). This is the approach used by Mozilla Firefox, Omniweb, early versions of Adium, and several other commonly used applications.\r\n\r\n4) A custom crash reporter that doesn't suppress Apple's. This is bad because it shows two separate pieces of UI for the same thing; one to send to Apple, and one to send to the app developer. I don't know of any apps that do this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Attempt to get automatic crash reports for an application from outside of Apple\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn API or tool exists for accessing crash report information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API exists, leading to use of the previously described workarounds."
