    description: "26-Aug-2006 08:22 AM Nello Lucchesi:\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWhen a playlist is too long to burn on a single Audio CD, iTunes offers to burn it across several CDs.  The songs themselves burn successfully.  However, the song names are lost on all but one of the CDs; they are named: track 1, track 2,...track n instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a playlist that has more songs than will fit on a single Audio CD.\r\n\r\n2. Burn the playlist.\r\n\r\n3. iTunes will note that the playlist won't fit on a single Audio CD; accept iTunes offer to burn on multiple Audio CDs.\r\n\r\n4. Insert additional CDs as iTunes requests to finish burning playlist.\r\n\r\n5. Check the names of the files on the Audio CDs.  Only one will have the song names; the rest of the CDs will have file names of: track 1, track 2, etc.  (The numbering of tracks restarts at 1 on each Audio CD.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nThis issue was posted Apple's discussion forum at:\r\n\r\n  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=584052&tstart=0"
