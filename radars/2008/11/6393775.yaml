    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen copying files into a project, where some of the files already exist, Xcode will copy over the files up until it reaches those which already exist and then fail. However, it will not add the files that it successfully copied to the target. Eg:\r\n\r\nFile 1\r\nFile 2\r\nFile 3 <-- This exists in the project already\r\nFile 4\r\nFile 5\r\n\r\nFile 1 and 2 will be successfully added to the project, but not the target. Files 3, 4 and 5 will not be added to the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select some files in one Xcode project, where a file with this name already exists in another project\r\n2. Drag the files from one project to another\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are 3 things that could happen, with the least ideal first and the ideal result last\r\n\r\n1. Xcode doesn't add any files to the project, undoing the files it has added when it encounters an error\r\n2. Xcode fails at the file that already exists but adds the files it did add successfully to the target\r\n3. Xcode produces and error asking the user whether they want to replace the conflicting file with the one they're copying, add a reference to the file that already exists with that name, or skip that file and continue adding those without conflics\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode fails at the file with the conflict, leaving any files before added to the project but not the target and any files after not added to the project."
