    description: Given the nature of the iPhone as an always-connected device, many applications have a social element baked into their DNA.  As a result, it is often desirable to express oneself in a way that is less prone to typographical errors on the software keyboard - for instance, typing :-) and not having it be auto-corrected to ;-). Emoji provide the perfect means of inserting rich visual graphics into streams of text without the associated overhead of using a webview or the complexity of writing a custom attributed string class. Similarly, extending the character-set so that it can be viewable on the desktop would be useful.
