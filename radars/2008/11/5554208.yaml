    description: "22-Oct-2007 08:06 PM Robert Sesek:\r\nWhile iCal and many other calendaring programs support multiple calendars, the iPhone does not. Any new items have to be added to a single calendar. Also, the calendar colors from iCal should be carried over to the iPhone so that events are color-coated based on which calendar they belong to. Finally, calendars should be able to be hidden from display (much like the way you can check and uncheck calendars from view in iCal)."
