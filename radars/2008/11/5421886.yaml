    description: "19-Aug-2007 08:12 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere are a multitude of flags named things like \"codecCanScale\" in various places, but none of them actually seem to do anything. It would be nice if they did, since the alternative is apparently to replace the Video Media Handler, and such things aren't documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. install attached Perian.component to somewhere.\r\n2. open movie.\r\n3. play to subtitle.\r\n4. resize window and observe image rescaling.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following flags are set:\r\ncodecCanStretch, codecCanShrink in the appropriate resource\r\ncodecCanScale in CodecDecompressParams.capabilities.flags\r\ncodecDrawsHigherQualityScaled in CodecDecompressParams.capabilities.flags2\r\nI would hope these would cause the image size requested for BeginBand to change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSize stays at the height/width in the image description.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMultiplying width/height in the image description by 4 works somewhat, except that CG draws unacceptably slowly sometimes (which I will report seperately) and older GPUs may not handle it well. This would be a much better solution."
