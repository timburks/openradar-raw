    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nTrying to save an image sent by e-mail to the phone results in the behaviour documented at:\r\n\r\nhttp://full-speed.org/archives/2008/11/21/iphone_22_update_image_issue.php\r\n\r\n...whereby saved photos are displayed in very bad (i.e., unsuitable) quality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduce self (i.e., have kids, socially more acceptable in wedlock)\r\n2. Buy iPhone and confirm that there is no way to send MMS depicting infant to friends and family (in Europe, slightly over 80% of current phones starting at the â‚¬50 bracket have MMS capability)\r\n3. Travel to another town, asking wife to send photos of kid at regular intervals by e-mail\r\n4. Open e-mail containing photo\r\n5. Scroll to view photo \r\n6. Hold finger on photo and save it to the phone\r\n\r\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe photo should be stored locally in such a way that it can be viewed at the best possible resolution/quality on the iPhone display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAs per URL above, photos saved in this manner are rendered in such a way as to suggest the image viewer is actually obtaining and upscaling the cached thumbnail from the album rather than the full photo.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDid not occur in firmware 2.1 or earlier. Also applies to saving photos on iPod 2.2."
