    description: "Summary:\r\nQuickTime Player assigns .m4a and .m4b files the same icon as .m4v and .mp4 files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create or obtain a .m4a or .m4b file.\r\n2. Associate it with QuickTime Player.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file's icon is the QuickTime logo on a plain document icon, with the name “MPEG-4” underneath it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file's icon is the QuickTime logo on a movie document icon (with sprocket holes down the sides), with the name “MPEG-4” underneath it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCompare to, for example, the MP3 icon. The basis for QTP's MP3 icon is a plain document icon, because MP3 files are always audio.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of .m4a and .m4b files (as well as .m4p files, which QuickTime Player currently provides no icon at all for, even though it can play them). Therefore, those files should have a different icon from .m4v and .mp4 files."
