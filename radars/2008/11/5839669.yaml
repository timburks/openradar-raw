    description: "02-Apr-2008 07:37 PM Jehiah Czebotar:\r\nWhen dashboard is active some underlying windows still receive and act on mouse movements when the mouse is over that area of the screen (even if a dashboard widget is between the mouse and the underlying window), and those applications can change the cursor while in dashboard which is misleading\r\n\r\nThis means that the cursor will changed based on movement over a window which you can't see because you are in dashboard\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis is reliably reproducible with Firefox 2.0.0.13, but not with other applications (that i have found; i surmise that it is possible though).\r\n\r\n* Open firefox, and have a link or area of firefox that will trigger a cursor change to the pointer from the arrow; \r\n* Invoke Dashboard\r\n* move mouse over underlying window; watch cursor change regardless of dashboard, and regardless of dashboard widgets that may cover that area of the screen.\r\n\r\nIt is counter-intuitive to have the cursor react to things that are not at the top of the screen\r\n\r\nfurther you can see firefox webpages react to mouseover events when dashboard is active. the firefox window should not receive mouse events as it is not the active window.\r\n\r\n07-Apr-2008 03:40 PM:\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate."
