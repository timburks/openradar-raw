    description: "23-Oct-2007 08:34 AM Robert Sesek:\r\nIt would be helpful to show, in the bar at the top of the screen, whether audio and vibrate are turned on. This would allow you to look at whether your phone will ring and/or vibrate at a glance. While the physical switch on will show you whether you're in \"silent\" mode or not, the phone can still vibrate. Currently, the only way to check these settings is through the Settings application."
