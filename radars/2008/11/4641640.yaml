    description: "20-Jul-2006 08:31 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nWhen creating new files in Xcode, it uses __MyCompanyName__ as the company name.  This can be customized from the command line like:\r\n\r\n% defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions -dict ORGANIZATIONNAME \"Dave Dribin\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this setting is global for all projects.  I'm a consultant and I often work on projects for multiple clients.  It would be great if this could be set as part of the project build settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nN/A"
