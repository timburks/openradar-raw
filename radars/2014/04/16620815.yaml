    description: "Summary:\r\nIf GCC_ENABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS is set to \"no\" in an Xcode project, iPhoneSimulator.platform does pass -fno-exceptions to the compiler, but *also* passes -fexceptions, re-enabling the use of exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by broken compiler flag configurations in iPhoneSimulator.platform's Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/Native Build System.xcspec, specifically:\r\n\r\n            {\r\n                Name = \"GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS\";\r\n                Type = Boolean;\r\n                DefaultValue = YES;\r\n                CommandLineFlag = \"-fexceptions\";\r\n            },\r\n\r\nXcode 5.1 does not set \"GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS\", which results in this flag defaulting to YES and -fexceptions being passed to the compiler. The actual configuration values used by Xcode 5.1 are \"GCC_ENABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS\" and \"GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS\".\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by adding \"GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS\" as a user-defined build setting, and setting its value to \"FALSE\"."
