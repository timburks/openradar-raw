    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Foundation Release Notes for OS X 10.9 a new feature was introduced for using NSStringGenderRuleType via the new Localizable.stringsdict file. The notes specify using integers to distinguish between the proper gender section in the strings dict. This does not work in practice and only returns (null).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with 3 labels for Male, Female, and Neutral\r\n2. Add a localized string to a Localizable.stringsdict file that uses NSStringGenderRuleType.\r\n3. Use `-localizedStringWithFormat:` and provide the appropriate gender integer and set that resulting value to the label\r\n4. Build and Run the app to see (null)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe proper gender should be displayed from the stringsdict file. Instead of \"Nick is (null) name\" it should read \"Nick is his name\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(null) is returned and, as is the case in the attached sample, it says \"Nick is (null) name\".\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSample can be viewed at https://github.com/jnjosh/RadarSamples/tree/master/GenderTesting"
