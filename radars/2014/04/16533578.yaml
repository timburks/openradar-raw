    description: "When an iPad's orientation is UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight, and the user starts a pan gesture outside the right edge of the screen (i.e., starting a swipe from the camera edge and moving your finger leftwards onto the screen), the expected UIPanGestureRecognizer or UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer (with edge = UIRectEdgeRight) callbacks are never called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIPanGestureRecognizer\r\n2. Attach it to a full-screen view\r\n3. Run\r\n4. Orient the device in landscape, with home button on left and camera on right\r\n5. Start a swipe outside the screen on the camera edge\r\n6. Move your finger to the left onto the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIPanGestureRecognizer action selector is called, starting when the finger moves onto the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIPanGestureRecognizer action selector is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.6\r\n7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample code:\r\n\r\n- (void)viewDidLoad {\r\n    [super viewDidLoad];\r\n\r\n    UIPanGestureRecognizer *pan = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handlePan:)];\r\n    [self.view addGestureRecognizer:pan];\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)handlePan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)pan {\r\n    NSLog(@\"panning\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also observe this issue in Maps.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on multiple iPad 3s."
