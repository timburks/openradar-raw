    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a problem with calculation of layout when the CSS has media queries with width on div, that contains image.\r\n\r\nWhen I set specific font size in iBooks that matches that query, then the image gets size from normal styles, layout is saved, and after that is applied media query rules and no update of layout. That leads the text is shifted and some lines are hidden (out of the frame of web view).\r\n\r\nSome users which bought this book are disappointed. That is bad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload book (Apple ID: 647932270) to iBooks on iPad.\r\n- Select Original font\r\n- 7 times tap for larger font (maybe 8 times)\r\n- Rotate iPad to landscape\r\n2. Go to page 30-31\r\n3. And go to next page\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpdate layout after applying rules from media queries, so no text is hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome lines are hidden\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niBooks version: 3.2\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn image there is red lines, that should highlight skipped text.\r\nI enclosed the source of book in case you cannot download from store :)\r\n\r\nTo eliminate this bug I have to remove media queries and the book will look bad. At specific font sizes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad, Landscape\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ibooks_bug_image.jpg' and 'konec_prokrastinace6.epub' were successfully uploaded."
