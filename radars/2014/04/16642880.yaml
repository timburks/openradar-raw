    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari crashes 100% of time on page re-load while streaming audio to BT device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. iPhone 5s (iOS 7.1) + TDK Bluetooth speaker model A33\r\n1. Visit atp.fm/live while podcast is streaming live\r\n2. Begin playing stream\r\n3. Connect iPhone to A33 for audio output of audio stream\r\n4. Re-load webpage (via top menu standard controls)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPage should reload normally, halting audio stream.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari crashes entirely 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have not regressed this with other streams or other BT devices. I would presume there is nothing special or unique about the way ATP streams in Safari. I don't know of other pages where streams exist but I would think Google should produce some. Hopefully the screen shot should give someone on Safari team via visual inspection a clue about what streaming mechanism being used here.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n iPhone 5s (iOS 7.1) + TDK Bluetooth speaker model A33"
