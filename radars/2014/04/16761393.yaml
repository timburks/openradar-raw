    description: "An app can become active in the background due to a Significant Location Change (SLC). To properly initialize itself, the app may need to load values from [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]. When the user reboots the iPhone due to battery exhaustion, OS update, or explicitly, the app can be woken up in the background due to a SLC, before the user had a chance to unlock the iPhone. [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] are always protected until first unlock. When the app reads values from [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults], nil values are returned, because the phone has not been unlocked since reboot. It has been observed, that after the subsequent \"first unlock\", the contents of [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] are blank. This has been observed on iPhones protected by a passcode.\r\n\r\nAnd if [[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize] is called while the app is active before the first unlock after a reboot, the data stored in [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] will be lost."
