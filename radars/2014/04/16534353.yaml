    description: "Summary:\r\nOccasionally when I look at the multitasking snapshot for my Sprite Kit game, parts of the app have been blacked out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI don't know how to reproduce this reliably. Perhaps it's caused by memory pressure, or a complicated scene graph, or something.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe snapshot in the iOS multitasking UI accurately resembles the scene graph.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe snapshot in the iOS multitasking UI sometimes has blacked out sections, or is completely blacked out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S"
