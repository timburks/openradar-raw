    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a CAC for DoD sites, the PIN prompt appears but does not have focus.  It should, because it's necessarily the next step.  Having users mouse over to it and click before being able to enter the PIN accomplishes nothing positive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInsert CAC/PIV/Smart Card.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPIN windows should appear with focus."
