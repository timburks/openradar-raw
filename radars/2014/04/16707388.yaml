    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running application tests, Xcode will make the simulator the front-most window. When the tests have completed, focus does not return to Xcode. Currently, I must Cmd-Tab or click in the Xcode window in order to continue working in Xcode. I find this intervention, when repeated many times per day, wholly disruptive to my concentration, not to mention frustrating.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project with tests\r\n2. Add a few simple tests to the project\r\n3. Run the tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, the simulator should not be moved to the front at all. However, if that is not an option, automatically returning focus to Xcode when the tests have completed would be an acceptable compromise. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe simulator remains in front of Xcode when the tests has completed."
