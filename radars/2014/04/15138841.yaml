    description: "UIViewControllerâ€™s back button sometimes displays strangely if the title is updated when the view is already displayed. For example, it might show \"< B\" instead of just showing an arrow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a navigation controller that pushes a second view controller.\r\n2. Make sure the view controller has a short title (or none at all) when it first displays its view.\r\n3. Set the second view controller's title property to something fairly long after the view has already appeared.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe back button should adjust in the same way that it would if the view had not been displayed yet. For example it should shorten to \"< Back\" or just \"<\" and not anything in between.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDepending on the text used, the back button will often display as \"< B\" or even cut off the text in the middle of a letter. It seems to correctly adjust the size of the button, but fails to re-draw it to fit the space.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis bug seems to be slightly more specific than I originally thought. The initial view controller apparently has to have a long title as well or the bug isn't triggered. The attached app reproduces the bug (only on iPhone). New steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the app on an iPhone or the iPhone simulator.\r\n2. Tap the + to add a row.\r\n3. Tap on the row and wait a moment.\r\n\r\nThe title will update, and the \"< Back\" button text gets cut off."
