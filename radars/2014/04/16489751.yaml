    description: "I just set up a new Time Machine backup drive, and I chose to encrypt the drive using FileVault. I used 1Password to generate and save a super-secure random 50-character password. The first time I rebooted my computer, I was prompted to unlock the drive, and I could not paste my password into the dialog box, or even use the keyboard to interact with other apps like LaunchBar or 1Password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable FileVault on your computer.\r\n2. Connect a new Mac-formatted hard drive.\r\n3. When the system prompts you to use the drive for Time Machine, choose Yes.\r\n4. When the system prompts you to encrypt the drive, choose Yes (I forget if 3 and 4 are separate dialog boxes or not).\r\n5. Use 1Password to create and save a random password.\r\n6. Enter the password and continue.\r\n7. The drive starts the initial backup.\r\n8. Later, restart the computer.\r\n9. When the drive first tries to mount, it will prompt you for the password with an option to remember the password in the keychain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can open and unlock 1Password, copy the password, and paste it into the dialog box.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to type out the 50-character random password, because I can not perform the following actions:\r\n1. Open 1Password using LaunchBar. I used Command-Space to invoke LaunchBar, but anything I typed just went into the password dialog box’s password field. I did not try this with Spotlight, but I suspect it would be similar.\r\n2. Unlock 1Password via the 1Password Mini menu item. I clicked the key icon, but anything I tried to type again went to the FileVault unlock dialog instead.\r\n3. Open 1Password from the Applications folder. Most clicks on the Finder seemed to be being rejected.\r\n\r\nI canceled the dialog, opened 1Password, and copied the password. When I disconnected and reconnected the drive, the dialog box appeared, and I was not able to to Command-V to paste. A right-click on the text field did not present a menu either. I also tried selecting the text in 1Password and dragging-and-dropping it into the password field, but it did not work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.2 (13C64)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMuch of this problem could be circumvented if the setup UI for an encrypted Time Machine disk included the option to remember the password in the keychain at the time that it is created. But for disks encrypted on other computers, it would still be useful to be able to access 1Password, Keychain, etc. while the unlock dialog box is visible.\r\n\r\nAttached a screenshot of the dialog box where I could not paste my password.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot of the offending dialog box: http://cl.ly/Ukfi"
