    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode doesn't show all commits available at the moment (even if we count only commits affecting current file)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn the current repository, this bug is always reproducible. It affects all team members working with this repository and Xcode.\r\nInspecting file with comparison or logs view doesn't show all the commits affecting current file.\r\nXcode is approximately 10 commits behind actual repository (although the local clone of repository is up to date)\r\nAny other 3rd-party tool including command line \"git\" shows more (all) commits.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should show all commits affecting current file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode is ~5 commits behind (at the moment) comparing to what other git-clients show."
