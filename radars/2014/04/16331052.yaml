    description: "When I present an MFMailComposeViewController, sometimes the tintColor of the cancel button in the top bar ends up being white on white (really white on very light grey).  This is very confusing to the user.  If I hit the invisible cancel button, it operates normally, so the button is there, just styled incorrectly.  My application does use a nav bar with custom tintColor, barTintColor, and bar style.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI haven't been able to find a reproducible test case for this, but it seems to happen only the first time the composer is displayed, presumably when the composer background process is just started.  Subsequent accesses after updating the application's nav bar colors seem to work normally in all cases.  I have seen this behavior on both the Xcode 5.0 simulator and a physical iPhone 5s.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA blue 'cancel' button on light grey top bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA white 'cancel' button on light grey top bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.6  11b651\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIOS7.0.6, iPhone 5s"
