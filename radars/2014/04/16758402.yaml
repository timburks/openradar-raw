    description: "Similar to UITableView, UICollectionView needs to inform the delegate of when a cell will be displayed on screen. This would be useful for lazily loading content, configuring cell appearance, animations, and many other use cases.\r\n\r\nThe dataSource method â€“collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath: does not solve this purpose since it may depend on the layout being called much earlier and for cells that might not be displayed in the visible area."
