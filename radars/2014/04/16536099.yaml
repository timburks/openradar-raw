    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an iPad in landscape mode to view an iPhone only app that doesn't support landscape orientation, auto rotate the app view to maintain proper visual rotation. There are enough pixels to support the reduced view in either orientation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nusing an iPad in landscape orientation, open an iPhone only app such as instagram.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\napp opens in a windowed view in the proper rotation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\napp opens sideways enforcing the portrait only orientation."
