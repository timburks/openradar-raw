    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UIASlider's dragToValue function, the thumb of the slider jiggles and goes to the wrong value (see this GIF: http://maxgabriel.github.io/images/uiasliderBug2.gif ) note how when the value is set to 1 the slider actually ends up at ~0.8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached sample project and open the .xcodeproj (or else clone the repo here https://github.com/MaxGabriel/UIASliderBug)\r\n2. Select the iOS 7 simulator (I used retina 4 inch, 32 bit)\r\n3. Run Instruments (command+I) and choose the Automation template\r\n4. From the scripts area of the left sidebar, choose 'import' and choose the UIAutomationScript.js file (included in the zip or in the repo)\r\n5. Press the 'run/record' button in the top left\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe slider smoothly slides to the given values in the script.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe slider jiggles when sliding to some values, and ends at the incorrect value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\nInstruments Version 5.1.1 (55045)\r\nOS X 10.9.2 Build 13C1021\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is possibly a duplicate of http://openradar.appspot.com/15723925 but I am unable to confirm because the mentioned videos look to have been included in the original Radar, but not in the OpenRadar report.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe `dragToValue` function works correctly on iOS 6. I have replicated the problem on iOS 7 and 7.1\r\n\r\nOf note is that sometimes the function worksâ€”note in the attached/linked GIF that it slides to 0.9 correctly, but fails to slide to 0.5 or 1.0 correctly. Potentially it only has problems with some values? However, I am able to replicate it using the value 1.0 every time.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'uiasliderBug2.gif' and 'TestSlider.zip' were successfully uploaded. // The gif is available at the link above, and the sample project is in the github repo above."
