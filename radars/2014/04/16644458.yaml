    description: "I´m building an SDK that relies heavily on the iBeacon ranging and monitoring. Several customer are using our SDK already but they are reporting weird behavior, which I´m now sure is a bug in iOS 7.1\r\n\r\nI was able to get my hands on three devices which experienced the bug. Rebooting 2 fixed the undesired behaviour. One device had a broken on/of button, so rebooting was not an option. I was able to connect that device to XCode and install Apple´s sample application AirLocate with some additional proximity UUIDs added (8 in total). I had it running with breakpoints and came to the following conclusions.\r\n\r\nOne customer reported getting the the kCLErrorDomain error 5 (monitored too many regions) but the app he was using was only monitoring 9 regions. Restarting the device fixed the error.\r\n\r\nWe´ve also been in non-technical call with some Apple employees from Munich, one of them reported this behaviour as well. Rebooting fixed his phone as well.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nDon´t reboot the device for some days. iBeacon based apps stop working.\r\n\r\nAll other BTLE related APIs seem to work fine. I was able to connect to a TI Sensortag  and scan for peripherals..\r\n\r\nReboot the device and iBeacon ranging and monitoring start working again.\r\n\r\nYou can use the AirLocate <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/AirLocate/Introduction/Intro.html> sample API and some iBeacons to reproduce the behviour if a device is affected.\r\n\r\n**Expected Results**\r\niBeacon ranging and monitoring callbacks should trigger callbacks. CLLocationManager does not call either of the two callbacks:\r\n\r\n\t- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didRangeBeacons:(NSArray *)beacons inRegion:(CLBeaconRegion *)region\r\n\t\r\n\t- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager rangingBeaconsDidFailForRegion:(CLBeaconRegion *)region withError:(NSError *)error\r\n\t\r\nneither does the Region Monitoring call any of the callbacks:\r\n\r\n\t- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didEnterRegion:(CLRegion *)region\r\n\t\r\n\t- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didExitRegion:(CLRegion *)region\r\n\t\r\n\t- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didFailWithError:(NSError *)error\r\n\r\n**Actual Results**\r\n\r\nNo callbacks at all.\r\n\r\n**Configuration**\r\ndirect contact with customers experiencing the problem who had the following devices:\r\n\r\n* iPhone5\r\n* iPad3\r\n* iPhone5s\r\n\r\n**Version/Build**\r\nOnly seen with devices running iOS 7.1\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes**\r\nI´ve yet been able to reproduce the problem sucessfully.\r\n\r\nOther resources online from people experiencing the bug:\r\n\r\n* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20164952/cllocationmanager-kclerrordomain-codes>\r\n* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20905843/locationmanagerrangingbeaconsdidfailforregionwitherror-kclerrordomain-16>\r\n* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23029197/monitoringdidfailforregion-when-regioning-for-ibeacon-kclerrordomain-error-5>"
