    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling [actionSheet showInView:currentContentViewOfPageViewController] will show the action sheet to the right of the screen. You can not see the action sheet, neither dismiss it, so the main window is completed blocked by _UIAlertOverlayWindow and the app is stuck there forever.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app(http://cl.ly/0E3H2e342a18).\r\n2. Long press anywhere to show the action sheet.\r\n3. Notice the overlay at the right edge of the screen.\r\n4. Dump the view tree of the top window(_UIAlertOverlayWindow) to see the bad position of action sheet."
