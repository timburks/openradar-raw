    description: "Summary:\r\nIn case of an app update that is in \"pending developer release\" status, when downloading promo codes for the currently available version of an app the downloaded codes are associated to the new \"pending developer release\" version instead of the version for which the download was requested.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nThe currently available version of an app is 1.0. The 2.0 version of this app is in \"pending developer release\" status.\r\nNow when requesting the remaining promo codes for the 1.0 version, the codes are associated to 2.0 instead.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nThis behavior is clearly unexpected because the promo code section is explicitly placed on the version level, not the app level. The consequences are quite bitter if all remaining promo codes are downloaded in expectance of a new 100 codes contingent."
