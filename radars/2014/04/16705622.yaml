    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen submitting an app update to the App Store, after it is approved it goes through a \"Processing for App Store\" phase. This used to be pretty quick, only a few minutes or an hour at most. Now it is common for it take hours, sometimes days, for the app update to show up for users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Submit an app update.\r\n2. Wait a few days for it to be approved.\r\n3. Watch the status change to \"Processing for App Store\".\r\n4. Wait a long time and notice that it's still not available.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRegardless of how long an app is in review, when it is actually approved, it should show up in the App Store immediately or within minutes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften takes 8 hours or longer for an app to be live in the store after being approved."
