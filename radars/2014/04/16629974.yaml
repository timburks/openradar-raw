    description: ".NET and JS provide references to the offending line number when a program crashes. Objective-C / LLDB on the other hand only gets as specific as a method name. This makes debugging much more difficult than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there are cryptic ways <http://stackoverflow.com/a/18135512> of determining the offending line of compiled(?) code, but that's very convoluted and a pain in the ass.\r\n\r\nIt would be a HUGE benefit to developers if LLDB could determine what line of uncompiled code is throwing fits."
