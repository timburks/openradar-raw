    description: "Summary:\r\nUIScrollViews setContentOffset: behaves different than setContentOffset:animated:NO. You would expect, that it behaves the same when animated:NO is given. You would even expect, that one method calls the other one.\r\n\r\nActually setContentOffset: just changes the offset without canceling any running animation/deceleration. setContentOffset:animated: on the other hand actually stops any running animation, but ONLY when animated:NO is given.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild a UITableView with a lot of cells, e.g. 2000. Scroll, so the scrollView keeps scrolling after you lift your finger. Call setContentOffset: or setContentOffset:animated:NO during the time, when it still scrolls.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou would expect on any manual change, that the animation will be stopped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation is ONLY stopped when calling setContentOffset:animated:NO, but NOT when using setContentOffset: or setContentOffset:animated:YES\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested in 6.1 and 7.1.1, probably the same in earlier versions\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nStackoverflow has some related questions, e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3410777/how-can-i-programmatically-force-stop-scrolling-in-a-uiscrollview/23290943\r\n\r\nThe behavior should at least be documented. That's not the case currently."
