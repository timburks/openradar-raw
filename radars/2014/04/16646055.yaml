    description: "Summary:\r\nA collection view cell cannot be **selected** if the collection view delegate indicates that the cell should not be **highlighted**. These should be independent factors, as the collection view delegate also has a method to indicate that a cell should not be highlighted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a collection view\r\n2. Click on a cell; it is selected normally.\r\n3. Implement the UICollectionViewDelegate method collectionView:shouldHighlightItemAtIndexPath: and return NO\r\n4. Click on a cell; it is NOT selected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncollectionView:shouldHighlightItemAtIndexPath: should not have any impact on whether the cell is selected. After all, that's what collectionView:shouldSelectItemAtIndexPath: is for.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReturning NO from collectionView:shouldHighlightItemAtIndexPath: prevents the cell from being selected. setSelected: on the UICollectionViewCell object is not called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPotentially related to rdar://16645887\r\n\r\nIt's possible that this is the intended behavior, and the documentation needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nCode sample: https://github.com/brockboland/CellSelectionPrevention"
