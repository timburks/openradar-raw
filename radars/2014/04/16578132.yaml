    description: "Summary:\r\nCrash in Core Media Framework.\r\nThis crash occurred in a modal View Formsheet in the iPad.\r\nThe way the project is set is described below:-\r\n1) The Modal View Formsheet is a CollectionView.\r\n2) Xibs are loaded on the CollectionView Cells. The Collection View Cell occupies the entire CollectionView frame. That said, at a time only one Xib is displayed. A user can navigate between these xibs using swipes, and next buttons(Located on the NavigationBar)\r\n3) A UIView is displayed on the Xib.\r\n4) A video is loaded on this UIView locally. There is a custom Video class which is a subclass of UIView. This video/movie class controls the Play, Pause and AutoPlay.\r\n5) There are certain user defined runtime attributes added on the UIView which is subclass of the video/movie Class in the Xib.\r\nFor Example. BOOL values like canAutoPlay, repeatPlaying.\r\n\r\nThe iOS version the User was running on his iPad was iOS 7.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnable to reproduce this crash, however the crash log suggests that a user was swiping between these xibs which was playing the videos and the App Crashed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser is able to successfully navigate between these xibs playing videos.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App crashed while navigating between these Xibs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUnable to reproduce this on any of the iOS versions 7.0 and above."
