    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode is a nice IDE, but the fact that it doesn't support file templates is not cool. There are ways by which files under ~/Library/Developer get picked up as templates, but it is extremely complicated and not documented.\r\n\r\nI need for example a certain test framework, and it's boring to add this every single time I create a test file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSimple file templating. This feature doesn't need to support inheritance, which apparently made the existing template mechanism so difficult to use (or even document, which is I guess the reason why it's undocumented).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 on OS X 10.9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
