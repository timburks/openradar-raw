    description: "Summary:\r\nIf Modules are enabled, it is impossible to call any of the macros in tgmath.h. Turning them off makes the macros work again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a sample project.\r\n2. Go to project settings and make sure the \"Enable Modules(C and Objective-C\" is set to \"Yes\"\r\n2. In any file, #import <tgmath.h> and add a single line of code calling a function overloaded in tgmath (such as \"CGFloat test = round(35.5);\").\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n The tgmath round() macro should be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe regular math.h function is called. This can be easily seen by performing cmd+click on the function call to see its declaration. If you go back to the project settings and turn the Modules setting to \"Off\", the macro starts working instantly and cmd+click takes you to the tgmath declaration\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs 100% of the time using Xcode 5, with both the iOS SDK and the OS X SDK."
