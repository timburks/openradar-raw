    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing exlusionPaths on the textContainer property of UITextView leads to 100% CPU usage and huge amounts of used memory on iOS 7.1. The issue only seems to arise for certain UIBezierPath rects. In my case, the problem occurs when I create the  UIBezierPath with a CGRect whose origin.x is zero (i.e. settings the rect's origin.x to 1 fixes the issue). \r\n\r\nThe problem does not exist on iOS 7.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITextView with some text\r\n2. Create a UIBezierPath with a CGRect like CGRectMake(0, 0, 50, 50)\r\n3. Set textView.textContainer.exclusionPaths array to include the UIBezierPath\r\n4. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UITextView should render with a blank space in the (0, 0, 50, 50) rect and the App shouldn't hang or crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App hangs, CPU usage goes up to 100% and huge amounts (easily 1GB) of memory is used. After a few minutes the App crashes with malloc: *** mach_vm_map(size=1048576) failed (error code=3) *** error: can't allocate region\r\n\r\nThe problem is currently being discussed in the Apple Developer Forum at https://devforums.apple.com/message/960349#960349"
