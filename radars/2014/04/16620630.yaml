        Summary:
        With OS X 10.9, the Sync framework which used to make direct sync of calendar, contact or Safari bookmark data between iOS devices and iTunes possible has been removed form OS X. iCloud sync however is not available to people below legal age to get an iCloud account (13 years or older, because the whole world is operating under Californian jurisdiction, as wer all know). This makes it impossible for children under that age to synchronize their iDevices with their Macs.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. get a Mac running OS X 10.9.
        2. get an iDevice of your choice.
        3. make sure you have disabled iCloud on both (remember: you are 11 years old and not allowed to have such an account).
        4. enter your dad’s mobile phone number into the contacts app on your iDevice.
        5. enter your school schedule in iCal on your Mac.
        6. ask your resident Apple guru how to get the data set from one device to the other.

        Expected Results:
        “It just works, son”.

        Actual Results:
        “You can’t. Nobody your age should worry about anything else than Minecraft, anyway.”.

        Regression:
        Any OS X version below 10.9.
