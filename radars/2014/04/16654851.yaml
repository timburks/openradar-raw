    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen there is an MKMapView placed inside a UIView and it is under the status bar and/or navigation bar, the centerCoordinate property returns the centerCoordinate as if the map didn't extend under the status bar and/or navigation bar.  The center property of the MKMapView returns the correct screen center and when calling convertPoint:toCoordinateFromView:, the correct center coordinate is returned but it is different than the centerCoordinate property by half the height of the status bar and/or navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project.\r\n2. Add a MKMapView to the main UIView and have it's frame take the full screen.\r\n3. Wire up the MKMapView to the parent UIViewController.\r\n4. On viewDidLoad, NSLog the centerCoordinate property of the MKMapView and NSLog the coordinate received from calling convertPoint:toCoordinateFromView: passing it the center property of the map and the map itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 2 coordinates logged to the console should be the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 2 coordinates logged to the console are different.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
