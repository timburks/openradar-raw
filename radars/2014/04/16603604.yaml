    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create or edit a reminder entry, press Home, and (close|OOM evict|reboot) Reminders out of memory, then that edit disappears as if it never happened. In order for a change to be saved, you must click another item or press Return. This is in stark opposition to Notes, which is comfortably aggressive about saving user data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Edit a Reminder event, append \"some stuff\"\r\n2. Press Home \r\n3. Double-tap Home, force close Reminders (alternative: reboot device, launch heavy apps)\r\n4. Relaunch Reminders\r\n5. Discover \"some stuff\" is missing from the entry in step 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLeaving Reminders via the Home key should err on the side of preserving the entry currently being edited.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLost data in 1 Reminders entry."
