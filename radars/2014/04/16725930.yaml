    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Transformations menu, which developers get by default with the Edit menu, has two misspellings:\r\n\r\n  - \"Make Upper Case\" should be \"Make Uppercase\"\r\n  - \"Make Lower Case\" should be \"Make Lowercase\"\r\n\r\nLook these up in the Dictionary app that ships with OS X and you'll see that these are misspelled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample 1: In Xcode\r\n1.  Launch Xcode\r\n2.  Choose \"Create a New Xcode Project\"\r\n3.  Choose OS X > Application > Cocoa Application, and then click Next.\r\n4.  Fill in the options for the project, including the Product Name, Organization Name, and Company Identifier, and then click Next.\r\n5.  Choose a location to save the project files, and then click Create.\r\n6.  Choose MainMenu.xib.\r\n7.  In the default Edit menu, choose Transformations and look at its options. You'll see that developers get \"Make Upper Case\" and \"Make Lower Case\" by default. These should be corrected as \"Make Uppercase\" and \"Make Lowercase\", respectively.\r\n\r\nExample 2: In Text Edit\r\n1.  Open TextEdit.\r\n2.  Choose Edit > Transformations, and then examine the submenu options. You'll see that users get \"Make Upper Case\" and \"Make Lower Case\" as two of the submenus options. These should be corrected as \"Make Uppercase\" and \"Make Lowercase\", respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Apple to spell menu options correctly. If you look at the 2013 edition of the Apple Style Guide (https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf), you'll see that \"uppercase\" (defined on p. 157) and \"lowercase\" (defined on p. 97) are used throughout. And since the ASG is what developers are supposed to follow (along with the HIG), these items need to be corrected in the defaults developers get when building a Cocoa application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevelopers and users alike get typos in default menu options that conflict with Apple's own Style Guide. These should be corrected."
