    description: "Please add functionality in Xcode when I click and drag (while holding down the modifier key) to scroll and pan the storyboard editor. This is a very common feature in other UI IDE's to navigate around a zoomed in artboard.\r\n\r\nWhen the modifier key is pressed switch the pointer to the hand cursor indicating you are going to grab and move the whole storyboard within the view. When I click and drag the storyboard pans / scrolls with my cursor, when I let go it stops."
