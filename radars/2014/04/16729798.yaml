    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you create a default Instruments Automation script for iOS and run it without making any changes, you receive the following error:\r\n\r\nPath not found '/Users/jonathan_morgan/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/lkj-efnmzqijwdkcixghgjaokmivpnnx/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/lkj.app/lkj'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n2. Start Xcode\r\n3. Create a new project\r\n4. Select iOS -> Application\r\n5. Click \"Empty Application “ \r\n6. Click “Next\"\r\n7. Enter Product Name and Company Identifier\r\n8. Click “Next\"\r\n9. Click “Create\"\r\n10. Select Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> Instruments\r\n11. Select iOS -> All -> Automation\r\n12. Click “Choose”\r\n13. The default script contains just one line, \"var target = UIATarget.localTarget();”\r\n14. Click the run arrow below the script.\r\n15. The alert pops up with the following alert: Path not found '/Users/jonathan_morgan/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/lkj-efnmzqijwdkcixghgjaokmivpnnx/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/lkj.app/lkj'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI did not expect anything to happen because nothing was changed in the script I was attempting to run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI received an alert with the following error:\r\n\r\nPath not found '/Users/jonathan_morgan/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/lkj-efnmzqijwdkcixghgjaokmivpnnx/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/lkj.app/lkj'\r\n\r\nI do not have any user accounts on my system so I should not have an issue for the user Jonathan Morgan. Also, I don't believe the initial script should cause an error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nInstruments 5.1.1 (55045)\r\nXcode Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\nOS X Version 10.9.2 (13C1021)"
