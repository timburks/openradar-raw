    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen capturing a poorly lit barcode it's often very helpful to have the torch illuminate the area. Unfortunately the best way to do this, using AVCaptureTorchModeAuto, does not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project using the new iOS 7 barcode scanner\r\n2. Call [device setTorchMode:AVCaptureTorchModeAuto]\r\n3. Start capturing barcodes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn a poorly lit area the torch/flash should light up automatically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe torch stays off. From what I can tell only capturing video triggers the \"auto\" mode correctly, which shouldn't be necessary. AVCaptureTorchModeOn does work correctly, but that either wastes power or requires the user to manually turn it on/off.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
