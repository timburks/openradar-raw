    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://8387508\n\nMake a new .xib. Drag on a UIView as subview. Interface Builder makes the thing the full size, even if you drag it partially on the screen. I *never* want a view hanging off the side. I canâ€™t manipulate it or work with it in any reasonable way there. If I did, I would manually adjust it back off the superview, probably using the ruler pane (or more likely code). \n\nIf I drop a new view onto a superview, the initial bounds of the subview should be within the superview!"
