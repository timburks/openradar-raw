    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a warning is emitted from a Makefile (e.g., $(warning Watch Out!)) that is being used with an Xcode \"External Build System\" project, Xcode marks it as an error. At the end, it gets confused because a zero return value was returned, but Xcode is expecting non-zero.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new External Build System project for /usr/bin/make\r\n2. Add a Makefile that displays the warning\r\n3. Build the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild successful with 1 warning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild successful with 2 errors.\r\n\r\nOutput from `xcodebuild`:\r\nMakefile:4: This is a warning\r\nc++ main.cpp -o main\r\nCommand /usr/bin/make emitted errors but did not return a nonzero exit code to indicate failure\r\n\r\n** BUILD SUCCEEDED **\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached sample project and screenshots from Xcode showing warnings being treated as errors.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MakefileWarningAsError.zip', 'ss1.png' and 'ss2.png' were successfully uploaded."
