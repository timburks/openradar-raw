    description: "Description: \r\nThere is a private method — `entityName` — on NSManagedObject that a lot of users are receiving App Store validation warnings for calling. The default method always seems to return nil, so I don't think you guys are using it.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a method on your NSManagedObject subclass that overrides `entityName`\r\n2. Call this method anywhere in your app\r\n3. Submit your app for validation for entry into either app store\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThere is no validation warning, because the Core Data team properly prefixed their private methods with something suitable like an underscore. The method returns your overridden value and everyone high fives.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app store validation process tells you that you're using a private method on NSManagedObject. Everyone is somber and there are no smiles anywhere."
