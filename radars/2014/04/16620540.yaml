        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. on either an iPAd 3 or an iPhone 4S running iOS 7.1 (11D167), deactivate iCloud Documents & Data in settings.app
        2. reboot the device by holding the home and power buttons
        3. go to settings.app → iCloud → Documents & Data, enable that
        4. go back (by swiping or tapping the nav button)

        Expected Results:
        iCloud Documents & Data status is “on”.

        Actual Results:
