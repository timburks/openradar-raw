    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using AVPlayer to play back video. I want to dismiss the view that plays back the video, but keep the audio playing.\r\nWhenever the the AVPlayerLayer is deallocated or it's player property is set to nil I get a gap in playback.\r\n\r\nI attached a demo project to show the problem.\r\n\r\nThe same problem occurs on attaching new player layers (or reattaching existing) to the player.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached demo project in iOS simulator (tested on 64bit iOS 7.1)\r\n2. wait for the video to play\r\n3. Press the \"Detach view 1\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the 2nd video view to continuously play back the video. Also I expect the audio to play flawlessly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 2nd video view stops for a second. Also the audio is interrupted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PlayerDetatchDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded.
