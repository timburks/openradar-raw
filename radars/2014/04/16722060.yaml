    description: "Summary:\r\nI've noticed that every so often, window resizing and dragging breaks in a really bizarre way in 10.9.2.  When the problem happens:\r\n\r\n1.  The windowDidMove: event never fires.\r\n2.  The windowWillMove: event works like it normally does.\r\n3.  If you drag a window using the title bar, then try to resize it, as you start to resize it, the window suddenly jumps back to where it was before you dragged it.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought this was a bug in my app, and tried to work around it, but then I tried to resize a Terminal window and got the same sudden jump.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to reproduce this, but this is the second time this bug has reared its ugly head for me in just a few weeks.\r\n\r\nI suppose I probably should have run sysdiagnose *before* I rebooted and had the problem go away, but hopefully there will be something in the logs that might help you figure out what's happening anyway.  :-)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2 (13C64)"
