    description: "Summary:\r\nThe compiler shipped with Xcode 5.1 includes support for the objc_designated_initializer attribute. However, no Foundation #define exists for this attribute, limiting developers' ability to adopt it. Please provide NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER or similar in a future release.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new app\r\n2. Add a new class\r\n3. Attempt to mark an initializer as designated with NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER is interpreted as __attribute__((objc_designated_initializer)) and the compiler begins warning appropriately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER is unrecognized."
