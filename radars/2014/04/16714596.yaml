    description: "At some point in the past couple of years, the old session videos for WWDC prior to 2010 ceased to be available.  Most of them were superseded by newer sessions.  Unfortunately, the Advanced Accessibility session from WWDC 2009 was not.\r\n\r\nWorse, the documentation for accessibility in OS X doesn't remotely cover all of the difficult corner cases, such as how to get rid of the *&^@#& VoiceOver cursor when you're hiding the currently selected element.\r\n\r\nGiven how crucial proper accessibility is for compliance with ADA and other laws, the current state of affairs is completely unacceptable.  This session video needs to be made available ASAP."
