    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to use NSFileManager to copy a file from an unsandboxed location into a sandboxed app's container, I encounter an error (as expected). However, the error misleadingly claims that my app cannot access its own container, rather than being unable to access the unsandboxed file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new app.\r\n2. Construct a path to a file that exists outside the app's sandbox.\r\n3. Use NSFileManager to copy that file into the app's sandbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI get an error that indicates the app is unable to access the unsandboxed file (since it has no security exception to do so).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get an error that claims the app is unable to access its own sandbox container."
