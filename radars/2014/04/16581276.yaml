    description: "Summary:\r\nApplications that have screenshots in PNG format with transparency appear to have their screenshots converted to JPEG by the App Store for display on the web and in the App Store app, among other places.\r\n\r\nA fix on the developers' end would be to add a white background to the images to avoid any transparency in the image. Unfortunately given the current rules of the App Store this cannot be done without submitting a new, updated version of the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/black-ink/id402376365?mt=12\r\n2. Observe the screenshot has a Mac OS X window capture that has been rendered with ugly black \"shadow\" around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should be rendered in such a way that it resembles the original in the way that the transparency is blended with whatever background Apple presents it on. If it's converted to JPEG for a white background, the transparencies should be converted to appropriate shades of white/grey for the final JPEG image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee attached screenshot or visit the above-linked page on the web.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Mac App Store - Black Ink-7.png' was successfully uploaded."
