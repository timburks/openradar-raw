    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to profile an app on a locked device, the error in Instruments does not mention anything about the device being locked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iOS project in Xcode.\r\n2. Connect an iOS device via USB.\r\n3. Make sure the device is locked such that it would require a passcode or Touch ID input to unlock it.\r\n4. In Xcode, press Command-I to profile the app.\r\n5. Choose an instrument to use. I am using Time Profiler.\r\n6. Click Profile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstruments either unlocks the device and begins profiling, or presents a warning to the effect that the device must be unlocked first.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments presents the unhelpful warning: “Error Starting Recording” with the subtitle: “At least one target failed to launch; aborting run”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\nInstruments 5.1.1 (55045)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/V44Q"
