    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a UITextField that has been configured with a clearButtonMode of either UITextFieldViewModeAlways or UITextFieldViewModeWhileEditing will have an incorrect caret position when programmatically becoming the first responder.\r\n\r\nUITextFields configured with different clearButtonModes do not exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project that has a UITextField\r\n2. Configure the UITextField's clearButtonMode to either UITextFieldViewModeAlways or UITextFieldViewModeWhileEditing\r\n3. Programmatically instruct that UITextField to become the first responder\r\n4. Set the text of the UITextField to a string which has a length greater than the width of the UITextField\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe currently editing UITextField's caret should be at the end of the text that has previously been set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe caret's position seems to be off by about twice the width of the clear button views frame which means a user has to tap and hold, then scrub to the actual end of the text so they may continue to edit it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA link to a video of the attached sample code, http://cl.ly/0w2g21293D3B"
