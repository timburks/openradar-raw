        Summary:
        CommonCrypto currently lacks a way to generate encryption keys using Diffie-Hellman.

        The only available option is to include a statically linked 3rd party library like OpenSSL to be able to generate keys using Diffie-Hellman or to do BigNum math on iOS.

        Taking a look at Appleâ€™s open source implementation of CommonCrypto (http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-60049/include/) you can find further headers not yet made public in the official iOS and OS X SDKs.
        Headers like CommonDH.h include functions to generate keys using the mentioned algorithms. The annotations behind the CCDH* functions tells us, that the functions were included starting with iOS 5.0 (and OS X 10.8) but were never made public.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Look at the public CommonCrypto headers included in the iOS SDK.

        Expected Results:
        The public CommonCrypto headers shipped with the iOS (and OS X) SDK include CommonDH with the CCDH* functions.

        Actual Results:
        No functions to generate keys using Diffie-Hellman can be found in the public CommonCrypto headers.

        Regression:
        -
