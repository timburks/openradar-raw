    description: "Summary:\n\nCalling bitmapImageRepByConvertingToColorSpace is producing warnings in the console.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCalling bitmapImageRepByConvertingToColorSpace like this:\n\n    rep = [rep bitmapImageRepByConvertingToColorSpace:[NSColorSpace sRGBColorSpace] renderingIntent:NSColorRenderingIntentDefault];\n\nwith a rep of\n\nNSBitmapImageRep 0x6080028bd340 Size={900, 1600} ColorSpace=(not yet loaded) BPS=8 BPP=(not yet loaded) Pixels=900x1600 Alpha=NO Planar=NO Format=(not yet loaded) CurrentBacking=nil (faulting) CGImageSource=0x60800016bac0\n\nproduces this warning:\n\nApr 23 11:10:55 caconym.local Sketch Nightly Debug[19020] <Error>: The function `CGContextErase' is obsolete and will be removed in an upcoming update. Unfortunately, this application, or a library it uses, is using this obsolete function, and is thereby \ncontributing to an overall degradation of system performance.\n\n\nExpected Results:\n\nNo warning should be produced (or the method should be deprecated).\n\nActual Results:\n\nA warning is produced. The method does not appear to have been deprecated (or is not documented as such).\n\nRegression:\n\nNot every call produces the warning - possibly itâ€™s only the first one?\n\nA second call with a rep of:\n\nNSBitmapImageRep 0x618000aa8820 Size={2112, 1756} ColorSpace=(not yet loaded) BPS=8 BPP=(not yet loaded) Pixels=2112x1756 Alpha=YES Planar=NO Format=(not yet loaded) CurrentBacking=nil (faulting) CGImageSource=0x618000163540\n\nproduces a variation on the warning:\n\nApr 23 11:17:53 caconym.local Sketch Nightly Debug[19869] <Error>: The function `CGContextClear' is obsolete and will be removed in an upcoming update. Unfortunately, this application, or a library it uses, is using this obsolete function, and is thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system performance.\n\nNotes:"
