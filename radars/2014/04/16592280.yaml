    description: "I have a XIB that uses autolayout, containing several views as top-level objects. If one of those views is at a distance from another, and I want to move them closer together, I have to drag the view to the edge of the canvas, release, scroll to make room for moving the view, then drag again, drop, scroll again, drag again, drop again, scroll again.\r\n\r\nAll other Mac applications will auto-scroll when the mouse reaches the edge of the canvas while dragging an object.\r\n\r\n(This is a Mac XIB, not Cocoa touch)"
