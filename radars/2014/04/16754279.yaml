    description: |-
        On larger story boards youâ€™ll find yourself often trying to duplicate prototype cells that have the same look and same backing class. This feature suggestion is to add the capability to storyboard editor to design prototype cells in one place that can be reused throughout the entire storyboard.

        This feature would greatly reduce developer stress trying to copy prototype cells between table view controllers in storyboard editor, this fails because the copied UI elements do not retain their constraints when being copied.
