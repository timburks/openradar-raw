        Summary:
        Using Open Quickly, I’d like to jump to the definition of an operator. However, typing ~= or another operator name returns no results.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use ⇧⌘O to trigger Open Quickly.
        2. Type: ~=


        Expected Results:
        I expected the Swift stdlib’s definition(s) of the ~= operator, as well as any overloads I may have available in my workspace, to be listed.


        Actual Results:
        There were no matches.


        Regression:
        N/A
