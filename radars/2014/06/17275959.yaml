    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be really useful to overlay charts to make it easier to see correlations between heath metrics. A simple example would be comparing blood sugar level and calorie intake, but there are many many more. The Health app should be able to overlay 2 (or more!) arbitrary charts on the same time scale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4265u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 GSM\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
