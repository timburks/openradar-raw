        Summary:
        Converting a struct to a tuple with a conversion function infinite loops.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Given these definitions:

        import Foundation
        extension CGSize {
        	@conversion func __conversion() -> (Double, Double) {
        		return self
        	}
        }

        Run this code:

        let (w, h) = CGSize.zeroSize


        Expected Results:
        Given that it compiles, I expected it to convert the size into a tuple of doubles unpacked as constants. I expected this to work, too:

        let t: (w: Double, h: Double) = CGSize.zeroSize


        Actual Results:
        Instead it apparently infinite loops and crashes. The crash is evident in the REPL but I can’t figure out how to get a backtrace to tell if it’s infinite looping or what.

        N/A
