    description: "Swift prioritizes brevity over readability. I'm talking about the new keywords like \"func\" and \"var\" .\r\n\r\n• it breaks \"read like a sentence\" rule\r\n• it doesn't play well with autocorrect\r\n• it breaks muscle memory of typists\r\n• it does not save any time\r\n• it looks plain confusing\r\n...\r\n\r\nSwift is a brand-new language. Please, don't go down this path. It makes no sense.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDefine a function or a variable in Swift\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUse of grammatical English words\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUse of non-sensical words"
