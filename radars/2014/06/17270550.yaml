    description: "Summary:\r\nHealthKit's Fit: Store and Retrieve HealthKit Data sample project does not work out of the box unless non obvious steps are taken like creating new app ids in the dev center, creating provisioning profiles, changing bundle Ids, etc. At WWDC it took about half an hour for me to get the sample running on my dev iPhone with the assistance of 2 HealthKit engineers. None of the steps we had to go through were documented in the readme file, and were only briefly mentioned during the WWDC session.\r\n\r\nDevelopers expect to be able to just download the sample, load it in Xcode and run it/step through it immediately. If there are extra setup steps, at a minimum the steps should be clearly documented, and ideally Xcode will automatically help the user resolve the issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the Fit: Store and Retrieve HealthKit Data sample from developer.apple.com/ios\r\n2. Open the sample project in Xcode 6 beta 1\r\n3. Change the target device to an iPhone running iOS8\r\n4. Press the run button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject should build cleanly, deploy to the device and start running.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject builds, but when Xcode tries to run it on the device, an alert appears complaining about invalid entitlements. See attached screenshot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFit: Store and Retrieve HealthKit Data\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
