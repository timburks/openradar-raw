    description: "This is admittedly a bit of a nit, but the current rules for semicolons in Swift are going to lead to ugly, inconsistent code. Semicolons should either be required between every statement, or disallowed entirely with the one exception of having multiple statements on a single line.\r\n\r\nFor whatever itâ€™s worth, my preference would be to remove the semicolon entirely and disallow having multiple statements on a single line. There are few, if any, circumstances where having multiple statements on a single line improves code in any way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nNo steps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\nAny\r\n\r\nXcode Version\r\nXcode 6 Beta 1\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes"
