    description: "In C (and very many other languages), it is possible to have the compiler concatenate static strings separated by only whitespace:\r\n\r\nconst char* cString = \"This \" \"works fine.\";\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Swift requires to explicitly include the string concatenation operator, +:\r\n\r\nlet swiftString = \"This \" + \"works fine.\"\r\nlet otherSwiftString = \"This \" \"does not.\"\r\n\r\nWhile requiring the concatenation operator is not the worst thing in the world, it does put more work that could be done by the compiler onto the programmer. It also results in more rigid code, as the programmer will always have to maintain the + operators when modifying the string code. This is especially evident in multi-line examples:\r\n\r\nlet someLongString = \"Jean shorts pug yr, nihil shabby chic synth ugh Carles Blue Bottle\" + \r\n\"sunt PBR&B McSweeney's fashion axe photo booth fingerstache. Kogi photo booth mollit \" +\r\n\"narwhal et readymade. DIY biodiesel enim YOLO sint, cliche authentic selvage Tonx. Carles \" +\r\n\"cardigan XOXO crucifix placeat. Vegan dolor incididunt selfies sint. Aliquip pour-over \" +\r\n\"sint officia, sriracha sustainable selvage. Artisan bicycle rights brunch, authentic \" + \"gentrify pickled stumptown banh mi magna quis in.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need to add a new paragraph, you have to add a + operator beforehand, or if you need to remove the last line you have to remove the + operator from the proceeding line. This is minor, but it is something the compiler could be worrying about instead of the programmer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a new playground in Xcode\r\n2. Enter the following:\r\n\r\nvar str = \"Hello, playground\" \", how are you?\"\r\nlet otherStr = \"Another try, \" \"at string concatenation\"\r\n\r\nfoo(\"Does this\"\r\n\t\"work?\")\r\n\r\n(Or open the attached playground).\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nThis should be accepted by the compiler.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nThe compiler rejects this code.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\nAny\r\n\r\nXcode Version\r\nXcode 6 Beta 1\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes"
