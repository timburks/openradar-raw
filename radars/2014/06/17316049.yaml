    description: |-
        In prior versions of OS X the dock labels contained text that was vertically centered to the x-height of the text to the vertical center of the label.

        The new labels appear to be crudely centered based on the text label container's bounds.  This leads to labels appearing low in the label bubble.

        To repeat:
        1. Hover over any icon in the Dock.
        2. There's no step 2.


        Result:  Icon appears a bit low -- vertically centering only the capital letters.
        Expected result:  Label should center the much more dominant lowercase letters as it did in prior versions.
