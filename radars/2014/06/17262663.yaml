    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://17261352\n\nSummary:\r\nAn iOS Playground can't declare objects of classes coming in from UIKit on my machine when running under OS X Mavericks. The same playground file works on the same machine & Xcode version when running the prerelease of Yosemite.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode beta (6A215l)\r\n2. Open either of the attached playgrounds (UIColor is the simpler of two and is only two lines long.)\r\n3. Open the Timeline assistant editor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Table View playground should display the table. The UIColor playground should show a value display with a color swatch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAny UIKit object will be unresolved and cause a REPL error in the timeline. Here's a sample:\r\n\r\n<REPL>:10:13: error: use of unresolved identifier 'UIColor'\r\nlet color = UIColor(red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 6.0, 6A215l. As I said above I'm not sure the exact Mavericks version number but I'm current on the updates. The Yosemite build that works is 10.10 (14A238x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI posted a bit about this at https://devforums.apple.com/message/980032#980032 . At least a few other users are having this problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, the import seems to not work properly. On Yosemite I don't have to import CoreGraphics but on Mavericks I can't declare CGPoint or CGRect structs unless I import CoreGraphics an addition to UIKit.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis testing is on my MacBookPro 10,1 (Retina, mid 2012 model) I'm writing this on my test install of Yosemite so I can't check my Mavericks version right now but it's current as of today (June 10).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Table View.playground.zip' and 'UIColor Creation.playground.zip' were successfully uploaded."
