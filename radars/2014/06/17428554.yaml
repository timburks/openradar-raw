    description: "On OS X, the open panel provides access to \"Media\", including photos from iPhoto. \r\n\r\nThe new iOS doc picker doesn't… if an app wants to let the user grab a file or a photo, it has to do that with a two stage UI, not just by throwing up the doc picker and letting take things from where they want. \r\n\r\nI think that's an artificial distinction… a photo stored in Dropbox or on the Camera Roll are both photos, the user isn't going to think of those as super different operations.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 2nd seed, 12A4297e"
