        Summary:
        Currently, you cannot use string literals within string interpolations, making it more difficult to express certain idioms.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to run the following code in a playground or REPL or otherwise:

        "[ \(join(" ", [ 1, 2, 3 ])) ]"


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to be run equivalently to this:

        let joined = join(" ", [ 1, 2, 3 ])
        "[ \(joined) ]"


        Actual Results:
        The compiler says “Unexpected '"' character in string interpolation”


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Balancing/nestable string interpolation is extremely convenient, and syntactically unambiguous. It can get silly—interpolated strings within interpolated strings—but that’s a “it hurts when I do this,” “then don’t do that” issue, in my opinion.
