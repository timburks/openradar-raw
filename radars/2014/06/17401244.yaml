    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that some of the new code samples from Apple include readme files in markdown format. If Xcode is installed double-clicking on them opens the file in Xcode, which is fine, but being able to quicklook them in the finder would be great too.\r\n\r\nIf apple is using markdown in their own documentation, there should be quicklook support for the format.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Yosemite\r\n2. Download the \"Fit: Store and Retrieve HealthKit Data\" sample from https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/Fit/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014583\r\n3. Open the sample code's folder in the finder\r\n4. Click on README.md\r\n5. Press the spacebar to activate quicklook\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe markdown document should be displayed in a quicklook window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe generic quicklook window for an unknown filetype is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A261i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
