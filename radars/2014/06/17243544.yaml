    description: "Summary:\r\nRight now the inspector shows integers for the lighting, shadow, shadowed, physics category, collision, and field bitfields. The default value for some of these fields is 4294967295 (2^33-1) which is itself a bit inscrutable.\r\n\r\nOrdinary humans like myself cannot do bit twiddling in our heads beyond like, 2^8. A better UI would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these fields could collapse/expand to display a list of named bit positions, modeling what we all do in code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
