        Summary:
        The active item in OS X Yosemite’s new segmented control looks strange when the segmented control is disabled — it lacks contrast.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Finder and switch to the AirDrop panel. The “View as” segmented control becomes disabled, with an active item (Icon view).

        Expected Results:
        Readable controls that don’t attract attention needlessly.

        Actual Results:
        The strong background highlight of the active item draws your eyes to the disabled control. The lack of contrast between the background and foreground color of that item makes it unreadable.

        Regression:
        Looked OK on Mavericks
