    description: "Summary:\r\nA typical Swift file will probably consist of a single class, struct, enum, or extension, along with function definitions and related types. The current syntax for all of these types have the entire definition wrapped in curly brackets. That means that, except for about five lines at the top of the file and one at the bottom, every line in the file is indented at least one tab stop.\r\n\r\nThis wastes horizontal space in an already wordy framework, and it just plain looks funny. There should be an alternate syntax for definitions of classes and other types which implicitly means “for the rest of this file”, and which does not require indentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift file.\r\n2. Put a large class in it.\r\n3. Read it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTop-level items in the class, like method or property definitions, are against the left margin of the file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTop-level items are indented one tab stop.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was a nice feature of Objective-C, but it’s not the only language that worked this way. Perl is another example, and Perl 6 kept that feature even as it added an alternate block-style syntax too. Even C++ implementation files don’t demand you indent all the method definitions.\r\n\r\nPossible syntaxes for this include:\r\n\r\nclass Foo (followed by a newline, with no “{“ before the next keyword)\r\nbegin class Foo\r\nclass Foo: (with no class names forthcoming) / class Foo: Base:\r\nclass Foo ->\r\n\r\nYou know the grammar better than I do, though, so you’re in a better position to choose.\r\n\r\nIt would be an error to have two of these top-level type declarations in one file."
