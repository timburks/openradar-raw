    description: "Summary:\r\nBased on the information in \"Introducing CloudKit\", session 208 (2014 WWDC), it appears that in order for the app to access personal information about the user, the user must grant permission to be discoverable by other users of the app. I feel that there should be a less grand permission option, where the user can grant access to the app for some personal information, without granting permission to be discoverable."
