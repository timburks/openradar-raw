        Summary:
        When refactoring code, often I want to take something I wrote and promote it to a category in order to reuse it somewhere else. If I select a block of code with exactly one object declared outside of the selection, Xcode should offer to extract the selected code to a category on that object’s class.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write some code that performs a utility function on an object, such as this:

        - (void)viewDidLoad
        {
        	[super viewDidLoad];
        	
        	self.view.layer.cornerRadius = 10.0f;
        	self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
        	self.view.opaque = NO;
        }

        2. Select code. In this example, you would select the last three lines of the -viewDidLoad method.
        3. Select Edit, then Refactor.

        Expected Results:
        There will be a way to create a category on UIView to perform the above actions.

        Actual Results:
        You can extract the three lines into a method, but it’s an instance method of the current class.
