        Background: When building a complex Continuous Integration setup for our iOS contracting company Raizlabs, we ran into an issue with provisioning profiles. We have scripts that build all of our iOS projects, but many of them use different provisioning profiles from different clients. Currently, to make these scripts work we have to manually “install” the profiles either by calling “open” on them or by copying them into ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles. In order to create an idempotent build process and avoid mixing of profiles from different clients, we have to reconstruct and clear this folder on each build. This is a significant amount of un-needed additional complexity.

        Expected Behavior: We would like to be able to specify the provisioning profile to use by its full path as an argument to an xcodebuild invocation. Alternatively, we could specify a folder other than ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles in which to search for provisioning profiles by name, similar to the existing search path that exists for Keychains.
