    description: "Summary:\r\nPattern matching in Swift is quite powerful, and arrays can be used in a pattern, but arrays cannot be deconstructed and bound to variables in patterns.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if arrays could be matched against and deconstructed in the same way tuples are. Something like this:\r\n\r\nswitch array {\r\n case let [x]: ///An array with a single element\r\n case let [x:xs]: /// An array with a head followed by a tail\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use an array in a switch statement\r\n2. Try to bind variable names in a pattern in the same way as tuples.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nArrays can be deconstructed and matched against just like tuples can\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nArrays cannot be deconstructed and bound to variables like tuples can."
