    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to save a record with an asset attribute (with a key of 'photo') to the public database of my container, I receive an error response saying \"Internal Error\" (1/1003); \"Saving asset failed \". Saving to the private container does not generate this error, and saves successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a CKRecord\r\n2. Create a CKAsset pointing to an image file on disk\r\n3. Set the 'photo' attribute of your CKRecord instance to your CKAsset instance\r\n4. Use *either* the CKModifyRecordsOperation-style or saveRecord-style method to save your CKRecord instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe CKAsset would get uploaded and the CKRecord would be saved properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error is returned stating simply \"Internal Error\" (1/1003); \"Saving asset failed.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor what it's worth, I am able to create records in the public database in the iCloud Dashboard, and upload assets manually there in the browser. *However*, when I use a CKQuery to retrieve records created in this fashion, the CKAssets are not properly populated and do not have a valid fileURL property (fileURL is nil)."
