    description: "Summary:\r\nDownloaded and installed the first Xcode6-Beta on my 2013 13\" MacBook Air on Mavericks. Tried to run it, it downloaded  bunch of stuff (configured itself?), and made a ding as if it had finished, but the progress indicator never went away. Then various other apps started freezing, including Mail, TweetBot, Chrome, and even Emacs! I ended up having to hold the power button down to force a shutdown.\r\n\r\nOn restart, Xcode6-Beta fired up again (because it was running on shutdown, right?) and froze. After a minute, other apps started freezing again. I had to force a shutdown again by holding down the power button for 10s. On restart, I quickly quit Xcode6-Beta before it had a chance to lock anything up. Another attempt to run it lead to another round of freezing apps and a forced shutdown.\r\n\r\nReally want to play with Swift, so this makes me sad! \U0001F62D"
