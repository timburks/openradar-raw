    description: "There's no easy way (to my knowledge) to create 1 px (not 1 pt) hair lines in Storyboard editor. If I specify 0.5 pt as the width or height of a view (with backgroundColor), it's automatically rounded to 1.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of Retina-optimized UIs, especially since iOS 7, there should be an easy way to accomplish this."
