    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the scrollbar is visible when you fullscreen a video in Safari, the scrollbar will remain visible while the video is playing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit any website with an embedded HTML5 video that uses the native player (or make your own page). Page has to be long enough to be scrollable/show scrollbar.\r\n2. After scrolling, while the scrollbar is still visible, put the video in fullscreen mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scrollbar should not be visible when a video is in fullscreen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scrollbar remained visible, even when the video is in fullscreen and playing â€” as shown in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.x\r\nSafari 7.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to wait until the scrollbar disappears before putting the video in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-06-19 at 11.40.31 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
