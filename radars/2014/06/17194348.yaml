    description: "Summary:\r\nI tried creating a new window and dragging it to a second display. As soon as resize it, it jumps right back to the main display and has a different size than before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an external display to your retina MBP\r\n2. Set the MBP as the primary display\r\n3. Choose an app like Safari (seemed to work for any app with windows)\r\n4. Open a new window on primary display\r\n5. Drag window to secondary display\r\n6. Resize window (choose any edge to resize)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window should resize to the desired size and stay on the secondary display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window jumps back to the primary display. The size changes accordingly to the primary display’s resolution. The cursor jumps together with the window to the primary display.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.10 (14A238x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI didn’t find a workaround. Resizing on external display doesn’t work, no matter what I do.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- Retina MBP 13.3\", resolution doesn’t matter (best for display or scaled)\r\n- external display Philips 273ELH (1080p HD Display, resolution \"Best for display\")\r\n- rMBP is primary display\r\n- arrangement doesn’t seem to matter (tested it with primary to the right and below)"
