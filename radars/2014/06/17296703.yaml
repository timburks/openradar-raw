    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, using any selector-based API requires that the developer know how Swift methods are mapped to Objective-C selectors. Swift should not require developers to know this; instead, it should include a language feature to construct the selector for you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Forget everything you know about how Objective-C works.\r\n\r\n2. Define a class like this:\r\n\r\n    class ButtonHandler: NSObject {\r\n        func buttonPressed(sender: AnyObject?) { println(“Pressed!” }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n3. Create a UIButton or NSButton and a ButtonHandler.\r\n\r\n4. Attempt to make the ButtonHandler the button’s target in some Swifty way, for instance:\r\n\r\n    button.addTarget(handler, action: handler.buttonPressed, forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis, or something like it, succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not. You must know that the selector for the buttonPressed method is “buttonPressed:” to make this work.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLast week, the first developers started learning to use Cocoa without knowing Objective-C. These people don’t know how selectors work and, if Swift is to be a first-class Cocoa language, shouldn’t have to, at least not beyond knowing that they represent a method name.\r\n\r\nThe “handler.buttonPressed” above is merely one example of how this feature might be implemented. Other possibilities include:\r\n\r\n    handler.buttonPressed.selector\r\n    ButtonHandler.buttonPressed.selector\r\n    Selector(handler.buttonPressed)\r\n    Selector(ButtonHandler.buttonPressed)\r\n    @selector(buttonPressed(sender:))"
