    description: "The @objc token will be an eyesore when everyone is programming in Swift or when there are additional languages other than Swift and Objective C.\r\n\r\nInstead, use a token which indicates the intent. I propose @expose\r\n\r\n\"expose this declaration for use in objective c\" (or some future language)\r\n\r\nand also\r\n\r\n\"expose this protocol for use in conformance-verifying introspection\"\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use two tokens for these two uses. Perhaps @interop and @conform. In any case, don't lock in a reference to Objective-C"
