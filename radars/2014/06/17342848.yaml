    description: "We'd like to use Action extensions to share locations between apps. There are many interesting use cases for that: Apps could display directions, log locations, show a street view panorama, search in the vicinity, show photos taken nearby etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no standardized way to share locations. Neither CLLocation objects can be used nor is there a standard file format / UTI specifying locations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the properties of CLLocation we'd like to see support for the viewing angle since this could be useful in a number of use cases such as photos (already in EXIF data), street view panoramas etc."
