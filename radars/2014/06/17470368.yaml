    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to check for the existence of an extension, even when that extension is part of the app group (see rdar://17470190 and rdar://17403759).\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you are trying to grant users a single extension, but they may have one or more apps in the app group installed, they will see multiple extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBlocked by rdar://17470190 and rdar://17403759\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWithin an app group, I should be able to check if an extension has been installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll extensions are always installed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4297e)"
