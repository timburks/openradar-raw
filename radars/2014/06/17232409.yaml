    description: "Summary:\r\nLoupe on a UISearchDisplayController's textview doesn't disappear if you cancel the search\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 Bring focus to the textfield in a search display controller\r\n2 tap and hold in the text field to bring up the magnifying loupe\r\n3 while keeping a hold of the text field, with another finger, tap cancel to dismiss the text field\r\n4 see that the loupe is very slow to disappear, sometimes it gets stuck on the screen entirely\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the text field is dismissed by way of tapping cancel button, the loupe if showing should also disappear\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe loupe sometimes does not disappear and becomes stuck on screen. At best it is very slow (a second) to hide.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
