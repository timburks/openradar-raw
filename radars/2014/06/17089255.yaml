    description: "Summary:\r\nPages documents exported to either Word format are significantly larger than they need to be because Pages is exporting them with embedded PNG files that aren't actually used. DOCX files have an extra unused 489 KB PNG file. Word '97 DOC files have three extra unused 489 KB PNG files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Pages 5.2 and create a new document from a blank template.\r\n2. Save the blank document in Pages format and export it as a Word '97 document and a Word DOCX document.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe three files should all be roughly the same size and all quite small given that they basically have no content. Especially since files exported in Pages '09 are only 15KB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Pages file will be about 62KB in size.\r\n\r\nThe Word DOCX file will be about 493KB in size.\r\n\r\nThe Word '97 file will be about 1.5MB in size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPages version 5.2 1860 running Mavericks 10.9.3 all up to date as of the time the problem is being logged.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPages '09 didn't have this behaviour. In fact if you open the 1.5MB Word '97 file in pages '09 and immediately export it again, the size drops to 15KB as Pages '09 strips out the unused PNG files.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Blank Word 97 file exported from Pages 5.2 1860.doc' was successfully uploaded."
