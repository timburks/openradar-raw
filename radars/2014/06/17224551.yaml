        Summary:
        I feel like the `Generator` protocol is the source of a lot of confusion, especially when used with `Sequence`. I can’t help but feel like a simple rename of `Generator` to `Enumerator` would clarify this protocol’s intended behavior.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Implement `Sequence`

        Expected Results:
        Expect the related protocol names to be descriptive enough to make it obvious what their intended use case is

        Actual Results:
        The use of the `generate()` function in `Sequence` along with a `Generator` sequence leads to confusion, and it’s not immediately clear what the `Generator` is used for.
