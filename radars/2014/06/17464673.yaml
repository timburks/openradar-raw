        Summary:
        When in editing/selection mode in iOS mail, cells lose the checkmarks when the view is scrolled

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open iOS mail and navigate to a mail folder such as inbox
        Ensure the folder has more than a single screen of items
        Tap the Edit button in the top right navigation bar slot
        Select some mail items.
        Scroll the table view to force cell reuse.
        New cells that are “reused” will no longer have the empty checkmark indicator, and if you scroll back up, your previously selected cells would have lost their checkmarks.

        Expected Results:
        New cells that come into view should have the empty checkmark slots, and previously selected mail items should retain the checkmarks.

        Actual Results:
        New cells that are “reused” will no longer have the empty checkmark indicator, and if you scroll back up, your previously selected cells would have lost their checkmarks.

        Regression:
        Does not occur with iOS7
