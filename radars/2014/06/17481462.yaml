    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Color Emoji Font currently only includes national flag symbols for ten countries. I think international iOS and OS X users would love it if Apple made an effort to provide flag symbols for most (if not all) countries in the world.\r\n\r\nUsing these flag symbols is extremely popular in social media all over the world (think of the current craze about the World Cup in Brazil) and users are wondering why their own country's flag is not available. For developers, this is really hard to explain to users.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Apple would provide flags for all 249 countries and territories that have an officially assigned two-letter country code: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 and OS X 10.9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
