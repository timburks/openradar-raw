        Summary:
        If the entire desktop is obscured, the dropdown part of a menu is translucent, but tinted with the color of the desktop wallpaper, even when the desktop wallpaper is entirely obscured by other windows.


        Steps to reproduce
        1.  Choose a desktop wallpaper with a bright color.
        2.  Open a document window that is white and opaque.
        3.  Hide the dock.
        4.  Option click the green zoom window button to fill the screen. (the bright desktop wallpaper color should now be entirely hidden from the desktop).
        5.  Open the File menu in the Finder.

        Notice: the menu views color is tinted the color of the bright desktop wallpaper.

        Expected Results:  the menu's translucency should show the the content that is directly below the menu (in this case, the white window).
