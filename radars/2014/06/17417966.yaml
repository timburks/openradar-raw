        Summary:
        OS X Server services only support old and insecure protocols but not the current TLS version 1.2.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Start any OS X service that supports encryption, like Mail, Webserver, XMPP, Calendar, Contacts, etc.

        Expected Results:
        In 2014 EVERY server component should be able to run TLS 1.2 and have that active as the default.

        Actual Results:
        Apple's OS X Server is stuck at TLS 1.0 which is not considered secure anymore making it impossible to use OS X Server on the internet and have services secured.

        Regression:
        This is likely connected to Apple refusing to upgrade OpenSSL from their ancient 0.9.8y version shipping with all supported OS X versions and all server services linked against this version which prevents secure services on OS X.

        Notes:
        I'm personally disgusted by Apple's loud announcements of caring for user's privacy (which would be a good thing) but then ignoring all those, now only considered marketing claims, by not delivering. Not supporting forward secrecy and current TLS versions is a huge oversight and a direct contribution to mass surveillance of OS X users.
