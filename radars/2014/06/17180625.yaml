    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing math functions such as ceil() causes compilation errors when used within extensions of CGGeometry types (CGRect, CGSize etc) and built against iOS simulators or in fat binaries.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAn extension to CGSize to convert a size to a specified aspect ratio and ensure it falls on an exact multiple value of that ratio would be very useful. The code below provides such a conversion, returning a new CGSize struct with the desired aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nextension CGSize {\r\n\r\n    func normalisedSizeWithAspectRatio(ratio:CGSize) -> CGSize {\r\n        let base = ceil( self.width / ratio.width );\r\n        return CGSizeMake(base * ratio.width, base * ratio.height)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis code will always cause a compilation error in one way or another if used in an iOS project. When compiling for the 64-bit simulators (iPhone 5s, iPad Air) you need to use the ceil() function, as CGFloat is defined as a Double. When compiling for 32-bit simulators you need to use the ceilf() function as CGFloat is defined as a Float. Compiling for devices always fails one way or the other.\r\n\r\nI remain convinced that if I throw enough casts at the problem I will be able to make it work eventually, but I have not found the solution and the code this will cause me to end up writing would be highly obfuscated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd the attached file to an iOS project and compile for device, 32-bit simulator and 64-bit simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same code should be able to compile on all three target devices\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCode using ceil() will compile for 64-bit, code using ceilf() will compile on 32-bit. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 1"
