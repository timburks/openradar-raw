    description: "Summary:\r\nI just got an iCloud backup size warning. When I went to check what was using up space, I found that it was the videos I had downloaded into the WWDC app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the WWDC app.\r\n2. Sign in with a developer account.\r\n3. Download some videos so that you can watch them offline.\r\n4. Attempt to run an iCloud backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe videos can be redownloaded easily, so they should not be included in the iCloud backup.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe videos contribute to the total size of the iCloud backup. I have several videos downloaded, and in Settings → iCloud → Storage & Backup → Manage Storage → <my iPhone>, I find that the WWDC app is taking up 2 GB of the backup.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWWDC app 2.1 (354)\r\niOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
