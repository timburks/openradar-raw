        Some things that look like attributes in Swift use @, and some donâ€™t.

        This appears to be an attempt to reduce the number of language keywords, but at least at first glance, the effect looks a bit inconsistent.

        At worst I think the thinking behind this needs clarifying. At best, the language would feel cleaner without the @s.
