    description: "Summary:\r\nCannot override properties of a Swift class in the second child class of an inheritance chain when class declarations are split across multiple files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift project in XCode 6.0 Beta (I used iOS iPhone Single View app).\r\n\r\n2. Create a new Swift file in the project (with any name)\r\n\r\n3. Paste the following code into the file:\r\n\r\nclass Foo1 {\r\n    var foo: String {\r\n        return \"bar1\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Foo2: Foo1 {\r\n    override var foo: String {\r\n        return \"bar2\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Foo3: Foo2 {\r\n    override var foo: String {\r\n        return \"bar3\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n4. Observe that the resulting code successfully builds\r\n\r\n5. Create another new Swift file in the project (with any different name)\r\n\r\n6. Cut the Foo2 class declaration from the first Swift file and paste it into the second.\r\n\r\n7. Observer that the code no longer compiles (with error: \"cannot override more than one superclass declaration\" on the override var foo:  line for class Foo3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to compile!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt fails to compile with error \"cannot override more than one superclass declaration\""
