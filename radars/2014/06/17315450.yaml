    description: "Accidentally capturing self in a retain loop is very common source of bugs in ObjC (so common that it generates warnings from the compiler). In any case that the compiler cannot prove that it is not a retain loop, \"[strong self] in\" or similar syntax (such as \"strong(self).\") should be required in closures.\r\n\r\nThis couples with radar:17301343 which requests that self. aways be required rather than having it be used to signal a strong reference. That overloads its meaning too much."
