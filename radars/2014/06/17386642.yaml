    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that when the console is updating with log messages from a connected device, holding down the option key and hovering the mouse over a symbol does not result in the pointing-hand cursor being used like it normally does. The jump to definition functionality still works if I click on the symbol, but the cursor isn't being set properly. This does not happen if the same app is running in the simulator.\r\n\r\nsee attachment \"Cursor bug,mov\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Xcode 6 on OS X 10.10\r\n2. Open the attached Xcode project (throwaway.zip)\r\n3. Set the target device to a physical iPhone device, not the simulator.\r\n4. Run the app\r\n5. Observe: once the app starts, it prints log messages to the console in an infinite loop\r\n6. Hold down the option key\r\n7. Hover the mouse over symbols\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nwhen the mouse is hovering over a symbol where the \"Jump to definition\" feature is supported, the mouse cursor should change to pointing-hand.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwhen the mouse is hovering over a symbol where the \"Jump to definition\" feature is supported, the mouse cursor briefly changes to pointing-hand, and then reverts to the I-beam cursor. see attachment \"Cursor bug,mov\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A216f) on 10.10 (14A261i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is not reproducible when running the app in the simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached system report\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Cursor bug,mov.mov', 'MacBook Pro System report.spx' and 'throwaway.zip' were successfully uploaded."
