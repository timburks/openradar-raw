    description: "Summary:\r\nThis code works:\r\n\r\n    let foo = Int(4)\r\n    let bar = Int(0.25)\r\n    let baz = Int(4 * 0.33)\r\n\r\n`baz` ends up set to 1 as expected. However, using constants, something gets confused:\r\n\r\n    let foo = 4\r\n    let bar = 0.33\r\n    let baz = Int(foo * bar)\r\n\r\nHere, the attempt to set `baz` yields an error: \"Could not find an overload for 'init' that accepts the supplied arguments\". Would be nice if it said what the types of those arguments are, but in any event, I'm would expect the result of `foo * bar` to be a Double. And the fact that it works in the first example literal values leads me to believe that it should work for constant variables, as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPaste this into a playground:\r\n\r\n    let foo = 4\r\n    let bar = 0.33\r\n    let baz = Int(foo * bar)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`baz` should be set to 1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Could not find an overload for 'init' that accepts the supplied arguments\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0/6A215l & OS X Version 10.9.3/13D65"
