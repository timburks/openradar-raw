    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swift Programming Language book says the following, in the “Type Properties” subsection of the “Properties” chapter: “For value types (that is, structures and enumerations), you can define stored and computed type properties. For classes, you can define computed type properties only.”\r\n\r\nNo reason is given for this omission, and when attempting to create a stored type property in a Swift class in the Xcode 6 beta, the compiler gives the error, “Class variables not yet supported”, indicating that this omission is temporary.\r\n\r\nWorking around this omission is easy, but inconsistent with the otherwise impeccably elegant nature of the Swift language. Please add support for stored type properties to classes in Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Swift playground in Xcode, and attempt to use the following syntax:\r\n\r\nclass SomeClass {\r\n\tclass var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nstoredTypeProperty is a stored type property of SomeClass.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler gives error: “Class variables not yet supported”.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24029581/why-no-stored-type-properties-for-classes-in-swift and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24015207/class-variables-not-yet-supported\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis feature is not present in the Swift programming language as of 6/26/14, Xcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)."
