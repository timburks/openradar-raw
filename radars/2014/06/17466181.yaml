    description: "In a .m (Objective-C) file I'm used to have comments like\r\n\r\n// See http://apple.com for the best\r\n\r\nthe URL (http://apple.com) has another color, is underlined, and when clicked, opens in the browser.\r\n\r\nIn a .swift source file though, that URL has the same color, not underlined, not clickable — basically handled as a regular string."
