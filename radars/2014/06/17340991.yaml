    description: "Often I need conglomerated keys in dictionaries. It would be helpful if it is possible to use tuples as keys.\n\ndictionary[(.Enum1, 2)] = “Value 1”\ndictionary[(.Enum2, 2)] = “Value 2”\n \nprintln(dictionary[(.Enum1, 2)])\n\nCurrently it is not possible, because Tuples doesn’t implement Hashable."
