        Summary:
        When emptying the trash in Finder the progress window always says “empty Trash”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Put a many files into the trash so you'll get the progress bar window. Empty the trash. The window says “Emptying the trash".
        Put another bunch of files into the trash so you'll get the progress bar window. SECURE Emtpty the trash. The window says “Emptying the trash".

        Expected Results:
        When securely emptying the trash the Finder progress window should reflect that and show “Securely emptying the trash”.

        Actual Results:
        The progress window always say “Emptying the trash” making it impossible to distinguish if the data in the trash is actually getting overwritten or not.

        Regression:
        I guess this does not affect the trash actually getting deleted securely.

        Notes:
        This would especially be useful when sending empty trash commands to the Finder via system events.
