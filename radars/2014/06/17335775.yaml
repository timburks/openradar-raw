        Summary:
        I’m testing out a quick app using the new Visit Monitoring technology. The Xcode 6 app info.plist required me to write in the required property key manually because there is no “nice” or automatic value - raw values are required

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Start a new app in Xcode and look at the options available in the Info.plist

        Expected Results:
        All the most up to date (and not the deprecated) key values are included in the human-readable key list

        Actual Results:
        NSLocationUsageDescriptionAlways and NSLocationUsageDescriptionWhenInUse are not offered in auto-completed list or “nice” keys

        Regression:
