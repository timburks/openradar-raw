        Summary:
        Not all emoji are valid Swift characters

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Several of the question mark and exclamation emoji are not valid. Also, there is no emoji for a duck. How can I explain WAT without a duck?

        Expected Results:
        I was writing a humorous Swift program and attempted to use emoji ?! as a variable name. I expected it to be allowed

        Actual Results:
        Swift interpreted it other than as a character in a name

        Regression:
        Most other emoji characters work
