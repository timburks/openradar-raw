        Summary:
        Many elements have too little contrast difference between different states to be distinguishable.

        * Active windows are almost identical to inactive windows, so I type into the wrong window all the time.
        * The disabled state of the Safari back/forward buttons is almost identical to the enable dstate, so I can’t tell if I can navigate or not.
        * Disabled menu items are almost indistinguishable from enabled menu items

        These issues aren’t as perceivable if you are on a Retina screen in a dark room. However, if there is just a little bit too much sun in the room you are in, most of these important details are washed out. This isn’t even an accessibility issue as my eyesight is very good, but I imagine it must be terrible if your eyesight is worse.
