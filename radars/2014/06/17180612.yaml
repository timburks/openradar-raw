    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift is described as \"Objective-C without the C\".  Objective-C was C + Smalltalk, so subtracting C yields Smalltalk.\r\n\r\nTrying to map Objective-C keyword syntax to function-call / dot syntax brings significant complexity to the language without commensurate benefits.  The section of the language spec. describing external vs. internal parameter names is larger than the entire Smalltalk language spec.\r\n\r\n\"Modern Syntax\" was tried before, and it was overwhelmingly rejected by the developer community.  Developers are accustomed to Objective-C message syntax (which is Smalltalk syntax), and the APIs don't have to be mapped, so there is less effort.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use reasonable syntax in Swift.\r\nTry to comprehend the language specification.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSyntax is easy to use + understand.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStruggle with \"where does the first parameter name go\", \"how do these things map\" etc."
