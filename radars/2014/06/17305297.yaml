    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Wifi icon's lines are too thin, making it hard to tell if it is connected or not and get a read on single strength.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDefault OS configuration. Connect to a wifi network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould show a clear indication of signal strength.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn a non-retina display thinner lines make it hard to tell if they are black (strong) or grey (weak) the older, pre-Yosemite icon was clearer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10 build 14A238x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe older icon was clearer, this change should be reverted or revised for clarity.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Mac without a Retina display running Yosemite DP 1"
