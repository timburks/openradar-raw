    description: "Summary:\r\nThe display goes into power save mode repeatedly when using mavericks. After about  1 second, the display turns back on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have Mavericks (10.9, 10.9.1, or 10.9.2).  The issue has been present in every version, but has become unbearably frequent in 10.9.2.  The issue DID NOT EXIST in Snow Leopard, Lion, or Mountain Lion.\r\n2. Mouse over dock, and move mouse over different apps.  Keeping the mouse moving will keep the display blank for an indefinite period of time.  Disabling animations reduces the frequency, but does not eliminate it.  This is not the only way to reproduce (clicking on files on the desktop works) but is the most reliable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect both displays to continue to function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy 2nd display enters power save mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac - 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\r\n4GB 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM\r\nSerial: QP8130QZX8A\r\nAsus MW221 monitor - DVI connection with Apple adapter"
