    description: "Summary:\r\nTuples do not support comparison with the == operator, and trying to compare tuples give an compiler error \r\n\r\n“could not find an overload for == that accepts the supplied arguments”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create two tuples such as:\r\nlet t1 = (1,2)\r\nlet t2 = (1,2)\r\n2. Try and compare them using == such as t1 == t2\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n(1,2) == (1,2)  should return true.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA compiler error stating “could not find an overload for == that accepts the supplied arguments”"
