        I submitted an app to the app store, and accidentally left the display name as “[App Name] iOS” because that is the target name we were using in development. After just over a week, we got a rejection for it. It would be great if this could be an error when uploading submission to iTunes Connect.

        Looking through the other rules to create warnings for other obvious rejections would also benefit us. Generally app submissions are a hectic time and so things like this can be missed. It would obviously save time for your reviewers. :-)
