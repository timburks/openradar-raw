    description: "When accessing Cocoa and CocoaTouch APIs from swift, it would be nice to able to take advance of some of Swift features. For example, let's take one API that was discussed in the WWDC session: Building Modern Frameworks.\r\n\r\n- (void)presentPopoverFromRect:(CGRect)rect\r\n                        inView:(UIView *)view\r\n      permittedArrowDirections:(UIPopoverArrowDirection)arrowDirections\r\n                      animated:(BOOL)animated\r\n\r\nThe current signature of this API in Swift is:\r\n\r\nfunc presentPopoverFromRect(_ rect: CGRect,\r\n                     inView view: UIView!,\r\n   permittedArrowDirections arrowDirections: UIPopoverArrowDirection,\r\n                   animated animated: Bool)\r\n\r\nResulting in a call like this:\r\n\r\npresentPopoverFromRect(myRect, inView: myView, permittedArrowDirections: .Any, animated: true)\r\n\r\nLike mentioned in the session, it would be great if the signature of the Swift API could be rewritten to look like this:\r\n\r\nfunc presentPopover(fromRect rect: CGRect,\r\n                     inView view: UIView!,\r\n   arrowDirections: UIPopoverArrowDirection = .Any,\r\n                   animated: Bool = true)\r\n\r\nResulting in a call like this:\r\n\r\npresentPopover(fromRect: myRect, inView: myView)\r\n\r\nThis improvement comes form two things:\r\n\r\n1- Currently, the first parameter name is often part of the function name. But in Swift, it looks more natural to have it part of the first parameter name. APIs like UIView's\r\n\r\ninsertSubview(_ view: UIView!, atIndex index: Int)\r\n\r\ncould become,\r\n\r\ninsert(subview view: UIView!, atIndex index: Int)\r\n\r\n2- Some APIs can also become much better by using default values."
