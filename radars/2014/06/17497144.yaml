    description: "Player 1 starts a new GKTurnBasedMatch and invites Player 2 to play. Player 1 sends a GKTurnBasedExchange to Player 2. Player 2 receives the GKTurnBasedExchange, but does not tap the push notification.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this match is not added to Player 2's list of active games. The match does not appear in Game Center and the match is not returned via the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler:. The match only appears in Player 2's list of active games if Player 2 taps the exchange push notification or if the turn is passed to Player 2.\r\n\r\nReceiving a GKTurnBasedExchange should add the match to the players list of active games so that the match is not lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a GKTurnBasedMatch with 2 or more players\r\n2. Player 1 sends a GKTurnBasedExchange request to Player 2\r\n3. Player 2 does not tap the push notification\r\n4. Player 2 opens Game Center and looks at the list of active games and does not see the match\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayer 2 should see the match in the list of active games. Also, the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler: should display the match when called in the app if Player 2 is authenticated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayer 2 does not see the match in the list of active games or with the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler:.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of iOS 7 (including 7.1.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe docs say: \"You can build a game by adding exchanges to the existing turn-based gaming model or create a game solely through the use of exchanges.\" (Link below.)\r\n\r\nIf Player 1 starts a game, passes the turn to Player 2, and Player 2 does not tap the push notification, the game still shows up in Player 2's list of active games. This should also happen with exchanges since exchanges are asking Player 2 to take an action.\r\n\r\nThis is a more specific follow up to a radar that has been fixed and closed: 15592848\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/GameKit_Guide/ImplementingaTurn-BasedMatch/ImplementingaTurn-BasedMatch.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008304-CH15-SW1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens on all devices I've tested: iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPhone 4, iPad mini with Retina Display, and iPad mini."
