    description: |-
        Swift has two operators for specifying ranges, .. and … - as it is very easy to miss a keypress on the keyboard or trigger a key twice due to bounce-back of the physical keyobard keys, this can lead to hard-to-detect bugs where a large array is iterated, but the last element is missed, which can lead to creeping loss of data.

        Instead, it would be better to make the two range operators more distinct.

        Also, Swift’s operators are reversed from that of other popular (and similar-looking) languages.
