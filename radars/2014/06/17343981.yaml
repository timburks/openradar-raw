    description: "Summary:\r\nAllman style brackets work throughout Swift, except with the trailing closure syntax.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTyped:\r\n\r\nSCNTransaction.setCompletionBlock\r\n{\r\n    SCNTransaction.begin()\r\n    SCNTransaction.setAnimationDuration(0.5)\r\n                \r\n    material.emission.contents = UIColor.blackColor()\r\n                \r\n    SCNTransaction.commit()\r\n}\r\n\r\nAlso tried with () after setCompletionBlock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to compile without issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo Swift compiler errors:\r\n\r\n\"Braced block of statements is an unused closure\"\r\n\"Expression resolves to an unused function\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nOS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWas able to get it working by wrapping the brackets with parentheses, but that totally defeats the purpose of the trailing closure syntax.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
