    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a custom @IBDesignable swift class gets a new @IBInspectable Int property, and whenever I try to set its value in the Xcode Inspector on the Storyboard, the IB Cocoa Touch Tool reports a crash, and the application crashes as well (EXC_BAD_ACCESS, code 2, address 0x0) with a peculiar NSKeyValueIvarSetter stack trace (screenshot attached), with no additional console information printed out.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen regardless of the complexity of the custom view itself; simply adding a property of type Int and then setting its value in the Storyboard seems to cause the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project (View-based iOS application, with the language set to Swift—I did not test this in an Objective-C-only project)\r\n2. Add a Cocoa Touch Framework target to the project, embedding it in the Application as well.\r\n3. In the new Framework, create a new Swift Cocoa Touch subclass of UIView (TestView), and mark it as @IBDesignable.\r\n4. Go to the Storyboard (Main.storyboard), and add a View with the same class type as the subclass that has just been created onto the main view of the application.\r\n5. Going back to the TestView.swift in the Framework group, add an @IBInspectable var number: Int?\r\n6. Going back to the Storyboard, setting this value on the inspector should cause the Interface Builder tool to report a crash. The application itself also crashes when run on the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe inspectable property should be set with no complaints from the inspector, and the app should run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInterface Builder reports a crash and therefore the view is no longer updated live; running the app on the simulator also crashes the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l), Mac OS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have only been able to test this on one machine—a Retina MacBook Pro (Late 2013, 15\", high-end stock model) running OS X 10.9.3.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StackTrace.png' and 'IBComplain.png' were successfully uploaded."
