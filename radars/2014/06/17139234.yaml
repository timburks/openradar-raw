    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift functions are currently unnecessarily verbose due to the need for an explicit \"return\" statement. It would be nice if functions could automatically return whatever expression was last evaluated.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nfunc square(x: Int) -> Int { x * x }  // instead of \"return x * x\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nfunc oddOrEven(x: Int) -> String {\r\n  if x % 2 == 0 {\r\n    \"Even\"\r\n  } else {\r\n    \"Odd\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nResponse from Apple Developer Relations 06-Jun-2014 03:36 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that there are no plans to address this based on the following:\r\n\r\nWe considered this, but this becomes problematic in many cases.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
