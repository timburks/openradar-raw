    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen getting an appointment at the UI Design or App Store labs, it would be nice to be able to see the appointment in my schedule so that I don’t forget. And so that I can adjust my schedule to attend desired sessions later.\r\n\r\nIt’d be great if they showed up automatically, but at least it would be nice to be able to enter them. Or maybe the lab team could email me something that would auto-add it for me."
