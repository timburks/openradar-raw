    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be helpful to be able to store UIColors and UIFonts in your asset catalog, to make them globally available in code, xibs, and storyboards via dropdown menus in interface builder and in code, e.g., [UIColor colorNamed:@\"Foo\"], [UIFont fontNamed:@\"Foo\"] similar to the way Image assets are handled now.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure consistent access to the same palette of colors and fonts without having to define them in multiple places throughout the project."
