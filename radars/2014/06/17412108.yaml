    description: "Consider allowing the syntax in Swift to allow either the two-character \"->\" notation or the single unicode arrow character →. It's 2014. The original \"->\" notation was a syntax hack forced by the limits of the ASCII character set. Allowing the old notation and the new notation to co-exist will allow an advantage in readability and eliminate another place where syntax errors could be prevented, as well as an aesthetic advantage.\r\n\r\nThe user could type \"->\" the usual way, and keyboard substitution could simply replace it with the → character. This could be an optional setting in Xcode, or it could be simply up to the user to include it in their standard set of keyboard substitutions in the system preferences."
