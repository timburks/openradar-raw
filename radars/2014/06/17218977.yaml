    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a functional language, if and switch statements should return values. I know there is the ternary operator (? :) but there are cases where it would make sense to have slightly larger conditionals without having to make an actual function. These cases would be much more readable if they could be written as if/else or switch statements (would be quite ugly using nested ternaries).\r\n\r\nSee for example the following example from http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out\r\n\r\ndoubleSmallNumber x = if x > 100  \r\n                        then x  \r\n                        else x*2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a playground\r\n2. Try to refactor the first switch example to pull the let to the top level as follows\r\nlet vegetable = \"red pepper\"\r\nlet vegetableComment = switch vegetable {\r\n    case \"celery\" :\r\n        \"Add some raisins and make ants on a log.\"\r\n    case \"cucumber\", \"watercress\":\r\n        \"That would make a good tea sandwich.\"\r\n    case let x where x.hasSuffix(\"pepper\"):\r\n        \"Is it a spicy \\(x)?\"\r\n    default:\r\n        \"Everything tastes good in soup.\"\r\n    }\r\n3. Note that it does not work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe value of vegetableComment is \"Is it a spicy red pepper?\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first time I tried this I got no error in the playground, yet it failed to give vegetableComment a value.  I tried again and did get an error message the second time. (Expected initial value after '='.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFunctional programming FTW! Everything that can reasonable be an expression with a value should be!"
