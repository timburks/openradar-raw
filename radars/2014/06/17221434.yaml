    description: "I find Perl 6's use of given/when rather than switch/case reads much more naturally.\r\n\r\ngiven number {\r\n    when 1, 2, 3: ...\r\n    when range: ...\r\n    default: ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nreads much more naturally than\r\n\r\nswitch number {\r\n    case 1, 2, 3: ...\r\n    case range: ...\r\n    default: ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nI can see consistency with other languages as the only reason to choose a construct that reads much less nicely than this alternative. Since Swift does away with many past behaviours such as no fall through in switch statements and mandatory braces on if statements, I don't think renaming this construct would be a problem and would make for much more natural sounding code."
