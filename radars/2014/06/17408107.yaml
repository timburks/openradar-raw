    description: "The NS_REQUIRES_SUPER macro (or rather the underlying objc_requires_super LLVM attribute) in Objective-C is used to mark a method that expects a call to the superclass implementation from an overriding method.\r\n\r\nSwift seems designed to make conventions explicit and allow the compiler to catch common sources of bugs. Supporting an equivalent attribute (@requires_super?) could help generate appropriate error or warning messages at compile time rather than confront the developer with unexpected behavior."
