    description: "Summary:\r\niOS NSFetchedResultsController: Stop hiding caches directory\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen NSFetchedResultsControllers are configured to use a section info cache, the caches are persisted within the <AppSandbox>/Library/Caches/<appIdentifier>/.CoreDataCaches/ directory. The result of the leading period of \".CoreDataCaches\" is to make the directory invisible to most casual file browsing methods. Please stop doing this.\r\n\r\nThis controller is not a standalone application trying to hide files from prying users, it is framework code hosted within my application, running in a sandboxed environment. This entire sandboxed directory is the developer's responsibility to manage, and hiding it from me is disrespectful and difficult to troubleshoot. Framework support code should be transparent and above board, it shouldn't feel like a hijack.\r\n\r\nI'm not even asking for the cache file format to be documented, just please don't hide the files from us.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A, see summary\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A, see summary\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A, see summary\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1.1 [11D201]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny"
