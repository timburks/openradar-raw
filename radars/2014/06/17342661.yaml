    description: "There should be a way to keep the navigation title or titleView in the navigation bar unchanged and not animated if it's not changed after being pushed or popped. It doesn't look nice if the same title is shifted in and out.\r\n\r\nThis would be especially useful for custom transitions with a different style than the standard push/pop animation."
