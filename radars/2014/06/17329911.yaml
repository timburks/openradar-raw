    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the last couple months, I've been noticing that meetings added by my Google Calendar, which I accepted in Calendar on OS X Mavericks, sometimes never show up in Calendar on my iPhone. I have a bunch of long-standing daily meetings that are always there, but just now I noticed that a meeting I accepted three days ago never appeared.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Accept a meeting in Google Calendar on your Mac or in a browser\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMeeting should appear in Calendar on iOS, ideally within a few seconds, acceptably within 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAppointment never shows up, shows up sometime after it takes place, or after some length of time I cannot ascertain, not for days, at least.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm using a paid Google Calendar account at my company, through Google's corporate services plan thing (includes Gmail, calendar, other stuff I never use.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
