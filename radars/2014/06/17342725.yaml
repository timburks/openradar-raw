    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new extension stuff is wonderful but we'd like to support for a hook without any UIActivityViewController to incorporate functionality of sister apps from the same vendor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample:\r\nWe have two apps, Where To? (a POI finder) and Streets (a street view client). We'd like to display the street view panorama for any POI shown in Where To? without having the user to switch apps.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis shouldn't be any security concern since both apps are made by the same vendor."
