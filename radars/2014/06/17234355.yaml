    description: "Auto closures are a neat feature, akin to Smalltalk 76's open-colon arguments.  However, unlike Smalltalk 76 they are defined by the callee and not the caller, and more importantly, invisible at the call-site.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is quite unexpected and absolutely needs to be indicated at the call site, for example with the open-colon syntax that Smalltalk-76 uses.  Even C Macros at least have a convention of ALLCAPS() so that the user has an idea that the expression they are passing is not evaluated and then passed, but passed and evaluated (or not!) by the callee."
