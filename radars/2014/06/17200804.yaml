    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use a collection view and rotate the device, UIKit tries to animate between the landscape & portrait layout. The result is very weird, especially when viewed in slow motion in the simulator: gaps between the cells appear, the cell sizes jump etc. \r\nI have attached two movies and a sample Xcode project to demonstrate this issue\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nopen testCVC and run in slow motion on simulator \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the rotation animation works identically on table and collection view: no gaps between cells, no jumping of content views, not cells appearing out of nowhere\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ngaps during rotation\r\ncontent views are jumping and appearing\r\nrotation animation just looks broken\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 and iOS 8 beta\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and iOS simulator"
