    description: "One can see that iOS 8 brings private API to CoreBluetooth to access such information (CBPairingAgent). Apps would greatly benefit from some of these APIs to understand in what state pairing is in the device your app is running on.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the ability to programmatically unpair a peripheral from an application would simplify common user flows and reduce the need to have to ask users to go into settings."
