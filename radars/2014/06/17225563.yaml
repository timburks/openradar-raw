    description: "The Swift language supports enums with type parameters for associated values.  Such enum types should support recursive relationships, such as the classic linked list.  \r\n\r\nFor example, this seems to be a reasonable enum declaration:\r\n\r\nenum List<T> {\r\n    case Nil\r\n    case Cons(T, List<T>)\r\n}\r\n\r\nHowever, it fails to compile in Swift source code files.  The compiler reports the error:\r\n\r\n<unknown>:0: error: unable to execute command: Segmentation fault: 11\r\n<unknown>:0: error: swift frontend command failed due to signal (use -v to see invocation)\r\nCommand /Applications/Xcode6-Beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift failed with exit code 254\r\n\r\nFurthermore, pasting that class definition in a Playground file causes Xcode to crash.  When Xcode tries to re-launch with the Playground file with the definition, it crashes repeatedly."
