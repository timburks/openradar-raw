    description: "\"enum\" style enums and \"union\" style enums work very differently. They almost differ as much as structs and classes.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, it's confusing that they share the exact same declaration.\r\n\r\nPlease change \"union\" style enums to be called \"union\" (or similar) instead."
