    description: "Summary:\r\nNot having subsections in the beta DevForums makes it very difficult to find useful information in the DevFourms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Browse the DevFourms \"iOS 8 Betas\"\r\n2. Try to find content useful to what you're trying to do, for instance, solve an issue with the new Extensions APIs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA search or casual browse of an \"Extensions\" section might give me some useful questions and answers about building Extensions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWade through 5 pages of people complaining about bricking their iPhones with the beta OS, whose subject feature common phrases like \"HELp!!!1!!1,\" \"Activation issue,\" or \"how to downgrade?! please read!\" before coming across the first reasonable-looking post.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith the forum search as awful as it is, at least allow some sort of navigation with subcategories instead of throwing every question into the same bucket. It's almost as if you're starting to acknowledge the relative badness of the forums yourselves.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
