        1. When using implicitly unwrapped reference and passing it to a function that takes an implicitly unwrapped reference as argument, it is unclear whether the unwrapping occurs when method is invoked or when the variable is first accessed within the method.

        Documentation could be improved with that.

        2. Also, it makes not very readable code:

        myFunc(myInt)

        This line can crash if argument is Int and myInt is nil, or not crash if it is internally processed as an optional if argument is Int!. But this cannot be determined by reading this line of code, which is a readability issue IMO.
