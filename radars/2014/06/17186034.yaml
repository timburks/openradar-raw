    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Router component in the YUI JS library somehow induces a certain state that temporarily causes Array.prototype.filter() to return incorrect results (an empty array instead of a correctly filtered array).\r\n\r\nI've been unable to track down the precise cause of this state, but it's at least consistently reproducible using the attached test case, which is also visible at http://jsbin.com/potewaye/13/edit?js,console\r\n\r\nThe test succeeds in all browsers except Safari 8. I don't think the problem lies with YUI, since YUI's router has been in wide production use for several years and this problem only surfaced in Safari 8.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.smugmug.com/ is one such production website affected by this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached test case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThree separate arrays should be logged to the console: [\"started\"], [\"finished\"], and [\"foo\"].\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn Safari 8, the logged arrays are [\"started\"], [\"finished\"], and [], and you'll see the error message \"Array.prototype.filter() failed!\" indicating that Array.prototype.filter() returned incorrect results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0 (10538.35.8)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A238x)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in Safari 8 on OS X 10.10.\r\n\r\nDoes not occur in Safari 7 on OS X 10.9, in Google Chrome 35.0.1916.114, or in Firefox 29.0.1.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
