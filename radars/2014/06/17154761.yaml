    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting my iPhone, or any device larger than a flash drive (iPad, iPhone, external 2.5\" hard drive, Logitech USB headset, etc....) to the USB port on my Apple Wired Keyboard, Mavericks warns that the USB port has been disabled due to too much power being drawn. This disables the charging/syncing/functionality of the connected device, and of course to the keyboard as well. The devices must be disconnected from the computer itself, and the keyboard must be reconnected alone to regain use of the port. This also affects the USB hubs built in to 27\" Thunderbolt Displays. It has been determined to be a software issue, as the same computer, and displays worked fine with these connected devices on all versions of OS X 10.8. Upon upgrading to 10.9+ the issues occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce: \r\n1) Use a computer running OS X 10.8.X\r\n2) Connect an Apple Wired Keyboard. Plug an iPhone into the keyboard USB port.\r\n3) iPhone charges.\r\n\r\n4) Upgrade or perform a fresh install to OS X 10.9.X\r\n5) Connect an Apple Wired Keyboard. Plug an iPhone into the keyboard USB port.\r\n6) iPhone does not charge, and keyboard stops functioning. Warning notification displays warning of excessive power draw on the USB port, and the port has been disabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn OS X 10.9.X the iPhone connected to the keyboard should charge.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn OS X 10.9.X the USB driver incorrectly calculates power usage, and disables both the iPhone charging/syncing, and the keyboard by disabling the USB port.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFunctioning version : 10.8.X\r\nVersion with bug: 10.9.X\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue occurs on two 2012 15\" Retina MacBook Pros, and a 2013 13\" Retina MacBook Pro. Issue is also mentioned at length if you perform a Google search for \"the USB device drawing too much power has been disabled\"\r\n\r\nOn all 3 computers, OS X 10.8 functions fine with the USB devices as well as Windows 7 Professional x64"
