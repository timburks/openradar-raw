    description: "Summary:\r\nMost iOS / OS X networked games / applications are backed by servers running on virtual linux machines.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, servers are generally written in Java, Python, Javascript or Ruby or some other fairly easily portable language.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible to set up OS X Server and run an ObjC server, there are problems both with available hosting services and lack of sys admins with OS X skills.\r\n\r\nThe problem having Objective-C on one end and Jave/Python/JS/Ruby on the other, is that lots of protocol and networking code has to be written twice. There's also no way to leverage some of the nicer features in Cocoa that otherwise would speed up development.\r\n\r\nFor Objective C there is GNUStep, but not being maintained by Apple, it's always a worry that incompatibilities will arise.\r\n\r\nWith Swift, I hope that you can create a solid *SERVER DEVELOPMENT* port of Swift. Aside from Swift we would need part of the Cocoa library, but the entire UI part could be cut out.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's the Swift language + a subset of Cocoa (similar to what you'd need for a command line cocoa application)\r\n\r\nThis would boost both the Swift language and ease development of networked apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to compile Swift on linux\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwift is available and compilable of Linux\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift is not available for compilation on Linux."
