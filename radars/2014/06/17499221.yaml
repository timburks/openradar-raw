    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari fails to download large files (approx > 2Gb) when time machine is active if the time machine backup disk is disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0) Enable Time Machine to a USB backup disk. Disconnect backup volume.\r\n\r\n1) Download a large file using Safari. I used XCode6-Beta2 as a test file, which is 2.43Gb, to reproduce the problem. I’m uncertain of the exact size threshold, but 2Gb seems suspicious.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari downloads the file in question.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari downloads the entire file, then fails to move it from the .download bundle to the target file. If the .download bundle is opened with “Show Package Contents”, the target file is present, and passes a DMG checksum test (so it has been completely downloaded).\r\n\r\nThe error Safari presents to the user within the downloads popover is:\r\n“Cannot write file”\r\n\r\nThe error logged to the sandbox is more informative:\r\nJun 30 03:28:59 X.local sandboxd[146] ([6127]): com.apple.WebKit(6127) deny file-write* /.MobileBackups/Computer/2014-06-30-031846/Volume/Users/tim/Downloads/xcode_6_beta_2.dmg.download/xcode_6_beta_2.dmg\r\n\r\nNow attach the Time Machine backup drive and repeat the download. This time it works correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 7.0.4 (9537.76.4) running on OS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem manifests in Safari, but may in fact be a sandbox bug in OSX.\r\n\r\nUpdate: 10th July 2014 - Closed as duplicate of 15066646"
