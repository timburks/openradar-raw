    description: "Trailing closures require the opening brace to be on the same line. \n\nThis effectively imposes the K&R style for trailing closures - which, if you want to be consistent within your own code, imposes it for everything.\n\nThis seems wrong, and dangerous. Passing code through a formatter which only changes whitespace should not have the potential to break things!"
