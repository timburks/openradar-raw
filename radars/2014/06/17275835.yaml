    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift code prefers strong typing and dispatch. By way of ObjC it also allows some amount of dynamic dispatch.\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding easy dynamic dispatch to Swift, e.g.\r\n\r\nfunc callMethod(object : AnyClass, args: Any...) -> Any?\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if this many times slower than normal function calls. Just as long as it is there, it enables lots of solutions that otherwise are extremely hard to pull off.\r\n\r\nThere are many articles showing how to try to *emulate* this in C++.\r\n\r\nPlease provide at least the level Java has, preferably with a much easier syntax (with java you have to catch a million different types of exceptions - almost)"
