    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are two requirements to reproducing this bug: an asynchronous test that is tested by spinning the run loop, and having posted the aforementioned notification before the run loop is spun.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download attached sample project and decompress. \r\n2. Run the tests with breakpoints enabled\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`invokeTest` in MySuite should only be called for the third time after the second call has returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`invokeTest` in MySuite is called for the third time during spinning of the run loop in the second invocation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1, OS X Mavericks (latest)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is contrived since I originally encountered the issue using the Kiwi framework, which builds its examples and invokes them as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nPosting the application did finish launching notification is often necessary in testing, so I don't think this should be considered expected behavior.\r\n\r\nA workaround can be achieved by applying a lock to the user implementation of invokeTests, though an empty test suite will still be reported.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xctest-run-bug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
