    description: "In Swift, \r\n\r\nvar string = \"foo\"    makes a String varialble.\r\nvar char   = 'b'        isn't valid syntax but rather\r\nvar char: Character = \"b\"      has to be used\r\n\r\nWhy is that? I also saw that the escape character \\'  existed although there's no real need for it since \" ' \" is prefectly valid.\r\n\r\nPlease add support for single quoting for Characters as in other languages."
