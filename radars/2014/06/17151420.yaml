    description: "--\r\nUsing the += operator on an array sometimes results in the array items on the RHS being added to the array on the LHS, and sometimes results in the whole RHS array being added to the LHS. (in objc terms, sometimes addObject: is called and sometimes addObjectFromArray: is called).\r\n\r\nit appears using literals VS variable VS constants can really change the behavior of the += operator. This causes code to be unpredictable and hard to read at a glance.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSee the following two images for an example:\r\n1. http://cl.ly/image/3j2N3h0w2J3Z/o\r\n2. http://cl.ly/image/3q321j0I0p3m\r\n\r\n--\r\n+= should either always call addObject or addObjectsFromArray: enforcing types where it makes sense. Variables vs constants vs inline literals shouldn't change the behavior."
