In the application target, this code:\r\n\r\nimport Framework1\r\nimport Framework2\r\n\r\nfunc foo() {\r\n    let m1 = Framework1.MyClass()\r\n    let m2 = Framework2.MyClass()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfails to build with errors:\r\n\r\n/Users/john/Documents/swift/NamespaceError/NamespaceError/File.swift:14:14: error: module 'Framework1' has no member named 'MyClass'\r\n    let m1 = Framework1.MyClass()\r\n             ^          ~~~~~~~\r\n/Users/john/Documents/swift/NamespaceError/NamespaceError/File.swift:15:14: error: module 'Framework2' has no member named 'MyClass'\r\n    let m2 = Framework2.MyClass()\r\n             ^          ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project and try to build it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project should build, and m1/m2 should have their appropriate types.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NamespaceError.zip' was successfully uploaded."
