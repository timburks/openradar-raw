    description: "All or most of the various assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=) currently have very strict rules about their surrounding whitespace. The operators must either have no whitespace separating them from either operand, or whitespace between them and both operands. Having whitespace only between the operator and one operand, but not the other, results in a compiler error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a new Playground in Xcode 6.\r\n2. Enter the following:\r\nvar i=0\r\ni = 2\r\ni =2\r\ni= 2\r\ni=2\r\n\r\ni+=2\r\ni +=2\r\ni+= 2\r\ni += 2\r\n\r\ni-=2\r\ni -=2\r\ni-= 2\r\ni -= 2\r\n\r\ni*=2\r\ni *=2\r\ni*= 2\r\ni *= 2\r\n\r\ni/=2\r\ni /=2\r\ni/= 2\r\ni /= 2\r\n\r\n(or load the attached playground)\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nThis code should be valid and compile without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nSeveral lines produce various compiler errors:\r\n- For the = operator, when there is whitespace on one side of the operator but not the other, the compiler complains \"Prefix/Postfix '=' is reserved.\"\r\n- In the same situation for the other operators, the compiler complains \"Consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\nAll\r\n\r\nXcode Version\r\nXcode 6 Beta 1\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes"
