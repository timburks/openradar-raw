        Thank you for making the book on Swift available, it’s great to have this when getting into this new language. However, I do have a bit of feedback, which would be useful for a future companion book or a revised edition:

        The exercises are too simple. They seem to be aimed at beginners to programming (as a more experienced programmer that just doesn’t know the language would know to try these things). The rest of the book, OTOH, assumes a lot of knowledge. IMHO the exercises should just go.

        The book assumes you know programming, and you know the rationale behind features. All examples just say “do this”. Not why. I would find it much more useful to have it document what each feature is mainly intended for. What problem each feature is trying to solve.

        Therefore, it feels like a syntax reference, but written for sequential reading instead of as a reference book, which is a contradiction.

        That said, thanks for the book!
