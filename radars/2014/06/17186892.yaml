    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a Swift project with a storyboard containing UIImageViews, then set the target to iOS7.1, the images will appear on the simulator but not on the actual device.  On the device, calling UIImage(named: \"blah\") returns null according to my debugging session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift project with a storyboard\r\n2. Drag a UIImageView on the scene\r\n3. Drag an image into the asset catalog\r\n4. Set the UIImageView from the storyboard to the image in the asset catalog\r\n5. Set the SDK target to 7.1\r\n6. Run on a Device (tested on A1429 model iPhone 5)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image does not show up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)\r\nOS X 10.9.3 Build 13D65"
