    description: "When you assign a Swift String to a variable, you *have to* put whitespaces around the assignment operator or no spaces at all. This is not always desirable (different coding styles) and confusing for people learning Swift.\r\n\r\nvar s = \"This is Ok\"\r\n\r\ns = \"ok\"\r\n\r\ns=\"Still ok\"\r\n\r\ns  =  \"Ok, obviously\"\r\n\r\ns= \"compiler error\" // Prefix / postfix '=' is reserved\r\n\r\ns =\"compiler error // Prefix / postfix '=' is reserved"
