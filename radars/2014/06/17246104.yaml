    description: "The Swift language supports many of the principles of functional programming, such as higher-order functions, immutable values, and pattern matching.  One gap in the functional support is for conditional expressions.  \r\n\r\nSwift includes the ternary “? :” operator from C, but that operator does not support the “if let” test with binding that is so useful.  Swift only allows “if” or “if let” in a statement, not an expression.  Likewise, Swift only supports “switch” in a statement.\r\n\r\nI propose adding syntax to Swift that allows conditional expressions with the full binding support of “if” and “let”.  As a strawman, the syntax could look like the following:\r\n\r\nlet result = (if let myValue = someOptional {myValue.calculateSomething()}\r\n              else {calculateSomethingElse()})\r\n\r\nlet result = (switch someEnum {\r\n    case let .Success(value): .Some(value)\r\n    case let .Error(error): nil\r\n})"
