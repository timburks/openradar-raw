    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Swift, iterating over 3...2 exits as expected, whereas iterating over 3...1 loops infinitely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached playground file [not attached in OpenRadar], which contains:\r\n\r\nimport Foundation\r\n\r\nvar x = 0\r\nfor i in 3...2 { // expected never to run\r\n    println(i)\r\n    x = i\r\n}\r\nassert(x == 0) // never ran, as expected\r\nx\r\n\r\nx = 0\r\nfor i in 3...1 { // expected never to run but unexpectedly loops infinitely\r\n    println(i)\r\n    x = i\r\n}\r\nassert(x == 0) // never reached\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected both loops to not run their bodies and leave x unchanged at 0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second for loop ran infinitely (it may have stopped when it hit Int.max, but that's beside the point so I didn't test it).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)\r\nOS X 10.9.3 build 13D65"
