    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode allows you to setup search scopes, but doesn’t save the file selection filter you setup in the scope\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new search scope\r\n2. Select which files the search should be limited to\r\n3. Quit Xcode\r\n4. Re-launch Xcode\r\n5. Select your saved search scope\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen re-selected in step 5, the files selected in step 2 should be restored\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFile selection in step 2 is not saved, and search is based on the current selection (usually “Project”, or whichever files are selected by the scope)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot being able to save file selection makes it impossible to do something like:\r\n\r\na> Setup a search for only files specific to one project in a workspace\r\nb> Setup a search that always excluded one project in a workspace"
