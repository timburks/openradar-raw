    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 8's action & sharing extensions are awesome, and when run, they provide interesting JavaScript preprocessing functionality and access to the website's DOM.\r\n\r\nBut in many cases, it is necessary for an extension to be able to access the page contents (or the selected page contents) and this is difficult to do using the current APIs. Action/sharing extensions should include functionality to return rich text (web archive, HTML, RTF, RTFd, NSAttributedString, etc.) to the extension itself.\r\n\r\nThis would fit cleanly into the existing public APIs. Simply include an NSItemProvider that provides rich text and/or fill in the attributedContentText property in the NSExtensionItem that Safari returns to action/sharing extensions.\r\n\r\nThis functionality would also be easy to implement. When the user copies content from a UIWebView, the content is automatically copied to the pasteboard in several formats, including web archive and RTF.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an action extension that logs the returned NSExtensionItems\r\n2. Install it onto an iOS 8 device\r\n3. Trigger the extension from Safari\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should return the contents of the web page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe returned NSExtensionItems do not include the contents of the web page\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8, regardless of device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
