    description: "Hybrid native/web apps need to call between native code and JavaScript at times, for example when a system event like a push notification comes in. This is possible in UIWebView with stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString: but there is no equivalent functionality in the new, improved WKWebView API.\r\n\r\nThere is a private method _runJavaScriptInMainFrame: that appears to do this.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue for hybrid apps that use PhoneGap or similar frameworks."
