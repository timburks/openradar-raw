    description: "Summary:\r\nFor Objective-C Xcode will color the @[] and @{} portion of array and dictionary literals as the literal color (which is used for character and number literals). For Swift Xcode colors them the same as plain text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor Objective-C type the following into Xcode:\r\n\r\nid array = @[item1, item2, item3];\r\nid dictionary = @[key1: item1, key2: item2, key3: item3];\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Swift type the following into Xcode:\r\n\r\nlet array = [item1, item2, item3]\r\nlet dictionary = [key1: item1, key2: item2, key3: item3]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe [] characters in the Swift example to be colored in literal coloring.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe [] characters in the Swift example are colored the same as the plain text coloring."
