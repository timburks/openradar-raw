    description: "Summary:\r\nTo complete the new \"Sources\" analytics tracking introduced in the new iTunes Connect, it would be very beneficial to app developers to gain access to the Campaign ID that was associated with an App download.\r\n\r\nThis would enable things like:\r\n- App branding or White labeling (Thereby reducing excessive duplicate apps in the app store)\r\n- Crediting or Acknowledging Referrals to the App User\r\n- Streamlining Onboarding by pre-supplying known information\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn NSBundle property like \"appStoreReceiptURL:\" should be provided to allow the user to access the  CampaignID that was associated with an App download.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo \"appStoreCampaignID\" property exists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
