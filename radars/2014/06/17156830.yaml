        The progressive exploration of algorithms in Playgrounds often includes writing the code to actually run/test this code. It would be really handy if it was made easy to select part of a Playground “worksheet” and mark it (and its result) as a test, and then generate source files from it that

        1) contain a test case class with the appropriate comparison statement to ensure it matches the current result

        2) take the remaining code that’s not for testing and turn it into a header/source file pair, ready for use.
