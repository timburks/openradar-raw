    description: "Summary:\r\nI have multiple versions of Xcode installed: Xcode 5.1.1 for shipping apps, and Xcode 6 Beta 2 for apps targeting iOS 8. They share the list of open and recently used projects. Some projects I want to open only in one build or the other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project foo in Xcode 5\r\n2. Close Xcode 5\r\n3. Open Xcode 6 Beta\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject foo does not load automatically, because it has never been opened in Xcode 6 before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject foo loads automatically\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApplies to all versions, for as long as I can remember.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs every time you have multiple Xcode installs running concurrently.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
