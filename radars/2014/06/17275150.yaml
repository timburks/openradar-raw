    description: "Summary:\r\nI'd like to request than an NSTemperatureFormatter class to be added to complement NSMassFormatter, NSEnergyFormatter, NSLengthFormatter and friends. Our company, Kinsa (www.kinsahealth.com) makes a smartphone connected medical thermometer, and the ability to reliably format temperatures correctly for the user's locale would be awesome. \r\n\r\nIn addition if there's a reliable way to determine what the preferred temperature scale for the users locale is, that would be great too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start new Xcode Project\r\n2. try to alloc/init an NSTemperatureFormatter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClass should exist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
