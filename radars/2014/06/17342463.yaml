    description: "We'd like to see an additional flag whether a region change was user initiated or not:\r\n\r\n -[MKMapViewDelegate mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView regionWill/DidChangeRegion:(MKCoordinateRegion)region userInitiated:(BOOL)userInitiated\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for apps that need to fetch content based on map movement but at the same time want to center the map based on the found content. Such apps need a way to differentiate whether a map movement was initiated by the user or made programmatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOf course we can introduce a custom waitingForProgrammaticRegionUpdate flag that is set on each programmatic region update and cleared at the regionDidChange callback. However this doesn't always work because callbacks tend to be omitted when the region change is too small.\r\n\r\nSo we need a proper way to differentiate both types of updates. Btw, Google Maps SDK has such a property in their willChange equivalent method and it's very useful."
