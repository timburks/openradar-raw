        Summary:
        In the first Yosemite beta release, the lines of the new Wi-Fi menu bar icon are much thinner than previously, making it much harder to read the Wi-Fi status at a glance. (Especially in dim environments such as a WWDC session.)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Look at the menu bar. Is Wi-Fi active?

        Expected Results:
        I can see the Wi-Fi status at a glance.

        Actual Results:
        I have to strain my eyes or open the menu to recognize Wi-Fi status.

        Regression:
        The menu icon was clear in Mavericks.
