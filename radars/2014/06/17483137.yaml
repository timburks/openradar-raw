    description: "Summary:\r\nA large number of third-party apps that use scroll views are scrolled to the top when Notification Center is pulled down. This is very frustrating as Notification Center is very useful (and will be more so in iOS 8), yet using it constantly causes me to lose my place. I'm not sure if this happens in any first-party apps or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Scroll down a ways such that you are not at the top of the scroll view\r\n* Pull down Notification Center\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPulling down Notification Center should *not* affect the underlying app's scroll view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scroll view is automatically scrolled to the top by the act of pulling Notification Center down"
