    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use the Safari \"share\" menu to share a URL to Twitter, the resulting share sheet has an incorrect character count. (Screenshots attached.)\r\n\r\nNote that in Safari, it says I have 33 characters remaining, while the exact same content in the native Twitter app says I have 58 characters remaining. Something is gobbling up 25 characters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to a webpage in Safari 8.0.\r\n2. Click the \"Share\" button.\r\n3. Choose \"Twitter\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe character accurately reflects the number of available characters, which should be 140 - # of characters typed, with a link counting as 22 or 23 characters (depending on http/https). The tweet in the screenshot has 60 characters plus a trailing http link, which means 88 used characters, or 58 characters free.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Safari share sheet is counting 25 extra characters somewhere.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10 b2 (14A261i)\r\nSafari 8.0 (10538.39.41)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSafariTwitter.png\r\nNativeTwitter.png"
