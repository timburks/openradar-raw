    description: "There are a lot of asynchronous APIs available in the Cocoa. Multiple asynchronous calls in code are often hard to follow and hard to combine. I would like more language support to make it more readable:\r\n\r\n- make it easy to start new async call after another async call finishes\r\n- be able to start multiple async calls, and continue when they are all finished\r\n- be able to directly see the flow in code without lots of nested callbacks or lots of delegates jumping around\r\n\r\nThe await/async in C# might be a good candidate to help in this regard. Reactive programming can also help with this."
