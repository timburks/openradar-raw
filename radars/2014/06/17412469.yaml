    description: "We currently have a nice generic function 'contains' that works on anything that implements a Sequence: contains([1,2,3],1)\r\nIt would be nicer if I could write [1,2,3].contains(1). It is also more easily discoverable by a developer using code completion. Yet it would still be nice to keep the function generic, so it really belongs on the protocol itself. See also the default methods in Java 8 interfaces.\r\n\r\nIf you implement two protocols with a same default method signature, there should also be some syntax to choose the preferred implementation (or override it completely)"
