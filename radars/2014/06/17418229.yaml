    description: "Summary:\r\nBy default, a Swift playground only shows the code and results of evaluated expressions. The results of println() output are not visible unless the user takes steps to show the Console Output, and the steps to do so are not obvious.\r\n\r\nAs playgrounds are intended for use by beginners, it would be helpful if the Console Output was automatically displayed whenever a println() statement was executed, or if the output was included in the playground's sidebar where expression values are shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Xcode\r\n2. Create new playground\r\n3. Paste this code into the playground\r\n\r\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see \"Hello, world!\" somewhere.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't see \"Hello, world!\" unless one knows to open the Assistant Editor to see Console Output\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 (6A216f)"
