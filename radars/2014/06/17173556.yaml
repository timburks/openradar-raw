    description: "I get this strange error where images contained in the image assets are unable to display in the app.\r\n \r\nThe files are definitely shipped with the application since I'm able to load them into UIImages and check their size. When I attach them to an UIImageView they won't show up though. The image view is just blank! Opening the same project in Xcode 5, they display just fine.\r\n \r\nAlso, in Xcode 6, when attaching images contained elsewhere than the asset catalogue, they display fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate imageview in storyboard, attach image from asset catalogue to it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should display\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image won't display\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A215l)"
