    description: "Summary:\r\nPreviously, loading an RTF file from the app bundle and displaying it in a UIWebView worked fine. As of iOS 8 (beta 1 and 2), this no longer works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load an RTF file from the app bundle\r\n2. Create an NSURLRequest for the RTF file\r\n3. Have a UIWebView load that request\r\n\r\nNSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"Acknowledgements\" ofType:@\"rtf\"];\r\nNSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath];\r\nNSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];\r\n[self.webView loadRequest:request];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contents of the RTF file display in the UIWebView as it did in iOS 6 and 7.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web view displays the message \"Unable to Read Document. An error occurred while reading the document\" and the following message is logged to the console: \"Cannot find data converter callback for uti public.rtf\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4297e), iOS Simulator 8.0 (841)"
