    description: "Summary:\r\nApps that requestWhenInUseAuthorization do not have CLLocationManagerDelegate methods called. requestAlwaysAuthorization works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(Sample app attached)\r\n\r\n1. Setup CLLocationManager, delegate, and Info.plist strings\r\n2. Add NSLogs in the required delegate methods, and also include locationManager:didUpdateLocations:.\r\n2. [locationManager requestWhenInUseAuthorization]\r\n3. In the didChangeAuthorizationStatus, call [manager startUpdatingLocation] when status == kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorizedWhenInUse\r\n4. Observe NSLogs in console\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirst run:\r\nAuthorization not determined\r\nAuthorization when in use\r\nUpdated location\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAuthorization not determined\r\nAuthorization when in use\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4265u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project attached. Code in ViewController.m.\r\n\r\nYou can swap out requestWhenInUseAuthorizationn for requestAlwaysAuthorization and it will work fine, just delete the sample app in between.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
