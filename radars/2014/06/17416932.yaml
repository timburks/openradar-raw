    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 8b2 interactivePopGestureRecognizer allows the gesture to be started from anywhere on the screen when the iPhone is in landscape orientation (it's a great improvement!). However, it breaks recognition of pan/swipe gestures performed from left to right in subviews.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an application with Master-Detail Application template\r\n2. Add a UISlider to the Detail View Controller's view\r\n3. Run the app in the horizontal orientation on the iPhone\r\n4. Tap on \"+\", then on the row that just appeared\r\n5. Try to move slider's thumb to right\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSlider's thumb should be moved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ninteractivePopGestureRecognizer recognizes the gesture and the touch event isn't delivered to UISlider.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 2"
