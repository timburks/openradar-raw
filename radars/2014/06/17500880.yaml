    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the dock is set to autohide, and a Mad Catz R.A.T 7 Gaming Mouse is attached, moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen to reveal the dock does not work. While the R.A.T 7 mouse is attached, trying to unhide the dock with my macbook's built in trackpad or a different USB mouse does not work. Unplugging the R.A.T 7 mouse restores normal dock behavior.\r\n\r\nR.A.T 7 Gaming Mouse website: http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/rat7.htm\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In dock preferences enable the \"Automatically hide and show the Dock\" option\r\n2. Plug in a Mad Catz R.A.T 7 Gaming Mouse\r\n3. Try to unhide the dock by moving the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDock should unhide\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDock does not unhide\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A261i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnly workaround is to disable autohiding the dock when the Mad Catz R.A.T 7 Gaming Mouse is attached.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that if I drag a file from the finder to the dock, the dock does unhide normally.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached system report\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MacBook Pro.spx' was successfully uploaded."
