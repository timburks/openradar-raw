    description: "Safari 8.0 in OS X 10.10b1 has been updated to change only the company name instead of the full domain in the address bar. \r\n\r\nFor example, instead of \"discussions.apple.com\" or \"bugreporter.apple.com\" the address bar now shows \"Apple Inc\". This is very disorienting and forces me to keep selecting the address bar just to see the domain name.\r\n\r\nPlease revert this change or add an option to show the URL in the address bar."
