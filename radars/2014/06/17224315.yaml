    description: |-
        Almost all properties of NSView and other classes of AppKit are declared as atomic, because atomic is default if you don’t use “nonatomic”.

        @property (readonly, assign) NSWindow *window;

        It is hard to believe that all properties are atomic, because you can use those classes only from the main thread without complications. They are not thread-safe.

        You should declare those properties as nonatomic.
