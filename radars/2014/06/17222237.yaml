    description: "Summary:\r\nYou'd expect this to work:\r\n\r\nvar s = \"Hello world\"\r\nprintln(s[0])\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no built-in overload for subscript that takes an integer index.\r\n\r\nThis is a workaround but you'd expect something like this to be in the standard library:\r\n\r\nextension String {\r\n  subscript(i: Int) -> Character {\r\n    return Array(self)[i]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake a string.\r\nTry to access a character at a specified index.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompiler gives an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt returns a Character."
