    description: "Swift bridges with the C stdlib math functions directly, which is workable. However, the lack of type-safe generic math functions makes doing type-ambiguous math work extremely difficult - particularly when ambiguous types, like CoreGraphics' CGFloat is in play.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an iOS project.\r\n2. In any view/layer/UIKit-related class, set up some frame math\r\n3. Make the unfortunate decision to round/floor/ceil\r\n4. Add Double() or Float() casts to make builds succeed\r\n5. Switch to the opposite bit-width platform/simulator target\r\n6. Add Double() or Float() casts to make builds succeed\r\n7. Switch to the opposite bit-width platform/simulator target\r\n8. Repeat... \r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nSwift supports function overloading; overloaded math functions should exist that supplant the Darwin.C.math and Darwin.C.tgmath ones, as in C++.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nA developer is required to choose between, for example, floor and floorf and aggressively cast/initialize new Double() or Float(), and the \"casts\" that worked to make one platform compile will not work on another.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs primarily when building an application in Swift that targets both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nUsing Darwin.C.tgmath's __tg_floor et. al. produces linker errors, as the Swift compiler refuses to inline the tgmath functions from the Clang stdlib's header."
