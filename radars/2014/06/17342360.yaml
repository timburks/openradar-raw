    description: "Each and every time I build and run my app on the simulator, I get this alert:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouting App Coverage file not copied to the Simulator\r\n\r\nIt appears you are running 'WhereTo.app' on the iPhone 5s Simulator for the first time, and therefore do not yet have a data folder created.  The Routing App Coverage file will be installed the next time you run your app in the Simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coverage file apparently is successfully copied since my app can be launched from Maps.app."
