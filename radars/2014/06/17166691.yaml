    description: "Summary:\r\nrdar://17136480 and probably other bugs are already about adding access control to Swift, so that entire properties can be public, or private, or module-only; this bug is about allowing mixed publicly constant/privately writable properties.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Obj-C, you can make the public interface of a class's property read-only, so other code can get at it but not change it (at least not without some fiddling), *AND* the private interface writable, so the class can continue to modify the value itself.\r\n\r\nI use this all the time to preserve encapsulation.\r\n\r\nSince Swift does not have this yet, I cannot write Swift code with the level of encapsulation I would like."
