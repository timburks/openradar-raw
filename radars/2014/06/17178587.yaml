        The NSError** pattern isnâ€™t really appropriate in Swift. Using an enumeration where the Error case has an associated NSError seems like it might make sense.

        Whatever the actual answer, it would be good to have official guidance on how Apple will do this going forward, so that we can try to follow the same pattern.
