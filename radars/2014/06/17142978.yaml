    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a framework project, Xcode 6 is able to render views decorated with IB_DESIGNABLE directly in Interface Builder. This works well when the project is opened directly, but not when it is opened from a workspace.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI created a dedicated iOS sample project:\r\n\r\n1) Grab the 0.3 tag of my radar project (https://github.com/defagos/radars)\r\n2) Open the live-rendering-bug.xcodeproj project with Xcode 6. This project contains a single CustomView class marked as IB_DESIGNABLE, and which draws a smiling face. If you open PreviewView.xib, which contains an instance of CustomView, you can see that Xcode correctly displays the associated live preview. This is confirmed by the ‘Build <project_name> for Live Preview’ message appearing in the Xcode toolbar while the framework is automatically built for live rendering\r\n3) Close the project and open radars.xcworkspace. The live-rendering-bug project has been added to this workspace. If you now open PreviewView.xib, there is no live preview of CustomView, and the toolbar never displays a `Build <project_name> for Live Preview` message\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLive preview works no matter how a framework project is opened\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLive preview does not work when the project is opened from a workspace\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6, iOS\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
