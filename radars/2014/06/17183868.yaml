    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the \"if let x = expr\" syntax, \"expr\" must be an expression of type \"T?\", but \"x\" can be left as an inferred type or declared as \"T\" or \"T!\" or \"T?\". The inferred type isn't known, but is certainly not \"T?\". In other words, you really don't know what the type of \"x\" is or should be.\r\n\r\nI think it would be less confusing if \"x\" were always inferred to be \"T!\", or, if explicitly typed, required to be \"T!\". In other words one could say \"if let x : T! = expr\" or \"if let x = expr\", but not \"if let x : T = expr\" or \"if let x : T? = expr\".\r\n\r\nThis would leave \"if let\" a special case, but at least a well-defined special case. This would also preclude \"if let x = expr\" where expr is a non-optional type, but that is already an error, so no loss or gain there."
