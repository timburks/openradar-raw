    description: "Summary:\r\nInstead of showing one item for each device model, with a submenu to select the iOS version, each device model appears multiple times with no way to tell which iOS version it has.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project (any kind) with a pre-8.0 deployment target such as 7.0.\r\n2. View the destination menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA destination menu like that in Xcode 5, where each simulated device has a submenu for selecting the iOS version\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe destination appears as in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta build 6A215l\r\nOS X 10.9.3 build 13D65\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
