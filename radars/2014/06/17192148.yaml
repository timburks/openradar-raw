    description: "In the WWDC session Building Modern Frameworks we are encouraged to continue to be fairly verbose in our naming conventions in Swift, and I think that's a good thing.\r\n\r\nBut on the other side, Swift seems to favour abbreviations, which I don't like. For example, for a language that gets rid of the baggage of C, println sounds fairly bad. printLine is only 2 extra characters and sounds much better. Similarly, the func keyword could be function, it's only 4 extra characters and code completion is here to help us."
