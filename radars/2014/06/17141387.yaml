    description: "Message passing has been one of the most powerful features of Objective-C. Although Swift objects which inherit from Objective-C still use message passing for Objective-C compatible functions, looking forward to a world where Apple frameworks have been rewritten in Swift and Objective-C is deprecated, it would be a shame to lose this functionality.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways this could be implemented. Here are some suggestions in my personal priority order:\r\n\r\n1. Vtable dispatch is replaced with message passing\r\n2. Classes can opt-in to message passing at runtime (and extensions can opt their classes into message passing)\r\n3. A special Swift class that imparts message passing to its subclasses\r\n4. A separate type from regular classes that supports message passing"
