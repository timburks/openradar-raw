        Summary:
        Most apps now allow you to rename, move, and tag their files from the title bar of a window showing that document. The Finder does not allow this with an open folder. It should.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a folder in the Finder.
        2. Mouse over the title bar.
        3. Look for the little down arrow that lets you manipulate the open document.

        Expected Results:
        The down arrow exists and brings up some version of the normal panel allowing you to move, rename, or tag a document.

        Actual Results:
        It does not. To rename a folder, you must navigate to its parent folder and rename it there.

        Notes:
        This confused my mom. It’s great that you’ve made these features so easily accessible to normal users, but they need to be there all the time!
