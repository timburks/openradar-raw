    description: "Summary:\r\nibtool randomly crashes or exits with code 255 during the  compile xib build phase.\r\nA full stack trace is included below in the actual results section.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming a problem for us, our automated builds randomly fail, which give us false negatives in our Bots CI pipeline, and prevent beta builds from reaching testflightapp.com\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLike mentioned in the title, the crashes are somewhat random, so I can't give reliable steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nValid xib compile properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nibtool crashes/exits with code 255, build subsequently fails.\r\n\r\n2013-11-08 01:09:51.019 Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool[60297:3607] Encountered an XPC error while communicating with backboardd: <error: 0x2bc46a4> { count = 1, contents =\r\n\t\"XPCErrorDescription\" => <string: 0x2bc4884> { length = 18, contents = \"Connection invalid\" }\r\n}\r\n2013-11-08 01:09:51.019 Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool[60297:1013] TASK-ASSERT: cfurlcache - ProcessCacheTask - FAILED to get task-assertion, going commando with 1 items to process.\r\n2013-11-08 01:09:53.034 ibtoold[60239:507] [MT] DVTAssertions: ASSERTION FAILURE in /SourceCache/IDEInterfaceBuilderCocoaTouch/IDEInterfaceBuilderCocoaTouch-3746/IBPlugin/Utilities/IBObjectMarshalling.m:670\r\nDetails:  Failed to compile nib consisting of IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBLayoutConstraint, IBMKMapView, IBProxyObject, IBProxyObject, IBUIActivityIndicatorView, IBUIButton, IBUIButton, IBUIImageView, IBUILabel, IBUILabel, IBUILabel, IBUIView, IBUIView, and IBUIView.\r\n\r\nInterface Builder encountered an error communicating with the iOS Simulator. If you choose to file a crash report or radar for this issue, please check Console.app for crash reports for \"Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool\" and include their content in your crash report.\r\n\r\nException name: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed.

I ran into a dozen times today on Xcode 5.0.1(5A2053)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nA few things I've noticed:\r\n- I've never ran into the issue when building locally through Xcode's UI, the problem always showed up with either xcodebuild or Bots.\r\n- the issue seem to happen on the same set of xib. A handful of nibs are causing the issues in our project, roughly 5-10 out of about 100.\r\n- firing another build right after the failure usually goes through.\r\n\r\nAttached is the particular xib this build crashed on."
