    description: "Summary:\nIn Objective-C, we have a consistent method of documenting code in such a manner as to product popover documentation in Xcode.\n\nThere appears to be the beginnings of support for this in Xcode 6.0b2, however it does not support annotations like @return, @param, etc that headerdoc does. \n\nIâ€™d love to see these restored."
