    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOne person who I showed the iOS 7 seed to has dyslexia and found the new appearance for Notes to be harder to use. She preferred the lined appearance of the iOS 6 UI, and said her eyes had a harder time knowing which line to focus on without the lines.\r\n\r\nAn option to reenable the lines may be useful as an accessibility option."
