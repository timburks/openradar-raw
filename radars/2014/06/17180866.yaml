    description: "Summary:\r\nConstructors in Java and C++ are language features that seem like a good idea initially, but turn out to be less than useful in practice, leading to unexpected gotchas, complexity and ultimately use of the \"Factory Pattern\".   Use normal methods / message instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are not going to do this.  The uniform construction syntax is fundamental to the Swift model.\""
