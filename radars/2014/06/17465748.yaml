    description: "AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose as one of the AVCaptureExposureMode enum values isn't currently supported on any device or OS version. One indication that this is the case can be found here: https://devforums.apple.com/message/937741#937741.\r\n\r\nBut this fact isn't mentioned anywhere within the headers or the documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNSArray *devices = [AVCaptureDevice devicesWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo];\r\nAVCaptureDevice *device = devices.firstObject;\r\nBOOL supported = [device isExposureModeSupported:AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose];\r\n// supported = NO\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose = 1, // Unimplemented\r\n   like e.g.\r\nNSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData = 4, // Unimplemented\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nRemoval of AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose altogether.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nImplementation of the given value to fully work as expected. (of course this would be in favor)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBOOL supported = [device isExposureModeSupported:AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose];\r\n\r\nSimply returns supported = NO for all devices, OS version, etc."
