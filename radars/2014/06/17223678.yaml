        Summary:
        a swift Dictionary has a .keys and .values properties which return arrays. The docs do not say whether or not there is a guarantee that the order will be preserved for these two.

        In my testing, the order *is* the same (which is the behavior I prefer) however the docs should reflect this guarantee, otherwise we won’t be able to depend on it.

        Example:

        let dict = [ “drink”: “lagunitas”, “appetizer”: “quail eggs”, “entree”: “pork chop”  ]

        dict.keys    //  returns [“appetizer”, “drink”, “entree”]
        dict.values //  returns [“quail eggs”, “lagunitas”, “pork chop”]

        (The actual order doesn’t matter, as long as the same order is guaranteed for both)
