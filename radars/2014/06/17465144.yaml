    description: "Summary:\r\nI created an Array extension, but one of the computed properties I defined is not visible from the test target.\r\nI guess the problem is the return type, which is T!.\r\n\r\nThis problem doesn't happen in playground:\r\n\r\nextension Array {\r\n  var head: T! {\r\n    if isEmpty {\r\n      return nil\r\n    }\r\n    return self[0]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[1,2,3].head\r\n\r\nworks just fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the Xcode project in Xcode 6.\r\n\r\nBuild should be successful but the test target should fail to compile because of the missing property \"head\" on Array, which is defined.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this problem doesn't happen in playground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest target should compile as the computed property has been defined.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTest target doesn't compile as it can't find the computed property.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 2"
