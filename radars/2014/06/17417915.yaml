        Summary:
        Safari's Location bar doesn't display the web URL.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open any website with Safari, look at the Location bar. There is no URL displayed.

        Expected Results:
        The most vital information of a website is it's URL which should ALWAYS be displayed by a web browser. This also has security implications when in need to check a URL/domain/Path for phishing and other forms of common attacks.

        Actual Results:
        Safari conceals the URL of a website making it impossible to easily spot the currently viewed URL.

        Regression:
        This insecure behaviour is new in Safari 8 and there is no way to turn it off for the user. Even if there was this would be a terrible default making Safari an even more insecure browser.
