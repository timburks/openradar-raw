    description: "Summary:\r\nNSString has -stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:, which takes a character set and returns a new NSString. Unlike other NSString -stringBy* API's, this one does not have an in-place counterpart in NSMutableString. I would like one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to trim an NSMutableString in place. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. There should be a method available to do this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. There is not a method available to do this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0-10.9 SDKs, iOS 2.0-7.1 SDKs\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot a regression, but a missing API."
