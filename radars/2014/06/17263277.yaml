    description: "Summary:\r\nThe system firewall in Yosemite (and Mavericks, Mountain Lion... as far back as Snow Leopard, and possibly before) is not enabled by default. For most users, this is unacceptable, since they have little to no idea what a firewall does or why it would be useful (necessary) for them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a new copy of Yosemite\r\n2. After installation, open System Preferences.\r\n3. Click on Security and Privacy, then Firewall\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem firewall should be enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem firewall is not enabled\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite (first beta)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBrand new installation of Yosemite (and previous versions of OS X)"
