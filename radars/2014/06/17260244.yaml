    description: "Summary:\r\nI can use a trailing comma in a list of parameters to construct a Swift collect object like so:\r\n\r\n        let foo = [\r\n            \"this\",\r\n            \"that\",\r\n            \"other\",\r\n        ]\r\n\r\nI mean the comma after `\"other\"`. But I can't use a trailing comma in a function parameter list:\r\n\r\n        let threeDoubles = String[](\r\n            count: 3,\r\n            repeatedValue: \"\",\r\n        )\r\n\r\nIt's that comma after `\"\"` that's not allowed. The error is \"Expected expression in list of expressions\". It would be nice to optionally be able to have that comma, especially if the arguments to a function are variadic: It's easier to add and remove arguments without having to remember to edit the final line. Diffs look better, too: only an added or removed line is highlighted; no need to highlight the addition or removal of a comma in the final line.\r\n\r\nMost dynamic languages allow this syntax for lists of arguments, FWIW (though JavaScript and JSON notably don't, which is super irritating).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pass a list of arguments to a function\r\n2. Put in a trailing comma\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompile-time error: Expected expression in list of expressions\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A215l)"
