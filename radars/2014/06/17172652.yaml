    description: "Summary:\r\nGetting asynchronous programming right is hands-down the hardest thing in developing modern apps today. C# simplified the hell out of this with async/await. JS is not too far behind with yield and coroutines already in Node v 0.11, and async/await coming in ES7. That Swift doesn't support this feature is a big disappointment to me, but I'm hoping it's planned.\r\n\r\nSee http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2013/Aug-15.html (Callbacks as our Generations' Go To Statement)\r\n\r\n“Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.”\r\n\r\nDijkstra\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to write a decent app with async calls\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n    try {\r\n        Busy = true;\r\n        UpdateUIStatus (\"Taking a picture\");\r\n        var picker = new Xamarin.Media.MediaPicker ();\r\n        var mFile = await picker.TakePhotoAsync (new Xamarin.Media.StoreCameraMediaOptions ());\r\n        var tagsCtrl = new GetTagsUIViewController (mFile.GetStream ());\r\n        // Call new iOS await API\r\n        await PresentViewControllerAsync (tagsCtrl, true);\r\n        UpdateUIStatus (\"Submitting picture to server\");\r\n        await PostPicToServiceAsync (mFile.GetStream (), tagsCtrl.Tags);\r\n        UpdateUIStatus (\"Success\");\r\n    } catch (OperationCanceledException) {\r\n        UpdateUIStatus (\"Canceled\");\r\n    } finally {\r\n        Busy = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nhttps://o.twimg.com/1/proxy.jpg?t=FQQVBhhUaHR0cDovL2YuY2wubHkvaXRlbXMvMEcwaDFxMTUyZDFVMHEyMjBXMWgvSW1hZ2UlMjAyMDEzLjA4LjA4JTIwMTElM0E1MyUzQTI0JTIwUE0ucG5nFAQWABIA&s=QI9GeZLSgLIb5f5fHpX911kqiOAAqp-0XmZ0fbgSGUk"
