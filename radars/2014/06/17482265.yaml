It will encourage developers to create good frameworks with easy customization, there are plenty of cases to use in applications too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. It will be possible to create user-defined class for attribute\r\n2. You can attach this attribute to declarative language element.\r\n3.
