        Please add quick fix for create new methods for references to methods that can not be resolved.

        For example if I write something like this

        {
          SMPage *page = ...
          [self updatePage:page];
        }

        And updatePage: is not found, then just offer a quick fix like creating a new method like this

        - (void)updatePage:(SMPage *)page {
        }

        Eclipse has these features years ago and I can’t see why Xcode doesn’t offer these quick fixes too.
