    description: "When shipped, an eval() function would be great to have in the Swift runtime. Such a function would take a String and compile it in the current process.\r\n\r\nObviously, I'm not advocating for an entire development enviornment to be shipped to every user, but it might be possible if the Swift fronted is included as part of the runtime, and it passes off an AST to libllvm.\r\n\r\nI would love to have an eval() function on both OS X and iOS, but if it's not feasible on iOS, I'd still like it on OS X."
