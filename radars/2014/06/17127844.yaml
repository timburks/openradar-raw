    description: "Apple frequently uses a split screen layout in WWDC keynote videos and on the live stream. An example can be seen at 6:28 of this year's keynote video.\r\n\r\nThere's a bright big image displayed on a dark background. The rectangular image seems to stand on top of a black reflective floor.\r\n\r\nThe reflection of the image is rendered with a sharp bend, while a real reflection would point straight down, mirrored on the flat floor. The resulting shape resembles more that of a shadow, not a reflection."
