    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI applaud that Swift has done away with unnecessary semicolons, treating them as whitespace. I also think it's great that it's done away with requiring unnecessary parentheses in conditional contexts.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if it took the next logical and did away with requiring unnecessary commas in dictionary and array literal contexts, treating them as whitespace as well.\r\n\r\nSo instead of writing\r\n\r\n   var example = [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nyou could just write\r\n\r\n   var example = [1 2 3 4]\r\n\r\nAnd instead of writing\r\n\r\n   var my dictionary = [\"a\":1, \"b\":2, \"c\":3]\r\n\r\nyou could just write\r\n\r\n   var my dictionary = [\"a\":1 \"b\":2 \"c\":3]\r\n\r\nThis is a cleaner syntax.\r\n\r\nSpaces are a better default separator, which is why we use them as the separators between written words every day, instead,of,writing,every,sentence,like,this,which,is,hard,to,read,and,annoying!  Also, we are *already* writing spaces to separate collection items, so writing commas as well is just adding line noise. We are not adding obscure, meaningful punctuation; we are getting rid of obscuring, meaningless punctuation. As our colleagues in design remind us, whitespace is good.\r\n\r\n(The Clojure language already works this way, by the way, and it's worked for years without difficulties.)\r\n\r\nOf course, since we can just treat the comma as whitespace, no one would be required to write in this way immediately. Traditionalists could cleave to the familiar comfort of unnecessary commas, unnecessary semicolons, and unnecessary parentheses, so they would not be alarmed or inconvenienced.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite an array or dictionary in the cleanest possible syntax\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nglorious compilation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ninglorious compilation error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode6-beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nall the time\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
