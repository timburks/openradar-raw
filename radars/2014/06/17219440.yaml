    description: "Summary:\r\nBackground: I discovered that if I want to pass a complex closure into an auto_closure, I'll get an error but I can pass something like ({ ... })() meaning creating a closure then executing it immediately but we're in an auto_closure so it's delayed. :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have one that references self, so I want to reset the ownership to unowned.  Doing so stops SourceKitService and segfaults the compiler.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the attached Xcode project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode should compile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSegmentation fault."
