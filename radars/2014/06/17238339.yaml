    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen in instance method is passed to a function that accepts closures/functions, the passed method's class instance is captured strongly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pass a method to a function that strongly captures the method.\r\n2. Remove all other references to the instance of the class containing the method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe instance should be deallocated (or there should be a way to specify that the instance is not captured strongly by the method)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe instance is not deallocated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4265u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached project for a test exhibiting this behavior\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'FunctionExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
