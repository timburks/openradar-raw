        Summary:
        New storyboard in IB. Added a tabbed view controller. Changed text on the tab icons. Duplicated one of the linked view controllers. Can’t click on the icon in the IB canvas on the new view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See summary

        Expected Results:
        Ability to click to select the tab icon on the duplicated view controller

        Actual Results:
        Clicking had no effect and selected the view object of the duplicated view only

        Regression:
        I think I’ve seen this in previous IBs

        Notes:
        Workaround: restart Xcode or select the tab item using the object navigator panel
