    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Xcode to automatically symbolicate a crash report, Xcode uses Spotlight to search for and locate the relevant dSYM file. But it appears that as of Mavericks, Spotlight has searching of the Xcode archive folder disabled, which means Xcode is unable to ever find the dSYM file it needs.\r\n\r\nUsing this command:\r\n\r\nmdfind \"com_apple_xcode_dsym_uuids == *\"\r\n\r\nYou can see all of the dSYM files Spotlight knows about, but you won't see any in the default archive location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nArchive a build into the default location: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives\r\nTry and symbolicate a crash from that build.\r\n\r\nIf you move the archive out of the default location, say to your Desktop, Spotlight will be able to find the dSYM file and the symbolication will succeed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLog should be symbolicated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLog is not symbolicated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 (5B1008) on Mavericks 10.9.3"
