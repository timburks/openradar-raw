    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to make a Share Extension, and we are planning on releasing multiple apps. Obviously we do not want users to be able to install multiple share extensions, as that's a poor experience. But those apps all have different bundle IDs, so there is no way of embedding the same extension in all of them.\r\n\r\nI should be able to submit the same extension with multiple apps, ensuring that users can share to reddit regardless of what first-party reddit app they have installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached .xcodeproj\r\n2. Try to build. It will fail with the error \"Embedded binary's bundle identifier is not prefixed with the parent app's bundle identifier.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to build any extension prefixed with my company (com.reddit.*) in any app bundle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt requires me to prefix the bundle ID with the parent app's ID.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4297e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt always occurs."
