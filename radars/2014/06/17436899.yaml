    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Swift language, a Dictionary variable may contain, as a value, another Dictionary.  However, if the variable is declared to be a Dictionary? (optional Dictionary) rather than a Dictionary, it will crash Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty project\r\n2. Add a Swift Playground file\r\n3. Add the following line of code:\r\n          var x:Dictionary = [\"foobar\": [ \"foo\" : \"bar\" ]]\r\n4. Now, add a ? after the word Dictionary, so the line reads\r\n          var x:Dictionary? = [\"foobar\": [ \"foo\" : \"bar\" ]]\r\n5. Crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash. If a dictionary can contain a value (line 3), then an optional-wrapped dictionary should also (line 4)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs soon as the file is parsed after making the variable declaration optional, Xcode crashes and disappears. The crash handler/exception reporter does not even show up.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0-Beta2 (6A216f)\r\nOS X 10.9.3"
