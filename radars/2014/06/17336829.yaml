    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating constraints in Interface Builder should use the standard constant if it's the same as the position on the canvas. Interface Builder will currently use the actual pixel value as the constant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag any view (e.g. a button) to the canvas, positioning it inside another view snapping to the layout guide so it's a standard distance from the edge or another view.\r\n2. Create a spacing constraint to the other view.\r\n3. Inspect the constraint's constant.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConstraint is created with \"standard\" constant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConstraint is created with a fixed point constant.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 (5B1008), Xcode 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on both iOS and Mac nibs."
