    description: "Issue category: Keyboard\r\n\r\nThe keyboard gets \"separated\" from the bottom of the screen and jumps to the top of it.\r\nKeyboard keeps \"working\" but when \"shown\" it gets hidden because its view is drawn outside the phone's screen.\r\n\r\n• Detailed description of the issue: was doing a search on WWDC app. Hit back without dismissing the keyboard and then it got unmatched from the bottom and reattached to the top of the screen \r\n• Steps to reproduce: open WWDC app. Search sessions. Without dismissing the keyboard hit back\r\n• Expected result: the keyboard is dismissed and the app takes the user to the previous screen\r\n• Actual result: the keyboard keeps visible but attached to the top of the screen. \r\n• Additional notes or comments: after opening the bug reporter the keyboard moved to the correct place"
