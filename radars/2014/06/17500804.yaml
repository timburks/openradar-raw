        Summary:
        I would expect to be able to set a property via an optional, however this results in a compiler error.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Given the following syntax:

        someObject?.value = anotherValue


        Expected Results:
        The someObject’s value property is set to anotherValue if someObject is not None. If someObject is None, then the call does nothing.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode reports an error: “Cannot assign to the result of this expression”

        Notes:
        I understand that I can use the `if let someObject = blah` syntax to conditionally check and unwrap the optional, but it would be nice to have simple syntax like we have for property getters.
