    description: "rdar://17136480 is about access control, my bug rdar://17166691 is about public readonly/private writable properties in Swift: this bug combines those and asks for an interface in Xcode that lets you see only the public properties/methods/etc. of a class, and therefore only there readonly aspect of public readonly/private writable properties.\r\n\r\nWithout this functionality, you would have to continually \"eyeball\" classes as you write them, picking out the public aspects manually, a tedious and error-prone process.\r\n\r\nI could see this as an Assistant view, or a comparison view, in Xcode."
