    description: When posting a receipt to either the Production or Sandbox iTunes Receipt Verification websites, JSON data is returned indicating whether the receipt is valid. However, the response header does not have "application/json" set as the Content-Type. In fact, there is no Content-Type header set at all. This can be problematic for some REST clients.
