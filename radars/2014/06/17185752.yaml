        When referring to an enum value in Swift, we are allowed to drop the name of the enum, and use the case values, prefixed by a full stop:

        eg:

        	switch suit {
          		case .Spades:
        			// do stuff
        		  case .Hearts:
        			// do stuff
        	}


        or

        	self.callSomeMethodWhichExpectsASuit(.Hearts)


        This is better than having to fully qualify the values, but it looks quirky, and the full stop seems superfluous in many situations.

        Consider revising the syntax so that the full stop isn’t required. If it isn’t possible to have nothing there, consider a different mechanism for telling the parser that the next token is to be treated as an enum value (eg a different piece of punctuation, or even a keyword).
