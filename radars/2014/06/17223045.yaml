    description: "Summary:\r\n(Tested in Swift)\r\n\r\nDeleting the code pertaining to a connected @IBAction function causes Xcode to crash immediately after.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode (I tested this with a View-based Cocoa Touch application, written in Swift)\r\n2. Drag any view that can have an IBAction (e.g. a button) onto the main view\r\n3. Using the Assistant Editor, drag and create an IBAction (any type, any name, any sender type) onto the ViewController.swift, and give it a name\r\n4. Save both files\r\n5. Move the focus to the ViewController.swift, select the entire @IBAction function, and try to delete it with backspace\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should simply delete the selected text in the editor and remain active.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes. (Crash log attached)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l), Mac OS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have only been able to test this on one machineâ€”a Retina MacBook Pro (Late 2013, 15\", high-end stock model) running OS X 10.9.3.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IBAction crash.log' was successfully uploaded."
