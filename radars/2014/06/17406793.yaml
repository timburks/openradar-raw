    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of: presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:permittedArrowDirections:animated: notes that:\r\n\"When presenting the popover, this method adds the toolbar that owns the button to the popoverâ€™s list of passthrough views.\"\r\n\r\nOn iOS 8 beta 2 the toolbar behaves like it was in the passthroughViews array, but the array is actually empty.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter?\r\nIf the toolbar was in the array, it would be possible to remove it from the array manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iPad app with a toolbar and add two buttons to it\r\n2. Add an action to one of the buttons that shows the popover with presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:permittedArrowDirections:animated:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNote that after sending presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:permittedArrowDirections:animated: to UIPopoverController instance its passthroughViews is nil. But if you tap on the other bar button (when the popover is still visible), the tap is recognized.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npassthroughViews should contain the toolbar object.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator and iPad 3"
