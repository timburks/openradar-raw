        Summary:
        Hoping to demo the power of playgrounds for iOS, I wanted to show animations being tailored to perfection

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to import XCPlayground into any iOS Playground

        Expected Results:
        No error and use of the XCPlayground features

        Actual Results:
        The module is not found

        Regression:
        I believe this is working in the session videos and is not a Cocoa exclusive (Swift Playgrounds)
