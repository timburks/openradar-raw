    description: "Summary:\r\nCan't symbolicate crash on device with different architecture if I built app for 64 bit then for 32 bit and crashed app on 5S.  I guess XCode doesn't keep dSym and crash isn't symbolicated beause we store 32 dSym for 4S\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build & install app with 64 bit arch for 5S\r\n2. Build & install app with 32 bit arch for 4S\r\n3. Crash app on 5S\r\nAR: it's symbolicized\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's symbolicized\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not symbolicized until you reinstall app. I guess XCode doesn't keep dSym and crash isn't symbolicated beause we store 32 dSym for 4S"
