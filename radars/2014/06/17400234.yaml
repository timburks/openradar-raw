    description: "Summary:\r\nSKMutableTexture's description (as read here: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SKMutableTexture_Ref/index.html) contains the following: \"To use this class, create a mutable texture using either one of its creation methods or those of its superclass. \" However, whenever I use an SKTexture (i.e. superclass) initialization method in this manner (e.g. `- [SKMutableTexture textureWithRect:inTexture:]`) the returned object is an SKTexture. This seems counter to the documentation quoted above. That those same initialization methods also have the return type \"instancetype\" makes me believe that this could be incorrect behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new OS X > Application > Game project in Xcode\r\n2. Use the SpriteKit game technology\r\n3. Attempt to create an SKMutableTexture using one of the superclass' initializers\r\n`SKMutableTexture *mutableTexture = [SKMutableTexture textureWithImageNamed:@\"Spaceship\"];`\r\n4. Note that the returned object is actually an SKTexture\r\n```\r\n(lldb) po [mutableTexture class]\r\nSKTexture\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the superclass' initialization methods to return a SKMutableTexture with unique pixel data if necessary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe superclass' initialization methods return a SKTexture.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A216f)\r\nOS X Version 10.10 (14A261i)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has occurred for me every time with both OS X 10.10 and iOS 8.0 prerelease SDKs. I have not found a case where this scenario has worked as expected."
