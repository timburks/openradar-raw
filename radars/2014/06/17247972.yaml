    description: "Summary:\r\nTake this code:\r\n\r\nfunc hello() -> Int {\r\n  return 123\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet hello = hello()\r\n\r\nDeclaring the variable \"hello\" gives an error, \"Variable used within its own initial value\". Swift does not recognize that hello, the variable, is different from hello(), the function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a function and a variable with the same name. Swift gets upset.\r\n\r\nThis also happens if the function is a member of a class and the variable is a local variable inside another function.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can have a function and a variable with the same name.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift gives the error \"Variable used within its own initial value\" \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 1"
