    description: "Summary:\r\nI tried to drag a quicktime window by clicking and dragging on the titlebar and was unable to do so. I was surprised by this. I had to drag the window by clicking on other regions of the \"content\" area instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start quicktime player\r\n2. Select file->Open Location\r\n3. Enter http://traffic.libsyn.com/zenandtech/debug39.mp3 in the \"Movie location\" field.\r\n4. Click \"Open\"\r\n5. Observe: A quicktime window will open\r\n6. Try to drag the quicktime window by dragging on the titlebar of the window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window should drag like any other OS X window\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window does not drag. (see attached video)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A261i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to click elsewhere in the window (see attached video) but this is not obvious and not an adequate workaround for most users.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached system report\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'quicktime drag bug.mov' and 'MacBook Pro System report.spx' were successfully uploaded."
