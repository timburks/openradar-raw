    description: 'I think that the rules that govern external parameter names are too convoluted. The way I understand it, external parameter names need to appear before internal parameter names, but they don''t need to be repeated if they are the same as the internal parameter name and a # symbol is prepended to the internal parameter name, but that symbol is un-necessary for parameters with default values. I understand that these rules were implemented to reduce the noise in function signatures, but they are too complex for my taste.'
