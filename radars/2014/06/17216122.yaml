    description: "Summary:\r\nThe indentation produced by the Editor -> Structure -> Re-indent menu item (or ˆ+i) is not particularly pretty. The get and set keywords are inline with the var/let keyword, and the closing braces are inline with the closing brace of the computed property itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Re-indent / ˆ+i on the following code block.\r\n\r\nclass ExampleClass {\r\n    var someInt = 42\r\n    \r\n    var myString: String? {\r\n    get {\r\n        if someInt == 42 {\r\n            return \"Hello Swift\"\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            return \"Goodbye Objective-C\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    set (newString) {\r\n        // do something\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe get and set code blocks should be indented one further level."
