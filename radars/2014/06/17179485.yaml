    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIActionSheet is displayed with no buttons other than Cancel, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple app with a button connected to an IBAction method.\r\n2. In that method, create a UIActionSheet object using the plain `init` method.\r\n3. Add a cancel button to the action sheet.\r\n4. Display the action sheet, and the app crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUncertain. Perhaps this should just display a cancel button; perhaps it should do nothing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes with:\r\n\r\nTerminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Unexpected use of internal layout attribute'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4265u)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached project demonstrates the bug. See comments in ViewController.m. In the current state, this app will crash when the button is clicked in the UI. If you uncomment one of the calls to `addButtonWithTitle`, the app runs fine.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ActionSheetCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded."
