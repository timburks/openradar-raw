        Summary:
        No fancy structure, I’ll just come out and say it: I don’t really like “let”. It doesn’t read like defining a constant to me.

        My alternative suggestion is “def”. It’s short for “define”, which seems appropriately definitive (and is used in C for preprocessor-based “constants”), and matches “var” and “func” in being an abbreviation.
