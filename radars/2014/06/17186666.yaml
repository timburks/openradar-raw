    description: "On my 27\" iMac the readability of Helvetica Neue as the new system font in Yosemite is horrible. Not only is it difficult to discern l and I and some other characters, but in general is the font not nearly as ergonomically sound as Lucida Grande is.\r\n\r\nI understand that Retina screens are on their way forward, but until then I intend to get some more good years of use out of my i7 machine which has an otherwise gorgeous screen.\r\n\r\nPlease provide at least an option to use Lucida on non-retina screens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Yosemit on any non-retina enabled Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReadable typography. Lucida Grande does a great job at this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMuch worse readability of on screen elements due to Helvetica Neue being unsuitable for non high-res screens, esp. at small sizes as they are common in interface labels and the like."
