    description: "Summary:\r\nSeveral modern programming languages, including Haskell, Python, and F#, use whitespace indentation instead of curly braces or other begin/end delimiters. The result is code that is easier to read due to the absence of \"noisy\" punctuation that is redundant when programmers naturally indent their code anyway.\r\n\r\nSwift should adopt this feature.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nResponse from Apple Developer Relations 06-Jun-2014 03:36 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following:\r\n\r\nWe considered this, and aren't changing the design.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
