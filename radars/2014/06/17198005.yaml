    description: "We updated our app to v1.1 and wanted to hold it for release until a certain date. So I:\r\n\r\n- Uploaded the new binary\r\n- When to Rights and Pricing and set the release date some date in the future\r\n\r\nAt this point I got a warning that said \"if you do this, your currently live app will be removed from the app store\". Well, I don't want that, so I clicked Cancel.\r\n\r\nThis morning I woke up to complaints that our app is no longer available on the app store.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't realize is that the Cancel didn't actually cancel anything. The UI made it seem like it was *warning* me that this would happen, and then showed a Cancel button so I though I could back out.\r\n\r\nTo further confuse matters, on the main iTunes Connect screen the current version of the app kept its \"Ready for Sale\" status, as it remains at this moment.\r\n\r\nI believe two changes are warranted here:\r\n\r\n1. When an action by the user could result in their app being removed from the app store, they should get a warning prompt that actually allows them to change their mind.\r\n2. When an app is going to be or has been taken off the app store, its status should be something other than \"Ready for Sale\"."
