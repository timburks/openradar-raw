    description: "Summary:\r\nNormally, when sending email with MFMailComposeViewController, the developer can set isHTML and pass in an NSString of HTML-formatted text. \r\n\r\nHowever, UIActionSheet appears to infer which actions are applicable based on the type of object it receives. I think NSString is interpreted as plain-text email when UIActionSheet brings up the mail composer on my behalf. Thus, isHTML is not set. \r\n\r\nHowever, the mail composer interprets the text as HTML anyway, and _displays_ it correctly formatted. But after sending, it removes the formatting and sends a plaintext email instead!\r\n\r\nNSAttributedString is interpreted as HTML email -- why not use that instead? The problem is that it requires me to specify a font, which is excessive if I only need a bit of bolding or underline:\r\n\r\n- The default font in \"Cocoa HTML Writer\" is Times, which is not the default font for emails. \r\n- If I set the font to Helvetica Neue, it looks normal to the sender but will look odd if the recipient doesn't have that font, or sets a different preferred font in their email client. Plus, this setup is fragile: it needs to be maintained if the default system font family/size changes in an OS release.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate UIActionSheet\r\n2. Pass it an NSString with HTML. I used \"<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><strong>Hello,</strong> world!</body></html>\"\r\n3. Show the UIActionSheet\r\n4. User taps the icon for the \"Mail\" action \r\n5. User fills in recipient and sends the email\r\n6. Recipient opens the email\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe recipient receives the message with \"Hello,\" bolded\r\n\r\nAlso, the HTML received is similar to: \"<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><strong>Hello,</strong> world!</body></html>\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email is plain text and it simply says: \"Hello, world!\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
