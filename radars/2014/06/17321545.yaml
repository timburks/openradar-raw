    description: "Summary:\r\nI did a switch on (Bool, Bool), with cases for (true, true), (true, false), (false, true), and (false, false) and the error messages demanded more cases or a default case, to be exhaustive\r\n\r\nWhen I tried switching on a single bool, the IDE crashed (froze and needed a force-quit) before I even finished typing the first line of the switch statement.\r\n\r\nBoth behaviors were reproducible"
