        It would be nice to easily allow custom fonts to participate with the Dynamic Text system.

        I imagine one way would be to have a Font Catalog that would show the custom fonts and allow styles to be set for each system defined text style. As a bonus it would allow setting a default size for that font and reference sizes for the smallest and largest dynamic sizing options. This way you could ask for a font from a Font Catalog using a specific text style.
