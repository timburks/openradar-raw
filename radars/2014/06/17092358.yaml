    description: "Summary:\r\nThe getter for UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer's edges property always returns 0, even when actually set to something else.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer\r\n2. Set its edges property to any value, such as UIRectEdgeLeft\r\n3. Get the value of the edges property\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe result is the value that was previously set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result is always zero.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooking at the disassembly of UIKit, it seems that setEdges: sets a property of an internal object, but the getter returns the value of an instance variable (which has never been set).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S / iPad / iOS simulator"
