    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using AVPlayer to play a HLS master playlist containing a low-bitrate audio-only representation of the content, if the player adapts down to the audio only stream, it reports an incorrect presentation size.\r\n\r\nOn my testing on an iPad Air, the player always reported a presentation size of {1280, 720} when playing the audio-only stream.\r\n\r\nAll other presentation size changes seemed to be reported correctly. For example, when I added KVO on presentationSize during a playback session which adapted from 240p => 144p => audio only, I observed the following:\r\n\r\npresentationSize changed: NSSize: {426, 240}\r\npresentationSize changed: NSSize: {256, 144}\r\npresentationSize changed: NSSize: {1280, 720} \r\n\r\n(the last line being logged when the player began to play the audio-only stream).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlay a HLS master playlist containing an audio-only stream.\r\nThrottle network bandwidth using a proxy such as Charles\r\nObserve changes to AVPlayerItem presentationSize\r\nWait for the player to adapt to the audio-only stream.\r\nNote that the presentation size is incorrectly reported.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe presentation size should be reported as {0, 0} when playing an audio-only stream."
