    description: "Summary:\nTranslucency in Window chrome and menu bars make text extremely distracting and text hard to read.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nWatch the WWDC keynote and see Craid demo Windows Vista.\n\nExpected Results:\nClear borders to distinguish objects and windows from each other.\n\nActual Results:\nTranslucency makes this very hard, unreadable and annoying.\n\nRegression:\nThis has been a problem with Windows Vista with regards to usability. Now we have the same UI problems in OS X. Please, stop the madness! \n\nNotes:\nBack in the day when Apple adhered to the HIGâ€¦ no UI element was without a purpose. This is just useless eye candy carrying no information but only to distract and annoy."
