    description: "UIAppearance.h states that since iOS 7 \"tintColor (...) conflicts with the appearance proxy, and therefore tintColor is now disallowed with the appearance proxy\".\r\n\r\nI consider this \"conflict\" an implementation detail and ask for a solution, esp. in light of the importance of tintColor for UI customization since iOS 7.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous use cases where setting tintColor via UIAppearance is useful: I'd like to highlight our #1 use case of navigation bar customization. In many cases the navigation bar tintColor is different from the window tintColor, e.g for colored background and white content.\r\n\r\nOf course we can set the navigationBar.tintColor manually. However this fails for system view controllers such as SKStoreProductViewController, MFMailComposeViewController and MFMessageComposeViewController (especially when launched from a share sheet!) etc.\r\n\r\nAll these cases would be immediately solved if UIView.tintColor supported UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR."
