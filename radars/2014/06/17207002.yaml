    description: "WKWebView supports \"- addScriptMessageHandler:name:\" on the WKUserContentController which allows creating a communication channel that allows sending messages from JS to the native side.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there's no method for doing the reverse: sending messages from native to JS. This would be useful for causing navigations or other changes in a web page in response to pressing a native button (for instance).\r\n\r\n(See also http://stackoverflow.com/q/24049343/49485.)\r\n\r\nWKWebViewPrivate has _runJavaScriptInMainFrame: which sounds like it provides the appropriate function, but it isn't documented or supported. Can this method be publicized or a similar one added?\r\n\r\nThanks."
