    description: "I'm working on an application which allows users to check-in without having to interact with their iOS device by utilizing iBeacons. In order to implement this feature, I need the major and minor identifiers for a beacon region. Unfortunately, locationManager:didEnterRegion: does not include such identifying information, only the beacon's identifier.\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation, we need to start ranging for a beacon in order to get the major / minor values. Unfortunately, ranging only works in the foreground, which prevents this from being a truly seamless experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScenario 1: \r\nStep 1:Implement CLLocationManagerDelegate and start monitoring for a beacon region. \r\nStep 2: Enter the beacon region while the app is in the background or the device is asleep. \r\n\r\nScenario 2: \r\nStep 1: Implement CLLocationManagerDelegate and start monitoring for a beacon region. In the delegate's locationManager:didEnterRegion: method, start ranging. \r\nStep 2: Enter the beacon region while the app is in the background or the device is asleep. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScenario 1: Major / Minor information is included in the CLRegion object passed with locationManager:didEnterRegion: \r\n\r\nScenario 2: Ranging starts while in the background, allowing access to major / minor values while the app is in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScenario 1: The major / minor value are not included with locationManager:didEnterRegion:. These values are only available when ranging in the foreground.\r\n\r\nScenario 2: Ranging does not start until the app enters the foreground.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeally, major / minor information would be included in the CLRegion object passed with locationManager:didEnterRegion: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 64 GB using wifi and cellular (AT&T)"
