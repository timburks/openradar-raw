        Summary:
        It's really cosmetical but I want to see the keyword "function" instead of "func" in Swift. Every time I see it, it baffles me. We have space more than we need and we have auto-complete. Using the hole word is much more readable than every abbreviation.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Just create a new function in Swift.

        Expected Results:
        Auto-complete should write the keyword "function"...

        Actual Results:
        ...but every time I will get the garbled "func".

        Regression:
        It occurs every time, in that very first release of Swift.
