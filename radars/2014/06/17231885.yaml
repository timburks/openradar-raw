        Given that it’s already built on top of the fantastic open-source llvm et al, there shouldn’t be any need to explain why open source in general is a good thing.

        Currently though, the swift compiler itself (and presumably some supporting tools and libraries) do not appear to be open sourced.

        Consider this a request to open source them.
