    description: "Swift presents an opportunity to make Sets something closer to a first class collection type. While Dictionaries and Arrays are more commonly used than sets in Objective C, there are many cases where a Set is more desirable than either.  Core data uses sets extensively and the lack of a literal syntax, while manageable, is frustrating.\r\n\r\nSet literal syntax would help to reduce the friction of using sets. \r\n\r\nClosure syntax allowing for 'bare' {} seems to preclude adopting python's set literal syntax, so I suggest <members>  \r\n\r\nvar array = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"foo\", \"baz\"]\r\nvar dictionary = {\"foo\": \"bar\", \"foo\": \"baz\"}\r\nvar set = <\"foo\", \"bar\", \"foo\", \"baz\">"
