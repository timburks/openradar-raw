        Summary:
        2014-06-05 an OpenSSL security advisory was published: https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt
        OS X ships with vulnerable OpenSSL versions and many many binaries linked against OpenSSL leaving OS X and OS X server vulnerable to many of the CVEs. This affects OS X from at least 10.6 on including the current 10.9.3 client and server versions.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a OS X ships with known vulnerable OpenSSL versions and many binaries linked against it.

        Expected Results:
        Apple must release an update patch to update the vulnerable OpenSSL versions.

        Actual Results:
        No Update from Apple is available yet leaving any OS X vulnerable.

        Regression:
        I have not checked OS X versions before 10.6.8 server.
