        Summary:
        Still attempting to show the power of playgrounds for tailoring animations in iOS, I attempted to set up a dispatch semaphore to execute the main runloop whilst animations were running. It wonâ€™t compile

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to use a dispatch_semaphore (see notes)
        2. Encounter console output error pages and the playground refuses to compile

        Expected Results:
        The ability to use dispatch_semaphore

        Actual Results:
        Console errors and playground not compiling from that statement onwards

        Regression:


        Notes:
        // Sample code
        var semaphore = dispatch_semaphore_create(0)
