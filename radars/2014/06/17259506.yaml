    description: "Summary:\r\n(This is a duplicate of rdar://10207999 with revised wording.)\r\n\r\nPlease read the GitHub issue comments, starting with: https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/10#issuecomment-2229407\r\n\r\nWhile the bug is occurring, realpath()/readdir() and FSCopyAliasInfo() return paths with different cases. The filesystem is always HFS+. It appears that Dropbox exacerbates the problem, but is not in itself responsible. In all scenarios, renaming the folder to a different case and back fixes the problem. Logging out and back in also can fix the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFsevents should always fire.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, fsevents do not fire; this happens when realpath() and FSCopyAliasInfo() return different case for a path.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug is reliably detected by this code: https://github.com/andreyvit/find-fsevents-bugs/blob/master/find-fsevents-bugs.c (Attached)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am unaware of how to reliably _reproduce_ the bug myself, and it's easy to accidentally fix.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'find-fsevents-bugs.c' was successfully uploaded."
