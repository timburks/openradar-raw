    description: "It's frustrating not to be able to respond directly to app store reviews, but I understand the complexity involved and see how it might possibly not fix any of the core issues.\r\n\r\nWhen pushing a new update of an application, developers should be able to choose which reviews requesting new features or mentioning crashes or bugs have been addressed in the update. The developer could either write which features / bugs have been addressed, but this is not necessary. Apple would then send out an email to all of the customers who have written the selected reviews.\r\n\r\nUsers writing reviews can choose whether to receive developer updates when 1) giving a review or 2) in their iTunes account settings."
