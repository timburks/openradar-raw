    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to uninstall an extension without deleting the parent app. Even when the extension target is removed from the parent app, the extension remains.\r\n\r\nSince we cannot conditionally install extensions (rdar://17470368), a user might end up with duplicate extensions (rdar://17470190)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an extension\r\n2. Install the app/extension\r\n3. ???\r\n4. No way to remove extension without removing app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to remove the extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExtension stays around until app is deleted, even when an update without the extension target is installed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4297e)"
