    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe haven't seen what the minimum price for bundles will be yet, but please, make it so that bundles can not be less than Tier 1 * number apps. Ie, if there are 4 apps in a bundle, the minimum price should be $3.99 in the US store. Otherwise, if the minimum is Tier 1 regardless of how many apps are in the bundle, you'll be changing the minimum price per app to $0.10, restarting the race to the bottom."
