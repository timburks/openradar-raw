        Summary:
        The stdlib’s declaration of Collection is:

        protocol Collection : Sequence {
            subscript (i: Self.IndexType) -> Self.GeneratorType.Element { get }
        }

        This makes it appear like any type which conforms to Sequence and implements that subscript method can conform to Collection. However, this is insufficient; it also needs to conform to another protocol, _Collection, whose definition is unavailable but which requires startIndex/endIndex properties.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make a type, e.g. Set, from here: https://gist.github.com/robrix/e9e6c6693382a579c62a
        2. Declare that the type conforms to Collection.
        3. Provide an implementation of subscript per the declaration above.


        Expected Results:
        I expected that the type would be fully conformed to Collection and I could proceed.


        Actual Results:
        The compiler gives the errors shown in Notes, below.

        N/A


        Notes:
        These are the compiler errors:
