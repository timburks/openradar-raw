    description: "Summary:\r\nAn NSOperation can return YES for both -isCancelled and -isFinished. It seems counter-intuitive that an NSOperation can be both cancelled and finished.\r\n\r\nHowever, since finished does not imply completed, I suggest that an -isCompleted method be added to NSOperation.\r\n\r\n“Alice finished running a marathon after 3 miles, she didn’t complete it.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
