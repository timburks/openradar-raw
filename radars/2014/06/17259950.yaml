    description: "Summary:\r\nAs [Rick says](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24049021/79202), Xcode does not currently  support importing your own app or framework code into a playground, short of pasting it into the playground editor. I'd like to have that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a project\r\n* Create a class\r\n* Create a playground\r\n* Try to use created class in playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClass should be accessible from playground\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClass is not accessible from playground."
