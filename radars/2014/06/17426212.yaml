    description: "Summary:\r\nXode/IB should allow you to enter not just simple numerical literals in text fields expecting numerical values (e.g., enter \"200\" in the height field, to set the height to 200), but simple arithmetical expressions that will be substituted on the fly with the resulting value (e.g., enter \"200+30\" in the height field, to fill the field with the value 230).\r\n\r\nWhy? When entering numerical values, you are often tweaking them in a systematic way, either adding or subtracting an offset, or (occasionally) dividing or multiplying by two to compensate for screen scaling factors. It is awkward, slow, and error-prone to do all this arithmetic manually before entering the values. Let the computer do the computing!\r\n\r\nSince you enter original values once, and then tweak them dozens of times, MOST of the time you are actually tweaking values, and going through this awkward, slow, error-prone workflow. \r\n\r\nIf IB let you enter simple expressions like this, it would make most value manipulation much easier -- e.g., setting layout constraint constants, setting sizes and positions for manual layout, etc..\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fire up Interface Builder, beloved friend.\r\n2. try to enter a simple expression like \"200+30\" to set a new value of 230 in any text field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. see a result of 230 entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
