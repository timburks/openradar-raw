    description: "Strongly typed languages like C# and Java can provide reflection APIs.  Even C++ has a simple runtime type information system.\r\n\r\nObjective-C has a fairly rich run time type information system (not as good as C#).  \r\n\r\nSwift should provide a rich run time type information (Reflection) API similar to C#'s.\r\n\r\nAs a developer I should be able to enumerate all types defined in a Swift executable.  I should be able to enumerate all the methods and properties of a Swift type.  I should be able to get at all the parameters, return values (and types there of) of a method or property.\r\n\r\nI should then also be able to invoke a method or read/write a property of an object using the method information returned from the reflection API.\r\n\r\nFor reference: C#'s Reflection API: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145033(v=vs.110).aspx\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat there be a rich reflection API in Swift.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere appears to be none.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 (6A216f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
