        Summary:
        Using a tab bar controller, zoomed out via pinch gesture and attempted to link a view controller using the Control-Drag action on the IB canvas

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See Summary

        Expected Results:
        A blue line to appear, indicating Control-Drag gesture is working

        Actual Results:
        No line, no pop-up afterwards either

        Regression:
        Works in current version of Xcode 5

        Notes:
        Control drag still works when zoomed in 100% (which is not feasible on laptop screens in most cases) and the navigator panel still works for control drag
