    description: "We're trying to build a photo editing extension on iOS for our app. \n\nOur app is typically built with 2 different bundle ids: com.company.app & com.company.beta.app. We use a different bundle id like many other developers to enable released and beta builds to coexist on the same device.\n\nThis bundle id is changed depending on the build configuration in Xcode:\nDebug -> com.company.beta.app\nRelease -> com.company.beta.app\nAdHoc -> com.company.beta.app\nDistribution -> com.company.app\n\nThe extension reflects that by tuning it target build settings:\nDebug -> com.company.beta.app.extension\nRelease -> com.company.beta.app.extension\nAdHoc -> com.company.beta.app.extension\nDistribution -> com.company.app.extension\n\nBut the copy build phase that copies the extension into the app always look for the same extension (beta in this case), com.company.beta.app.extension, which obviously fails when building in Distribution (not beta).\n\nBuilding: com.company.app\n\ncopy: com.company.beta.app.extension\n(should be com.company.app.extension, as we're building com.company.app, but the copy phase is not customizable and always refers to the beta one)\n\nerror: Embedded binary's bundle identifier is not prefixed with the parent app's bundle identifier.\n\t\tEmbedded Binary Bundle Ientifier:\tcom.company.beta.app.extension\n\t\tParent App Bundle Identifier:\t\tcom.company.app\n\nThanks!"
