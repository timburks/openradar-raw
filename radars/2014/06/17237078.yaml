    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's no reliable way to get the bounding rect for a given glyph with TextKit. Invoking -boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer returns a rect that doesn't fully enclose the actual drawn glyph.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the documentation for -enumerateEnclosingRectsForGlyphRange:withinSelectedGlyphRange:inTextContainer:usingBlock: states:\r\n\r\n\"...The rectangles donâ€™t necessarily enclose glyphs that draw outside their line fragment rectangles; use boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer: to determine the area that contains all drawing performed for a range of glyphs...\"\r\n\r\nIt's clearly indicated that boundingRectForGlyphRange should return the actual drawings glyphs, however, this is clearly not the case.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would have another instance method to get the actual boundingRect for the drawn rect just like CTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs allow us to do in Core Text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITextView\r\n2. Add the letter \"f\" using font \"Zapfino\".\r\n3. Access the NSLayoutManager object of the UITextView and invoke -boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer.\r\n\r\nThe returned rectangle doesn't fully enclose the drawn glyph.  See the attached project for an example.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bounding rect should fully enclose the drawn glyph.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bounding rect doesn't enclose the actual drawn glyph and clipping occurs.  E.g. in the example project the \"f\" gets clipped if aligned to the right or left.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 and up\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone, Simulator, etc.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'RadarSample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
