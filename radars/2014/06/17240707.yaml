    description: "Summary:\r\nIt was possible to install a custom NSURLProtocol to handle requests from UIWebView. This is no longer possible with WKWebView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create and register a custom NSURLProtocol subclass that handles all requests.\r\n2. Create a WKWebView and load a request.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe custom NSURLProtocol subclass should receive a +canInitWithRequest: message, and then an instance should be created and initialized with -initWithRequest:cachedResponse:client:.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSURLProtocol subclass *does* receive the +canInitWithRequest: message, but is never instantiated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device or Simulator"
