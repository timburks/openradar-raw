    description: "In order to perform common setup in a subclass of UICollectionView in Swift, I tried to define both init(frame:collectionViewLayout:) and init(coder:) initializers. For the latter I receive a 'Must call a designated initializer of the superclass' compiler error if I try to call super.init(coder:). It seems the strict initialization rules of Swift require explicit conformance to the NSCoding protocol for every subclass, even if a superclass already conforms to it.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the headers for UICollectionView don't indicate conformance to NSCoding. This may be true of more UIView subclasses, although both UIView itself and UIScrollView do."
