    description: It seems that whenever I drag an object from a Storyboard to a .swift file, it's first as Outlet and I have to switch to Action. Obviously this is because Swift (as opposed to ObjC) can put everything at the same place. It should be easy to look if the dragging point is before or after the first method (e.g. init or any other method/function in the class) and assume the developer wants an Action â€” as opposed to Outlets being right at the beginning of the Class.
