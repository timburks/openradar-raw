        Summary:
        A where clause cannot use tuples to relate type parameters to one another.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to write one of the following functions:

        /// Returns a sequence containing the elements of the cartesian product of its elements.
        func cartesianProduct<A : Sequence, B : Sequence, C : Sequence where C.GeneratorType.Element == (A.GeneratorType.Element, B.GeneratorType.Element)> (a: A, b: B) -> C

        /// Returns a sequence consisting of the heads of the pairs.
        /// Note that it’s also unclear whether the _ is at all valid, but you could always represent it with an otherwise unused type parameter.
        func heads<A : Sequence, B : Sequence where A.GeneratorType.Element == (B.GeneratorType.Element, _)>(pairs: A) -> B

        /// Returns true if the pairs in `left` are flipped versions of the pairs in `right`.
        func flipped<A : Sequence, B : Sequence, T, U where A.GeneratorType.Element == (T, U), B == (U, T)>(left: A, right: B) -> Bool


        Expected Results:
        I expected these type signatures to be acceptable.


        Actual Results:
        The compiler complains that it expected an identifier for a type name.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Tuples are not first-class in the type system: you can’t extend them; you can’t typically construct 1-tuples; etc.

        Tuples are *incredibly* useful for defining ad hoc relationships between types (e.g. multiple returns), so it’s a shame that this isn’t taken further.
