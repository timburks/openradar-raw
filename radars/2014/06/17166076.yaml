    description: "This has been fixed by iOS 8  Beta 4 for sure. Possibly previous betas might have fixed it too.\r\n\r\nOld submission for clarifications:\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf we have \".txt\" in a UITextField (typed with the English keyboard) and then change to Pinyin keyboard, move it to the start and type \"nihao\" (你好) in the beginning, then we have \"你好.txt\" on the field. If then we hit the 前往 button to dismiss the keyboard then the value in the text field changes to \"你好好.txt\"\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that before you press the 前往 button that the character 吗 appears on top of the keyboard as a suggestion. Also that you don't move the cursor because it will clear the suggestion, which seems to be necessary to get the bug to trigger\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Tap the search/URL text field\r\n3. With the English Keyboard type \".txt\" (No quotation marks)\r\n4. Move cursor to beginning\r\n5. Change keyboard to Chinese Simplified Pinyin\r\n6. Type \"nihao\" (Again no quotation marks)\r\n7. Select the suggestion that the keyboard gives you, which should be \"你好\" (Again no quotation marks)\r\n8. Tap the button 前往 to dismiss the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to have \"你好.txt\" on the text field (No quotation marks)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActually got \"你好好.txt\" on the text field\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone5 32GB"
