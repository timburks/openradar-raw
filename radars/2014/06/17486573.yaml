        Summary:
        Software developers spend a lot of their time staring at computer screens. Bright colors (whites) are tiring to look at. Dark/night themes are becoming increasingly popular for professional apps, that are often used for hours at a time. Can we please have an option like this for Xcode as well? Thanks!
        Some examples:
        AppCode, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Adobe’s creative apps, Pixelmator, any of your Pro apps.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to write the next great app for iOS.
        2. Be blended by a bright 27’’ screen.
