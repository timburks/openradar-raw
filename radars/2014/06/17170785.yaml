        Summary:

        The new analytics are great. One thing I’ve always wanted to know is which keywords a user was searching for when they found my app. Being able to have keyword search terms show up as a Source (or something similar) would be very helpful. Right now, I’m not sure which keywords are working for me, or whether any of them are.

        When my app comes up in a search result, do users decided to try it? Do they think it’s appropriate? Am I using the wrong keywords? Incorporating keyword search terms into analytics would allow me to answer these questions and better fit my keywords to the expectations of the user doing the search.
