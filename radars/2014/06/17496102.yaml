        Summary:
        I want to be able to define generic typealiases. For example:

        typealias Cons<First, Rest> = (First, Rest)

        Hereafter I’d be able to use Cons<X, Y> to refer to a specific instance of this tuple type family.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to compile the above typealias.


        Expected Results:
        I didn’t actually expect it to work, but I would like to be able to expect it to work.


        Actual Results:
        It didn’t work, of course.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        This would go a long ways to being able to use tuples as first-class types.
