    description: "Phone/Addressbook loses a new record that had not been completed by pressing the \"Done\" button if you leave the app to get additional information needed for the record.\r\niOSState: Open\r\nRank:No Value\r\nJason Stelzel15-Jun-2014 11:55 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen adding a new record to iPhone's address book, it may be necessary to bring data in from other apps that have been used (such as Safari) to get the necessary info to complete the record.  Having left the phone app to get this additional information, upon returning to the phone app, the user's editing-in-process record screen is changed to the Contacts screen and the record is lost.  I can delete this record myself if I no longer need it, but having the OS remove it when I intended to add more data to it is a pretty severe interface violation and most definitely not what I expected of my phone app.  When using the task switcher, the pending record being created stays visible among the open apps and I would expect it to remain visible and editable when I return to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open phone app.\r\n2.  Tap '+' button to generate new address record.\r\n3.  Begin editing record (say, put in the first name of someone).\r\n4.  Leave the phone app to go to any other running app on iPhone.\r\n5.  View phone app in app switcher (newly edited record still visible in app switcher)\r\n6.  Upon tapping to return to phone app, screen changes back to Contacts and newly created record is lost.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6 (expected).  Upon tapping to return to phone app, I expect to be able to continue editing the record I just created.  Losing all of the data I just entered (by having the entire record vanish) is NOT what I expect to happen at all...\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6 (actual).  Screen returns to contacts screen and the new record I created is gone.  iPhone should always err on the side of preserving my data, not destroying it.  There's a reason I created the new record and if I decide that I don't need it (which happens FAR less often than me actually wanting to keep my new data) I can always delete it.  The iPhone should not be deleting this new record (despite the fact that I did not hit the 'Done' button) as I expect a multi-tasking operating system to be able to switch to another app without losing my current state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUI should be corrected to preserve my current editing of a newly created record operation in progress.  Just because I leave the app, this does not mean I wish to dispose of my edits on this new record (as the app switcher clearly indicates because it shows my newly created record up until I actually tap to return to the phone app).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 64GB Verizon, LTE\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
