    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a gif  that I want to show animated. It works fine as long the NSImageView or any of its superviews isn't layer backed.\r\n\r\nas soon as there is a layer backed view in its path, it stops animating. The only workaround I found is setting canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer=YES\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a NSImageView with an animated gif inside a layer backed supview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee it animate the gif\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsee it won't animate the gif (except if I now set canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer=YES)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nworkaround is to set canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer=YES on the image view.... which feels wrong :D\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n    NSImageView *view = [[NSImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 10, 50, 50)];\r\n    view.imageScaling = NSImageScaleNone;\r\n    view.animates = YES;\r\n    view.image = [NSImage imageNamed:@\"FanBlades2_42x42.gif\"];\r\n    view.canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer = YES;\r\n    \r\n    NSView *layerview = [[NSView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 60, 60)];\r\n    layerview.wantsLayer = YES;\r\n    [layerview addSubview:view];\r\n    \r\n    [self.window.contentView addSubview:layerview];"
