    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the introduction of app groups, it's even better to break up a giant app into smaller components. But if you want certain extensions to be installed regardless of which app in the group is installed--for example a share extension--there is no way to do this.\r\n\r\nRelated: rdar://17403759\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBundle the same extension code in 2 apps, get a build failure (rdar://17403759). I can't even try to get this working.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to bundle an extension with multiple apps in an app group and have it install only once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild fails (rdar://17403759). This is not actually possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4297e)"
