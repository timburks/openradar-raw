    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift's \"switch\" is a statement, not an expression. That means that if one wants to use a switch to calculate a value, one has to wrap it in a function:\r\n\r\nfunc stringFromInt(n: Int) -> String {\r\n    switch n {\r\n        case 1: return \"1\"\r\n        case 2: return \"2\"\r\n        default: return \"Only 1 and 2 are numbers\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nlet myNumericString = stringFromInt(n)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this common pattern could be simplified by adding an expression to Swift that does the pattern matching of \"switch\" but which is treated as an expression. For example, if this new expression was called \"match\", it might look like this:\r\n\r\nlet myNumericString = match n -> String {\r\n    case 1: \"1\"\r\n    case 2: \"2\"\r\n    default: \"Only 1 and 2 are numbers\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6"
