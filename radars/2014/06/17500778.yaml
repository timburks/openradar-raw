    description: "Summary:\nSwift requires trailing closures to have their opening bracket on the same line as the function call\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nGiven the following function signature in Swift: \n\nfunc searchForImagesWithQuery(query: String, count: Int, offset: Int, completion: (results: Array<ImageSearchResult>) -> Void);\n\nI would expect to be able to place the brackets on a newline:\n\nself.searchAPIRequest.searchForImagesWithQuery(request.query, count: 25, offset: 0) \n{\n\trequest.results = $0\n}\n\n\nExpected Results:\nThe code should compile just fine.\n\nActual Results:\nThe compiler in Xcode shows the following errors:\n\n“Missing argument for parameter 'completion' in call” and “error: braced block of statements is an unused closure”\n\n\nPlacing the brackets on the same line as the function call works, but isn’t ideal for my style. Thanks guys!"
