    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift's automatic bridging to Objective-C is great. However there are a number of compiler/language/runtime features that seem to be out of bounds of Swift developers.  For example there doesn't seem to be a generic way of defining Swift<->Objective-C data type bridging.\r\n\r\nEg, Swift's Array is bridged (and can be passed in place of) NSArray.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a generic mechanism where Swift developers can define bridges to Foundation or custom Objective-C classes.  Ie, why can't I define my own List<T> generic data type that can also be easily bridged to NSArray or my own Set<T> that is bridged to NSSet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the language bridging features of Swift were exposed to Swift developers to aid in integrating Swift with Objective-C, Core Foundation and other languages, frameworks and libraries.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A216f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
