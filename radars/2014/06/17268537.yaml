    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://17256397\n\nSummary:\r\nThe new TestFlight support for iOS is fantastic. Thank you! I love that it's now tracking users instead of devices. I love the much higher limits. I love that the process is pleasant for users.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for those of us developing for Mac we're still stuck in device purgatory and now that we know what we *could* have it will be all the more painful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a Mac app to be distributed on the Mac App Store\r\n2. Beta test it with users\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe process would be like TestFlight for iOS apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe process is soul sucking.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
