        Summary:
        Currently there’s now way to functionally iterate an array of objects other than with “for in” loops.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Declare an array; trying to iterate with a functional method.

        Expected Results:
        Swift provides a “each” method that will iterate through the array and return each method (similar to map but without the need to actually map the results)

        Actual Results:
        There’s no method available to do this
