    description: "Summary:\r\nA handy feature from the UIView Interface Builder is the left-hand sidebar that shows the view hierarchy as a collapsible tree view.\r\n\r\nSince nodes can be occluded by other nodes, or be positioned far away from the scene rect, having a list of all nodes in the scene would be very handy for finding stray nodes. It would also be handy to find nodes hierarchically instead of spacially.\r\n\r\nSince nodes obey a tree structure, a treeview UI control would be the most natural way to model the node graph.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A215l)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
