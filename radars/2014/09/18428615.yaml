        Summary:
        I thought this was the case at one point, but it object subscripting doesn’t return an optional. This seems crazy to me, since I have to imagine that’s a huge point of failure for most applications. Simply returning an optional would make the entire thing much safer. If general subscripting doesn’t return an optional (which I’d argue it should), then it would be great to at least have a safe function inside the standard lib to do this.
