    description: "Summary:\r\nI understand that it was a valid design decision at iOS 3 times, but now it really hurts that UIDocumentInteractionController (or also the print one) is a subclass of NSObject and just hides the activityViewController via a private property. \r\n\r\nWe have the concrete issue that we need to know when the view controller dismisses itself. For that we listen to `documentInteractionControllerDidDismissOpenInMenu:`. Unfortunately this is also being called when the user presses the \"More...\" button to configure the apps. There is no way to detect if it's a dismissal or just a push for the option controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nImplement `documentInteractionControllerDidDismissOpenInMenu:`\r\nPresent UIDocumentInteractionController on iOS 8.\r\nPress \"More...\" button\r\nObserve that delegate is called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView controller exposed or additional delegate so we can separate the state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo state separation without hacks.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
