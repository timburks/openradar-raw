        Summary:
        I have a project which was fine under Xcode6-Beta7 but which dies under Xcode 6.1. Reducing the issue, it turns out to be groups/paths with UTF8 characters (e.g. λ or ¬).

        Console log contains relevant warnings & errors.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a Swift file in a path with non-ASCII characters (e.g. ¬/Foo.swift) to your target.


        Expected Results:
        I expected this to be fine.


        Actual Results:
        Xcode 6.1 crashes.


        Regression:
        Xcode6-Beta7 did not crash.


        Notes:
        Sample project, crash log, and console logs to be attached shortly.
