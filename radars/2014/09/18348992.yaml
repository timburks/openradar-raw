    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen designing a UIButton in interface builder you can set insets on the content in a UIButton to make a gap between the imageView and the the titleLabel. The render in IB is what I would expect but at runtime the calculation for intrinsicContentSize for UIButton does not take the edge insets for the titleLabel or the imageView into account and therefore breaks the layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate UIButton\r\nAdd image to imageView\r\nAdd text for titleLabel\r\nadd content inset to the button\r\nadd content inset to the text on the left to give space between image and text\r\nrun app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButton renders like in IB (see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntext is truncated as button is incorrectly sized by auto layout at runtime\r\n(see attached screenshot from device running iOS 8 GM)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM, Xcode 6 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone simulator, iPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Broken Buttons.zip', 'Screen Shot 2014-09-16 at 11.47.07.png' and 'IMG_1244.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
