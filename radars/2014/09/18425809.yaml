    description: "Summary:\r\nCustom fonts in IB were introduced in Xcode 6. \r\nThis was a blessed introduction, but unfortunately there seems to be a major in it: it doesn't load the fonts well for labels with text in \"Attributed\" mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create new clean project\r\n2) Add some custom font\r\n3) Create ViewController with xib or storyboard. Add UILabel with this custom font in \"Plain\" mode.\r\n4) RUN - everything working, you can see custom font in Interface Builder and on the device\r\n5) Change UILabel to \"Attributed\" mode. Check that font is added correctly for this text.\r\n6) RUN - font not working in both Interface Builder and device\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0.1 OS X 10.9.4"
