    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you ask the contentView of UITableViewCell for its size the returned frame is only correct if the cell has already been rendered or the cell does not have any type of accessory view or accessory type. This is a problem if you want to calculate the height of a table view cell based on its layout as you have no chance to figure out the size of the contentView inside the tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: delegate method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the given example project or create a new table view controller\r\n2. In tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath: dequeue a table view cell\r\n3. set the accessory type of the table view cell to UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator\r\n3. ask the table view cell's contentView for its frame.\r\n4. call layoutIfNeeded\r\n5. redo step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- In step 3 the content view returns the full size of the cell: {{0, 0}, {320, 44}}\r\n- In step 5 the content view returns the final size that is used to render it: {{0, 0}, {286, 43.5}}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- In step 3 the content view returns the full size of the cell: {{0, 0}, {320, 44}}\r\n- In step 5 the content view returns something in between: {{0, 0}, {294, 44}}\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8 GM, Xcode 6 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe biggest problem here is the wrong width, not the height that is wrong by 0.5pt. Without the correct width it is impossible to calculate the height of a label properly.\r\n\r\nThe sample project outputs logs that show the different rect values in the described states.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S / iPhone 6 Simulator"
