    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen validating a Mac OS X app via the \"Validate ...\" button in the organizer window, Xcode 6.1 falsely claims that the app is an iOS application and validation fails with the following error message:\r\n\"iTunes Store operation failed. Unable to process application at this time due to the following error: iOS Apps must have a provisioning profile\".\r\n\r\nThe provisioning profile settings for the app in question have been set to \"Automatic\" in the build configuration. Before validation, Xcode correctly displays \"XC: *\" as the automatically chosen provisioning profile. The app in question is a standard Objective-C OS X app with a bundled XPC helper app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode (or iTunes Connect, which seems to be the origin of the error message) should not identify a Mac OS X app as an iOS app. Furthermore, it should not complain about missing provisioning profiles when itself added them automatically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 6.1 instead does both of the above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1027)\r\nOS X 10.10 DP 7 (14A343f)"
