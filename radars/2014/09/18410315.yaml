        Summary:
        The Control Center is not accessible on the iPhone 6 Plus lock screen when the device was locked while being upside down.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Unlock the device
        2) Rotate it 180 degrees so it is in upside down in portrait mode
        3) Lock it using the power button
        4) Bring the lock screen on with the Home button/power button
        5) Try to display the Control Center with a swipe up from the bottom of the screen

        Expected Results:
        The Control Center should display.

        Actual Results:
        No Control Center being displayed.

        Notes:
        - Unlocking the device and rotating it back to its normal orientation (with the Home Button at the bottom) brings everything back to normal and the Control Center is available again in the Lock Screen
        - Rotating the device in Landscape mode before locking it up doesnâ€™t affect the correct display of the Control Center: this only happens when rotated 180 degrees.
