    description: "Summary:\r\nRotating a share extension while the keyboard is up and a UITableViewController is on screen causes the bottom contentInset to be adjusted to an invalid value, causing the content to be pushed off screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. ensure that orientation lock is off\r\n1. run the attached application\r\n2. go to Safari, tap the share button, go to more.\r\n3. enable \"awesomeshare\"\r\n4. hit done\r\n5. tap on \"awesomeshare\" in the activity picker\r\n6. tap on any of the cells within the share extension\r\n7. rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UITableView should properly adjust itself based upon the keyboard size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UITableView is improperly adjusted, causing the content to move completely off screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nToggling the switch within the extension to the on position will start executing the 'sane height' code path. After this option is enabled, you should be able to rotate correctly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPHone 5 64GB AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'awesome.zip' was successfully uploaded."
