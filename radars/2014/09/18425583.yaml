    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's impossible to place any images with text in Pages. Automatic \"moves with text\" doesn't work, the images don't move with text.\r\n\r\nI have no idea where an image will appear in my Pages document when I add it. I doesn't add it to where my cursor position is.\r\n\r\nInstead it randomly appears several pages up, or several pages down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with the 1st pages document attached\r\n2. Add the 10 images form the folder at each FIGURE #\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the images to appear where I drop them in the text document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe images do not drop where I place them.\r\n\r\nThe go up or down, or onto a separate page.\r\n\r\nThe placement is random.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to change the images from \"Moves With Text\" and \"Inline\" the images continue to jump up or down the page. (Open document #4 and look for image #8)\r\n\r\nPlease make inline the default option, or fix the placement bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMavericks 10.9.4, Pages 5.2.2 (1877)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNotes: Take a look at my results in the documents #2, #3, and #4. I wasn't able to finish placing images in #4 because of a placement bug that prevents images from being set to inline. Also you can see how Image #8 jumps to a separate page which is not where I initially placed it.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround I have is to change every image to \"Inline\" Moves with Text, but the option isn't always available, and it always sends an image to some other page in the document.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge issue when compositing text and images together.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro Retina 2012\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Pages Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachment: https://www.dropbox.com/s/h62sllmgcwxnc5h/Pages%20Bug.zip?dl=0"
