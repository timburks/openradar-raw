    description: "Summary:\r\nI ported a Markdown implementation from JavaScript to Swift and in some basic testing it is about 65 times slower. (See  https://github.com/bnickel/CommonMark.swift).\r\n\r\nI wrote a much simpler experiment where I generate 100,000 character ASCII representable and 100,000 composed character (450,000 unichar) strings and do an iterative character search.  In the ASCII case, Swift shouldn't be doing much more work than Objective-C/C and in the second case it should.  In both cases however, Swift is hundreds of times slower.  The test code is attached along with the time profile I obtained during it.  They can also be found at https://github.com/bnickel/Simple-Swift.String-Performance-Test\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIterate through and compare the character at the index with another character (perhaps by running the attached tests).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwift scans the string around as fast as Objective-C.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift is *way* slower.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite, Xcode 6.1 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on a 2013 MBP"
