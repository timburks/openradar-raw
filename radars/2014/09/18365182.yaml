        Summary:
        In a pure Swift CLI tool, I’m unable to po anything in lldb. Any attempt to do so results in it failing to dlopen the appropriate dylib.

        I’m not sure where the dylib lives normally, but if it’s expecting it to be copied inside the app bundle then that would explain why it’s not working—there isn’t one.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write a pure Swift CLI tool.
        2. Set a breakpoint.
        3. Run.
        4. When running pauses in the debugger, attempt to po any variable or other accessible symbol, e.g. `po Process`.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to print the value bound to the symbol.


        Actual Results:
        It errored:

        error: Error in auto-import:
        Failed to load linked library swiftDarwin of module Swift - errors:
        Looking for "@rpath/libswiftDarwin.dylib", error: dlopen error: dlopen(@rpath/libswiftDarwin.dylib, 2): image not found


        Regression:
        You can workaround this by setting LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS to:

        $(DEVELOPER_DIR)/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/macosx

        This works quite well, however any time you get quite a few messages like this:

        objc[9009]: Class _TtCSs20_IndirectArrayBuffer is implemented in both /Users/rob/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/boom-aaolihuubdazajalrhptcajlaiaf/Build/Products/Debug/boom and /Applications/Xcode-Beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/macosx/libswiftCore.dylib. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

        So evidently lldb doesn’t need to be nabbing the dylib at all, it just doesn’t realize that. Alas, I don’t know how to make it stop.
