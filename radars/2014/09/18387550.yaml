    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app launches with a window set to UIWindowLevelAlert. (It's later faded to another window, but that's long after this process.)\r\n\r\nThe startup process displays informational text, then triggers a permissions ask for location; on iOS 8 with the new API, and on iOS 7 via startUpdatingLocation.\r\n\r\nWe receive the applicationDidResignActive, so we know the alert is being displayed. However, it is invisible. \r\n\r\nWhen quitting the app or switching to e.g. Siri, the alert becomes visible.\r\nMovie attached. Some quick code to paste in to engender the problem below.\r\nXcode 6.01, iOS 7.1, both simulator and real hardware.\r\n\r\n    self.splashScreenWindow = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds];\r\n    self.splashScreenWindow.windowLevel = UIWindowLevelAlert;\r\n    \r\n    SplashScreenViewController *splashScreenViewController = [[SplashScreenViewController alloc] initWithDelegate:self session:sessionController]; // particulars insignificant\r\n    self.splashScreenWindow.rootViewController = splashScreenViewController;\r\n    [self.splashScreenWindow makeKeyAndVisible];\r\n\r\n. . . . . \r\n\r\nlater, trigger location request. \r\nObserve that resignActive is called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith above code creating a key window at UIWindowAlert level:\r\n\r\nHold home button; alert displays over Siri. \r\nTap home to switch back; alert disappears. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert should display in my app, and not outside my app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert does not display in my app, but does display outside my app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVarious iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niphone 5 verizon, iOS 7.1.2; also simulator (iOS 7 versions)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_1726.MOV' was successfully uploaded."
