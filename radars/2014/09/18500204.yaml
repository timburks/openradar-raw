    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder the iOS 8 SDK (either in Simulator or tested on a device running iOS 8.0.2), when an external keyboard is disconnected, the keyboard frame reported in the userInfo dictionary (beginFrame) is the wrong height and does not match the size of the keyboard frame before the external keyboard was attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple project with a UITextView.\r\n2. On keyboard will show or keyboard did show, log the frame of the keyboard.\r\n3. Start up the app.\r\n4. Note the size of the frame when the app starts up.\r\n5. Attach an external keyboard (Simulator or device).\r\n6. Detach the external keyboard.\r\n7. Note the size of the frame when the keyboard reappears.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This does *not* occur when the soft/system keyboard is hidden/shown, either through a keyboard hide button or via becoming/resigning first responder status.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this with any third-party keyboards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard frame should be accurate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard frame is inaccurate (appears to ignore the QuickType bar's size).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny, 8.0 to 8.0.2, Xcode 6.0.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator, iPhone 5s, iPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
