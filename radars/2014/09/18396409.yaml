        Summary:
        When one manages to successfully attach a debugger to a today view extension (can’t get it to work 100% of the times, I believe this is a known issue though), breakpoints and print statements don’t work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Launch a today view extension in a device (I’m currently unable to launch in simulator due to radar #18396309) and wait for debugger to attach.

        Expected Results:
        App is paused on breakpoints and I can successfully inspect stack variables, etc.
        “print” statements successfully output text to the console.

        Actual Results:
        The app runs without stopping on any breakpoint.
        No log statement appears in the console, either in Xcode or in the device console.
