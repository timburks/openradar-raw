    description: "UPDATE: This issue has been fixed\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nLooking up a game by either ID or Bundle ID works correctly and looks up 40 items, as in these queries:\r\n\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=561941526\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=es.socialpoint.dragoncity\r\n\r\nBut if you lookup by both values, it returns 2 results. The first result has 37 items compared to the second result's 40 items. Additionally, the first item has blank arrays for some data, like the screenshot URLs. This is despite the items having equal IDs in the returned values.\r\n\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=561941526&bundleId=es.socialpoint.dragoncity\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lookup a game by ID and, separately, bundle ID to ensure they have the same data\r\n2. Lookup a game by both ID and bundle ID combined as in the description. This lookup will have missing data in the first item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe results have equal data\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne result has more data than the other.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
