    description: "Summary:\r\na class in my app has a method that uses [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle bundleWithClass:[self class]] pathForResource:@\"x\" ofType:@\"png\"], where x.png (and x@2x.png, et al) are proper members of an .xcassets file in my app .\r\n\r\nwhen the app is run separately, the assets are found and used normally.\r\n\r\nwhen the app is run as part of an XCTest, the asset is not found, and nil is returned.\r\n\r\ni've checked the copy bundle phase of the build phases, and includes the .xcassets file referred to above.\r\n\r\nafter building, i've noticed that in both the package contents for the app, and in the debug folder for the .xctest package contents, an Assets.car is created, and the binary contents seem to contain pretty much the same thing (the name of the asset is found in both, and the files are almost exactly the same size)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. include an x.png in a app.xcassets file\r\n2. include have code that retrieves the asset as described in the Description\r\n3. run the app (code is found)\r\n4. create an XCTest that invokes the method that makes the call described in 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nboth the app and XCTest should be able to access the resource\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nonly the app can access the resource\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
