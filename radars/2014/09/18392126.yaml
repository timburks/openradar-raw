    description: "Using the UIDocumentInteractionController takes a long while to display when using presentOptionsMenuFromRect.  Now with iOS 8, it's taking an unacceptable amount of time to show a list of applications available to open the document.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of documents, such as PDFs and Powerpoint presentations.  They are all slow, but the powerpoint presentations (pptx) seem to take the longest, I think quite likely because they are larger files.\r\n\r\nLooking at the output in XCode, there is a huge memory spike when performing the presentOptionsMenuFromRect method with a message that says \"Unknown Activity Items Supplied\" along with \"org.openxmlformats.presentationml.presentation\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a tabbed application project\r\n2. Add a CollectionViewController tab with UICollectionViewFlowLayout\r\n3. Add some items to the collection view\r\n4. Add a UIDocumentInteractionController\r\n5. Under collectionView:didSelectItemAtIndexPath use the presentOptionsMenuFromRect method to provide options for viewing the document.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo get the options menu in a timely manner, within a few seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTakes around 25-30 seconds to present the options menu.\r\n\r\nApparently a duplicate of 17927875 which is still open."
