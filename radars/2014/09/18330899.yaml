    description: "Summary:\r\nOne conversation in Messages insists on showing the unread bullet. Every time I open that conversation, the bullet disappears, and then re-appears almost immediately. The same conversation on the iPhone is marked as read, and the Messages app in iPhone has no badge, because there are no unread messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Notice a badge count on the Messages app.\r\n2. Open the app and note a conversation is marked as unread.\r\n3. Look at conversation and realize it's been read before. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRe-opening the conversation should mark the conversation as read, permanently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRe-opening the conversation marks the conversation as read briefly, and then it marks it as unread again. The badge on the icon never goes away during this process."
