    description: "Attached files: https://jeffvautin.com/wp-content/uploads/openradar/radarUIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum.zip\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWith iOS 8, when setting UIImagePickerController sourceType to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum, the image picker reveals all photos in the photos app, not just those in 'Recently Added'. Since 'Camera Roll' was deprecated in iOS 8, 'Recently Added' is the intuitive choice for what should be shown to the user in this condition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create UIImagePickerController.\r\n2. Set sourceType to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum.\r\n3. Present UIImagePickerController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see UIImagePickerController view display 'Recently Added' photos (as shown in `screenshot_Photos_App_recently_added.png`, a snap of the Recently Added collection in Photos App).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIImagePickerController displays all photos (same as if sourceType were set to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary). `screenShot_demo_app_SavedImages.png` contents match contents of Photos app All Photos, as shown in screenshot_Photos_App_all_photos.png.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 (12A405)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'radarUIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum.zip', 'screenShot_demo_app_SavedImages.png', 'screenshot_Photos_App_all_photos.png' and 'screenshot_Photos_App_recently_added.png' were successfully uploaded."
