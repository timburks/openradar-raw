    description: "Summary:\r\nAs the user drags and arranges icons in the home screen, iOS automatically \"re-flows\" the icons starting from the upper left corner. As iOS phones and tablets get bigger, it would make more sense to flow the icons from the bottom to the top, so that icons are closer to the user's thumbs/fingers, which are typically at the bottom of the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrag a single icon onto a home screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIcon should be in lower left or lower right corner, so that it can be easily tapped by a thumb.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIcon is as far away from thumb as possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
