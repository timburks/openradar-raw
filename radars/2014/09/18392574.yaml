    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I want to scale down a view in an animation I used to do\r\n\r\n[UIView animateWithDuration:duration animations:^{\r\n    view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0, 0);\r\n}];\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work anymore in iOS 8 and the change is not animated but immediate. The reason apparently is that setting a zero scale transform sets the frame size of the view to zero immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the code above on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view should scale down animated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view immediately disappears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 (6A313)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from iOS 7. It also worked on iOS 8 when the app was built against the iOS 7 SDK.\r\n\r\nMy workaround: Do a transform of CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0.0001, 0.0001) which is correctly animated."
