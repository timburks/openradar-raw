    description: "Current status as of 2014/09/30: Duplicate of 18042389 (Open)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAfter recent iOS 8 release, we are getting more reports from users complaining about unresponsive UI in our web app. All of them are on iOS 8, and all of them added our web app to homescreen.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation reveals that because our gesture control events are tweening with requestAnimationFrame, they too are affected by a recently discovered iOS 8 WKWebView bug: rAF and setTimeout stop firing after lock screen.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openradar.me/18315454\r\nhttp://www.sencha.com/blog/apple-shows-love-for-html5-with-ios-8\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee reference for details.\r\n\r\nWe are able to reproduce this issue on iPhone 5 with iOS 8.\r\nMobile Safari does not appear to be affected. Which is why I am filing this bug under iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nrAF and setTimeout should fire as normal after lock screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nrAF and setTimeout no longer fire after lock screen\r\n\r\n(The only remedy for this issue is to exit and relaunch app, since iOS always reload homescreen web app on launch, the problem disappears.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 [12A365]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDevice does not appear to matter."
