    description: "Summary:\r\nVoiceover skips the contents of third-party today widgets even if they have accessible content. Voiceover selects and reads off all the other elements in notification center (including first-party widgets like Today and Tomorrow), it even reads off the titles of the third-party widgets, but it will completely skip over their contents. The only way to get voiceover to speak the accessible elements in the widget is to touch inside the widget. But this will make it very hard if the user cannot see because they will not know where to touch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open notification center.\r\n2. If there aren't any third party widgets in the Today screen, add one.\r\n3. Turn on voiceover.\r\n4. Swipe right until voiceover selects all accessible elements on the screen.\r\n5. Swipe back right all the way up to the top\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceover should not skip the contents of the widget.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceover does skip the contents of the widget"
