    description: "Summary:\r\nTesting the appearance of applications that are shrunk to the \"half\" screen on an iPhone 6 Plus is currently impossible for developers.\r\n\r\nEven once it begins shipping it would be very helpful to have the ability to test the shrunken screen mode in simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run application on iPhone 6 Plus simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Expected to choose a menu option to emulate double-touching the home button on an iPhone 6 Plus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. There is no such menu option and seemingly no way to achieve this mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
