    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 8, the UIImagePickerController does not orient the camera to be upright in different device orientations.  Instead, the camera is rotated at the same angle as the device.  This is in contrast to previous versions of iOS were the camera would always be oriented upright regardless of device orientation.\r\n\r\nSee landscape.png and portrait.png in the attached zip.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIImagePickerController and present it.\r\n2. Observe the camera is upright in portrait.\r\n3. Rotate the device to landscape.\r\n4. Observe the camera is angled 90 degrees (the same orientation as the device) instead of oriented upright.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe camera should always be oriented upright.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe camera is oriented at the same angle as the device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEnsure rotation lock is disabled.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3 32GB, using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CameraBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
