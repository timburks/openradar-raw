    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I create a Swift String subscript extension and the Swift file lives in the App Target, the subscript extension works nicely. However, when I move it into a Framework, the same logic no longer works. I have created a sample application with two test cases that demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nI have been able to do this with Swift String function extensions successfully. It seems to be something specific to the subscript extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the SubscriptFrameworkExtensions sample app\r\n2. Run it with Test Case 1 uncommented\r\n3. Run it with Test Case 2 uncommented\r\n\r\nYou will see the difference in output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect both approaches to work the same way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe results are different. The framework extension method just doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator, Xcode Beta 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SubscriptFrameworkExtensions.zip' was successfully uploaded."
