    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user is syncing photos using iTunes or My Photo Stream, a call to enumerate all PHAssets with the user's \"moments\" will return both the original version of a photo and the synced version (thumbnail). Developers need a way to deduplicate such content reliably. Right now, using -[PHAsset canPerformEditOperation:PHAssetEditOperationProperties] works as a solution (since only iTunes and My Photo Stream assets aren't editable), but a more explicit and well-supported API would be preferred.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
