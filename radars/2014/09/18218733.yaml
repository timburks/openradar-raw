    description: "Summary:\r\nThe docs for `+[UIImage imageNamed:]` state that the method returns:\r\n\r\n“The image object for the specified file, or nil if the method could not find the specified image.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the Swift version of this API uses `init` and is typed as `init(named name: String) -> UIImage`\r\n\r\nThis seems incorrect, since the image with that name might not exist. I think this method would be better as `class func imageNamed(named name: String) -> UIImage?`\r\n\r\nThat seems like it would match the behavior of the existing API much closer."
