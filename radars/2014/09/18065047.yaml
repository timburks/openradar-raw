    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Tumblr app, we'd like to exclude our own share extension from showing up when tapping the share button on posts within the app because reflagging is already built into the platform.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a share extension on iOS\r\n2. Present a UIActivityViewController with items that would be supported by the extension\r\n3. The extension of the hosting application shows up in that application with no way to exclude it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a provided API to exclude the extension from showing up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API exists\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5 (12A4345D)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
