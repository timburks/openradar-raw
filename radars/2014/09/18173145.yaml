    description: "Summary:\r\nThe introduction of UIAlertController seems to have caused a regression in the way the old UIActionSheet handles clicking of its button.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, when any of the buttons in the action sheet is clicked, -[UIViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:] seems to be called behind the scenes. This was not the case in iOS 7, and I suspect it is a result of the fact that the new UIAlertController is a presented view controller in itself.\r\n\r\nThe result is that if I show an UIActionSheet from a view controller that was itself presented, for examples on the iPad, clicking the button will not only dismiss the popover, but also dismiss the underlying presented view controller.\r\n\r\nPlease find a demo project attached that shows the behavior. Compare how it runs on iOS 8 vs 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project for iPad, run it on iOS 8 beta 5\r\n2. First, present a view controller using presentViewController:animated:completion:\r\n3. From the presented view controller, show an UIActionSheet in a popover from within the presented view controller.\r\n4. When any of the buttons in the action sheet are clicked, BOTH the popover and the view controller presented in (2) will be dismissed due to the fact that -[UIViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:] is now being called behind by the OS when the button is clicked.\r\n5. Run the same example on iOS 7. The presented view controller from (2) will stay on screen after the popover with the action sheet has been dismissed. This is the expected, correct behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter clicking a button in the UIActionSheet presented in a popover, the popover should be dismissed but the underlying presented view controller should stay on screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter clicking a button in the UIActionSheet presented in a popover, both the popover and the underlying presented view controller are dismissed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 beta 5 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6 beta 6, iPad Air Simulator"
