        Summary:
        Launching a today view extension in the simulator fails.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select extension scheme.
        2. Select any iOS 8 simulator from the list of devices.
        3. Select “Today” from the lists of “apps to run”.
        4. Wait for app to compile and simulator to launch.

        Expected Results:
        Extension launches and the debugger is attached.

        Actual Results:
        I get an alert message:
        “Installation failed”
        “Invalid argument”

        With no additional details. The console doesn’t provide any more useful information either.

        Regression:
        This was also 100% reproducible in Xcode 6 GM.

        Launching does work on a device, except the debugger only works about 1 out of 100 times, but that’s a separate issue.
