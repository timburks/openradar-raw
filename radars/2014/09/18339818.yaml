    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder the iOS 7 SDK, -[ALAssetRepresentation getBytes:fromOffset:length:error:] is documented to return \"the biggest, best representation available, unadjusted in any way\". Developers have written applications under the contract of this documentation, with the expectation that for filtered photos (i.e. photos with XMP edit metadata associated with them), this call will return the original, unedited version of the photo.\r\n\r\nNow, under the iOS 8 SDK, this call returns flattened image content. That is, for photos taken on an iOS 8 device with a filter, -[ALAssetRepresentation getBytes:fromOffset:length:error:] is returning photo content equivalent to PHImageRequestOptionsVersionCurrent.\r\n\r\nThis breaks forward compatibility of the AssetsLibrary API and leaves developers without a mechanism to access full photo content using the iOS 7 SDK. Since real-world applications have clients running in the wild compiled against the iOS 7 SDK, this will break existing applications when users upgrade to iOS 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the camera app and take a photo with a filter applied.\r\n2. Using the attached sample project, capture the photo contents via -[ALAssetRepresentation getBytes:fromOffset:length:error:] and write to file.\r\n\r\nRepeat steps (1) and (2) by deploying to a device running iOS 7.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image data returned by -[ALAssetRepresentation getBytes:fromOffset:length:error:] on iOS 8 should match what is returned on iOS 7. That is, the call should return the data unmodified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image data returned on iOS 8 is a flattened version of the photo, with edits destructively applied.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SPPhotoLibraryData.zip' was successfully uploaded."
