        Summary:
        With Reduced Transparency on in Accessibility Preferences, a pop-up (didn’t check other possible uses of vibrant views) which is initialized with VibrantDark appearance shows with a light background but the controls inside appear to be for dark mode, which make this whole thing pretty unusable.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Enabled Reduced Transparency in Accessibility Preferences
        2. Display a popover with popover.appearance = [NSAppearance appearanceNamed:NSAppearanceNameVibrantDark];

        Expected Results:
        The background of the pop-over should be dark

        Actual Results:
        The background of the pop-over is light

        Regression:
        Without Reduced Transparency it works as advertised. I believe it also worked in some of the previous betas but I’m not 100% sure.
