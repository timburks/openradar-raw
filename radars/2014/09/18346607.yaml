    description: "Summary:\r\nAddress book SQLite files cannot be taken from an iOS8 device and used in Xcode Version 6.0 (6A313) GM simulators; however sqlite  files from iOS7 devices versions of the AddressBook SQLite DB work fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy AddressBook and AddressBook image DBs from an iOS7 device to the appropriate Library/AddressBoo simulator directory.\r\n\r\n2. Launch  the simulator and go into the simulator's Address Book app; your address book will be present.\r\n\r\n3. Reset the sim and erase all contents.\r\n\r\n4. Replace the same address book SQLite files from an iOS8 device and launch the simulator, opening the address book app again.  The address book will be empty. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to take Address Book SQLite files from a backup of an actual iOS device and use them as part of my development process in the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAddress books appear to be empty.  Clearly the on-device version of libSQLlite is *different* than the one used in Xcode Version 6.0 (6A313) and it's simulators.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A313) and iOS8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2 iOS devices: one running iOS7.1.x and another running iOS8GM\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
