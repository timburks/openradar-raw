    description: "Summary:\r\nCall -[PHImageManager requestImageForAsset:targetSize:contentMode:options:resultHandler:] for a video taken on iOS 7, with a small target size. PHImageManager will return a thumbnail that has icon/text overlaid.\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been captured in a sample project attached to this rdar and uploaded to: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ykxg3z4ql4mv569/AACkhU1QIgd0k5IvJR4ETqT9a?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe sample project will identify all videos in the camera roll, and show a tiny thumbnail in the center of the screen for each video from newest to oldest.\r\n\r\nA sample icon exhibiting this behavior is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sc/bklaaxzdba45uuk/AAB4oVLHxy2_UdlTbDdycuFja\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the provided sample project and deploy to a device running iOS 8 which has a mix of videos taken while running iOS 8 and videos taken before installing iOS 8.\r\n2. The app will show tiny thumbnails in the center of the screen, one at a time, with 5 seconds in between each thumbnail. The thumbnails are displayed newest->oldest.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThumbnails for older videos should be returned with no overlays.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe most recent videos (i.e. the ones added to the camera roll from iOS 8) return thumbnails as expected, with no overlay. Older videos (taken from iOS 7 or earlier) return thumbnails with an overlaid video icon and duration text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PHAssetVideoThumbnailBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
