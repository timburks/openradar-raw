    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I activate Time Machine, a black rectangle covers most of the screen.  See the screen shot [omitted here].  This rectangle corresponds to the size of my second screen; presumably it is intended to blank out that screen, but it is appearing on my primary screen instead.\r\n\r\nIf I move the Finder window to the second screen, the second screen is correctly blanked, and the Time Machine UI is displayed on the primary screen, however it is fuzzed out and not interactive; clicking it just goes to further back in the history, so it appears to be the window behind the active one (which doesn't appear).  So Time Machine is still unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have two screens.\r\n2. Have Finder window on primary screen.\r\n3. Active Time Machine (via Dock icon).\r\n4. Observe the black rectangle making it unusable.\r\n5. Escape out.\r\n6. Move Finder window to second screen.\r\n7. Activate Time Machine again.\r\n8. Observe unusable window.\r\n9. Escape out.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnblocked, interactive Time Machine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlocked or unresponsive, as above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A361c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTwo screens."
