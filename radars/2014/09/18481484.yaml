    description: "The published Swift grammar summary [1] has incorrect \"if\" condition rules. Xcode doesn't compile programs that can be produced using the grammar. For example:\r\n\r\nWith the following productions:\r\n\r\nif-statement → if ­if-condition ­code-block ­else-clause­_opt\r\nif-condition → expression­  declaration­\r\ndeclaration → import-declaration­\r\nimport-declaration → attributes­_opt­ import­ import-kind­_opt­ import-path­\r\n\r\nI can produce the following illegal programs (which Xcode rightly detects as illegal):\r\n\r\nif import Foundation {}\r\n\r\nor with similar rules\r\n\r\nif class {} {}\r\n\r\nand other illegal programs.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the \"declaration\" bit of the if-condition is misplaced. Only expressions and let bindings should be allowed I think.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/zzSummaryOfTheGrammar.html"
