    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling systemLayoutSizeFittingSize on a UICollectionViewCell that has layout constraints that define a valid height returns 0 for the height. The same layout works fine for regular UIViews and also works fine in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee sample code. A cell is loaded from a nib. The cell has a fixed height defined with a layout constraint. systemLayoutSizeFittingSize is called on the cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRun the sample app on an iOS 7 device or simulator and the call to the cellâ€™s systemLayoutSizeFittingSize method should return a height of 100\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe call to systemLayoutSizeFittingSize returns a height of 0.\r\n\r\n**Regression**:\r\nI filed rdar://18047251 original where this bug occurred on iOS 8 devices and simulators, but was fine (and always worked on past versions of Xcode) on iOS 7 devices and simulators.\r\n\r\nEven on Xcode 6 beta 7, this call worked on iOS 7. Now it fails."
