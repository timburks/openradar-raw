    description: "Summary:\r\nBased on the device logs, it appears that IKEv2 only supports MSCHAPv2 for EAP credentials. That's just a guess, since the documentation makes no mention of supported EAP modes. We need EAP-GTC in order to mimic the old XAuth behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure an IPSec/IKEv2 server with EAP-GTC.\r\n2. Configure an iOS 8 device with an IKEv2 VPN configuration to match.\r\n3. Try to connect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS 8 should respond to EAP-GTC requests.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIKEv2 fails. No response is sent to the server and the handshake eventually times out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 beta 5 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch (MD723LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
