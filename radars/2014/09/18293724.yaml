    description: "Summary:\r\nOur application uses a library which does not have arm-64 support.  Therefore, we build it for 32-bit architectures only.\r\n\r\nPrior to the release of the Xcode 6.0 GM seed this was not a problem.  However, when attempting to upload our new app late last night/early this morning, we received these error messages:\r\n\r\nERROR ITMS-9000: \"Invalid Binary.  The binary Zoomingo.app/Zoomingo is missing architectures [arm64].\"\r\nERROR ITMS-9000: \"Invalid Binary.  The binary Zoomingo.app/PlugIns/ZNow.appex/ZNow is missing architectures [arm64].\"\r\n\r\n(One is for our primary app and one is for our new Today View Extension.)\r\n\r\nThis is a major concern as it is preventing us from submitting our app update for iOS 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6.0 GM seed and create a new Xcode project of type iOS Application.\r\n2. Set \"Valid architectures\" for project and scheme to \"armv6 armv7 armv7s\".\r\n3. Archive the app.\r\n4. Export an IPA using Organizer > Export... > Save for iOS App Store Deployment > (select the development team) > Export\r\n4. Create a corresponding app entry in iTunes Connect, and perform all necessary steps to make it ready for upload.\r\n5. Install and launch Application Loader.\r\n6. (Splash) -> Deliver Your App -> (choose the application you created above) Next -> Choose... -> (choose the IPA you exported above) -> Send\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should upload successfully and appear in the \"Builds\" section of the pending app under iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication Loader shows an error: ERROR ITMS-9000: \"Invalid Binary.  The binary Zoomingo.app/Zoomingo is missing architectures [arm64].\"  Screenshot is attached.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9.4, Xcode 6 GM seed, Application Loader 2.9.1 (441)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are unable to use Xcode 6.0 to complete this process because we receive a \"no such appid\" error when attempting to do so.  We believe this is due to using individual developer accounts in Xcode while the Agent for iTunes Connect has a different account and set of credentials.  Our Radar on this issue is not yet filed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina MacBook Pro (15\") [MacBookPro10,1] Mid-2012, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'itms-error.tiff' was successfully uploaded."
