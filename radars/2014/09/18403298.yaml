    description: "Summary:\r\nStoring Dictionary in NSUserDefaults does nothing, after dictionary object is saved and NSUserDefaults is synchronized attempt to read stored value ends with nil. There is no key and value stored before.\r\n\r\nThis works correctly on iOS 7. Tested on iPad 3 with iOS7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached example app\r\n2. Tap \"Save YES\" // [\"a\": \"1\"] should be in user defaults\r\n3. Label should update to \"Value set to: true\" but it doesn't.\r\n\r\nLog from console is saying:\r\n\r\nregistered defaults: [a: 0]\r\nloaded: [a: 0]\r\nto be saved: [a: 1]\r\nloaded: [a: 0] /// nothing has been saved, still registered defaults are fetched\r\n\r\n4. Replace save(), read() and registerDefaults() with save_fixed(), read_fixed(), registerDefaults_fixed() - These method are using NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver to wrap Dictionary into NSData.\r\n5. Remove app from device to have clear start.\r\n6. Tap \"Save Yes\"\r\n\r\nLog from console is saying:\r\nregistered defaults: [a: 0]\r\nloaded: [a: 0]\r\nto be saved: [a: 1]\r\nloaded: [a: 1] /// Value has been saved and is readed correctly\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDictionary stored in User Defaults should be stored correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKey and value for Dictionary is not saved in NSUserDefaults\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, iOS 8, Xcode 6.0.1, Swift, OS X Mavericks 10.9.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS8-NSUserDefault-bug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nI keep this in my dropbox account.
