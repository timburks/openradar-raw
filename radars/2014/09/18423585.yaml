    description: "Summary:\r\nIn storyboard there is a view which is MPVolumeView class. It has connected all needed constraints. MoviePlayer framework is added to the project so class is recognised correctly in Storyboard. Outlet is created. Simple environment.\r\n\r\nWhen running project on iOS 7 MPVolumeView is resized and placed correctly when view is presented. But on iOS 8 the outlet is resized and placed with animation instead of showing in the correct place before view is visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run project on iOS 7 device.\r\n2. Notice that MPVolumeView is resized, placed and ready to use.\r\n3. Run project on iOS 8 device.\r\n4. Notice that MPVolumeView is resizing with animation. /// wrong behaviour\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMPVolumeView regardless of system version should be resized and placed without animation like on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMPVolumeView is resizing with animation on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1, iOS 8.0, Xcode 5.1.1 (the same on Xcode 6.0.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUI is incorrect.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, iPad 3, iPad 2.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MPVolumeViewDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n/// project available on my dropbox:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11493275/openradar/18423585.zip"
