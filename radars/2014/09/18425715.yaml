    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot change image #2 to moves with text. The option is grayed out.\r\n\r\nSee attached .pages document and image files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a pages document, or start with my text document.\r\n2. Add text\r\n3. Add images to areas where you want them to appear\r\n4. Try to change images to move with text (inline)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe images should be able to be changed to Moves with Text (inline)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome images are locked and cannot change layout position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMavericks 10.9.4, Pages 5.2.2 (1877)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSuper annoying bug that requires lots of fiddling, and copy/paste, or reinsert of figure to proceed. \r\n\r\nIt's an intermittent bug, but I hit it every time I'm working on a blog post and insert 4-5 figures.
