    description: "Summary:\r\nHad tried to download my entire music library (~2900 songs) through a playlist in Music.app which contains all of my songs, over WiFi.\r\n\r\nI had also turned off Music.app from using cellular data. \r\n\r\nA few hours later, after leaving WiFi, my phone became unable to use any sort of data. Safari wouldn't load sites, Messages would fail, etc, even with 4-5 bars of LTE connectivity and in multiple locations, and later when I got home and used another WiFi network. \r\n\r\nI needed to restart my phone to get my phone to work, and after the restart, it only worked for ~10 minutes before becoming unable to use any data again, requiring another restart.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, I noticed that my cellular usage spiked. Over the period of about 2 hours, I used nearly 2GB of LTE cellular data. Music.app's cellular usage did not increase, but Media Services under System Services accounted for all of this data use. I had manually stopped each song that was downloading, and did not see any songs in the process of downloading.\r\n\r\nI turned off iTunes Match on the device, restarted the phone several times, but couldn't break this cycle. The phone would stop allowing any internet connectivity besides apparently downloading music, even though I had stopped all song downloads and saw no in progress in the playlist. The only way I could tell this though is because Media Services continued to rise in data usage.\r\n\r\nThe only way I could stop this, besides turning on Airplane Mode, was to restore the phone from an iCloud Backup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a playlist in Music.app of several thousand songs\r\n2. Start downloading all songs on this playlist over WIFi, with Music.app toggled to off in \"Use Cellular Data for...\".\r\n3. Exit Wifi range/turn off WiFi on device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMusic should stop downloading until WiFi is available again, device should remain connected to internet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice downloaded music over cellular, became unresponsive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 64GB, Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
