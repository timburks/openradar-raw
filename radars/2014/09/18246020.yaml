    description: "When presenting a modal overtop a view controller in iOS 8, the view controller's viewDidAppear and viewDidDisappear are provided the wrong animated Bool. At the very least, it is a difference from iOS 7 and should be documented.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7, the following animated Bools were returned:\r\n\r\nOn App Launch\r\nwillAppear: NO\r\ndidAppear: NO\r\n\r\nPresent Modal\r\nwillDisappear: YES\r\ndidDisappear: YES\r\n\r\nDismiss Modal\r\nwillAppear: YES\r\ndidAppear: YES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn iOS 8, when presenting a modal, the 'did' methods are providing different animated values.\r\n\r\nOn App Launch\r\nwillAppear: NO\r\ndidAppear: NO\r\n\r\nLaunch Modal\r\nwillDisappear: YES\r\ndidDisappear: NO !!!\r\n\r\nDismiss Modal\r\nwillAppear: YES\r\ndidAppear: NO !!!"
