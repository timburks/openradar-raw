    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you reorder the share buttons in Safari on iOS 8, then relaunch the app, it does not remember your setting and resets the order to the default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n\r\n2. Enable a few share extensions or action extensions, such as 1Password, Pocket, or the default copy/paste/Twitter/Mail options\r\n\r\n3. Rearrange them either by pressing the \"More\" button and dragging the items in the list around, or by pressing and holding to move them around the actual sheet\r\n\r\n4. Quit Safari from the Application Switcher\r\n\r\n5. Start Safari again\r\n\r\n6. Bring up a share sheet\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe buttons should be in the correct order.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHoly cow, they're in the default order yet again. Somehow the application just doesn't bother to store the preferred order even though it allows me to set one. I have to reset my preferred order on every run of the app. Wow."
