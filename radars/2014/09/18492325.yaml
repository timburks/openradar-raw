    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new WebKit framework does not support subclasses of NSURLProtocol to intercept URL requests. This includes custom URL schemes used by the application.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to enable this feature within an app by calling +[WKBrowsingContextController registerSchemeForCustomProtocol:], but it is private API (and deprecated according to WebKit's project organizer). This behaviour should be available as part of the public API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload and run the attached Xcode project. It will fail with the error \"failed provisional navigation with error: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1002 \"unsupported URL\" \"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe subclass of NSURLProtocol is asked if it wants to handle requests made by the webview in it's -[NSURLProtocol canInitWithRequest:] method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subclass of NSURLProtocol is not called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur app uses a custom URL scheme to do on-the-fly decryption of local assets. It is critical that we are able to decrypt the assets if we are to migrate our app from UIWebView to WKWebView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.0 simulator with Xcode 6.0\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WebViewCustomProtocol.zip' was successfully uploaded."
