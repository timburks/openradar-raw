    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a form build with a collection view inside of a view controller which I present modally, when a keyboard is shown I set the insets to the height of the keyboard so the contents of the collection view are pushed up.\r\n\r\nHowever if you start the initial editing of any textfield contained within a cell of this collection view, then the height reported by the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification notification will be 0, no matter if you switch then to a system keyboard. Unless you then switch to system keyboard, exit view controller and come back in and start editing.\r\n\r\nHowever if the first time you edit a text view in a cell of collection view with a system keyboard first, then everything works fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate modal view controller with collection view and cell with text field inside it.\r\n\r\nEdit it with system keyboard first, its fine. go back and reenter and edit it with custom keyboard being selected by default, notification's end frame's height will be 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe end frame should be the exact size of the custom keyboard no matter what.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA frame with a height of zero from the notification.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5C and iPod Touch 5th Gen\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
