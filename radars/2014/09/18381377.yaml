    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the iOS simulator is open, and I change my VPN connection, network requests will fail with NSURLDomainError -1005 until I restart the simulator. This applies to ALL network requests in the simulator, not just those specific to my app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect Mac to Wifi\r\n2. Launch the iOS Simulator\r\n3. Open Mobile Safari and visit a http://apple.com (this is successful)\r\n4. Connect the Mac to VPN\r\n5. Attempt to refresh the webpage that is open in Mobile Safari (not successful)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the iOS Simulator would be able to support changes to the VPN connection without needing to be restarted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen attempting to refresh the page, the following error message is displayed:\r\n\r\n\"Safari cannot open the page because the network connection was lost.\"\r\n\r\nNow, do the following steps:\r\n1. Quit the iOS Simulator\r\n2. Re-open the iOS Simulator\r\n3. Lauch Mobile Safari and visit http://apple.com\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the simulator, the network connection again works as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Simulator Version 8.0 (550.1)\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A313)\r\nOS 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe that under Xcode 5, the simulator was able to handle dynamic changes to the VPN configuration without requiring a reboot.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-09-18 at 11.26.15 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
