    description: "When viewing iPhone 6+ simulator, the 25% and 75% modes are far from ideal — they result in relatively heavy blurring because of the @3x resolution. At the same time, the screen size is much too large to display at 1:1 scale, even on Retina MBP.\r\n\r\nfor viewing @3x, 33 and 67% scales would work best — the former when viewing on a @1x display, the latter on a Retina display. At those scales, the simulator would be displayed point-to-point with the host screen."
