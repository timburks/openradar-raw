        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Software update via GUI, App Store or /usr/sbin/softwareupdate
        Wait for checking until available Updates are shown.

        Expected Results:
        OS X bash Update 1.0 should show up on 10.7.5, 10.8.5 and 10.9.5.

        Actual Results:
        bash Update is not shown and not available for auto-installation.

        Regression:
        -

        Notes:
        This Update has to be pushed to all customers. Even if Apple thinks that users are not vulnerable which is not true. Apple always tells the media that OS X is so secure where in fact it is not better than any other Unix/Linux. I agree that 5-days to patch part of a critical vulnerability is astonishingly fast for Apple, but 5-days too slow.
        Please, get faster with those security updates! It's really relevant if you want to have people believe in your claims that Apple cares about security and privacy. Please act like you really mean it!

        Thanks!
