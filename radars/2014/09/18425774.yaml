    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing springs&struts (as opposed to Auto Layout) to resize UILabels in table view cells results in labels that become much too wide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new app with a table view controller.\r\n2. Turn off Size Classes and Auto Layout in the storyboard.\r\n2. In the storyboard, drag a label into the prototype cell.\r\n3. Set the springs&struts so that the label resizes with the cell.\r\n4. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label should fill up the entire width of the cell (minus padding), regardless of device screen size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label is much wider than the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0, Xcode 6.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso goes wrong for other UI components such as UITextView."
