    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you do a Spotlight search in Finder with name + file format the order makes a difference. If the format is first and then the name, then the search yields no results. If the format is second and the name first, then files are found.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a folder containing Omnigraffle files amongst files of other types\r\n2. Enter the beginning of the file name\r\n3. Space\r\n4. Enter \"Omnigraffle\"\r\n5. In the pop up choose \"Omnigraffle Format\" under Kinds\r\n6. Take note that several files appear\r\n7. remove the Spotlight search text and enter:\r\n8. \"Omnigraffle\" first and pick the format as before\r\n9. Type the beginning of the file name \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The same results should appear regardless of the order in which you specify the filter criteria\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- with the file name first and the type second you see files\r\n- with the type first and the file name second you see no files\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A361c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to do it the way that works. :-)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac 27\"\r\n\r\nAttachment: Video demonstrating the issue at http://youtu.be/TEyTtnb5I0k"
