    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading to Xcode 6, I grabbed the iOS 7.1 SDK from Xcode 5 so could target 7.1 as the base SDK. After doing this my simulators menu suddenly had duplicate entries with the identifiers appended to the names.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get the iOS 7.1 SDK from Xcode 5 (Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS7.1sdk) and move to the equivalent folder for Xcode 6.\r\n2. Open an iOS project in Xcode 6 and note the list of simulators in the dropdown menu, as shown in the attached image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExisting simulators stay as they are.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimulators are duplicated and have a lengthy identifier suffix. Removing simulators and re-adding them does not solve the issue.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9.5 (13F34)"
