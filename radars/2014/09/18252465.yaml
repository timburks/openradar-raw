    description: "Summary:\r\nAn iPad only app should only need to supply the iPad icons. However if the project uses an Asset Catalog and an Xcode archive is built the icon that is used is the iPhone App (iOS7). If that icon is not provided then the archive has no icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an iPad-only project targeting iOS 7.1.\r\n2. Provide the icon assets via the default Images.xcassets Asset Catalog.\r\n3. Fill in all six iPad icons (Settings, Spotlight, & App, all in both 1x & 2x).\r\n4. Make an archive of the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive should use the iPad app icon to represent what is archived.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe grid/circle \"no icon\" icon is used instead. Note that if you add a (otherwise superfluous) iPhone app icon to the Asset Catalog that icon will display.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHappens both with Xcode 5.1.1 & Xcode 6 beta 7 (6A280n). Testing was on OS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm doing this on a mid-2012 retina MBP (10,1) running Mavericks."
