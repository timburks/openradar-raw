    description: "Summary:\r\nOn an iPhone 6 (presumably 6 Plus as well, but not tested), the home screen may be offset incorrectly when leaving Reachability mode. This results in home screen icons being off the top edge of the screen where they can not be pressed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when entering a folder with this bug, the folder does not appear, and no apps can be launched from that folder.\r\n\r\nWhile the bug is present, there is also severe UI lag when swiping left and right between home screens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enter Reachability mode by double-tapping twice on the home button on an iPhone 6. \r\n2. Quickly double tap again to exit Reachability mode.\r\n3. In some cases, the issue will appear, although it is very hard to reproduce.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, when exiting the mode, app icons would slide up above the top edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue can be fixed by restarting the device. Simply locking the device and unlocking does noes nothing."
