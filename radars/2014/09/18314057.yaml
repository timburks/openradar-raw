    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently an apple id can only be associated with one iTunes Connect at a time. This causes an issue with the new TestFlight ability with internal testers (I assume the same for external as well). As a developer I have multiple clients and I need to be an internal tester on all of them.\r\n\r\nApple support said I would need to make multiple apple ids and then log out and in on the TestFlight app on my phone. HOWEVER, upon further investigation I do not even see the ability to logout and switch apple id accounts within the TestFlight application.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR DEVELOPERS. This makes it so that I cannot start using the TestFlight feature on many of my clients applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Associate an apple id with an iTunes Connect Account.\r\n2. Try to associate an apple id with another iTunes Connect Account.\r\n3. Receive an error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect it to work much like the Developer Portal does with the same Apple ID.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get an error and are unable to add an apple id.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes Connect Web"
