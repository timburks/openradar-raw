    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, only share extensions whose extension rules match *every single* activity item that an activity controller is configure with will show up.\r\n\r\nThis means that if an activity controller is configured with both an image and a string, a share extension that declares itself able to share only strings will *not* be displayed in the controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure a UIActivityViewController with an activity items array containing three items: a UIImage, an NSURL, and an NSString.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShare extensions that support either images *or* URLs *or* text should all show up in the activity controller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly share extensions that explicitly support images *and* URLs *and* text will show up.\r\n\r\nA workaround for this is that extension developers could use a complex predicate rule that explicitly defines the OR relationships, but I strongly believe that this should be the default behavior even without resorting to a predicate. Also, the predicate documentation is severely lacking."
