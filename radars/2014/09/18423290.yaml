    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently I have a situation where I've exported a XLIFF file from Xcode, added a single localization to it and try to import that file back to Xcode. When importing the file, I get an error dialog from Xcode with the following text:\r\n\r\n\"XLIFF id attribute missing\".\r\n\r\nNo other details are provided. Since the XLIFF file was generated by Xcode itself, all required \"id\" attributes should be there. With this error description, I don't have any way of knowing what went wrong and what to do to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6.0.1\r\n2. Create a project with English-only resources\r\n3. Export resources to a XLIFF file from Editor -> Export For Localization…\r\n4. Add a single localization, add \"target-language\" attribute\r\n5. Import XLIFF with Editor -> Import Localizations…\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. Everything is imported without errors, OR if there is something wrong with the XLIFF file, a detailed error report is produced (either in Xcode or even just in system Console)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. An error dialog is displayed with the following string:\r\n\r\n\"XLIFF id attribute missing\". No other details is given. System console doesn't give any extra details. There's no enough info for fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.0.1\r\nMac OS X 10.9.5\r\n\r\nAlso tried with the latest Xcode 6.1 beta - same problem.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
