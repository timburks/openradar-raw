    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading a binary using Application Loader, an error -9000 is returned stating \"Invalid Info.plist value. The value for NSExtensionMainStoryboard in the Info.plist of extension XXX.app/Plugins/YYY.appex is invalid. The file ZZZ.storyboardc was not found.\"\r\n\r\nThe file is there, but it's in the Base.lproj folder, not at the top level of the Contents folder.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be worked around temporarily by moving the file out of Base.lproj. This is not a viable long-term solution because that prevents you from localizing the app extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApplication Loader 3.0 (OS X)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
