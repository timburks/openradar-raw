    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I set a maskView on a UIVisualEffectView instance, which has a blur effect, it renders at the moment of setting the maskView on-screen with a scale transformation. If there are other expensive operations on main queue, this effect is more drastically visible. The latter thing shouldn't happen at all, but is perhaps a helpful information for problem discovery.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the Example App (https://github.com/mrackwitz/Radar18466755)\r\n1. Run the app on one of the specified devices.\r\n2. Press on the button \"Flicker!\"\r\n3. See what happens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhole window remains at the same size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhole window is scaled by a positive factor for a moment and then the scaling is reverted.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 6 Simulator, iPhone 6P Simulator, iPhone 6P (not tested)\r\nThis bug is specific to the \"classic\" resolution (involving UIClassicWindow) on iPhone 6 / iPhone 6P."
