    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using a storyboard instead of a Default.png for my launch screen. I've added a UIImageView to this storyboard. The image is available in @2x and @3x.\r\n\r\nI noticed that even on an iPhone 6, the @3x artwork is used. Later when the app is launched, the @2x artwork is normally used in the UI. Depending on the artwork this leads to a noticeable glitch when the real UI takes over from the launch screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse a storyboard launch screen and add an image view. Provide the image in @2x and @3x. Run the app on an iPhone 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n@2x image is used in launch screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n@3x image is used in launch screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
