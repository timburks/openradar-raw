    description: "Summary:\r\nA swift file in an iOS 8 Framework target can only access Objective-C types which are included in the public umbrella file for the framework.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic if the swift code you are writing needs to interact with internal-only classes/functions/methods, as they would need to become part of the public API for the framework.\r\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that bridging headers are not allowed in framework targets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project file.\r\n\r\nLaunch it using the XCode 6 GM, and build. Compilation will fail. Open the file 'LookHere.swift' and follow the directions there.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere to be a way of accessing internal-only code from a swift source file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompilation fails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 6 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SwiftFrameworkPrivates.zip' was successfully uploaded."
