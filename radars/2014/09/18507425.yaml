    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a Mac running Yosemite with a non volume output setup (digital out, etc) the prohibit symbol is displayed normally. Previously this appeared in a way that did not clash with the volume adjustment chiclets themselves.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe prohibit icon is under the volume chiclets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVisually consistent and rational layout of bezel objects.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10 Beta (14A361p) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro10,2\r\nScreen Shot 2014-09-30 at 3.19.43 PM.png - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-09-30 at 3.19.43 PM.png' and 'MacBook Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded."
