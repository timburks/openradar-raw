    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a fetch request with NSFetchedResultsController, if returnsObjectsAsFaults is set to NO, faults are still returns as results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an application using a NSFetchedResultsController. An application created with the Xcode template \"master-detail application\" will work if \"Uses core data\" is checked.\r\n2. Set returnsObjectsAsFaults to NO on the fetch request: [fetchRequest setReturnsObjectsAsFaults:NO]\r\n3. Perform the fetch using performFetch:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the fetch request has setReturnsObjectsAsFaults set to NO, faults should not be returned.\r\nWhen the fetch request ALSO has fetchBatchSize set, only those objects that have been batch fetched should not be faults.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEverything is a fault. NSFetchedResultsController seems to fetch using NSManagedObjectIDResultType (regardless of the result type set on the original fetch request), and does not perform batch faulting on top of those results to satisfy the requirements of the developer provided fetch request. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe this worked in iOS 5, but I may be incorrect.\r\n\r\nIt appears this has been reported before, but I no radar number that this may be duplicating. \r\n\r\nThis forums thread describes the problem as well:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/177752\r\n\r\nThough in that case it is not specific to NSFetchedResultsController.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
