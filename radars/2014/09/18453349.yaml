    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a rule has a Date sent or Date received criteria, the value of \"days old\" is saved properly, however when the rule is edited again the UI always displays the \"days old\" value as 7 and will over write the value in the rules prefs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a rule with a criteria using either \"Date sent\" or \"Date received\"\r\n2. Change the \"days old\" field to something other than 7 (either fewer or more days)\r\n3. Save the rule and close it.\r\n4. Validate that the correct criteria value was written to rules prefs if you like.\r\n5. Edit the rule.\r\n6. Look at the \"days old\" value!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat \"days old\" value should be the same as what you changed it to in step 2 (not 7).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhenever you edit the rule, the value is redisplayed as \"7\" \"days old\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 8.0 (1985.4)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A361c)\r\n\r\nIt has been seen on older versions of 10.10 as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on many different configurations.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
