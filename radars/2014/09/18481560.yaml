    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the new iOS8 UIPopoverPresentationController approach to presenting popovers, I experienced a situation (easy to repeat in my codebase) where tapping once in the dimming region to dismiss the popover works, but performing a double tap not only dismissed the popover, it triggered a dismissal on the parent view controller defining the presentation context.\r\n\r\nIn my situation, I have a container view controller that comes on screen in stock modal fashion. It is a container for several child view controllers, one of which uses the UIPopoverPresentationController approach to present a popover.\r\n\r\nThe child view controller that requests the presentation of the view controller configured for UIModalPresentationPopover style never received a dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion: call, but its parent view controller (show in the debug screenshot attached) does.\r\n\r\nIt seems like without a UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate defined that implements the delegate method 'popoverPresentationControllerShouldDismissPopover:', your internal/private method 'dimmingViewWasTapped:' is jumping to the presentation context controller and invoking 'dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:' on it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee code snippet example here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26085641/535054, used in conjunction with the view controller hierarchy described in the Description section above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the popover to dismiss, but no other side effects, from a double tap on the dimming view setup by the popover's presentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popover is dismissed, and the presenting view controller is also dismissed!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n Xcode 6.0.1 (6A317), iOS8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy workaround posted on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26085641/535054\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n iPad Air simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Dimming_View_Tapped_is_telling_the_last_modal_presentation_to_dismiss.png' was successfully uploaded.
