    description: "Summary:\r\nBy default Xcode creates unwind segues without an identifier. The identifier does not exist, it is not an empty string. (Which would fix the problem)\r\n\r\nIt looks like this in a storyboard: \r\n<segue destination=\"foo\" kind=\"unwind\" unwindAction=\"unwind:\" id=\"bar\"/>\r\n\r\nWhen using Objective-C this is not a problem, the identifier is nil if you access it. \r\nSwift declares the identifier as non-optional. So when you try to access it the app will crash. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis poses a serious problem if you want to use an unwind segue from a view controller that implements prepareForSegue. \r\n\r\nThe workaround is easy. In Xcode put a character into the identifier field of the unwind segue and remove it. The identifier of the segue will be an empty string, which is not nil. \r\n\r\nThis looks like this in storyboard:\r\n\r\n<segue destination=\"foo\" kind=\"unwind\" identifier=\"\" unwindAction=\"unwind:\" id=\"bar\"/>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. run attached project. \r\n2. push view controller\r\n3. try non crashing unwind segue (the workaround was applied)\r\n4. push view controller\r\n5. try crashing unwind segue (the default that was created by Xcode)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot crashing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM + Xcode 6.0 (6A313)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs mentioned, the solution is trivial. Attach an empty string segue identifier when a unwind segue is created. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator etc\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UnwindBugDemo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
