    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter you put an app into the background, you will eventually see \"ReportCrash [pid] <bundle_id> failed to scene-update in time\" be logged in the device console.\r\n\r\nWhen you resume the app, you may see an old snapshot of the application state briefly before being returned to the home screen (because the app crashed). Or you may see the app's launch image (because the app is relaunching).\r\n\r\nThe only way to get out of this state is to restart the device.\r\n\r\nNote that no crash report is included because this event does not generate one. And restarting the device (to clear the issue) causes the contents of the device console to be cleared.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPut app in background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nNote: The app that caused this problem was installed with the new TestFlight app."
