    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing an ampersand character (&) in company name when setting up an iOS 8 project with Xcode 6 makes the project un-buildable. Even without adding any code or user interface elements, the build fails with \"/LaunchScreen.xib: error: Line 14: xmlParseEntityRef: no name\", followed by \"The file “LaunchScreen-PartialInfo.plist” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project, specifying a company name that uses an ampersand character (eg, \"Steve & Steve Apple Company\").\r\n\r\n2. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmpty project should build\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo build errors:\r\n/* com.apple.ibtool.errors */\r\n/Users/cadamson/dev/apple-buglets/AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet/AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.xib: error: Line 14: xmlParseEntityRef: no name\r\n\r\nerror: could not read data from '/Users/cadamson/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet-aiphsubeiyokgtekzcoirlfoskbu/Build/Intermediates/AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet.build/LaunchScreen-PartialInfo.plist': The file “LaunchScreen-PartialInfo.plist” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you attempt to view LaunchScreen.xib, you get a sheet with the error \"Line 14: xmlParseEntityRef: no name\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A313), OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: view LaunchScreen.xib as source, go down to line 14 (the <label>) tag, and replace ampersand in the \"text\" attribute with \"and\". The .xib will now be able to be edited with Interface Builder and the project will build.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac Pro early 2008 with Xcode GM is the only thing I've tried this on.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AmpersandInCompanyNameBuglet.zip' was successfully uploaded."
