    description: "There are so many places where OS X won't store my Apple ID in the keychain.  (I've reported this before for specific cases.)  iTunes store keeps asking me to type in my password; when I log into 10.9 \"Mavericks\" or 10.10 \"Yosemite\" I am prompted for both my iCloud Apple ID and the Apple ID I use for my Messages account.  Sometimes more than once.\r\n\r\nPeople, if you want your users to use strong passwords, why are you requiring us to type in passwords all the time, rather than letting them reside securely in your own secure keychain?\r\n\r\nMaybe if people weren't asked to type in their apple ID password all the time, they wouldn't use such weak, easy-to-guess passwords that end up getting breached and leaked."
