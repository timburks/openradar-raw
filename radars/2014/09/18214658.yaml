    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen rotating a share extension with the keyboard visible, multiple keyboardWillShow/DidShow notifications get dispatched. Sometimes the end frame value is reported improperly. This is mostly seen when rotating from portrait to landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a share extension that has text input in portrait orientation\r\n2. Rotat to landscape while the keyboard is up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nValues from keyboard notification correctly display the size of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nValues from the keyboard notifications sometimes to not reflect the correct size of the keyboard\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 64GB AT&T\r\n\r\nPlease run the attached sample project, go to safari, share to the extension in portrait, then rotate. You will see the keyboard move completely off the screen. This seems to be related apps that have been previously portrait only being rotated. The extension framework does not properly handle interface orientations specified by the view controllers presented.\r\n'awesome.zip' was successfully uploaded."
