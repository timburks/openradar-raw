    description: "Although Avenir Next supports opentype's C2SC and SMCP features (via querying with CTFontCopyFeatures) kLowerCaseType and kUpperCaseType and setting those features with selectors kLowerCaseSmallCapsSelector, when creating a fontdescriptor that has those features set on a weight of avenir, the features are discarded.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, setting those features on a third-party font (Nadyezhda SL One, for example, although also tested with proxima nova as well) that reports the same features available, succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism for setting the features seems ok, but the version of avenir next bundled with ios seems broken, preventing the feature from working even though the glyphs and features appear available on the font.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsimilar to osx behavior in textedit, would expect avenir next to activate the small cap feature.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe features are discarded on the font descriptor and avenir remains lowercase\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 11D167"
