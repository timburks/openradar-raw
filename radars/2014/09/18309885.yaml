    description: "Henry Stratmann11-Sep-2014 03:06 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA photo captured with the UIImagePickerController cannot be saved if the user backgrounds then foregrounds the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the UIImagePickerController in photo capture mode.\r\n2. Capture a photo (you should then see the \"Retake\" and \"Use Photo\" options).\r\n3. Background the app (hit the home button).\r\n4. Now foreground the app.\r\n5. Observer the photo taken is still on screen, but the \"Retake\" and \"Use Photo\" options have been replaced with \"Cancel\" and capture photo button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter reentering the app, the UIImagePickerController should continue to display the \"Retake\" and \"Use Photo\" options.\r\n\r\nIf Apple has decided that the new behavior is indeed to discard the previous photo captured, then the live preview should be shown again alongside the \"Cancel\" and capture photo button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter reentering the app, the UIImagePickerController displays the \"Cancel\" and capture photo button as well as the previously taken photo.  Because the previously taken photo is still displayed, you cannot see a live preview anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3 32GB, using WiFi"
