    description: "Summary:\r\nImport/export to/from a document picker extension works, if the document picker extension is backed by a file provider extension. However, if there is no file provider, then often (but not always), import/export will fail with an alert view with the following:\r\n\r\nFailed to make file available\r\nThe file could not be made available to the application. (The operation couldn't be completed. (BRCloudDocsErrorDomain error 10.))\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that contains both a document picker and file provider.\r\n2. Use the same app or a different app to choose a file from the document picker.\r\n3. Now delete the file provider completely from the app, and recompile and reinstall it.\r\n4. Use the same app or a different app to choose a file from the document picker.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. The file is successfully chosen and passed back to the host app.\r\n4. The file is successfully chosen and passed back to the host app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. The file is successfully chosen and passed back to the host app.\r\n4. The file is occasionally (but rarely) successfully chosen and passed back to the host app. Usually, a modal alert view is displayed:\r\n\r\nFailed to make file available\r\nThe file could not be made available to the application. (The operation couldn't be completed. (BRCloudDocsErrorDomain error 10.))\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad and iPhone device and simulators"
