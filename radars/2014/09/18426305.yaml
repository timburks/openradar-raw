    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using CGImageCreateWithImageInRect() to tile a massive image (e.g. 16,000x9,000px). This has worked nicely in the past, since this function hasn't attempted to decode the entire image.\r\n\r\nHowever, on an iPhone 6 the device now runs out of memory when using this approach. Please note that the exact same code, on an iPhone 5 or iPad mini (1st gen), both running iOS 8, works flawlessly. This is especially interesting since the iPad mini has only half the RAM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached example project\r\n2. Run the example on an iPhone 5 or iPad mini running iOS 8\r\n3. Keep an eye on the memory gauge\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The output \"Tiling...\" appears in the console\r\n2. The output \"Tiling complete. Data length: 72806\" (data length may vary)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The output \"Tiling...\" appears in the console\r\n2. The device hangs and/or crashes, presumably because the device runs out of memory\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDevices that passed the test: iPhone 5, iOS 8 (12A365), 16GB and iPad mini, iOS 8 (12A365), 16GB\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImageTiling.zip' was successfully uploaded.
