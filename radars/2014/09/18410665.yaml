    description: "NSViewControllers (and NSWindowControllers for that matter) should have a storyboard identifier property.\r\n\r\nThis is very useful in some situations, for example when multiple VCs/scenes in the storyboard have the same class â€” a storyboardIdentifier property would make it easy to distinguish between them in code."
