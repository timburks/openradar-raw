    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the new version of ItunesConnect released today, when I upload a build that has not the same version number as the one that I introduced in ItunesConnect, the binary is marked as invalid in ITC, with a yellow warning sign. The problem is that there is nowhere to be found an explanation of why the binary is invalid. \r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, previously, this type of error was reported directly in the upload tool of xcode. This should come back, or the error should be shown on the site.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app version 3.12\r\n2. Fill all the forms to submit this app in Itunes Connect while giving version number 3.11 in those forms. \r\n3. Upload the app to ITC\r\n4. The binary is marked as invalid, but no explanation is given. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome message in IT explaining why the binary is invalid.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
