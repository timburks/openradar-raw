        Summary:
        I am not able to use my existing Apple ID in multiple iTunes Connect teams.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to add existing Apple ID to another iTunes Account team.

        Expected Results:
        The Apple ID will be associated with another team. I could switch between team same as between multiple developer teams.

        Actual Results:
        I am not able to add Apple ID which is already associated with another iTunes Connect. I have to always create a new Apple ID for every team I have to work with.
