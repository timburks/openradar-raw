    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a lot of VPN payloads installed, it can take a long time (measurable in seconds to tens of seconds) to display the VPN list when going to the Settings app and tapping VPN.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single configuration profile with many (say, 10) VPN payloads.\r\n2. Install the profile\r\n3. Open the Settings app\r\n4. Tap VPN to get the list of VPNs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list appears immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a long delay before the list finally shows up\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis can be frustrating for enterprise customers with complex VPN configurations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s (ME311LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
