    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen executing the following (also attached as file) playground it will call drawRect many times until it crashes. \r\n\r\nimport UIKit\r\nimport XCPlayground\r\n\r\nclass CustomView : UIView\r\n{\r\n    override func drawRect(rect: CGRect)\r\n    {\r\n        // this works (as drawing code does as well)\r\n        println(3)\r\n\r\n        // This will call the method very often until it crashes\r\n        self.aMethodWithInt(4)\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func aMethod()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func aMethodWithInt(aInt: Int)\r\n    {\r\n        println(aInt)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet view = CustomView(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 800, 400))\r\n\r\n// The method itself works fine\r\nview.aMethodWithInt(6)\r\n\r\nXCPShowView(\"graph\", view)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the playground\r\n2. wait until it crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ndrawRect should be called once per execution. That would enable to use sub methods to playing around with drawRect implementation. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncrash\r\n\r\nPlayGroundDrawRectBug.playground/: error: Playground execution aborted: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7fff514606e8).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta7 (6A280n)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2012), OS X Yosemite 10.10 preview 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PlaygroundDrawRectBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
