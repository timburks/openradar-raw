    description: "I got an iPhone 6 Plus yesterday, and my wife got a 6. Last night we plugged them in, and noticed TouchID wouldn’t work. It didn’t even see the finger, not a failed read, it was as if there was no finger.\r\n\r\nWe worked out today that the TouchID sensor is “blind” on both our phones, but only when power is coming via the lightning port. It is blind when connected to my MacBook Pro, or the charger it came with, or an old charger - but NOT blind with the cable plugged in but the charger unplugged from the wall.\r\n\r\nI asked on forums and no one else was having this issue.\r\n\r\nI tried erasing all data and setting up again, even during setup the sensor is blind, so it’s not the restored iCloud backups…\r\n\r\nEventually I tried something odd for want of another step. I removed my case. We both have midnight blue leather offical Apple cases. As soon as the case is off, the TouchID sensor works when the phone is charging. Put the case back on, the sensor is blind.\r\n\r\nPeople with the black leather case are not having this issue. But I have here an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus both of which have TouchID sensors which are “blind” when in a midnight blue Apple case and charging. It’s a very specific combination. But it’s real.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet iPhone 6 / 6 Plus\r\n\r\nPut in official Apple midnight blue leather case\r\n\r\nPlug in lightning cable connected to UK charger / MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nPlug UK charger into wall / turn MacBook Pro on\r\n\r\nObserve phone is charging\r\n\r\nTHEN\r\n\r\nLock phone\r\n\r\nAttempt to unlock phone with TouchID\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nGo into TouchID settings\r\n\r\nAttempt to enrol new finger\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPhone should unlock\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nNew finger should enrol\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone acts as if no finger present on TouchID sensor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6 and 6 Plus UK model 128GB\r\n\r\niOS 8 as shipped\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving case solves problem.\r\n\r\nI am told on forums that other colours of case work\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and 6 Plus 128GB in Midnight Blue Apple leather cases.\r\n\r\n6 is silver, 6 Plus is gold."
