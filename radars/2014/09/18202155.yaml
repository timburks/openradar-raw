    description: "Summary:\r\nAt the moment, the order of function overloads and operator definitions in the generated header of the Swift std lib seems inconsistent and non-deterministic. Overloads get shuffled every time a new beta comes out, which makes it hard to diff it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDiff the generated header of Swift stdlib between two beta seeds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can clearly see what changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual changes are hidden underneath a lot of noise â€” functions getting reordered erratically for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nCase in point: https://github.com/radex/swift_stdlib/compare/beta6...beta7.diff\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nxcode 6 beta 7"
