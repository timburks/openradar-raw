    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using NSFetchedResultsController and an NSFetchRequest that includes a fetchBatchSize value, the value is ignored when using the NSSQLiteStoreType and a child context. If the context is the root context (i.e. it has no parent context), this works as intended.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an application that uses NSFetchedResultsController with nested contexts.\r\n2. Have the NSFetchedResultsController use a child context.\r\n3. Set a fetchBatchSize value on the fetch request, no sectionNameKeyPath\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nResults should be fetched fetchBatchSize objects at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEntire result set is fetched at once. Enabling SQLDebug reveals that when a child context is used, the generated SQL does not include LIMIT.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a file with a comparison of the SQLDebug = 3 output when using the root context (working) vs. a child context (not working )\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sqldebug.txt' was successfully uploaded."
