    description: "Summary:\r\nYesterday I submitted an app for review and it changed state to In Review in the same day. Today I wanted to try uploading an App Preview video, so I removed the app from review, uploaded the video, saved my changes, and then tried submitting for review again. \r\n\r\nWhen I do this, I get the error message, \"You must submit your builds using Xcode 5.1.1 or later, or Application Loader 2.9.1 or later. After you’ve submitted a build, select it in the Builds section below.\" I have already uploaded a build with Xcode and selected it in the Builds section of the app in iTunes Connect. I cannot submit my app to review because of this error.\r\n\r\nApp name: Duolingo - Learn Languages for Free\r\nApp ID #: 570060128\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prepare an app for app store submission.\r\n2. Submit the app to review.\r\n3. Remove the app from review.\r\n4. Click on the Submit for Review button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be submitted for review again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message saying \"You must submit your builds using Xcode 5.1.1 or later, or Application Loader 2.9.1 or later. After you’ve submitted a build, select it in the Builds section below.\" appears, despite a build being selected in the Builds section.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0 on OS X Yosemite Beta 10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
