    description: "Summary:\r\nVersions: Xcode: Version 6.0 (6A280e), OS X: 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nThe Swift, non-storyboard, document-based application template does not produce apps that function immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall and open Xcode 6A280e under OS X 10.10 (14A298i).\r\n\r\nCreate a new Cocoa Application.\r\nEnter Any Product Name, Organization Name, Organization Identifier.\r\nSelect Swift as the language.\r\nUncheck “Use Storyboards”.\r\nCheck “Create Document-Based Application”.\r\nEnter any Document Extension.\r\nUncheck “Use Core Data”.\r\n\r\nCreate the project in an auspicious location on disk.\r\n\r\n(Alternatively: download the attached Demo.zip, extract its contents, and open the enclosed Xcode project.)\r\n\r\nRun the app.\r\n\r\nYou will see an alert with the text “No document could be created.\r\n\r\nYou will see in the console <<2014-09-01 16:35:22.463 Demo[39748:12877248] The DocumentType type doesn't map to any NSDocumentClass.>>\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new Document window should appear when the app launches for the first time or whenever you select \"File\"->\"New\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the app launches for the first time, and thereafter whenever you select \"File\"->\"New\", an alert is presented with the text \"No document could be created.\" and into the console is logged \"The DocumentType type doesn't map to any NSDocumentClass.\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: Version 6.0 (6A280e)\r\nOS X: 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are a couple of workarounds:\r\n\r\n(1)  Override readableTypes() in Document.swift:\r\n\r\n    override class func readableTypes() -> [AnyObject] {\r\n        return [\"DocumentType\"]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(2)  In the Info.plist, change the entry for \"Document Types\"->\"Item 0\"->\"Cocoa NSDocument Class\" to the mangled version of \"$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).Document\" (for example \"_TtC4Demo8Document\").\r\n\r\nIt looks like the immediate cause of the bug is in the implementation of -[NSDocumentController _getReadableNotWritable:types:forDocumentClass:] where the unmangled \"Demo.Document\" is compared via isEqualToString: to the mangled \"_TtC4Demo8Document\" with predictable results.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Demo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
