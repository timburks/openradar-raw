        Summary:
        Since iOS 8 the developer can upload a preview video to his app. The Transporter tool does not support these videos so it’s impossible to upload videos with the metadata for the new devices.

        At least the metadata documentation on iTunes Connect says so.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the metadata documentation for the Transporter tool for iTunes Connect (found here: https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/resources/download/AppMetadataSpecification/pdf) and look after video upload. It’s not in there.


        Expected Results:
        It’s possible to upload preview videos.


        Actual Results:
        It’s not  possible to upload preview videos.


        Regression:
