    description: "Summary:\r\nBuild setting variables are not expanded by the agvtool and thus it breaks when there is a variable in the INFOPLIST_FILE build setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Edit the INFOPLIST_FILE build setting for any target in an Xcode project\r\n- Insert a valid build setting variable such as PROJECT_NAME like so:\r\n     $(PROJECT_NAME)/Supporting Files/Info.plist\r\n- Open Terminal and cd to the root folder of the project\r\n- Execute the command: agvtool what-marketing-version\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current CFBundleShortVersionString value should be output in quotes, like the “1.0” shown in the last line below.\r\n\r\n    $ agvtool what-marketing-version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \r\n    No marketing version number (CFBundleShortVersionString) found for Jambase targets.\r\n\r\n    Looking for marketing version in native targets...\r\n    Looking for marketing version (CFBundleShortVersionString) in native targets...\r\n\r\n    Found CFBundleShortVersionString of \"1.0\" in \"it-policy-2014.xcodeproj/../it-policy-2014/Supporting Files/Info.plist\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the actual contents of the INFOPLIST_FILE build setting is echoed, followed by a “Cannot find …” message.\r\n\r\n    $ agvtool what-marketing-version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \r\n    No marketing version number (CFBundleShortVersionString) found for Jambase targets.\r\n\r\n    Looking for marketing version in native targets...\r\n    Looking for marketing version (CFBundleShortVersionString) in native targets...\r\n\r\n    $(PROJECT_NAME)/Supporting Files/Info.plist\r\n    Cannot find \"$(PROJECT_NAME)/Supporting Files/Info.plist\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been an issue for at least a couple years. I believe I first noticed it on Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding the -terse flag suppresses the “Cannot find…” message and simply outputs the value of INFOPLIST_FILE\r\n    $ agvtool what-marketing-version -terse\r\n    $(PROJECT_NAME)/Supporting Files/Info.plist"
