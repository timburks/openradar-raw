    description: While it is nice that the new iTunes Connect has a (partly) localized UI now, it is unfavorable that one cannot freely select the language of choice. When working with international teams there isn't any way now to know how for example "reject developer binary" is called in other team members' languages, so it is hard to refer precisely to certain iTunes Connect items and international communication is made harder.
