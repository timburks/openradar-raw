    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen rotating an iPad from Landscape left to Landscape Right, or from Portrait to Portrait Upside Down, the contents of the status bar visibly race ahead of the rest of the content, completing 1.5 rotations while the rest of the views do only .5 rotations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.app on an iPad running iOS 8 beta 5.\r\n2. Turn the iPad so it is in landscape orientation with the home button on the left.\r\n3. Tilt the iPad so that it changes directly to landscape orientation with the home button on the right, without passing through either portrait orientation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status bar rotates smoothly along with the rest of the current app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe status bar races ahead, so that it is moving too fast to see during most of the transition, but you can see it fall into place at the last second.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReproducible in Mail, Safari, Clock, Notes, and the latest 1Password beta for iOS 8. Not reproducible in Springboard, Fantastical, or the WWDC app for iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini with Retina display\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nVideo recording: http://cl.ly/XSZh"
