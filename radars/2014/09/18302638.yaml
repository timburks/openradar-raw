    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen accessibility zooming using ctrl+scroll wheel, the zoom is very slow when just using my internal display on my MBR13\". With an external 27\" Apple Thunderbolt display, the zoom is so bad that it goes from about a frame a second during the first part of the animation, to a frame per minute towards the end. It's so bad that I can't even stop it, and all UI is unresponsive during this transition, and I end up having to reboot my computer to regain access.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have gotten worse with each beta: in beta 1 I could at least zoom back out over a minute or so and use my computer again, but now it's completely broken. I really like the zoom feature, so I hope you can fix it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a 27\" Apple display to a MacBook Pro 13\" (the one with HD4000)\r\n2. Hold down ctrl and scroll up to zoom in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Look at the thing you wanted to study in detail\r\n4. Zoom back out with ctrl-scroll down\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Panic as all UI stutters to a halt and you're stuck in watching the slowest zoom-in animation ever\r\n4. Reboot the computer to regain access\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A343f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe zoom is at least usable without an external display connected."
