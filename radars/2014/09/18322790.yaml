    description: "Summary:\r\nMKMapView, if partially behind a nav bar, will factor that in when setting a map rect. This makes it so that the visible portion of the map (the potion not covered) displays the full map rect being set. I have a complex layout with animations, and this undocumented functionality is breaking functionality. I want to adjust the layout using edgePadding manually, and not have this automatic behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a MKMapView and add it to a view controller in a UINavigationController. The map view should be be placed so that the top portion is completely under the nav bar.\r\n2. Set the visibleMapRect to a known area\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe known area takes up the entire map, including under the nav bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe known area is covered in the portion of the map not under the nav bar. The portion of the map under the nav bar as a result shows the area north of the known area.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM"
