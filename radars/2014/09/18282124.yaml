    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an iTunes Match library (with some songs downloaded on device), artworks are taking a lot of times to display, and some of them aren't available at a specific size (smaller ones it seems)\r\nTo avoid a lot of memory usage, I query a lot of thumbnail artworks from my library, and display bigger sizes later (when a track is playing for exemple).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the project I attached\r\n2. Run the App on an iOS device which has a fresh iTunes Match library on it\r\n3. The app enumerates all your Albums and calls -representativeItem on each of them\r\n4. The app displays 3 imageViews on screen with 3 different sizes (80, 120, 280)\r\n5. Once the app founds out that an artwork couldn't be found for a specific size, but is available for the other sizes, it stops and pops an alert with more informations about the track MPMediaItemArtwork failed to retrieve the artwork at a specific size. \r\n\r\n(if no alert is being displayed at the end of albums enumeration, there is no error)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMPMediaItemArtwork should provide an artwork for every sizes (if there's at least one-sized artwork, of course).\r\nIf no artwork available for a specific size, should return a greater or lower artwork instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMPMediaItemArtwork does not return artworks for smaller sizes (sometimes)\r\nMy app failed at the first album. The 80*80 and 120*120 artworks couldn't be retrieved\r\n\r\nSample Project: http://cl.ly/0B1V3R3u1K39/ArtworkTesting.zip"
