    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen my iPad is sitting idly and someone nearby says \"In Theory\", Siri fairly consistently recognizes it as a request for Siri to do something.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an iOS 8 device active and say \"In theory\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri activates to capture the speech after that and attempt to process the info.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing should happen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that I noticed this first when I was listening to the ATP podcast and John Siracusa said \"in theory\" on the podcast in a speaker near the iPad and that was enough to activate it. This is what you see in the attached video.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3 with 64 GB installed\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Siri likes John.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
