    description: "Currently, there is no system-wide feature to allow a dark mode. A universal low-contrast mode would be useful at nighttime, and for people who with certain vision issues (http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/dark-mode-as-accessibility-feature), as a high contrast white background can incredibly frustrating to use.\r\n\r\nThe inverted colors is not a good solution â€” colors in photographs and UI lose meaning.\r\n\r\nIn addition, inverting colors is not easily accessible, even when triple tapping a home button, which requires the user to dig through the settings app to activate.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a system-wide switch that turns on dark mode permanently (like a more global Yosemite-style dark mode), or in situations when the screen brightness drops below a certain level."
