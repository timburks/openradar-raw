    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a folder on a remote (AFP-mounted) share in my Finder sidebar; in recent versions of Mavericks and when the AFP share is not mounted this causes Finder to hang in certain curcumstances when the first window of the application is loaded and when focus returns to the application after a period of being hidden in the background. Previous versions of OS X (and I believe previous versions of Mavericks) did not exhibit this behaviour.\r\n\r\nConfirmed on 10.9.4 and 10.9.5. I have attached a dtruss trace of Finder while this behaviour was occurring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mount an AFP share\r\n2. Choose a folder inside the share\r\n3. Drag the folder into the Finder sidebar\r\n4. Unmount the AFP share\r\n5. Close all Finder windows\r\n6. Click on Finder in the dock\r\n\r\nOR\r\nFollow steps 1-4\r\n5. Move to another window\r\n6. Wait for some time\r\n7. Return to Finder by clicking on the window in the background\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA Finder window should appear immediately (or, in the second example, should regain focus immediately)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder hangs for a few seconds and then becomes responsive again\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5 13F34\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a dtruss log (with arguments -acs) showing the system calls made by Finder during a reproduction of this bug (this dtruss log is from 10.9.4).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'dtruss-all-slow-to-load.txt' was successfully uploaded."
