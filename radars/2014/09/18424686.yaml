    description: "Summary:\nThe status bar area of the menu bar is not updated after the  cog displayed in the menu bar status area when a NSAppleScript is executed in the background disappears, leaving a gap until the user switches apps or uses Exposé functions.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Automator\n2. Choose to create a service\n3. Insert a single “Run AppleScript” component\n4. paste in the following example code:\n\ntell application \"Mail\"\r\tmy markMailboxAsRead(get selected mailboxes of message viewer 1)\rend tell\r\ron markMailboxAsRead(targetMailbox)\r\ttell application \"Mail\"\r\t\trepeat with theMailbox in targetMailbox\r\t\t\tset unreadMessages to (every message of theMailbox whose read status is false)\r\t\t\trepeat with aMessage in unreadMessages\r\t\t\t\tset read status of aMessage to true\r\t\t\tend repeat\r\t\t\trepeat with subMailbox in every mailbox of theMailbox\r\t\t\t\tmy markMailboxAsRead(subMailbox)\r\t\t\tend repeat\r\t\tend repeat\r\tend tell\rend markMailboxAsRead\n\n5. save the service\n6. open System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts\n7. assign a hotkey to the newly created service (ex. Ctrl-Cmd-u)\n8. close System Preferences\n9. open Mail.app\n10. navigate to a mail folder\n11. watch the status bar area of the menu bar\n12. press the hotkey defined in 7.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe script cog appears in the status area, spins, then disappears, leaving the status area in its previous state.\n\nActual Results:\nThe script cog appears in the status area, spins, then disappears, leaving a gap in the status area at its position.\n\nNotes:\nBehavior is not dependent on target application, script code or script host application (it’s identical with NSAppleScript based Alfred workflows, for instance)."
