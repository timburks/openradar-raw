    description: "Summary:\r\nSample project attached.\r\n\r\nIf a UIImage loaded from the assets catalog has horizontal stretching/tiling with more than 1 pixel, the UIImageView will not respect it's constraints\r\n\r\nSeems to be a pretty major issue as it renders slicing useless\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an image to the catalog, add horizontal slicing, more than 1 pixel width\r\n2. Create an UIImageView in a storyboard, assign a fixed width and height constraint\r\n3. Assign the image to the imageView\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe imageView will have the size enforced by the constraints\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe imageView is bigger\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device"
