    description: "Summary:\r\nThe published Swift grammar summary [1] has incorrect \"for ... in\" loop rules. Xcode doesn't compile programs that can be produced using the grammar. For example:\r\n\r\nWith the following productions:\r\n\r\nfor-in-statement → for ­pattern­ in ­expression ­code-block­\r\npattern → value-binding-pattern­\r\nvalue-binding-pattern → var­ pattern­ | let ­pattern­\r\n\r\nI can produce the following illegal programs (which Xcode rightly detects as illegal):\r\n\r\nfor var () in [] {}\r\n\r\nThe for-in loop doesn't accept a \"value-binding-pattern\".\r\n\r\nOn top, the \"value-binding-pattern\" shouldn't be recursive because that would make even less sense:\r\n\r\nfor var let var let var let () in [] {}\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/zzSummaryOfTheGrammar.html"
