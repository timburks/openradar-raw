    description: "Summary:\r\nThe selectedImage property on a tab bar item is replaced with a default blue color image after a modal view has been presented and dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n01. Create a new storyboard\r\n02. In the Storyboard, create a Tab Bar Controller with two child view controllers\r\n03. In the Storyboard, set an image on the TabBar Item of the first child view controller\r\n04. In the Storyboard, place a button inside the first child view controller's view\r\n05. In the Storyboard, drag another view controller to an empty space, and add a button to its view\r\n06. In the Storyboard, ctrl-drag the button on the first child view controller's view to the First Child View Controller class, and create an IBAction.\r\n07. In the Storyboard, ctrl-drag the button on the last view controller added, to create an IBAction\r\n08. In the first child view controller viewDidLoad method, set the tab bar item selectedImage to another image\r\n09. In the first child view controller IBAction method, perform a segue to modally present the last view controller added to the Storyboard\r\n10. In the last view controller IBAction method, call the dismissViewController method.\r\n11. Launch the app in the Simulator or on the Device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter dismissing the modally presented view controller, the same selectedImage should be present at the currently selected tab bar item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter dismissing the modally presented view controller, the selectedImage is replaced with a blue color.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 [12A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attachment contains three images that show the initial state of the selectedImage, the modally presented view and the final state of the selectedImage after dismissing the modal view.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 16GB"
