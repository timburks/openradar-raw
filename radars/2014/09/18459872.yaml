        Summary:
        When viewing build settings, I want to be able to see what the resolved value of the build settings are, with $(inherited) and other's final value without it being cropped in the UI. Some way to see it via tooltip/quicklook/inspector would be great. The only way to see it is in the build settings view which is usually too narrow for some settings even if you try to enlarge the columns.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set a lot of defines in preprocessor macros
        2. Attempt to see all them without editing(editing won't show you $(inherited)'s value or similar


        Expected Results:
        Be able to hover over build setting, or inspect, or tooltip to see what the value of the setting is once fully resolved and without being cropped.

        Actual Results:
        Can only see partial value of setting.
