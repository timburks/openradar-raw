    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a new Objective-C iOS app and then add a Today Extension target written in Swift, the Today Extension does not get displayed properly in Notification Center. However if you create the Today Extension in Objective-C, it works just fine. I tested this in the simulator as well as on my iPhone 5. \r\n\r\nI also tested creating a Swift Today Extension in a Swift app, and that worked fine, as did an Objective-C Today Extension in a Swift app, so the issue ONLY seems to be happening with Objective-C apps and Swift Today Extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Single View Objective-C Application in Xcode 6.\r\n2. Add a new target for a Today Extension in Swift.\r\n3. Run the app and add the extension to Notification Center\r\n4. Display will be wrong as in the attached screenshot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCan see the contents of the view in the Today Extension's view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot see the contents of the view in the Today Extension's view controller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 running iOS 8 GM, iOS 8.0 Simulator, Xcode 6 GM"
