    description: "Summary:\r\nAs iPhone hardware gets bigger, the power switch becomes more difficult to manipulate. It would be nice if the iPhone would automatically turn itself off when it detects that it has been placed in a pocket, or has been placed face-down on a table. The accelerometer, proximity sensor, and ambient light sensor could be used to determine when this has happened.\r\n\r\nFurther, it would be nice if the iPhone would automatically turn on when picked up after an automatic turn-off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
