    description: "I'm the developer of Where To?, iTunes id 903955898. I'm trying to change the description of the app. When I hit \"Save\", it fails with the error \"You must choose a build.\"\r\n\r\nFor our other app \"Streets\" iTunes id 598024897, it works without a problem.\r\n\r\nI should mention that the Where To? 7.0.1 update has just been released (status has changed to Ready for Sale 13 hours ago) but the new version is still not available on the App Store.\r\n\r\n\r\nTried using latest Chrome and latest Firefox. Safari unfortunately doesn't open the new iTunes connect at all (keeps spinning after login)."
