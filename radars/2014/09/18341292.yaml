    description: "Summary:\r\nWWDC Session 217 indicates that NSFileCoordinator can be used for synchronizing file access. In practice, we've found it to be very unreliable and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith extension and application processes running at the same time, modify a file in the extension via NSFileCoordinator's `\r\ncoordinateWritingItemAtURL:options:error:byAccessor:` method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect NSFilePresenter in the application to be alerted when writing is about to begin, and when has completed, via `relinquishPresentedItemToWriter:` and `presentedItemDidChange` respectively.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThese methods are either:\r\n\r\n* Not called at all\r\n* Only called when switching between applications\r\n* Called, but only after a method that would cause the app to overwrite the data that the extension had just written (either `savePresentedItemChangesWithCompletionHandler:` or `relinquishPresentedItemToReader:` was called first\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 SDK, last beta prior to GM\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S, last iOS 8 beta prior to GM"
