    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to \"What's New in Core Data in iOS 7\", https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/DataManagement/WhatsNew_CoreData_iOS/, some developers need to use the legacy delete/rollback journaling in SQLite Stores, and that document explains how to do it.  But it does not work when NSMigrationManager gets involved to do a migration, which can result in data loss since users expect the document file to be self-contained any may move it without moving the associated -shm and -wal files.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the bug is that one of Apple's NSMigrationManager methods replaces an inner value in the NSSQLitePragmasOption dictionary with an NSNull.  See  \"Additional Notes\" for link to YouTube video and test code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Get your favorite Core Data SQLite document-based OS X app project which has more than one data model version, for example, version 1 and version 2, and performs a non-lightweight migration between the two, using a subclass of NSMigrationManager.\r\n\r\n2.  Add the code to use legacy delete/rollback journaling in SQLite Stores.\r\n\r\n3.  Build and run, with data model version 2 as the current version.\r\n\r\n4.  Open an old document that was created with data model version 1.\r\n\r\n5.  Perform a âŒ˜-click on the document's title, and click on the parent folder.  A Finder window will open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Finder window should show a .bkmslf document file, with no -shm or -wal files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder window shows -shm and -wal files associated with the migrated document file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYouTube video that shows how the NSNull appears:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daSf7n78NPM\r\n\r\nUpdated version of code used in the demo:\r\nhttps://github.com/jerrykrinock/CategoriesObjC/blob/master/NSPersistentStoreCoordinator%2BPatchRollback.h\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
