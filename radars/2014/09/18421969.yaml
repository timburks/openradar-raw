    description: "code & screenshot: https://github.com/imoldman/testDismiss\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\naccording to doc, \"If you present several view controllers in succession, thus building a stack of presented view controllers, calling this method(means -[UIViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion]) on a view controller lower in the stack dismisses its immediate child view controller and all view controllers above that child on the stack. When this happens, only the top-most view is dismissed in an animated fashion; any intermediate view controllers are simply removed from the stack.\"\r\n\r\nit is right in iOS 7, but in iOS 8, the world has been changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nprepare:\r\n1. start app, you should see a view with red color background\r\n2. click 'button 1', a view with green color background is presented\r\n3. click 'button 2', a view with blue color background is presented\r\n\r\naction:\r\n4. click 'button 3', in iOS 7, you only see a dismiss animation with blue color, this is right. however, in iOS 8, you can see a dismiss animation with green color, obviously, this is wrong."
