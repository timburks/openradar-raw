    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently keyboard extensions require \"Full Access\" in order to be conigured by their containing app or extended using in-app purchase. This forces developers to frighten users by requesting access to a level of capability that they don't need - there is no need for these extensions to have network access or to write to a part of the filesystem that is visible to the containing app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nKeyboard extensions that use IAP currently require \"Full Access\". \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be nice to be able to offer extended features without scaring consumers and looking shady.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch Google for \"keyboard extension full access\" to see consumer reactions to this."
