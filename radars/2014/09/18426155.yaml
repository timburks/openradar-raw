    description: "Summary:\r\nAt some point in the past, the sources for the BridgeSupport metadata generation tool were all Open-Source and available on macosforge.org. (I know, because some of us on the MacRuby team actually worked on it.) However, at this point in time it has been completely removed from macosforge and recent sources are als not available on opensource.apple.com.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to access the sources of the BridgeSupport metadata generation tool again, specifically the C part that gets built as the dynamic library that can be found at `/System/Library/BridgeSupport/ruby-2.0/bridgesupportparser.bundle`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search project in projects list sidebar on macosforge.org\r\n2. Throw hands-up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeing able to download the sources.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot available. http://www.cutestpage.com/pictures/Sad_Cat_Is_Sad.jpg"
