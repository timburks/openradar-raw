    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an in-house app was previously installed and then deleted while the device was using iOS 7, it cannot be reinstalled again when the device is upgraded to iOS 8. (This is just a guess as I don't have any iOS 7 devices to test with and can't reproduce the problem on another iOS 8 device.)\r\n\r\nThe device shows this in the log when attempting to install the app:\r\n\r\nitunesstored[86] <Warning>: LoadExternalDownloadManifestOperation: Ignore manifest download, already have bundleID: com.example.myapp\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iOS 7 device used for development, install an in-house app wirelessly according to the instructions in the iOS Deployment Reference ( https://help.apple.com/deployment/ios/#/apda0e3426d7 )\r\n2. Delete the app\r\n3. Upgrade to iOS 8\r\n3. Attempt to install app a second time\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should install and appear on the home screen just like the first time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp doesn't appear on the home screen and no error message appears. The only clue is found in the device log:\r\n\r\nitunesstored[86] <Warning>: LoadExternalDownloadManifestOperation: Ignore manifest download, already have bundleID: com.example.myapp\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 [12A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDuplicate of 18416645? See https://devforums.apple.com/thread/246321\r\n\r\nThe app will appear on the device if run from Xcode. It also appears that Springboard still thinks that the app is there even after it has been deleted:\r\n\r\nSpringBoard[48] <Warning>: could not find icon for representation -> com.example.myapp\r\n\r\nSee the included log.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 64GB Sprint, using WiFi"
