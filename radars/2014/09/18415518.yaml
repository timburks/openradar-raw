    description: "While the Health app currently contains Blood Glucose support, it only supports mg/dL as a unit of measurement. While this is widely used, particularly in America, it is not widely used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMany European countries, as well as worldwide scientific journals, are now moving towards mmol/L as the main unit of measurement of blood glucose level.\r\n\r\nLooking on forums recently, there has been some confusion as to why this is not an option in iOS. This would be a great enhancement to the Health app and HealthKit if mmol/L was supported.\r\n\r\nmmol/L is millimoles per litre and is the standard blood glucose measurement unit in the UK and a lot of other countries."
