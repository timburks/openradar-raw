        Summary:
        Since iPhone 6 / iPhone 6 Plus there are new screenshot requirements. The Transporter does not support these so it’s impossible to upload screenshots with the metadata for the new devices.

        At least the metadata documentation on iTunes Connect says so.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the metadata documentation for the Transporter tool for iTunes Connect (found here: https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/resources/download/AppMetadataSpecification/pdf) and look at page 75ff dimensions for iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus are missing.


        Expected Results:
        It’s possible to upload screenshots for iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.


        Actual Results:
        It’s not possible to upload screenshots for iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.


        Regression:
