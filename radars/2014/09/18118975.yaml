    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving the latest iOS 8 beta 5 installed on my iPad I found out that an error and/or significant change in behaviour like UIImage loads images in iOS 8 leads to very unexpected results and makes existing apps unusable!!!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have a universal app, which is built for retina and nonretina devices. For some of the images you use, you provide retina resources explicitly, but for reasons of memory-consumption you will not provide retina resources for certain iPad assets, but instead you use the scaled up retina resources from the iPhone.\r\n\r\n2) You use following UIImage initializer\r\nUIImage *image = [self isPad] ? [UIImage imageNamed:@\"myImageName@2x.png\"] : [UIImage imageNamed:@\"myImageName.png\"];\r\n\r\n3) Recognize, that you won't get the @2x-Resource any longer on the initializer, but instead a scaled down version.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the UIImage initializer would behave consistently with iOS 7 in iOS 8 and load the explicitly named resource without any interpretation involved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe wrong image gets delivered by the initializer, which leads to very undesirable results. (See attached screenshot showing both in comparison)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad (3rd generation ATT), running iOS 8 beta 5"
