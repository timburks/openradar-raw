    description: "Summary:\r\nApps that set the AVSpeechUtterance \"rate\" property do so to make speech an appropriate speed for their app use case.\r\n\r\nUnder iOS 8 (later betas and including GM), the same rate value as iOS 7 gives speech that is approximately 50% faster on iOS 8. \r\n\r\nThis is effectively breaking apps as it is not clear if this is intended or a bug. To workaround it we can adjust our rates but a future iOS 8 release may change this again and break our apps as then speech would be far too slow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open example project in Xcode 6\r\n2. Deploy to iOS 7.x device \r\n3. Run, press Speak - note the NSLog shows the time of speech start and stop. Approximately 8.5s\r\n4. Deploy same code to iOS 8 device\r\n5. Repeat step (3). Notice duration of speech indicated in NSLog is approximately 7.1.s\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe speech rate should be identical. In both cases the code is specifying a rate of 0.5\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 8 the speech is approximately 50% faster\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIncluded in the project is a multiplier factor for the rate, of 0.6666f. If you uncomment this to adjust the desired rate, iOS 8 will speak at almost exactly the same rate as iOS 7 did at the non-multiplied rate.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device on iOS 8"
