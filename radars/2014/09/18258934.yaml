    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new \"launch screen file\" option to replace the ever growing number of launch screen images with a single storyboard is a wonderful idea. Launch screen images have accounted for a huge percentage of my total app size—and if rumors are true this is about to get drastically worse very soon.\r\n\r\nHowever the launch screen file currently seems extremely limited in usefulness. Some very basic UI elements, like split views and search bars, don't seem to be supported—if those are included all I get is a black screen, as though the launch screen is missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project\r\n2. Create a separate storyboard to use for the launch screen\r\n3. Set it up with a split view, or even just add a search bar\r\n4. Go to the Targets > General settings\r\n5. Set the appropriate storyboard as the \"Launch Screen File\"\r\n6. Run the app on a device (in my case I'm testing with a 5th gen iPod touch)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomething other than a black screen should appear at launch, preferably resembling your launch screen storyboard. In the case of the search bar I would expect to see a simplified version, with no text or search icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA black screen displays during launch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am able to get the launch image to display if I remove the split view and the search bar. I can work around the search bar by using a stretchable image, but the split view is pretty complicated. It looks like I can get part of the way there using container views and constraints that change based on traits, but I'm surprised I'd have to for such a common setup.\r\n\r\nIf split view controller support is added, it'd be important to include support for specifying the minimumPrimaryColumnWidth and maximumPrimaryColumnWidth in Interface Builder, otherwise it would be impossible to set up a smooth transition to the actual UI.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I would need to make this work is a way to change whether a bar button item is installed based on traits. Launch images generally include icons without any text, and it's also typical to have certain buttons show up in the detail view instead of the master view on iPad.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch 5th generation"
