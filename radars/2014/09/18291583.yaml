    description: "Summary:\r\nAVSpeechSynthesizer only speaks undownloaded languages on second try. Whereas downloaded languages work first time as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVSpeechSynthesizer\r\n2. Create a voice for language that isn't downloaded in the Voice Over accessibility section.\r\n3. Create an utterance using the voice.\r\n4. Use the synth to speak the utterance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should call the didStartSpeech delegate method\r\nSpeak the utterance\r\nThen call the didFinishSpeech delegate method\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoesn't speak utterance\r\nCalls didFinishSpeech delegate method.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSubsequent calls to the speech synthesizer using the same voice will work.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
