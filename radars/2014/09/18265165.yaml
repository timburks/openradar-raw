    description: "Summary:\r\nI am a member of two developer-program teams that have the same name. The teams belong to the same organization, but one of those teams is for an Enterprise developer program and the other is for a standard AppStore developer program.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many UI elements in Xcode that display a team or allow selection of a team show only the name, and so I can never tell which of those two teams is really selected. Also, the ordering of teams in lists is inconsistent, so I can't just remember to select \"the first one\" or \"the second one\" depending on whether I am working on an enterprise app or an AppStore app.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if UI elements related to team selection would include the team ID or some other unique feature. It might also be helpful if developers could assign their own aliases to each team.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if code signing settings allowed one to specify a provisioning profile by name rather than by selecting a team. (I can give my provisioning profiles distinguishable names, but Xcode doesn't let me see them in the Code Signing settings.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS Developer program account\r\n2. Create an iOS Enterprise Developer program account using the same organization name and Apple ID as the first account.\r\n3. Start Xcode, go to Preferences > Accounts and sign in for both programs\r\n4. Create a new iOS project, and in the target's General panel, try to figure out which team you have selected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSelection UI should provide a way to distinguish between the two accounts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to distinguish between the accounts other than by trying one and seeing if code signing works. If not, you try the other account. If neither works, then you have to go to the Provisioning Portal, make changes, and then guess again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 and Xcode 6"
