    description: "Update:\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\nI tested it on an iPad mini (A1489) with iOS 8.1 beta 2, and it appears to be behaving correctly.\r\n\r\nAttachments: https://jeffvautin.com/wp-content/uploads/openradar/radarUIImagePickerControllerLandscapeCameraiPad.zip\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen presenting a UIImagePickerController of sourceType Camera on an iPad, in portrait, the image displayed is of correct orientation. If the iPad is then rotated to Landscape, the image displayed rotates to be 90deg out from what should be shown.\r\n\r\nBehavior is proper on iPhone.\r\n\r\nI am aware documentation states that UIImagePickerController only supports Portrait orientation, but since it is not to be subclassed, there is no obvious way to limit the orientation to Portrait only without limiting orientations for the entire application!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create UIImagePickerController.\r\n2. Set sourceType to Camera.\r\n3. Launch from Portrait rotation.\r\n4. Rotate to Landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImage displayed is correctly aligned with image captured by camera.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage is rotated 90 degs. See radarUIImagePickerControllerLandscapeCameraiPad_demo.MOV.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 12A405\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini with Retina, 32GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'radarUIImagePickerControllerLandscapeCameraiPad.zip' and 'radarUIImagePickerControllerLandscapeCameraiPad_demo.MOV' were successfully uploaded."
