    description: "Summary:\r\nXmlHttpRequest file upload in iOS 8 Safari (WKWebView) does not work at all. The same test page below works in iOS 8 UIWebView.\r\n\r\nThis might be related to the file:// url bug in [rdar://problem/18039024](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5839348817723392)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iOS 8 Safari\r\n2. Go to http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/ and go to the file upload example at the end of the page\r\n3. Select a file to upload (camera / photo roll) by pressing the \"Select a file\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to upload the file using xhr.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot upload the file using xhr.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttempting to manipulate the File object prior to sending also doe snot work. So converting the File to an ArrayBuffer or Blob prior to sending will also fail. Creating a Blob from scratch however still does work but this does not help with uploading any files from the local filesystem. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 5th Generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
