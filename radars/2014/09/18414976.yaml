    description: "Photos loaded in via either iTunes or the camera connection kit often benefit from being able to access the original file's file name. This is possible in the AssetsLibrary framework with this basic code:\r\n\r\nALAssetRepresentation *rep = [asset defaultRepresentation];\r\nNSString *name = [rep filename];\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any current method or property to retrieve this information on PHAsset or any other class in the framework."
