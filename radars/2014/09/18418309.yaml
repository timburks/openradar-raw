        Summary:
        In Keychain Access, when you focus on an item inside the keychain list and hit the Left Arrow key or Right Arrow key, all of the icons flicker briefly to the "@" blue webloc symbol.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch Keychain Access
        2. Click on "login" keychain
        3. Click on any item inside the "login" keychain
        4. Tap Left or Right Arrow key

        Expected Results:
        Well, nothing really, except maybe scrolling to the next or previous item.

        Actual Results:
        Every icon that is not already the round blue "@" webloc symbol very briefly flashes into the round blue "@" webloc symbol each time either the left or right arrow keys are pressed.

        Regression:
        Issue exists in Yosemite DP8 too.
