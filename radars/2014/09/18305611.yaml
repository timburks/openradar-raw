    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Partial Curl Modal Transtion Style (UIModalTranstitionStylePartialCurl) hides the presenting view controller after the animation is complete.  This is jarring and unexpected since it only animates into a partial curl before the top view disappears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Present a modal view controller with the modalTranstionStyle set to UIModalTransitionStylePartialCurl\r\n\r\n(for your convenience, a test app has been attached to demonstrate the issue)\r\n1) Open attached CurlTestApp, run in the Simulator or on device.\r\n2) Press the Curl! button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe main view curls halfway up the screen exposing the bottom of the settings screen, but leaving the main view visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe main view curls halfway up the screen exposing the bottom of the settings, and then disappears completely."
