    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://18336466\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAttempts to run unit tests via the command line fail if the parent process originates from ssh.\r\n\r\nThis manifests with unit tests being invoked by Jenkins, where the Mac is a build slave running the slave.jar invoked by the Jenkins master via ssh. The failure is observed even when the same user is also interactively logged in to the machine. I can see the Java process in the dock, and prior to Xcode 6, I could sit here and watch the Simulator fire up when the tests ran.\r\n\r\nNote that there *is* an active GUI session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. ssh into the Mac from another machine.\r\n2. Attempt to build and test an iOS target using xcodebuild:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -workspace ./Kashoo.xcworkspace -scheme 'Kashoo Dev' -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad' test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS Simulator is launched and unit tests execute.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Simulator does not launch, the build job hangs, eventually times out and fails. The following is logged to stdout:\r\n\r\n2014-09-11 13:52:40.314 xcodebuild[55004:3c07]  iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.\r\n\r\nTesting failed:\r\n\tTest target KashooLogicTestsDev encountered an error (Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1. If you believe this error represents a bug, please attach the log file at /var/folders/gl/ty5zxsqj5tg5bgl6nl4h__wm0000gn/T/com.apple.dt.XCTest-status/Session-2014-09-11_13:50:40-jrn4Se.log)\r\n** TEST FAILED **\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 GM (6A313).\r\nMac OS 10.9.4 (13E28).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression with Xcode 6.  The existing configuration worked correctly with Xcode 5, and Xcode 4 prior to that.\r\n\r\nReported by many other developers and discussed in these dev forum threads:\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of Apple dev forum threads about this issue:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/1042544\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/1018276"
