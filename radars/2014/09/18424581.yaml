    description: "Summary:\nTrying to edit the name of a custom header used in the “One and Only Junk Rule” (i.e. the rule set as a custom action in the Junk preference pane of Mail) will fail: Mail.app always resets it to the form previously used in the O&OJR.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. start Mail.app\n3. open its preferences (Cmd-,) and select the Junk pane\n4. set Junk handling to use a custom Action\n5. edit the O&OJR to use a custom header named “X-Purgate-Type” with a value of “Foo”\n6. quit Mail\n7. start Mail.app in it\n8. open its preferences (Cmd-,) and select the Junk pane\n9. edit the header list in the rule; change the custom header name to “X-foo-bar”\n10. quit Mail and restart it\n11. open its preferences (Cmd-,) and select the Junk pane\n\nExpected Results:\nThe O&OJR uses a header named “X-foo-bar”; that header is to be found in the custom header list.\n\nActual Results:\nThe O&OJR uses a header named ”X-Purgate-Type”; no “X-foo-bar” header is found in the custom header list.\n\nIf the actual results are not reproducible, repeat the Steps to Reproduce, inserting “get a 10.9.5 VM” before step 1. and “upgrade the VM to 10.10 DP 8 with Mail 8 (1985.4)” between steps 6. and 7.)\n\nNotes:\n* Observing ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/UnsyncedRules.plist during the above operations shows the header edit from step 9. is never actually written back to the prefs file. \n* Manually editing the plist to change the header name yields the expected result (i.e. the custom header dialog shows the edited form)."
