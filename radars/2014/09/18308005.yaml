    description: "If you have an alarm set to go off, it will go off even if the phone is muted, by design. This is normally the right solution. Better to be on time and embarrassed, rather than late and not embarrassed.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a solution to the embarrassment...\r\n\r\nWhen a person mutes their iOS device, if an alarm is going to go off within a certain (user configurable) period of time, perhaps in the next 3 hours, the Clock app would signal a special vibration (to get your attention) and would show a notification on the lock screen:\r\n\r\nMute Alert: Your 6pm alarm will sound even though your phone is muted. Turn off your phone or adjust this alarm to avoid this.\r\n\r\nIf they swipe, it takes them right to the alarm in the Clock app.\r\n\r\nBonus points if you add a new option to individual alarms that allows the user to choose \"Vibrate\" instead of a Sound, so that even if the phone is in your pocket, you will feel it rather than having to disable the alarm or turn your phone off."
