    description: "I've set up my project to use XCTest and run a suite of unit and integration tests. The problem is that I can only run a single instance of the iOS Simulator at a time, so in order to parallelize my suite of tests, I have to run multiple machines and run multiple VMs on each machine. It would be a huge win for developers and QA to have the ability to run multiple instances of the iOS Simulator simultaneously!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun `xcodebuild ... clean test` and wait for all tests to run in a serial, way.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest can be run in parallel with each other in multiple instances of the iOS simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTests run serially.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of Xcode/iOS"
