    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen querying -[UIApplication canOpenURL:] whether it can open a phone call URL (tel://) on an iPod Touch it now responds YES, even if there are not phone apps on the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call [[UIApplication sharedApplication] canOpenURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"tel://\"]] in an application running on an iPod touch running iOS 8.\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, I've included a simple demo app which does this.  If the answer to the query is NO, it displays a red label saying \"This device CANNOT make phone calls.\"  If the answer is YES, it displays a green label saying \"THIS device CAN make phone calls.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPod touch cannot handle tel:// URLs, red label is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPod touch claims it can handle tel:// URLs, green label is displayed."
