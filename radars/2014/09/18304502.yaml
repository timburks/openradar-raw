    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to release a Mac OS X app that contains a XPC helper bundle with Xcode 6.1, iTunes Connect rejects the resulting binary with the message \"Invalid Provisioning Profile Location - The provisioning profile for your Mac OS X app must be located in the Contents directory of the main app bundle. A provisioning profile is optional, but you cannot submit more than one.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably because Xcode, starting with 6.1., forces the inclusion of a provisioning profile even in bundled XPC apps. This seems to happen within the uploading process to iTunes connect, so the user has no possibility to exclude the excess provisioning profile prior to uploading the binary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Objective-C app for OS X and add a XPC helper application target to it.\r\n2. Release the resulting application with XCode to iTunes Connect\r\n3. Receive a mail by iTunes Connect stating that the provisioning profile is at an invalid location or has been embedded more than once.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be accepted by iTunes Connect as it has been the case with Xcode versions prior to 6.1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes connect sends a complaint email: \"Invalid Provisioning Profile Location - The provisioning profile for your Mac OS X app must be located in the Contents directory of the main app bundle. A provisioning profile is optional, but you cannot submit more than one.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1027)\r\nOS X 10.10 DP 7 (14A343f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther Xcode users experience the same problem, please see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25774379/invalid-provisioning-profile-location-xcode-6-embeds-it-on-submission for example."
