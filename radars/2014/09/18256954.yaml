    description: "It would be wonderful if Xcode provided an automatically generated \"header\" view for Swift files in the Assistant Editor. This view would allow developers to see the public (and maybe internal?) properties and methods of a class while omitting private members and the implementation details. Developers would get all the benefits of headers without actually having to write them.\r\n\r\nFor example, a header view for a Swift class called Message might look something like this:\r\n\r\nclass Message : NSObject {\r\n  public var messageID: String\r\n  public var text: String\r\n  public var date: NSDate\r\n  public var read: Bool\r\n  public var deleted: Bool\r\n  \r\n  init()\r\n  \r\n  public class func fetchAllMessagesFromServer()\r\n  \r\n  public func replyWithText(text: String)\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis idea is adapted from a blog post: http://minutestomidnight.net/blog/2014/9/automatic-headers-in-swift"
