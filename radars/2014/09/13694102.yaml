    description: "Summary: I have an Xcode project that builds an iOS app. The Deployment Target for the project is set to \"5.0\". When I create a new XIB file, the Use Auto Layout checkbox defaults to On, but Auto Layout is not supported in iOS 5.0.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Xcode would automatically disable autolayout for pre-iOS 6 deployment targets. It would also be nice if the Document Version Deployment field defaulted to \"iOS 5.0\" rather than to \"Project SDK (iOS 6.1)\".\r\n\r\nAs-is, I have to remember to fiddle with these settings each time I create a new XIB, or the app won't run on iOS 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Xcode iOS project. Set the Deployment Target to 5.0.\r\n2. Choose File > New > File... > New...\r\n3. Choose a template that will create a XIB. For example: User Interface > View\r\n4. Give the new file a name and save it.\r\n5. In the Project Navigator, select the new file. Open the File Inspector in the Utilities panel, and look at the Interface Builder Document section. Note that Use Autolayout is checked, and Document Version: Deployment has \"Project SDK (iOS 6.1) selected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode should not create files with attributes that are incompatible with the project's deployment target by default. It should automatically set the attributes to be compatible with the deployment target, or prompt the user to determine what is desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode creates XIBs targeted at the current SDK version, regardless of deployment target setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
