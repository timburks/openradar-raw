    description: "I've been working on a D.R.Y. process for recording error numbers and associated error messages in an Enum.   I have a solution using StringLiteralConvertable Protocol  can be found at https://gist.github.com/ahalls/80d24eaf7312e24b42ff#file-gagglemessengererrors-swift \r\n\r\nWould be nice to do something similar so a (23,\"error 23\") tuple could be used to create a struct or class ... I've seen others looking for something similar to \"name\" various CGPoint literals with an enum."
