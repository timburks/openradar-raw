    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes while writing code in a Swift file the code completion stops working. \r\n\r\nI'm also unable to see any Quick Help on keywords when option-clicking on them, or navigate to them with command-click (I get the \"Symbol not found\" dialog). This happens for any symbol, system or my own.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I had an existing project I've been working on with prior Xcode 6 betas.\r\n2. Started writing Swift code and using code-completion.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee code completion, navigate to symbols, view Quick Help.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo code completion, all symbols are \"Not Found\", no Quick Help. I suspect SourceKit has crashed? Usually upon re-opening a file, this functionality returns. This time it has not. I've tried quitting and restarting Xcode, and restarting my Mac."
