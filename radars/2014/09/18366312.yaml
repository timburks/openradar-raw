    description: "Summary:\r\n1. Create an application that doesn't support 3x retina mode\r\n2. Create a UILabel in the application\r\n3. Specify 2x retina pixel aligned frame dimensions\r\n\r\nWe inspected the view frame and rect passed to drawRect: and it seemed like something in UIKit was occasionally using 3x screen scale instead of 2x."
