    description: OS X has Emacs-style line editing for text areas, which is absolutely wonderful, but only for the people who are on the Emacs side of the Editor War. For the Vi types, this is less than optimal. I understand that this is a niche feature that will mostly only affect developers, but it would be really nice for developers who prefer Vi working in Xcode and other native apps.
