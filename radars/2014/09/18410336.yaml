        Summary:
        The top level help menu of all apps (builtin and third party) is blank.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. set preferred language to German in System Prefs Â» Language & Region
        2. open Mail.app
        3. click on Help

        Expected Results:
        Help menu displays with search field and text items.

        Actual Results:
        Help menu shows search field and empty items (with separators). Selection highlighting and item selection work, but are useless as user has to guess what the blank item would do.

        Notes:
        * Setting the preferred language to English shows the correct text items.
        * Help menu submenus display their text.
        * Filed as serious as being unable to use help in any supported locale should be considered a show stopper.
