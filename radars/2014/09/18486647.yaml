    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder iOS 8+ the MDM configuration profiles are not being installed when restoring from an iCloud Backup. I am seeing this with both DEP and Apple Configurator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure iPad w/ MDM Enrollment\r\n2. Backup to iCloud\r\n3. Erase device\r\n3. Setup device & restore iCloud Backup\r\n4. Complete restore\r\n5. Open Settings>General\r\n6. Observe a lack of MDM Configuration profiles\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen restoring iCloud Backup configuration profiles should be restored with the device's data. DEP devices should be prompted with un-skippable MDM enrollment like new devices are. Under iOS 7.1.2 DEP devices were prompted to re-enroll in the MDM with the un-skippable step from the setup assistant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevices are restored without any configuration profiles or MDM enrollment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 (Model MC769LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
