    description: "Peter Steinberger30-Sep-2014 06:58 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe attached sample shows the correct UIAppearance tinging on iOS 8.0, but doesn't apply tinting on iOS 8.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start UIAppearance Regression.xcodeproj in Xcode 6.0 and Xcode 6.1b3\r\n2. Observe nav bar is blue in 6.0, but white in 6.1b3.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNav bar should be always blue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNav bar tinting is not applied in 8.1b1.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 and iOS 8.1b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to be related to the PSPDFNavigationController and the way we forward rotation information. Something in there triggers UIAppearance evaluation and this changed in 8.1. I found out after trying to reproduce this in a small simulated example.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nResizable iPad Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIAppearance Regression.zip' was successfully uploaded."
