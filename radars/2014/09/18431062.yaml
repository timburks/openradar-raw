    description: "Summary:\r\nMy root view controller is a subclass of UINavigationController with its orientation mask set to be portrait only. When you launch the app on an iPhone 6 Plus in landscape mode, the app's window is set to have landscape size but is positioned like it should be for portrait mode, causing half the screen to be empty. Rotating the device does not fix the orientation, the only way it can be fixed is to force quit the app and launch again with the device in portrait.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new single view controller iOS project in Xcode.\r\n2. Delete the Main storyboard created by the template and delete it from the Main Interface setting in the target settings.\r\n3. Create a subclass of UINavigationController and override its supportedInterfaceOrientations method to return only UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait.\r\n4. In the app delegate, create a window for the app programmatically, create an instance of the new navigation controller subclass, create an instance of ViewController (from the template), set it to be the root controller of the navigation controller and set the navigation controller to be the window's root view controller.\r\n5. Open the iPhone 6 Plus simulator and rotate it to landscape. \r\n6. Run the app on the iPhone 6 Plus simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe simulator should reorient itself to portrait mode and the view controller should fill the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller only occupies about half the screen and is locked in landscape orientation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PortraitTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
