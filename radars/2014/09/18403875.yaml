    description: "Summary:\r\nThe user can access a software-based orientation lock from Control Center. On an iPad, the user can lock the current orientation, both portrait and landscape. But, on an iPhone, the orientation lock will only support portrait orientation.\r\n\r\nWith the new devices, especially the iPhone 6+, and its much larger screen, it is now more useful than ever to be able to lock an iPhone in landscape mode, for games, reading web pages, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, because the iPhone 6+ supports landscape mode on Springboard, the landscape orientation lock makes for a natural experience across the various parts of the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Grab an iPad.\r\n2. Make sure that the orientation lock is not set.\r\n3. Rotate the iPad into landscape orientation.\r\n4. Swipe up from the extreme bottom of the screen to show Control Center.\r\n5. Tap the orientation lock icon.\r\n- Note that the iPad is now locked in Landscape orientation - \r\n6. Grab an iPhone 6+.\r\n7. Make sure that the orientation lock is not set.\r\n8. Rotate the iPhone 6+ into landscape orientation.\r\n9. Swipe up from the extreme bottom of the screen to show Control Center.\r\n10. Tap the orientation lock icon.\r\n- Note that the UI snaps to portrait orientation -\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to lock the CURRENT orientation of the device, not to have the orientation lock to a presumed orientation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn an iPhone, tapping the orientation lock button always locks the UI into portrait orientation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ 64GB AT&T"
