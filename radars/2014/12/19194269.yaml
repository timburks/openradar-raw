    description: "Summary:\r\nLong, potentially important error messages in Disk Utility's console middle truncate instead of wrapping.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an encrypted Time Machine drive that is having a bad day.\r\n2. Attempt to verify or repair the volume.\r\n3. Get an error. The error is presented in a dialog box.\r\n4. Click OK to dismiss the dialog box.\r\n5. Have a need to refer back to the error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe error is visible, in full, in the log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe error is middle-truncated, potentially hiding important or even critical information. I forget exactly what this one said in the middle, but it was something like \"you should erase and reformat the disk\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSorry for the poor screenshot quality. Long story.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nscreenshot: http://cl.ly/Ysgn"
