    description: "Summary:\r\nThere’s no Apple-provided NSData-to-hexadecimal conversion API, and developers have been writing their own. In fact, even Apple engineers have rewritten it a dozen times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch the docs for “-[NSData hexString]”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind such a method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeally, “hexString”, “ “lowercaseHexStringWithoutSpaces” and “ uppercaseHexStringWithoutSpaces” would be public.\r\n\r\nSee attached file for sample duplicates of this behaviour found in Apple-provided frameworks: this isn’t just needed by third-party devs, but also by Apple developers.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator 8.2"
