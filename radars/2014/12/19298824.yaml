        Summary:
        More than 1 notification scene, with different categories, in the watch Storyboard causes Illegal Configuration error with the message of “Multiple notification categories have the default name.”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Create new Xcode single view project
        2) Add watch target without including notifications (ensure the Include Notifications checkbox is not checked)
        3) Add 2 Notification Interfaces to the Storyboard and give them both unique category names.

        Expected Results:
        No error should be present when multiple notifications scenes are added as long as they have unique category names.

        Actual Results:
        Illegal Configuration error is shown.

        Regression:
        This problem doesn’t happen in Xcode 6.2 Beta 1 or 2. This is a new issues in Beta 3.
