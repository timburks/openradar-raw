        Summary:
        Utilities invoked from the Terminal that take advantage of standard or semi-standard system calls for prompting for password should convey the same security benefits to users that secure GUI text fields do.

        Currently typing that is made to one of these seemingly secure inputs is available to other processes using CGEventTap to monitor keystrokes.

        Two examples that come to mind are "sudo" and "ssh". A nefarious application that monitors keystrokes could use this weakness obtain the user's own admin password, or the authentication password to a remote server.
