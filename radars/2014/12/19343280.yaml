    description: "Summary:\r\nThe audio-message feature in Messages in iOS 8 is useful for some; for others, it's a potential source of constant frustration and embarrassment. It should be possible to disable the feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a conversation in Messages\r\n2. Set the phone screen-side down on your lap, or place it in your pocket.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing, as in previous versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt least a dozen times in the past several months, putting the phone away has caused an accidental \"tap\" (through the fabric of my pants, or by brushing against my arm) and \"swipe up\", which results in an audio message being sent.\r\n\r\nNo other accidental gesture happens so often to me, and the potential for embarrassment with this feature is much greater, since it will send my real-life conversations without my knowledge.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1.2 (12B440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis isn't just a theoretical concern; I wouldn't be filing this bug if this feature hadn't embarrassed me several times already. Additionally, I've never used the feature intentionally (it's just not something I care about) so I wouldn't mind completely disabling it."
