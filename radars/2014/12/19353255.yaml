        I’m trying to work with rich text through the Scripting Bridge. The idiom I’m trying to use is “apply this font name to characters 5-9”, for example. In Applescript I could just do “characters 5 thru 9”, but in Scripting Bridge I can’t find an equivalent.

        I’d like an API like this:

        - (SBElementArray*)[SBElementArray objectWithRange:(NSString*)rangeString]

        This would return another SBElementArray, which would be able to correctly proxy commands to the subset using only one AppleEvent.

        Current workaround: iterate, and send one Apple Event per character. Very inefficient and slow.
