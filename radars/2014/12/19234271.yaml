        Summary:
        “Dear Apple bug reporter team,
        I hope this radar finds you well”

        :)

        When you select a problem and it’s loading—which can take upwards of a couple of seconds depending on network speed and browser obstinacy—the app shows a nice little spinner suggesting that it’s loading asynchronously. However, you can’t actually do anything at all until it appears, even scroll the problem list.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use a slow internet connection, perhaps hotspotting through an EDGE network in an elevator, or use the network throttling prefpane.
        2. Open bug reporter and select a folder with >1 radar in it.
        3. Select a different radar than is currently selected.
        4. While it is showing the spinner, attempt to scroll the problem list, or to select a different radar.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to remain responsive: scrolling should scroll, selecting should cancel loading the previous selection and start loading the new selection.


        Actual Results:
        It’s completely unresponsive. It always makes me wonder if Safari has hung, until I realize that the whole _page_ has scrolled a bit and snapped back, as it would if you scrolled with the cursor over the “ Bug Reporter” bit in the top left.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Thank you <3
