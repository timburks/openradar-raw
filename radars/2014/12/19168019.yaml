        Summary: The document explaining how to design a wireless network was last updated in February 2008 for Mac OS X v10.5 and is sorely in need of an update


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Search Appleâ€™s documentation for documentation on Wireless Diagnostic, Airport Utility (Mac and iOS) or Airport hardware.
        Find http://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/0/MA349/en_US/Designing_AirPort_Networks_10.5-Windows.pdf as the newest result

        Expected Results:
        Something describing how to design a network with the hardware for sale in late 2014.

        Actual Results:
        Old documentation is nice, but needs an update

        Regression:

        Notes:
        Cheers and thanks from those of us supporting businesses that choose Apple hardware and software.
