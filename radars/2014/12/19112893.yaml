    description: "There is a major bug in Apple’s OSX Mavericks Operating System.\r\n\r\nWhenever the disk is approaching full, the OS will delete (or loose track) of files which are open in running applications. If the application crashes because of the low disk space, the file is lost permanently to the Operating System (until a disk carving method such as PhotoRec can be used to ‘undelete’ the file). \r\n\r\nSome applications will handle the situation gracefully, refusing to update an existing file, or refusing to create a new file where requested. The low disk space creates stability issues for some memory intensive applications, notably Pages and Xcode, which often crash when the situation occurs.\r\nHowever, for whatever reason, files in use by applications do not seem to remain on the physical storage. \r\n\r\nFor example, a file in use by (being edited within) Pages cannot be located within the Finder- it does not appear to exist, and for obvious reasons, fails to save with a message simply stating “This file cannot be saved”.\r\n\r\nIn another example a file open in Xcode, which crashes entirely in this situation, will not be found within the finder, nor within the Project Navigator when the application is relaunched, even if the low space issue is resolved. The file effectively appears to be deleted by the computer. \r\n\r\nThis issue is consistently repeatable, occurring every time the remaining disk space becomes low.\r\nIt has been observed to affect OSX Mavericks 10.9.5+.\r\n\r\nNeither the application, nor the Operating System, correctly handle the situation. It would be expected that a file previously saved to the physical storage remains there, regardless of any low space condition, and any request to update or overwrite the file be simply refused if cannot be completed. Certainly it is not expected that the file be removed from the physical storage simply because there is no more space to update it."
