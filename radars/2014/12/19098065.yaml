    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 8.2 has changed the default font location, but does not do a linked-on-or-after check in order to preserve the previous behavior. Apps downloaded from the App Store on iOS 8.2 that don't look in the new location will have broken text.\r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots of an app currently on the App Store, Supreme Freekick, that exhibits the regression. The app can be downloaded at:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/zhi-gaonofurikikkugemu-supreme/id904233987?mt=8\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download an app that doesn't refer to the new location, like Supreme Freekick mentioned above.\r\n2. Launch the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFonts should be loaded because the app has not been updated for iOS 8.2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFonts are not properly loaded, causing blank UI. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2 12D436\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know that Apple typically does a \"linked on-or-after\" check for apps to prevent these sorts of regressions. Please add a check for this, so that fonts are correctly loaded on apps that haven't been updated for iOS 8.2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 (Reproducible on any iOS device)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'expected.jpeg' and 'actual_8.2.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
