    description: "The title of a WKInterfaceController can be set programmatically using -setTitle: or via the Storyboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Storyboard title always shows up shortly before -setTitle: can be executed. I tried to use -setTitle: in -init, -initWithContext: (despite being deprecated) and -willActivate. In each case, it’s already too late and the storyboard title shows up first.\r\n\r\nOf course I can leave the title in the storyboard empty but then I get an ugly non-animated title change after the push animation has already finished.\r\n\r\nSo, I’d expect that setting the title in -init would display it right away without any glitch."
