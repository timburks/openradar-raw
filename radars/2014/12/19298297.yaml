    description: "Summary:\r\nA custom view with a single checkbox provides a non-standard and annoying interaction model when it's added as an accessory view to a File Open panel that is presented by the Sandbox/Powerbox process.\r\n\r\nBasically, the checkbox only reacts when the user clicks on a \"drawn\" pixel of the checkbox label text. If you click between words or in empty areas of drawn letters, the checkbox does not toggle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample Xcode project\r\n2. Build and run the sample application\r\n3. Select the sample application's File Openâ€¦ menu command\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe checkbox option can be toggled by clicking anywhere on the checkbox label.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe checkbox option can only be toggled by clicking on drawn pixels of the checkbox label. Clicks between words or inside empty areas of drawn letters (inside an 'O' letter for instance) are ignored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a) & OS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you go back to the project, disable the App Sandboxing capability and then build and run the application, the problem disappears: the checkbox toggles correctly, regardless of where you click on the checkbox label."
