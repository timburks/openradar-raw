        Summary:
        Bug reporter loads n items (50?) in folders initially, and then the next n when you scroll near the bottom. This is good!

        However, searching through your filed issues only searches those which have already loaded and are already visible. In order to search the entire list, I need to scroll to the bottom, wait for it to load the next chunk, and repeat until all area loaded. This is not good.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select a folder in bug reporter with > n items, e.g. in my case I’m selecting one with 116 items.
        2. Search for a term which appears in radars which are in that folder, but not in the most recent 50. (I have the sort set to the default “sort by date originated”.) In my case this was the term “find.”


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to turn up my radar rdar://17655838 (on Swift stdlib’s `find` being insufficient).


        Actual Results:
        “No Problems Found”


        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        This led me to think I had imagined filing that radar. I would have filed it again, wasting my time and others’ as well, had I not noticed this bug.
