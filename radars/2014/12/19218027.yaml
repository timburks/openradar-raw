    description: "Summary:\r\nObject Inspector shows only a select few properties for a given class. It should show all properties of that object and properties of its superclasses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Creare a simple UI in storyboard - drag a UILabel out onto a scene.\r\n2. Run in simulator and click \"Debug View Hierarchy\" to being inspecting\r\n3. select the label and open the object inspector.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe object inspector should show me all properties applied to my label but also properties of its super class (UIView) which would allow me to for example inspect the backgroundColor of the UILabel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe object inspector only shows me properties of the given class. This means that for my own subclasses of UIView etc I cannot inspect their properties via the Debug View Hierarchy."
