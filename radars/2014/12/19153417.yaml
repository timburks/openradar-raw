    description: "In a WatchKit app that I am developing, I am embedding a WKInterfaceSlider in a table row controller and wiring the slider's action to the row controller.  However, at runtime, an uncaught exception is thrown when pressing the up/down buttons of the slider.  Here is the output from the console:\r\n\r\n2014-12-04 23:40:23.414 SliderTest WatchKit Extension[16245:1054236] -[__NSCFNumber lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7a753950\r\n2014-12-04 23:40:23.415 SliderTest WatchKit Extension[16245:1054236] <NSXPCConnection: 0x7c551eb0> connection from pid 16209: Warning: Exception caught during invocation of received message, dropping incoming message and invalidating the connection.\r\nException: -[__NSCFNumber lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7a753950\r\n2014-12-04 23:40:23.415 SliderTest WatchKit Extension[16245:1054236] host connection <NSXPCConnection: 0x7c551eb0> connection from pid 16209 invalidated\r\n\r\nNote that I have only tested this on the iPhone Simulator."
