        Summary:
        Hockeyapp and the old Testflight allow you to add release notes and specify that a build should be released, before it’s even finished uploading. Distribution is basically one step, with progress indication. iTunes Connect Testflight adds many indeterminate steps into this process, which dramatically increases the amount of time, stress, and attention it takes to send out an external build.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Submit a build to iTunes Connect from the Organizer.
        2. Wait for build to upload and verify with iTunes Connect (2-10 minutes perhaps)
        3. Go to iTunes Connect, see the build is “Processing” with status “Uploaded”, and unclickable
        4. Reload iTunes Connect repeatedly for an indeterminate amount of time (3-10 minutes perhaps) looking for progress
        5. Note that the build is now in the main table section and clickable, but still “Processing” for internal testers
        6. Open build, fill in release notes, re-fill Beta App Review Information name, email and phone number, save form
        7. Reload iTunes Connect repeatedly for an indeterminate amount of time (5-30 minutes perhaps) looking for progress
        8. Note that the build is now “Invite Users” for internal testers and “Submit to App Store” for external testers
        9. Hit “Submit for Beta App Review”, specify that it has not changed substantially or added encryption, save, submit for review.
        10. Testers get build.

        Expected Results:
        You can ask Testflight to submit a build to testers, external or internal, as part of the upload - or at least as soon as the upload is complete.

        Actual Results:
        It takes the better part of an hour of reloading, waiting, context switching, to ask Testflight to send out a demo build to clients.

        Notes:
        The iTunes Connect Testflight has simplified getting your first build out, but complicated getting each additional build out.
