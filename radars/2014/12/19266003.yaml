    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the Network Link Conditioner is enabled on iOS, the status bar should reflect it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Network Link Conditioner with a slow profile on an iOS device to test an app with poor network connectivity.\r\n2. Forget that you have the Network Link Conditioner enabled.\r\n3. Wonder why your network connection is slow.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is some sort of indicator in the status bar, perhaps replacing or augmenting the network activity indicator, reminding you that the Network Link Conditioner is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such indicator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices with Developer Mode enabled.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
