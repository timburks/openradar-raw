    description: "When playing a video in full screen mode, the mouse cursor disappears. This happens when Zoom is enabled in the Accessibility tab of System Preferences.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom.\r\n\r\n2. Check either \"Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom\" or \"Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom\".\r\n\r\n3. Play a video in iTunes.\r\n\r\n4. Enter full screen mode if the video is not playing full screen.\r\n\r\n5. Move the mouse cursor with the trackpad.\r\n\r\n6. Stop the video by typing \"Command+.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect that the mouse cursor is visible when moving in full-screen mode, and that it always becomes visible when the video is stopped and full-screen mode is exited.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mouse cursor is not visible in full screen mode even when moving it, and it stays invisible after full screen mode is exited. It may become visible again if moved to the upper-left corner of the screen and the Apple menu is clicked in the menu bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\niTunes 12.0.1.26\r\n\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nMacBook Air (13-inch, mid-2012)"
