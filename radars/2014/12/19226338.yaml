    description: "Summary:\r\nThe CloudKit documentation says that for CKSubscriptions, the device that made the change will not receive the subsequent CKQueryNotification.  \r\n\r\nI have a CKSubscription based on an \"always true\" NSPredicate for CKSubscriptionOptionsFiresOnRecordDeletion. When I delete a CKRecord from a device OTHER THAN the device from which that CKRecord was created, I am getting CKQueryNotification to that device for the deletion\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a universal iOS application with CloudKit entitlements\r\n2. Create a generic CKRecord\r\n3. Create a CKSubscription with a \"always true\" NSPredicate for CKSubscriptionOptionsFiresOnRecordDeletion\r\n4. Run the App on 2 different devices\r\n5. Create a CKRecord from device 1\r\n6. When the CKRecord is synced device 2, delete it\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs stated in the documentation, the device which deletes the CKRecord should not receive a CKQueryNotification for that delete from CloudKit\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device which deleted the CKRecord will incorrectly receive a CKQueryNotification for the deletion of that CKRecord"
