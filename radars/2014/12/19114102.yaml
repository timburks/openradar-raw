    description: "When the Mac App Store design recently got reworked to fit OS X Yosemite's clean and bright appearance, apparently also the app's screenshots were touched. Ever since then the screenshots are blurry, user interface text displayed on them is hard to read and often they even show JPEG compression artifacts.\r\nThis is a regression: Screenshots used to look fine before the recent overhaul of the store's design. Also, as the purpose of the Mac App Store is to showcase Mac apps it is counterproductive when the images aren't as beautiful and crisp looking as they theoretically could be: No matter how high the resolution of the originally uploaded image assets is they appear blurry and overly compressed after having been processed for the store. Also, it makes no difference if JPEGs or PNGs are used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClosely examine the screenshots of any app on the Mac App Store. Notice compression artifacts for example on Pixelmator's tool palettes or Evernote's source list."
