    description: "Summary:\r\nHTML5 app which has a text editor needs to listen all the key input events. When predictive text available on keyboard is used, no js event is fired while predictive text insertion by UIWebView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an HTML page with a contenteditable div\r\n2. Register key events on div created above\r\n3. Choose any predictive text on keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nregistered key event handler is not called. Instead only 'input' event is called when DOM has changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeed events in js before predictive text is inserted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
