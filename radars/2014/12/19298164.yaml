    description: "Summary:\r\nA custom view with a single checkbox renders the checkbox label text poorly when it's added as an accessory view to a File Open panel that is presented by the Sandbox/Powerbox process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample Xcode project\r\n2. Build and run the sample application\r\n3. Select the sample application's File Openâ€¦ menu command\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe checkbox label text that appears in the File Open's accessory view looks as good as all the other text that is displayed elsewhere in the dialog box.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe checkbox label text that appears in the File Open's accessory view looks noticeably worse than all the other that is displayed elsewhere in the dialog box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a) & OS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you go back to the project, disable the App Sandboxing capability and then build and run the application, the problem disappears: text in the accessory view looks as good as text displayed elsewhere in file open panel.\r\n\r\nThe blurriness of the text is especially noticeable on a non-retina display, but it happens on a retina display as well, as can be seen by examine a zoomed-in screenshot of the view: basically, the antialias of the checkbox label text is different and not as smooth-looking as the antialias of the other text in the dialog."
