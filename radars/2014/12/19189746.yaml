        Summary:
        Occasionally a pop-up tool tip showing an email address shows up in Mail. I do not know how I trigger these pop-ups, but when they do show up they stay in front of all windows, including other applications or the desktop. The only way to get it to go away is to quit Mail and restart.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Trigger Mail to show an email address tool-tip.
        2. Switch to any other app.

        Expected Results:
        The toll-tip goes away.

        Actual Results:
        The tool-tip shows above all other windows.

        Regression:
        Unknown. I do not recall this happening on Mavericks.
