    description: "Summary:\r\nStoryboards can grow large, and short of splitting them up into multiple storyboards, a solution I've often used is spreading scenes out to let the storyboard \"breath\" a little.\r\n\r\nBut zooming in and out of storyboard is clunky and it's very inconvenient to do so.\r\n\r\nIt would be much nicer to have a mini map in the corner of the storyboard, a bit like the scroll map used in Sublime Text app on OS X, this map would show the outline of scenes and highlight the current viewport on the mini map. \r\n\r\nClicking another part of the map will take you there. \r\n\r\nAttached storyboard screenshot illustrates a very clunky user experience. Although I could split the bigger part of the journey into its own storyboard, I would then need to write storyboard management code to hook the two together.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStoryboards should be easy to navigate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStoryboards become very difficult to navigate. See attached screen grab of my current storyboard."
