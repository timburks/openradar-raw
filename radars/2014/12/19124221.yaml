        Summary:
        Xcode adds the path to the folder containing linked frameworks to the FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS build setting if they aren’t system frameworks.

        I think the intent was to be helpful, in practice it is at best chaff and at worst it masks errors (like forgetting to add a copy frameworks phase) until your beta testers get the app and it can’t run.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make a new framework project.
        2. Add a workspace.
        3. Copy another framework project (to use as a dependency) into the dir or check one out in a submodule.
        4. Add the dependency project to the workspace.
        5. In the build phases for the dependent framework target, add the dependency framework to the link phase with the + button.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to set up the linkage but not to mess with build settings because they don’t need to be messed with.


        Actual Results:
        It messes with the build settings, adding e.g.:

        				FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = (
        					"$(inherited)",
        					"$(USER_LIBRARY_DIR)/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Memo-gckjwjhvobgrrpgheuyaonxcriig/Build/Products/Debug",
        				);

        That’s the path to the build dir. The transiently-named build dir!


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        My framework project templates (and possibly Xcode’s default ones, too, I don’t recall) have good default settings for install name path and runpath search paths. Xcode pays these no heed and blithely adds the setting anyway.

        This sort of thing results:

        I’ve been making a bunch of frameworks lately and I’m willing to bet I’ve committed the broken search paths to several of them.
