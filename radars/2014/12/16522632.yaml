    description: "Summary:\r\nI am following the instructions in https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/quicktime/qtff/QTFFAppenG/QTFFAppenG.html to produce a .MOV file with explicit AAC delay information (the AAC encoder I'm using has a priming delay of 2014 samples)\r\n\r\nThe instructions on that page note \"An incomplete implementation will result in unspecified interpretation by Apple software and tools. In the absence of the sample group structures, the classic solution of expecting an implicit encoding delay of 2112 samples and the edit list to start at the beginning of encoder delay will be assumed as described in the previous section.\" - however the tools seem to be ignoring this information\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Generate .MOV file (see attachment - checked in Atom Inspector for validity, generated by our custom version of libavformat)\r\n2. Import into FCP X\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor audio and video to sync up perfectly, since the MOV includes explicit delay information indicating that we are using AAC priming of 1024 rather than 2112\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio is 1088 samples early compared to video (which also means the first 1088 samples in the file are lost). This means that the media loses AV sync when edited(!)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nRunning on OS X 10.9.2 build 13C64\r\nFCP X 10.1.1 build 240682\r\nQuicktime Player Version 10.3 (727.3)\r\nQuicktime for Windows\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf using PCM instead of AAC, the resulting file is parsed perfectly and AV sync is maintained\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'aac.mov' was successfully uploaded."
