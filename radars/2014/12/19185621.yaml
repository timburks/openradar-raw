        WatchKit Extensions should be able to schedule local notifications. Currently only iPhone apps can schedule Local Notification as the API exist on UIApplication. A WKInterfaceController does not have access to UIApplication nor does it have API to schedule a Local Notification.

        Developers should be able to schedule Local Notifications from either an iOS app or a WatchKit Extension.
