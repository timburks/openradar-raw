    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is a pain to delete unwanted web cookies, infeasible to individually manage them for all sites visited, and not worth the effort because every system (and account and reinstall) gets its own set. But managed cookies would provide much stronger privacy and security.\r\n\r\nThere are two good ways to address this. Shared (public) preference white/black lists and iCloud sync of cookie preferences.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could subscribe to a Safari extension that would block cookies from ad sites (since DNT is not honored), and another that blocked cookies from Google / Facebook / LinkedIn / etc. But not very Apple-like, hard to customize and manage subscriptions, and Mac only (no iOS). I want Twitter and Google cookies sometimes, but not across Safari launches, but never want Facebook or LinkedIn cookies to be saved.\r\n\r\nA more Apple-like solution would be to sync a list of per-site cookie preferences (accept cookies, reject cookies, delete cookies on browser quit, or delete cookies after 1 day [for iOS]) via iCloud. Safari/iOS could also benefit from this and edit it in a pinch. This would also preserve security preferences across reinstalls.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDelete cookies for a site.\r\nSwitch to another Mac or iOS device.\r\nCookies are independent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like Apple to help me set a cookie policy across all my devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach device fends for itself and with several devices I cannot keep track of all the sites stashing cookies on all devices."
