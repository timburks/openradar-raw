    description: "Summary:\nWhen setting an NSFontAttributeName with a custom font to  UISegmentedControl  appearance (some other controls as well)  and then creating a UIDcumentPickerViewController or a UIDocumentMenuController the controller takes up to 7 seconds to show up when presented modally. \n While using a  UIDocumentMenuController on an iPad  and the user is not logged in on an iCloud account the app will crash with \n- [_UIDimmingKnockoutBackdropView nsli_layoutEngine]%3A message sent to deallocated instance\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Add custom rtf font and set it up on info.plist\n2) On AppDelegate set Font appearance for a UISegmentControl\n\t\n    [[UISegmentedControl appearance] setTintColor%3A[UIColor redColor]]%3B\n    NSDictionary *attributes %3D %40{\n                                 NSFontAttributeName%3A [UIFont fontWithName%3A%40\"Pacifico\" size%3A16]\n                                 }%3B\n    \n    [[UISegmentedControl appearance] setTitleTextAttributes%3Aattributes forState%3AUIControlStateNormal]%3B\n\n3) Instantiate and present either a UIDcumentPickerViewController or a UIDocumentMenuController\n\nExpected Results:\nSee the document picker in a reasonable time\n\nActual Results:\nThe UI hangs there for up to 7 seconds (the main thread is not frozen and the UI actually responds) and eventually shows the picker.  If the user is not logged in on a iCloud account the app crashes. This is on iPad while trying to present on a popoverPresentationController\n\nNotes:\nThe file attached is the NewBox example from the Apple website%2C with the modification necessary to reproduce the bug (namely added the fond and the appearance on the app delegate)."
