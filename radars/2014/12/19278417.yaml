        Summary:
        NSBundle is not thread safe. It should be.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Hard; it’s more a conceptual thing, but we’ve seen rare crashes using NSBundle.mainBundle.infoDictionary on a background thread, and then started digging. (There’s no example needed nor would it be helpful.)

        Expected Results:
        NSBundle should be thread safe. Can it even be mutated?

        Actual Results:
        We’ve seen rare crashes using NSBundle on background threads.

        Notes:
        I see that it’s listed here, but it’s unexpected. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/ThreadSafetySummary/ThreadSafetySummary.html

        There’s also nothing warning developers about it being not thread safe (or sharing global state) in the NSBundle docs:
