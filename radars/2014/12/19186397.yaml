        Summary:
        Interface builder allows you to select a custom font you have included in your app.  When you change a UILabel to be attributed, you can’t pick the custom font in the attributed font list.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add a custom font to your project and plist, confirm its available as a font in interface builder.  Create a UILabel and change it to attributed and that same font won’t be available when you are editing the attributed text.

        Expected Results:
        The font should also be available when editing the attributed string.

        Actual Results:
        The font does not appear, see attached screenshot that shows one label set to my custom font and the font picker from an attributed string that is missing the font.

        Regression:
        Occurs always as far as I can tell.
