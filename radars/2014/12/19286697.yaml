    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning OS X Mavericks breaks these App Store Review Guidelines:\r\n\r\n> Apps that use Push Notifications to send unsolicited messages … will be rejected\r\n> Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind\r\n\r\nA non-dismissable notification is regularly displayed which reads:\r\n\r\n> Get OS X Yosemite free\r\n> New design. Better apps. More ways your Mac works with iOS.\r\n\r\nFrom the OS X Notification Center guidelines:\r\n\r\n> Choose an appropriate default style for your notifications. Use an alert when you need to deliver information that users need to know about right now. Because banners disappear after a few seconds, don't use banners for information that is critical for users to see. And because alerts interrupt the user’s workflow, it’s best to use them only when users would rather be interrupted than miss your notification. If users become annoyed with alerts, they may turn off notifications for your app.\r\n\r\nThis notification is annoying, and non-dismissible. Screenshot attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on a computer running OS X Mavericks\r\n2. Wait to be annoyed by a non-dismissable notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be informed of non-critical software updates in non-intrusive ways, like:\r\n\r\n- a badge on the app store icon\r\n- a listing in the app store available updates section\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am frequently annoyed by this notification, which violates multiple App Store rules, and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest version of OS X Mavericks\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDid I mention how annoying this is?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Banners and Alerts-1-2.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
