    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift provides a \"switch\" statement that is superficially similar to the switch statement provided by C and C++. However, it does not work the same way that C/C++ switch works, and its syntax is inconsistent with the general patterns of other Swift syntax.\r\n\r\nC's switch statement is essentially a computed-goto statement, so it makes sense that its cases look like C goto labels. Further, C's switch supports fall-through from one case to the next, which is useful for its problem domain (low-level OS implementation).\r\n\r\nHowever, Swift supports neither gotos nor fall-through, so the goto-like syntax is just confusing.\r\n\r\nEach case in a Swift switch has its own variable scope. This is not obvious, because programmers expect braces around scopes.\r\n\r\nA syntax like this would make more sense:\r\n\r\n    switch x {\r\n        case .SomeValue { ... }\r\n        case .OtherValue, .ThirdValue { ... }\r\n        default: { ... }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.1.1 (6A2008a)"
