    description: The users of my app (Disk Alarm on the Mac App Store) would like to send emails (alarms), not only compose them. The Review team rejected my last update (2.0.2) because I was using com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events and should use com.apple.security.scripting-targets.
