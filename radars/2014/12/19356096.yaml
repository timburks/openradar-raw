    description: "Unlike hardware products and other one-time purchases, software evolves to meet new demands and changing environments, meaning successful software has a long lifetime with upgrades to that software.\r\n\r\nCurrent MAS policies do not allow correct pricing of those upgrades:  \"free\" does not reflect the added value and makes it impossible for suppliers to stay in business.  \"Full purchase price\" does not reflect the incremental added value for existing customers."
