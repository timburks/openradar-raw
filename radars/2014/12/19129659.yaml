        Summary:
        When partially applying an NSObject subclass method, unless the class or the method are marked as `final`, you can encounter a crash.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached PartialApplication Xcode project
        2. Run the app on a device

        Expected Results:
        Expect to see the app run without crashing

        Actual Results:
        The app crashes while partially applying the `addItemToColumn` method

        Notes:
        This crash doesn’t occur in the iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, and iPad Air simulators. However, it does crash in the 5, 4S, iPad Retina, and iPad 2 simulators. It also crashes on the iPhone 6 device, the 6+ device, and the first-gen retina iPad mini device. I’m assuming it crashes on all devices, but these are the only devices I have available to test with.
