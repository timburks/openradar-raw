        Summary:
        Currently a nefarious process on Mac OS X can use CGEventTap to obtain access to all the typing made by a user to a Screen Sharing session. This means that such a process can observe even the typing that goes into a text field that is being "secured" on the other system. Users would reasonably assume this information is being secured unless they have a good understanding of the abstraction between the remote system and the local system.

        I think it would make sense for Screen Sharing to support a similar option to Terminal.app's "Secure Keyboard Entry," and that perhaps it should be enabled by default. Because the events being entered into a remote screen sharing session are by definition more pertinent to the remote session, I don't think there is a great risk of interfering with valuable event-tapping mechanisms by securing input by default.
