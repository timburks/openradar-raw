        In previous versions of iOS, one could have a table view cell with an editingAccessoryType of UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailButton, and also displaying the reordering control.

        Now, for cells with such a configuration, the reordering control is displayed but does not respond to touches. If the reordering control is touched, it is as if the detail button was touched.

        I have attached a picture showing the configuration in question.
