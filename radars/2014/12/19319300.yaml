    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to create my user interface in code (without using xibs or storyboards) and start the app on the iPad simulator in landscape the frame of the window is still like in portrait.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Rotate iPad simulator to landscape\r\n2. Build and run the attached application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view of the root view controller (and the window) fill the entire screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view of the root view controller (and the window) fill only part of the screen. I have set `window.clipsToBounds = true` to make the problem visible in the demo app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Swift\r\n- SDK 8.2\r\n- iPad simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Add the code\r\n\r\n    let frame = UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds\r\n    window.frame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width: frame.size.width+0.000_001, height: frame.size.height+0.000_001)\r\n\r\nin application(didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) to work around the bug (see demo project)."
