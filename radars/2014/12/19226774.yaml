        Adding a WatchKit App Target with Notifications and/or Glances enabled should automatically create the necessary build schemes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Xcode, open your iOS app project.
        2. Select File > New > Target and navigate to the Apple Watch section.
        3. Select WatchKit App.
        4. Click Next.
        5. Select Notification and/or Glance
        6. Click Finish.

        Expected Results:
        Build schemes for the WatchApp, Notification, and/or Glance should be automatically created.

        Actual Results:
        The only build scheme that is created is for the WatchApp.
