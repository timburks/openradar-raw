    description: "Summary:\r\nI use iCloud keychain and as such I sometimes like to refer back to some saved password when I'm using another device or using an app where the login is required and saved in my keychain.\r\n\r\nBut I need to scroll sometimes for a long time to find what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Settings > Safari > Passwords & AutoFill > Saved Passwords\r\n2. See big list of items\r\n3. No easy way to filter this list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to filter this list by typing in a search string which matches against the website name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo search functionality exists and I need to scroll a lot to find what I'm looking for."
