    description: "In iOS 8 mobile Safari gained the ability to automatically request the desktop version of a website; this feature is great for mobile use, but would be even better on the desktop. The \"social web\" is full of people using mobile devices to share links in various formats: on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, etc. If the URL of the website dictates its mobile-ness (e.g. Wikipedia uses a subdomain: http://en.m.wikipedia.org) I, as a desktop user, end up loading the mobile versionâ€”which is oftentimes awkward and frustrating to use with a mouse on a (glorious) 27\" cinema display. Since mobile Safari has demonstrated that automatically finding the Desktop version of a website is possible, adding that feature to desktop Safari would be a great improvement.\r\n\r\nEven better: an option to *always* request the desktop version when loading a site."
