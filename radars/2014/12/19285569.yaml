    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Safari on my iPad Air in landscape, the share sheet isn't laid out very well when the keyboard is visible. It's fine in portrait.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mobile Safari in landscape on an iPad running iOS 8\r\n2. Navigate to a page with a text field\r\n3. Tap in the text field to bring up the keyboard\r\n4. Tap the share icon in the toolbar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe share sheet would appear over the keyboard, instead of being constrained by it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe share sheet is shorter than it should be and some controls are unusable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.2 (12B440)"
