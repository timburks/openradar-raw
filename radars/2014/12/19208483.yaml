    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, a <select multiple> with many options and with `padding-right` CSS causes its OS X auto-hiding scrollbar to get clipped when it is displayed. If the `padding-right` is set to a sufficiently large value, the scrollbar gets completely hidden due to the clipping. Note how the scrollbars pointed at by the green arrows in the attached screenshot are different.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/fekipo/2/edit?html,output\r\n2. Hover over each <select multiple> and scroll up/down through its options using your mouse wheel\r\n3. While scrolling, observe the scrollbar that's displayed in the <select multiple>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scrollbar displayed in both <select multiple>s should be the same width.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scrollbar in the <select multiple> with `padding-right` CSS gets partially clipped off and is thus narrower than the correct scrollbar displayed in the normal <select multiple>.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0.1 (10600.2.3)\r\nOS X Yosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso filed as https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128489\r\nChrome and Firefox don't suffer from this problem; their scrollbars work fine in this case.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'clipped.png' was successfully uploaded."
