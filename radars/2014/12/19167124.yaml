        Summary:
        Accessing popoverPresentationController creates a retain cycle. UIPopoverPresentationController is strongly saved in the content view controller. Then the UIPopoverPresentationController strongly references the view controller.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open example. Set breakpoint to PSPDFTestViewController’s dealloc. It’s not being called.

        Expected Results:
        No retain cycle. PSPDFTestViewController should deallocate.

        Actual Results:
        In the example, both PSPDFTestViewController instances stay in memory, forever, with their matching UIPopoverPresentationController.

        Regression:
        This API did not exist on iOS 7.

        Notes:
        Tricky to decide where the retain cycle should be broken. I understand why UIPresentationController retains both view controllers for the presentation animation. If UIPopoverPresentationController would have used composition, the creation/destruction of the internal presentation controller could be managed. But we can’t change the API now, so I suggest a private extension that doesn’t yet set presentedViewController (as presentingViewController also is set dynamically when the presentation actually happened.)

        BTW: UIPopoverPresentationController is a new API, but it’s delegate is assign, not weak?
