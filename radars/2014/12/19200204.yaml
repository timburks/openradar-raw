    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to test my command-line swift application. I am disallowed from attaching a Test Target to my Command-Line Target. I cannot figure out how to embed a custom Framework (that holds all of my testable logic) into a Command-Line application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project as Command Line\r\n2. Try to add a Cocoa Testing Bundle.\r\n3. Try to embed a Framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to add a Cocoa Testing Bundle that has my application as the \"Target to be tested\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the \"None\" option is available in the \"Target to be tested\" dropdown, while my application is grayed out.\r\n\r\nIf I try to work around the problem by putting all my logic into a Framework and testing just the framework, I cannot figure out how to embed that Framework into my Command Line project and get it to run (though it compiles)."
