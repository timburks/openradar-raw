    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to add a WatchKit app target to the included project will crash Xcode 6.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the enclosed target. You can ignore all of the missing files.\r\n2. Attempt to add a WatchKit app target to the project.\r\n3. Xcode will crash and any attempt to open the project from this point on will crash Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.2 (6C86e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have discovered a work around which is to remove the \"Build Number\" target from the project and then add the WatchKit app. This avoids the crash. Adding the \"Build Number\" target back after adding the WatchKit app seems to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote for those who wish to duplicate this radar: I have a sample project that exemplifies this issue, if you would like a copy of this please email me at jon{at}pixelresearchlabs.com. Thanks."
