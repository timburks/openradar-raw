    description: "It would be great if there was a way to reset the WKInterfaceTimer in a stopped state to 0:00:00\n \nIf the timer is already started, I can set the date to [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:0] which effectively does the same thing.\n \nBut if the timer is already stopped, I can't find anything to set it to that will be honored. Setting it to nil, [NSDate date], etc. doesn't do anything.\n \n \nTom Within said to file an enhancement request, so here it is! :) \n\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/257761?tstart=0"
