        Summary:
        Recently I started using Hasklig as my editor font:

        https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig

        I’ve found it to be not merely aesthetic—it actually makes a readability difference to have -> rendered as →. Recently, BBEdit started supporting using its ligatures (because @siegel is a wonderful human being <3 ). It would be lovely if Xcode would too.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install Hasklig
        2. Set it as Xcode’s editor font
        3. Write some Swift code with -> and such


        Expected Results:
        I expected nice ligatures :)


        Actual Results:
        No ligatures :(


        Regression:
        Xcode actually DOES display the ligatures in some cases. The autocompletion placeholders for example, they draw ligatures. (See attached screenshot.)


        Notes:
        Thank you <3
