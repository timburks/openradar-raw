    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Interface Builder, you can use auto layout align the baselines of two labels, and the bottom of one label to the baseline of another, but not the bottom of an image to the baseline of a label.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag two labels into an iOS xib or storyboard, and place them side by side.\r\n2. Control-drag horizontally from one label to the other.\r\n3. Choose Bottom from the list of alignment attributes.\r\n4. Select the newly created constraint.\r\n5. In the Attributes Inspector, change the Second Item attribute to Baseline.\r\n6. Attempt to do the same thing, but with a UIImageView and a label instead of two labels.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou are able to align a UIImageView's bottom to a UILabel's Baseline or First Baseline.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Baseline and First baseline attributes of the label are grayed out. The only way to do this (that I know of) is to do it in code at run time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
