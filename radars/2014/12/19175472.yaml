        Summary:
        Setting preferredContentSize doesn't always correctly update the size if navigationBarHidden changes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open example. Observe that the popover is too large; it should be exactly the size to fit 5 rows, but there is one extra, which is the space for the hidden top toolbar.

        Expected Results:
        Should be sized correctly.

        Actual Results:
        Popover size is too large.

        Regression:
        Doesn’t work on iOS 7 either.

        Notes:
        Not sure if I’m doing something wrong here, when I change the call order I can make it work, however the call order here should not be relevant. It looks like changing preferredContentSize doesn’t propagate upwards (doesn’t call _preferredContentSizeDidChangeForChildViewController: if it’s the same value.)
