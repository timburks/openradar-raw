        Summary:

        Running xcodebuild from the commandline with a workspace which contains multiple schemes of the same name, it is non-deterministic which scheme will be used.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Create a workspace in which two schemes have the same name
        2. Use xcodebuild -workspace workspace.xcworkspace -scheme scheme multiple times

        Expected Results:

        There should be an error or a warning about the scheme name not being unique and in the latter case the same scheme should be used each time.

        Actual Results:

        A randomly selected scheme will be used.

        Regression:

        Xcodeâ€™s UI distinguishes the schemes by the Xcode project they reside in, making it possible for the user to resolve the conflict.
