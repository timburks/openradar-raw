    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen browsing unfamiliar code, it would be very useful to be able to temporarily enter a mode where the full definitions of all inferred types are inserted into the Swift code file for viewing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an unfamiliar Swift code file.\r\n2. Hold down Option key (or exact method up to you)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor all inferred types, the actual type is inserted where it would be if it had been typed into the file in the first place, possibly using some sort of special highlighting such that it's clear that this is not normal text content.\r\n\r\nWhen mode is exited, code file returns to normal state."
