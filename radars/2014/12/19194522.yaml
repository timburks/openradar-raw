    description: "Summary:\r\nUIContainerView subclasses that implement the UIAccessibilityContainer informal protocol do not get their methods called, except for indexOfAccessibilityElement.  Custom ordering of elements provided by UIAccessibilityContainer is not obeyed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample app is provided.  Run on an iPad.  It should provide a two-column collection view containing 8 labels.  Activate VoiceOver, and swipe side-to-side to navigate between them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccessibleCollectionView's implementation of UIAccessibilityContainer should force the navigation cursor to move down the first column, then down the second column.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIAccessibilityContainer is ignored, and the navigation cursor moves row-by-row instead of down the column.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.1 (12B435)"
