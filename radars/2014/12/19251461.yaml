        Summary:
        Specifically the file and project templates that you can add to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/.

        Xcode’s templates appear to have become a lot more capable sometime since Xcode 4, which is great! I have a number of my own templates set up which inherit from Apple’s templates and change code style, add defaults I use commonly, and so forth. I’ve figured out what I have largely by reading Xcode’s templates in its app bundle, and by reading http://blog.boreal-kiss.net/2011/03/11/a-minimal-project-template-for-xcode-4/ — plus a LOT of trial and error. However, there are still things I just can’t figure out, because e.g. there’s no extant template using some particular feature.

        Specifically, I would like to see documentation covering:

        - the possible plist keys/values
        - how they interact (e.g. the relationship between Nodes and Definitions)
        - what Apple’s extant templates are for, and how one should use them (e.g. when would one want to add Language Choice to the ancestors list?)
        - at a high level, how to add files to a project using a template

        I know this is a tall order—that’s a lot of documentation for something that you’re probably not expecting/intending folks to muck with much—but it would be extremely helpful for a lot of iOS consultancies, I’m certain; and it would be specifically very helpful for me.

        In the interim, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d love to know how to do a couple of things (if they’re even possible):

        - add a file to the root folder (i.e. beside the .xcodeproj) instead of to the per-target subfolder
        - add a file without including it in the project at all (e.g. to add a .gitignore file or a top-level .xcworkspace to the folder)

        Thank you very much for taking the time to implement such a powerful feature! ❤️
