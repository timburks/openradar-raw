        Summary:
        It should be possible to test the Short-Look notification Interface in the simulator even though the Short-Look notification is not customizable. Developers should be able to see how their app name, icon, and tint colors will render when a Short-Look notification is present.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add a scheme with the Notification executable
        2) Build and run
        3) Long-Look notification is shown

        Expected Results:
        When testing notifications there should be a way to see the Short-Look notification.

        Actual Results:
        Only the Long-Look notification can be tested on the simulator.
