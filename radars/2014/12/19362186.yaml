    description: "Summary:\r\nWeeks start on Mondays in Germany. However, when I print from the calendar app, the printout shows weeks starting at Tuesday. There are a multitude of threads regarding this issue on discussions.apple.com (eg https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6560780)\r\n\r\nI set the start of week to \"Monday\" both in my Mac's System Preferences (\"Language&Region\") and in the Calendar App's setting dialog. I expect my printouts to honor these settings. \r\n\r\nNote that when I change either the system setting or the calendar's setting to a week start of Sunday, I am able to print off a week starting in Monday.\r\n\r\nMore interesting even, when I set both settings to a week start of Tuesday, my printout starts on Thursday!\r\n\r\nI have included several screenshots to illustrate the problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sd2qi54dmeszd5v/Mon-Mon-%3ETues.png\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/buipmko2gavtmob/Mon%2BSun-%3EMon.png\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ztug9tmfd3fq725/Mon%2BTue-%3EWed.png\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yd0e5cxavrpvt1g/Tue%2BTue-%3EThur.png\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Goto System Preferences -> Language&Region and set First day of Week to \"Monday\"\r\n2. In the Calendar App's preferences -- on the General tab -- set \"Start week on\" to \"Monday\"\r\n3. In the Calendar App select \"File\" -> \"Print\"\r\n4. In the Print Dialog, Select View: \"Week\" or \"Month\" \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the printout to honor the Calendar App's settings and print a week starting with MONDAY.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first day of the week in both print preview and the actual printout is TUESDAY, not Monday, as was specified.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCalendar Version 8.0 (2026)\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that the calendar printout algorithm adds a correction factor of both the App setting and the system settings, thus leading to a \"double compensation\". \r\n\r\nSay: Default = Sunday = 0\r\nSystem says week starts on Monday. \"Oh, I must add one day\", the calendar thinks.\r\nCalendar app says week starts on Monday.  \"Oh, I must add one day\", the calendar thinks.\r\n\r\n\"So obviously, I have to add TWO days, and print off a week that starts on Tuesday\".\r\n\r\nWell, no ... ;)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe problem only occurs when the user specifies a start of week in the system(!) settings that is not Sunday."
