    description: "Summary:\r\nI've notice this since early Xcode 6 release and thought it something to be fixed in later releases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create Objective C two projects. The source from one project is compiled into embedded framework that is included by the second project.\r\n2. Xcode should be able to open source files for framework in second project during active debug sessions. A breakpoint moved to 'User' will allow this to happen.\r\n\r\nEven after debugging stops, this slowness continues.\r\n\r\n1. Stop Debugger and close second project. Editing returns to expected speed and functionality.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that editing of source in any project not slow down like this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nObserver that editing of any framework source file in either containing project or in second project lags. Auto-completion fails to update selected option in popover yet changes the suggested signature in edit pane. Quick-help works after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.1.1 (6A2008a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDeleting Intermediate and Derived data does not alleviate this problem.\r\nI am also not seeing and significant CPU or Disk access usage while this slowness is being observed."
