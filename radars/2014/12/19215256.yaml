    description: "Summary:\r\nWe released a few days ago a new version of our main app, the main feature being Handoff support.\r\nThe night after the release, our web server got around many requests at once at midnight, all requests being for /apple-app-site-association. All those requests had a user agent of swcd, for exampe:\r\nswcd (unknown version) CFNetwork/711.1.16 Darwin/14.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRelease a new version of an iOS app with Handoff support.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven if all the devices must get the last version of that file, make sure they don't all try to get it at the same time. For example add a random wait before downloading to not overload the servers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the iOS devices with automatic update turned on try to download the same file at midnight.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso we have mentioned to this problem to technical support team.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS devices with Handoff support."
