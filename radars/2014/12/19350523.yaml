        Summary:
        Safari constantly nags me to install the Java Runtime Environment to view certain web content that as far as I know does not require Java.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Browse the web.


        Expected Results:
        Web sites load as normal, without any warnings.

        Actual Results:
        A “To view this web content, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment” modal dialog appears seemingly at random when loading various websites.

        Regression:
        This did not happen, IIRC, in Mavericks. It has occurred in Safari 8.0 and 8.0.1 as well running under 10.10 and 10.10.1.

        Notes:
        This happens on Github, Spring Ahead, Ars Technica, and others. None of them appear to be trying to display a Java applet. If there’s something specific triggering the dialog, I don’t know what it is or how to find it. The last website I went to that this specifically happened is https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/blob/master/doc/webp-container-spec.txt
