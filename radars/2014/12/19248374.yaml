    description: "WKInterfaceMap is specified to open the maps app on tap. Weâ€™d like to see an enhancement to launch the maps app and start a navigation to a specified destination.\r\n\r\nThis could be either a replacement of the standard WKInterfaceMap tap action of just opening the Maps app. Alternatively, it would be great to be able to start this action programmatically."
