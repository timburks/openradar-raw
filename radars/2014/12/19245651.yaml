    description: "Project referenced available at https://github.com/dpassage/SubclassTest\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have an app written in a mix of Objective-C and Swift, and some test written in both Objective-C and Swift. For testing purposes, I want to subclass some of the classes in the main target in my testing target.\r\n\r\nIf I create a Swift subclass of an Objective-C class, everything's fine. If I create a Swift subclass of a Swift class, I then start to see an error when compiling the Objective-C test:\r\n\r\nIn file included from /Users/dpassage/tmp/SubclassTest/SubclassTestTests/SubclassTestTests.m:12:\r\n/Users/dpassage/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SubclassTest-dkjavthdjraroyfizogmnafydzkw/Build/Intermediates/SubclassTest.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/SubclassTestTests.build/DerivedSources/SubclassTestTests-Swift.h:67:9: fatal error: module 'SubclassTest' not found\r\n@import SubclassTest;\r\n ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnvironment: Original 15\" Retina Macbook Pro running Yosemite 10.10.1. Bug reproduced using both Xcode 6.1.1 and 6.2 beta 2 (6C95a).\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project. Build and run the tests with command-U. You should see it build and run the tests with no errors.\r\n2. Select the file \"FakeRatchet.swift\" in the SubclassTestTests group. Check the box under Target Membership to add it to the SubclassTestTests target.\r\n3. Try to build and run the tests again. You should see the error above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject to either compile and run the tests successfully, or report a comprehensible error I can address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode reports the compilation error included in the description.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 from the app store (not a GM seed).\r\n\r\nError seen with Xcode both Version 6.2 (6C95a) (beta 2) and Version 6.1.1 (6A2006)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SubclassTest.tgz' was successfully uploaded."
