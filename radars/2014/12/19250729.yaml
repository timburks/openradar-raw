    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you download a file that you previously uploaded to a bug, Radar knows how big the file is, but Safari doesn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit a radar with a large file attached.\r\n2. Click the paperclip icon to see the files.\r\n3. Click a file to download it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Safari Downloads popup shows a determinate progress bar because it knows how big the file is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Safari Downloads popup shows an indeterminate progress bar, presumably because the server isn't sending the header that the browser needs to know the file size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0.2 (10600.2.5)\r\n10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/Yy4b"
