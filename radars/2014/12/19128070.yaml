    description: "Roger Nolan03-Dec-2014 12:27 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEnforcing a 1:1 link between iTC account, TestFlight login and ITC account means that testers who are internal testers for more than one account need to log in and out of multiple iTunes accounts on their handset. This is not straight forward for non-technical people and cumbersome for everyone. Multiple iTC accounts is relatively common: brands have multiple agencies working on their projects or agency employees work on multiple customer accounts\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust step outside the Apple and try to use iTC.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTestFlight should be easier to use than it was when you bought it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n It's not it's much much harder to use.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ncurrent iTC.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
