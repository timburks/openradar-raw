    description: "Summary:\nI’m not sure exactly which component update sparked this change, but iTunes no longer displays iOS devices when they are not directly connected via USB, despite the fact that the devices are all set with “Sync with this iPad/iPhone over Wi-Fi” turned on. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nConnect iOS device. Open iTunes, verify that “Sync with this iPad over Wi-Fi” is checked. Sync. Disconnect the device.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe iOS device remains in the iTunes UI and can be clicked on and sync’ed through Wi-Fi even when not USB-connected.\n\nActual Results:\nDevice disappears."
