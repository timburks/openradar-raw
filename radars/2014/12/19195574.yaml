    description: "Summary:\nThe current 8.2 beta seems to relocate the “iPad” or “iPhone” entry in the AirPlay destinations list to the bottom of the list. In the past, it was always the first item. This seems fine on iPhone, but putting it at the bottom of the iPad’s floating destination list makes no sense and is a PITA.\n\nThe underlying issue is that the iPad destinations list is for some reason vertically compressed so that only two or three destinations can be seen at once. (See attached images.) The destinations list should really expand vertically to accommodate all the possible destinations at once. I filed a separate bug about that a while ago, but evidently it’s not going to be fixed. \n\nSo, given that for some reason you do want to limit the size of the destinations list, it makes things significantly less usable when “iPad” moves to the bottom of the list. Manual scrolling through several “pages” of destinations is now required to get back to “iPad”. Given that iPad is likely to be the most frequently selected destination, it makes no sense that it’s in the least accessible position."
