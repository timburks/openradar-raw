        Summary:
        I don’t know what’s causing this, but every time I try to open the sole swift file in this workspace, which happens to be the tests, Xcode crashes.

        This is on 10.10.2 beta 14C68m.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the project which I will attach in a moment.
        2. Open Quickly… or navigate to the tests in the file navigator and open them.


        Expected Results:
        I expected to see the tests.


        Actual Results:
        Xcode crashed.


        Regression:
        This hasn’t happened with any other workspace. I dunno?


        Notes:
        I will attach a zip of the repo in just a moment.
