        Summary:
        In the header’s definition, the n_un field is a union, which I take it is unsupported in Swift. This union only contains a 32-bit integer, however, so I think it should be representable as a struct:

        struct nlist_64 {
            struct n_un {
                let n_strx: Int32
            }
            …
        }


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Look at how Swift imports the nlist_64 struct from mach-o/nlist.h


        Expected Results:
        I expected to see a n_un field with a n_strx field within it, or at least to see n_strx at the top level (which would also presumably be semantically valid?).


        Actual Results:
        It’s just omitted.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Only workaround I know of is to drop down to C.
