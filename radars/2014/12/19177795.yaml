        Summary:
        XCTestCase’s measureBlock method is handy for benchmarking, but it’s not obvious how to get from there to Instruments when I’ve regressed performance. It would be really nice to be able to immediately jump to profiling the tests—and especially *specific* tests—with a click or two. These runs shouldn’t be recorded as statistics (because they’re biased by the presence of the profiler), but I *should* be able to compare runs before and after in the absence of the profiler to ensure that I was successful.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A.


        Expected Results:
        N/A.


        Actual Results:
        N/A.


        Regression:
        N/A.


        Notes:
        N/A.
