    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I create a UITableViewCell myself in code, settings its frame manually to 320px wide, its accessory type to detail disclosure, calling layoutIfNeeded, then asking it for its content view frame, the result is 294 pt. When that same table view cell gets displayed on screen in a 320pt wide table view, and I again check its content view width, the result is 287pt. \r\n\r\nThese results should not differ. It is very useful to create a table view cell and ask it for sizes in code — creating a prototype cell and populating it with data is a common way to calculate cell height.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached Xcode project on the iPhone 5 simulator.\r\n2. Click Reload once.\r\n3. Look in the Xcode console.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Content view width: 287.000000\r\n2. Content view width: 287.000000\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Content view width: 294.000000\r\n2. Content view width: 287.000000\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLine 1 of the log is the size calculated before the cell is handed to the table view. Line 2 is calculated when a cell is being reused, i.e. it has already been given to the table view."
