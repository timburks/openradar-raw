    description: "Summary:\r\nApple has provided configuration profiles to allow developers to get additional debug logging (StateRestorationDebugLogging.mobileconfig) and a developer mode (StateRestorationDeveloperMode.mobileconfig) so that they can troubleshoot issues related to the State Preservation and Restoration API's.  These configuration profiles fail with \"Profile Installation Failed: The profile \"State Restoration Developer Mode\" is no longer valid\" on iOS 8 devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using an iOS 8 device, attempt to open the attached configuration profiles.  The iPhone Configuration Utility does not recognize the settings so an over the air installation must occur. You can also get the originals on the Apple Developer Download page (https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) by searching for \"restoration\".  The \"restorationArchiveTool for iOS 7\" is the result you are looking for.\r\n2. Choose \"Install\" after opening.\r\n3. Enter passcode if required\r\n4. Get error message\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessful installation of profile\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError message:  \"Profile Installation Failed: The profile \"State Restoration Developer Mode\" is no longer valid\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411) for iPhone 6 Plus / iOS 8.0.2 (12A405) for iPhone 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 16GB, AT&T using LTE / iPhone 6 16GB, AT&T using LTE\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StateRestoration DebugLogging.mobileconfig' and 'StateRestoration DeveloperMode.mobileconfig' were successfully uploaded."
