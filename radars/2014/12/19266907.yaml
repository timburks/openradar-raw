    description: "We are seeing cookies stripped from requests that result from a 302 redirect for users using Safari 8 with the \"Allow from current website only\" privacy setting. This was discovered while debugging an issue where users were unable to authorize an application using OAuth with Safari. A typical OAuth flow is:\r\n\r\n1. Client application/site does a 302 redirect (or directly links to) the OAuth provider.\r\n2. OAuth provider validates the user is logged in and lets the user authorize the client application.\r\n3. OAuth provider does a 302 redirect (or meta-refresh) back to the client application with a `code` to be used to exchange for a valid OAuth token.\r\n\r\nWe are seeing cookies stripped from the requests resulting from the 302 redirect that occurs in step 1 and step 3. Despite them being functionally similar, the meta-refresh redirection approach does not strip cookies from the request back to the client application. From a privacy perspective it seems these two approaches (302 vs. meta-refresh) should work the same (i.e. they should either both strip cookies or both not strip cookies). From a functional perspective, many sites rely on cookie bearing 302 redirects for OAuth (and likely other use cases). So, the hope is that this is a bug and that cookies should be sent along with requests that result from a 302 redirect (or meta-refresh).\r\n\r\nAlso submitted a webkit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139683"
