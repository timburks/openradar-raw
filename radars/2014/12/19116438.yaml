    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to fully script my integration testing workflow\r\nAs a developer or continuous integration server\r\nI want to load my newly compiled app onto my device from the command-line without hacks\r\n\r\nRight now, the only two ways I've found to load an app onto a device from the command line are:\r\n\r\n1. Use xcodebuild(1) with a buildaction of \"test.\" This is a hack because I don't want to run unit tests. I just want the app on the device so I can run integration tests.\r\n2. Use a third-party tool like ios-deploy[1], which is GPL'ed (I strongly prefer MIT or Apache2 licenses) and apparently uses private Apple API (and is therefore liable to break).\r\n\r\nI want something like a buildaction of \"load\" (or \"deploy\" or ...) on xcodebuild(1) that simply installs the application onto the specified destination.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. At the command line, run:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -project MyApp.xcodeproj -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos -scheme MyApp -destination \"platform=iOS,name=Juliette\"  build test\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to invoke xcodebuild with \"deploy\" (or some other name) instead of \"test\", like this:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -project MyApp.xcodeproj -configuration Debug -sdk iphoneos -scheme MyApp -destination \"platform=iOS,name=Juliette\"  build deploy\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRunning with the buildaction of \"test\" works, but it runs tests on the device, which is more than what I want to do."
