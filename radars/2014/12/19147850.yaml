    description: "Duplicate of 19147873 (Open)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode 6 calls home every time it needs to sign an Ad Hoc build, ignoring the local signing assets. Xcode should use the local assets if they are available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download your signing assets like we've been doing for YEARS\r\n2. Open up and configure a MITM proxy\r\n3. Go through the steps of signing an ad hoc build\r\n4. Note that Xcode makes a web request in order to download provisioning profiles, ignoring what you have locally\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should use local signing assets first if they are available, and only download missing ones or ones that have been updated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode phones home and downloads everything all the time."
