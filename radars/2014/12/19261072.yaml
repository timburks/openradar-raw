    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a HTML5 based web app which contains a text editor. I have handled undo/redo actions inside js code by registering \"onkeypress\". But when i use my app inside UIWebview i am not able to handle undo/redo events because of undoManager of UIWebView. No \"onkeypress\" event is fired on the document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScenario 1:\r\n1. Create an HTML page with a contenteditable div\r\n2. Register key events on div created above\r\n3. press cmd+z\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\njs function registered for key events was not called. Instead only 'input' event is called when content has changed by NSUndoManager\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\njs function should be called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
