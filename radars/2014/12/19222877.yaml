    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently, the photo returned from -[ALAssetRepresentation fullScreenImage] has Photos.app CIFilters applied, but the photo data returned from -[ALAssetRepresentation getBytes:fromOffset:length:error] does not have the CIFilters applied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Edit a photo in Photos.app\r\n2. Open an app that queries ALAssetsLibrary for the fullScreenImage and the full size image that you just edited.\r\n3. Compare and notice that they're different.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe full screen image and the full size image would have the same filters applied. Or, if the full size image is still processing, the unedited full screen image would be returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe full screen image and the full size image have different sets of filters applied.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and iOS Simulator"
