    description: "Closed: too old\r\n\r\nWhen developing a LaunchAgent for OS X that functions as a keyboard proxy, you cannot post keyboard events created with CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent functions.\r\nUsing the deprecated CGPostKeyboardEvent function however works.\r\nPlease check the supplied sample code (modified PreLoginAgentCocoa example) and console log, which shows the window server messages.\r\n\r\nI can provide a modification that will show the problem more extensively.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. have a mac with a user account that requires authentication on login window (no automatic login)\r\n1. Install Xcode, build the supplied example\r\n2. install the supplied launchd plist to /Library/LaunchAgents\r\n3. install the build .app into /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools\r\n4. restart the machine\r\n5. on login window, press the button labeled \"Keyboard\" in the example application window\r\n6. after login, check console messages for Window server not available messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindow server should be available and the keyboard event should be posted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error is logged in the system.log and no keyboard event is posted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X >= 10.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to use deprecated CGPostKeyboardEvent function when running in login window"
