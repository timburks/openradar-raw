    description: "Summary:\r\n-[UINavigationController pushViewController:animated:] includes a flag that can prevent animation when adding a new view controller to the navigation controller's stack. The resulting effect is that the view snaps into place, immediately updating the contents of the screen (including the navigation bar).\r\n\r\n+[UIView performWithoutAnimation:] is documented to \"disable a view transition animation.\" However, when used to wrap a block that calls -pushViewController:animated:, it does not succeed â€“ the new view controller's view is still animated onto the UINavigationController's stack, as though the without-animation block did not exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app\r\n2. Tap \"Flag\" and observe the lack of animation\r\n3. Tap \"Back\"\r\n4. Tap \"Block\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new view controller snaps into place as it did when \"Flag\" was chosen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new view controller animates into place.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AnimatedPushTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
