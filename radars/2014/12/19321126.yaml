    description: "I have a mixed Swift/Obj-C project in which I'm making a Swift class which subclasses NSObject and implements NSObjectProtocol.\r\n\r\nIn that class, I'm overriding isEqual and hash for my own purposes. I then want to use that class from Objective-C code.\r\n\r\nIn the imported \"project-Swift.h\" header, my hash property gets imported as NSInteger. This conflicts with the definition of hash in the NSObject protocol definition, which is NSUInteger. This creates a warning that I can't get rid of.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen and build the attached project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject should build without warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject reports a warning in \"HashWarning-Swift.h\" which I can't get rid of.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS Yosemite 10.10.1\r\nReproduces in both Xcode Version 6.1.1 (6A2006) and Version 6.2 (6C101)"
