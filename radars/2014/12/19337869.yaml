    description: "Summary:\r\nAs developers we are allowed to create iCloud Containers and optionally associate them with App IDs. Once created, the containers can never be deleted, even if they contain no data and have never been associated with an App ID.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to delete empty iCloud containers, or at  least delete containers that have never had an App ID association. At the moment, once a container is created there seems to be no way to remove it at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into iOS Dev Center\r\n2. Under Identifiers click iCloud Containers\r\n3. Create an iCloud Container\r\n4. No way to delete the container once created?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be some set of conditions that, if met, allow for the deletion of the iCloud container. For example, immediately after creating the container, I should be able to delete it. Or, if it has never been associated with an App ID, I should be able to delete it. Ideally, it would be nice to be able to delete any completely empty container (although I understand that might not be possible).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce an iCloud Container is deleted, there is absolutely no way to delete it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a (real-world) example, I was having issues with an iCloud enabled app so I created an iCloud container for testing purposes. Before even associating the container with an App ID, the original issue was resolved. Now I have this new, unassociated iCloud Container in my account with no way to remove it. I even opened a DTS case to remove it and they were unable to."
