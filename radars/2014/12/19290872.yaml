        Summary:
        UITextView implements the UITextInput protocol. Yet some text input bypassed this protocol and call directly into private API without any chance over intervention!


        Steps to Reproduce:
        See the attached sample project:
        - Subclass UITextView
        - Observe -deleteBackward is NEVER called
        - Observe -_deleteBackwardAndNotify: is ALWAYS called

        Expected Results:
        At least one funnel through public API in the callstack.

        Actual Results:
        No way of intercepting backwards delete other than through private API.


        Regression:
        This is a MAJOR regression in our eyes. This behavior was as expected at least until iOS 7.2.2.

        Notes:
        Please provide the best-suited workaround. At the moment weâ€™re overriding -_deleteBackwardAndNotify: and call the publicly available -deleteBackward.
