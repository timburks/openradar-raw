The three iCloud groups all connect to the same data, and changing one changes the data behind all three. I believe this happened either during the update to 10.9, or when I first configured iCloud Keychain  - I can't remember, and I can't figure out how to correct it. All three instances of iCloud show up in the Contacts -> Preferences -> Accounts page, but I can't remove any of the three without disconnecting from iCloud altogether.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'2014-12-19 at 4.45 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
