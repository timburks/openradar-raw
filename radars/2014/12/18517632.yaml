    description: "Summary:\r\nSeveral modern authentication protocols, such as SCRAM (rfc5802) and enrollment-over-TLS (rfc7030), make use of TLS channel binding (see rfc5056 and rfc5929) to improve security. In order to implement these, the client needs access to some data from the SSL negotiation process (specifically the Finished messages). There is currently no way to retrieve that data.\r\n\r\nRequest: Two additional APIs:\r\n\r\n1. Have some way to retrieve that data from an SSLContextRef.\r\n\r\n2. Some way to gain access to the SSLContextRef from the NSURLRequest when it is reading from its HTTPBodyStream, or a KVObservable property on the NSURLRequest which can be used to update the HTTPBody when the request is about to be sent on a new channel, or a delegate method on NSURLSession that can be used to update this information, or something like that.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Getting the data from a plain SSLContextRef is needed for non-HTTP protocols that might be using SCRAM. Getting the data from a NSURLRequest is needed for HTTP-based protocols; a request might be sent multiple times (re-authentications, redirects, etc.) so it is necessary to be able to update the body when the request's channel changes.\r\n\r\nConcern: It should also be possible to alter a request's headers according to the TLS channel binding information, but I don't see a good way to shoehorn that capability into the NSURL loading machinery.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nfunctionality is not there\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, OSX 10.10"
