    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIPageViewController crashed with the exception \"NSInternalInconsistencyException: No view controller managing visible view\" while a user was swiping through a UIPageViewController that contained view controllers with embedded UIWebViews. The user appeared to have begun a page turn with one finger (possibly an accidental thumb pan), and continued to swipe through pages using another finger while still holding down the other, resulting in one long pan gesture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIPageViewController with view controllers that contain UIWebViews.\r\n2. Set page view controller's transition style to UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll.\r\n3. Load more than 3 pages into the page controller.\r\n4. Slightly pan to the next page with your thumb at the edge of the screen, but do not release.\r\n5. Use another finger to swipe back and forth through pages.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIPageViewController should not cause a crash with the UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll transition style.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash with \"NSInternalInconsistencyException: No view controller managing visible view\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 Build 12A365\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe were not able to reproduce this crash again.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 WiFi"
