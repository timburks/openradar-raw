    description: "Summary:\r\nI am having an issue with the installation of WiFi configuration profiles after updating to iOS8.\r\n\r\nWith iOS7 the installation of a WiFi profile (with 20 WiFi networks) just takes 2 or 3 seconds, but using iOS8 the installation of the same WiFi profile can take up to an hour. During this time the iPhone becomes slow and the user is not able to enter into the WiFi settings of the phone.\r\n\r\nI have tried the installation of the same WiFi profile in different scenarios:\r\n\r\niPhone 4 / 4S with iOS 7: Takes 2 or 3 seconds\r\niPhone 5 / 5S with iOS 7: Takes 2 or 3 seconds\r\niPhone 5 / 5S with iOS8 (8.0/8.1/8.2): Takes up to an hour\r\niPhone 6 with iOS8: Takes up to an hour\r\niPhone 6 plus with iOS8: Takes 5 seconds aprox.\r\niPad Air 2 with iOS 8: Takes 5 seconds aprox.\r\n\r\nAlso tried with the profile signed by Thawte using openssl_pkcs7_sign and not signed with the same result.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enter the url where the mobileconfig file is linked from Safari using iPhone 5 with iOS8 (There are about 20 WiFi networks in the profile)\r\n2. I am redirected to the Install-Configuration-Profile Screen (the profile is Verified (in green))\r\n3. I click on Install\r\n4. I accept the installation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the profile installs into the device in a few seconds (like with iOS7) and be able to continue using my iPhone without problems\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe installing spinner appears and nothing more happens for several minutes\r\n\r\nFrom my experience: The installation takes up to an hour (aprox.) (About two minutes for each WiFi added within the profile)\r\n\r\nIf I let the installing screen in background to continue using my iPhone while the profile installation, the iPhone becomes slower and I am not able to access the WiFi Settings (ocasionally the home button could not work or the background apps cannot be accessed...)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNOTE: Also tested with the same result using: iPhone6 and iOS8.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 32GB movistar, using 3G"
