    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn 10.10.0 and 10.10.1, I've noticed an issue when enabling FileVault 2 via System Preferences when using an institutional recovery key. System Preferences does not give the logged-in user an opportunity to enable additional users, seems to hang, then automatically restarts without prompting the user. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n\r\n2. Select the FileVault preference pane.\r\n\r\n3. Click the lock to unlock the FileVault preference pane\r\n\r\n4. Click the Turn on FileVault... button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. A list of users that can be enabled for FileVault 2 is displayed. The logged-in user account is marked with the green checkbox that shows that the account is enabled.\r\n\r\n2. A message is displayed that a recovery key has been set by a company, school or institution.\r\n\r\n3. A message prompting the user to restart is displayed.\r\n\r\n4. Once the Restart button has been clicked, the FileVault 2 initialization process continues and restarts the Mac.\r\n\r\n5. The Mac restarts to the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. A message is displayed that a recovery key has been set by a company, school or institution.\r\n\r\n2. System Preferences then displays no additional messages and will appear to hang for up to two minutes.\r\n\r\n4. The Mac restarts without further input from the user.\r\n\r\n5. The Mac restarts to the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the behavior, I've posted videos showing the expected behavior using 10.9.5 and the actual behavior in 10.10.1.\r\n\r\n10.9.5 video: http://youtu.be/flrAygWuGp0\r\n\r\n10.10.1 video: http://youtu.be/cawwruWudYo\r\n\r\nVideos were made using OS X VMs hosted in VMware Fusion 7.1.0."
