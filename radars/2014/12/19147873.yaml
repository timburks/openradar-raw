    description: "Summary:\r\nRelated to rdar://19147850\r\n\r\nSince Xcode _needs_ to phone home every time a build is signed, it cannot sign builds while offline.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disconnect from the internet\r\n2. Attempt to sign an ad hoc build\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should be able to use local signing assets to sign builds, especially when offline\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode cannot create a signed build."
