        Summary:
        enums are ignored by a couple of different bits of the Xcode UI. This one is about the Show Document Items menu (⌃6 by default) not showing them at all.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In a .swift file, define two enums, one with a method and one without
        2. Select the View > Standard Editor > Show Document Items menu item or trigger it with ⌃6


        Expected Results:
        I expected to see the enums, with their cases and any methods/properties/etc nested beneath them.


        Actual Results:
        The enums are not listed there. Oddly enough, the method _is_ listed, but the enum it’s in is not.


        Regression:
        I can’t recall if I’ve ever seen enums listed in there.


        Notes:
        Extensions on enums are listed. Structs are listed. Classes are listed. Just not enums.
