    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) explains there can be 2 actions for a notification: a positive one and a negative one.\r\nANCS never includes the positive action when an application provides one (bug 1).\r\n\r\nOnly a negative \"Dismiss\" action is included. The label text that ANCS includes for the negative action is always the same \"Dismiss\", even though the app has set a different (customized) text (bug 2).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached example app\r\n2. Connect a Pebble smartwatch (or another ANCS client device) and monitor the traffic\r\n3. Observe that when sending a notification from the example app, the positive action is never included by ANCS\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. ANCS should include the positive action for notifications (bug 1).\r\n2. ANCS should include the action's label text as the app has assigned them (bug 2).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. ANCS does NOT include the positive action for notifications (bug 1).\r\n2. ANCS does NOT include the action's label text as the app has assigned them (bug 2).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 - 8.2 beta 2, 12D445d\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iOS 8.2 beta 2"
