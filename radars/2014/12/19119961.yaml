    description: "Description:\r\nWe would like access to real-time heart rate data from the Apple Watch hardware. This data would be used to update a display (glance?) in our watch app showing the user's current heart rate during an exercise. Historical heart rate data could be displayed in a graph and associated with an HKWorkout in HealthKit.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would like to provide notifications when the user's heart rate falls above or below their target range, which will vary based on several factors, including doctor recommendations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWatchKit API contains classes and methods to access a stream of heart rate reading from the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatchKit API doesn't include classes and methods to access a stream of heart rate reading from the Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator Version 8.2 (553.3)\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:\r\nXcode 6.2 beta (6C86e), iOS 8.2 beta (12D436)\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:"
