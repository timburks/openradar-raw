    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you specify size classes in .xib files then changes that you make in Regular x Regular size class are not applied on iOS 7 iPad.\r\n\r\nThis problem is reproduced only with .xib files, not storyboards which work as stated in documentation:\r\n\"Size classes are backward compatible when:\r\n- The app is built using Xcode version 6 or later;\r\n- The deployment target of the app is earlier than iOS 8;\r\n- The value of the height component is not compact.\"\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project to demonstrate the issue. There is a view in CustomView.xib file with two labels in it: first one with text \"iPhone\" and second one with text \"iPad\". \"iPad\" label and its constraints are disabled in Any x Any size class and enabled in Regular x Regular size class, \"iPhone\" label and its constraints are enabled in Any x Any size class and disabled in Regular x Regular size class. View from CustomView.xib is loaded and added to ViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project in attached archive.\r\n2. Run it on any iPad with iOS 7.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should see label with \"iPad\" text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou will see label with \"iPhone\" text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1(6A1052d), OS X 10.10 (14A389)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24172860/how-can-xcode-6-adaptive-uis-be-backwards-compatible-with-ios-7-and-ios-6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SizeClassIOS7Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/imaks/SizeClassIOS7Bug"
