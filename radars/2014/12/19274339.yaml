    description: "Summary:\r\nSourceKit incorrectly adds a `source.decl.attribute.private` attribute to public declarations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode with the environment variable `SOURCEKIT_LOGGING=3` (e.g. by launching from the command line with `export SOURCEKIT_LOGGING=3 && /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode`)\r\n2. Open a Swift file with a declaration using the `public` access control modifier (e.g. the attached sourcekit_acl_bug.swift file)\r\n3. Look at the SourceKit logs (you should see the attached sourcekit_acl_bug.json output in your SourceKit logs)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npublic declarations should have an attribute of `source.decl.attribute.public`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npublic declarations have an attribute of `source.decl.attribute.private`\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of Xcode that I could test exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis functionality would be very useful for 3rd parties integrating with SourceKit. For example, the jazzy documentation generator (https://github.com/realm/jazzy) has to rely on regular expressions to detect the access control level of declarations, which causes many mis-categorizations."
