    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a multiline WKInterfaceLabel with Width = “Relative to Container” and a negative adjustment and Height = “Size to Fit Content”, the label is cut off if the adjustment is large enough.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label height should be large enough to fit the content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label height is not large enough to fit the content and the text is truncated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe main use case for such a layout would be to position an image to the left of a multiline label. Of course I could define a fixed size for the label but then I can’t make use of the larger screen of the 42 mm watch (or would have to calculate the width at runtime which is even more inconvenient)."
