    description: "Summary:\nThe documentation for \"Do not remove or modify the SyncServices folder\" previously had an powerful and accurate statement to avoid any modification to the SyncServices folder.  The current documentation for kbase article http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201657 is missing the beginning statement: \"As if it were a swarm of bees, you should stay away from the SyncServices folder\".  I would suggest returning this important piece of information to effectively articulate for future readers the importances of avoiding SyncServices folder and re-instate the above documented statement. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nVisit the current documentation (as of 2014-12-22) at: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201657 \n\nExpected Results:\nInsert at the beginning the statement \"As if it were a swarm of bees, you should stay away from the SyncServices folder\" as seen at: https://web.archive.org/web/20140105015852/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1865\n\nActual Results:\nThe \"swarm of bees\" statement is missing.  In the future, I may be inclined to modify or move the SyncServices folder as there are no bees to warn me of my actions."
