    description: "I think it's worth making some tweaks to how optional unwrapping works, and I have two suggestions. Here's an example of a fairly common scenario:\r\n\r\nvar a: Int? = 1\r\nvar b: Int? = 2\r\nvar c: Int? = 3\r\n\r\nif let realA = a {\r\n  if let realB = b {\r\n    if let realC = c {\r\n      let sum = realA + realB + realC\r\n      println(\"Sum: \\(sum)\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nUnwrapping gets pretty cumbersome. The first problem is this deep nesting. Many times you don't really want to do anything if the optional is nil, you just want to handle the case where all of the variables have a value. Why not allow `if-let` to include multiple terms, the way you might with any other `if` statement, like so:\r\n\r\nvar a: Int? = 1\r\nvar b: Int? = 2\r\nvar c: Int? = 3\r\n\r\nif let realA = a && let realB = b && let realC = c {\r\n  let sum = realA + realB + realC\r\n  println(\"Sum: \\(sum)\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nSecondly, it's often irritating to come up with another name for the unwrapped variable, and you sometimes even see developers do things like `if let a = a`. In this case, the name `a` represents the unwrapped optional inside the `if` statement. Why not allow the language to do something like this:\r\n\r\nvar a: Int? = 1\r\nvar b: Int? = 2\r\nvar c: Int? = 3\r\n\r\n// Equal to if let a = a && let b = b && let c = c\r\nif let a && let b && let c {\r\n  let sum = a + b + c\r\n  println(\"Sum: \\(sum)\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt keeps the functionality of optionals in place, and adopts some of Swift's conciseness, while making the code less leggy."
