    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an NSTrackingArea is attached to a view in a Today extension (or, I’m told, any extension at all), the various methods it is supposed to call on its owner are never called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Mac project with a Today extension.\r\n\r\n1. Write an NSButton subclass with code like this:\r\n\r\n    var highlightTrackingArea: NSTrackingArea!\r\n    override func updateTrackingAreas()  {\r\n        super.updateTrackingAreas()\r\n        \r\n        removeTrackingArea(highlightTrackingArea)\r\n        highlightTrackingArea = NSTrackingArea(rect: bounds, options: .MouseEnteredAndExited | .ActiveAlways, owner: self, userInfo: nil)\r\n        addTrackingArea(highlightTrackingArea!)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    override func mouseEntered(theEvent: NSEvent!)  {\r\n        super.mouseEntered(theEvent)\r\n        println(“In mouseEntered”)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    override func mouseExited(theEvent: NSEvent!)  {\r\n        super.mouseExited(theEvent)\r\n        println(“In mouseExited”)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n3. Set breakpoints in those three methods if desired.\r\n\r\n4. Add an instance of that NSButton subclass to the extension’s nib file.\r\n\r\n5. Run the extension and mouse over the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmouseEntered() and mouseExited() are called as appropriate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThese methods are not called.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would like to have a button in my extension that changes appearance (replacing one icon with another) when moused over, but this is not currently possible because of this bug."
