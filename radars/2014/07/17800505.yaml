    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have mail items set to sort newest at the top, closing and opening the mail window causes the list to scroll the the bottom (the oldest items). This is undesirable.\r\nOn my system, inbox, junk and archive behave like this, but sent and trash do not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen mail, select your mail item list to sort by date, newest messages on top. \r\nYou must be showing your inbox.\r\nScroll to the top (your newest messages).\r\nClose the window using the red close button.\r\nOpen the window again by clicking on the Mail app icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list should remain scrolled to the most recent item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list shows scrolled to the bottom, the oldest items."
