    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dragging a file to the cocoa open file dialog the file is moved to the folder displayed by the dialog instead of chancing the directory of the dialog to the one of the dragged file.\r\nThis is a UX issue since Open dialog is suppose to deal with opening files, not act like a file manager. The change of behaviour is confusing and breaks the open dialog semantic.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Safari on OSX 10.10 beta4 (or any other native OS X 10.10 app that allows to open a file)\r\nPress cmd+O\r\nDrag a file from the desktop to the open file dialog\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dialog changes the current displayed folder to the Desktop folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog moves the file to the displayed folder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.10 beta 4"
