    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 6 provides the ability to Option-click an identifier to see the type associated with that identifier. This is very helpful for Swift code, which does not require explicit type declarations for many names.\r\n\r\nHowever, it can be cumbersome to use Option-click when checking several items. It would be helpful if the editor would automatically show types associated with identifiers when the mouse hovers over them, as data tips work while debugging.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite some Swift code\r\n\r\nPoint mouse at the names of a variable or function.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould like to see data tip displaying the type associated with the variable or function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHave to Option-click each name to see the information.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 3"
