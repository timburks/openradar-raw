        Summary:
        Safari 8 does not support OCSP stapling

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Visit one of these sites to show the browser's capabilities:
        https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html
        http://howsmyssl.com/

        Expected Results:
        Any modern browser should support OCSP stapling to improve performance of TLS handshakes as well as gain better MITM detection with spoofed certificates.

        Actual Results:
        Safari 8 still does not support OCSP stapling.

        Regression:
        This likely applies to the underlying SecureTransport.framework's capabilities.
