    description: "It's awesome that Safari 7.1/8 finally supports <img srcset>, but I noticed a little issue:\r\n\r\nImage source is determined at the time of loading and doesn't respond to changes in screen resolution. If I open a website using srcset on my old 1x display, images naturally load using 1x variant. However, when I  move the Safari window to my main Retina display, the images should be promoted to the 2x variant (that's what would happen if I was using background-image and resolution media queries). They don't."
