    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to specify pure Swift class as NIB file owner you will receive a crash at runtime with error similar to following:\r\n\r\n[NSObject 0x7bfa0cc0 setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key myView.\r\n\r\nWhere 'myView' is the name of an outlet that was connected to the owner using IB.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create swift class MyViewOwner\r\n2. Create NIB with single UIView\r\n3. Specify MyViewOwner as owner for the NIB created at step 2\r\n4. Connect the view as outlet to the owner\r\n5. Try to load nib in swift code. Code: NSBundle.mainBundle().loadNibNamed(\"MyView\", owner: myViewOwner, options: nil)\r\n6. Compile (no error or warning about fact that MyViewOwner is non KVC compliant class)\r\n7. Execute code by running the app. (runtime crash)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nError before compilation stating that: MyViewOwner class is not KVC thus cannot be specified as NIB owner.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nDoes not allow to set MyViewOwner as NIB owner at all. Like xCode does in case when we specify inappropriate string in class field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashed with error similar to:\r\n\r\n[NSObject 0x7bfa0cc0 setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key myView.\r\n\r\nCrush happens due to the reason that pure Swift class is not KVC compliant.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nxCode Version 6.0 (6A254o)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf we inherit MyViewOwner from NSObject everything is fine because NSObject class is KVC compliant"
