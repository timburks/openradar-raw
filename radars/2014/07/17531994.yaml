    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 8 introduces a Quick Reply feature for iMessage notifications, allowing the user to respond to an incoming message by expanding the notification to reveal a text field. As of beta 2, UIUserNotificationSettings.h doesn’t seem to provide a way of implementing this feature in third-party apps. Please consider adding a way to do so in a future release.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open UIUserNotificationSettings.h in Xcode 6\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. Method declarations and/or header docs explaining how to implement the Quick Reply feature in Messages.app on iOS 8\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. No API for implementing quick reply feature is available\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 beta 2 (12A4297e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy initial suggestion for implementing this would be a `BOOL allowsTextEntry` property on UIUserNotificationCategory, though I’m not sure how you’d get the text entered by the user back in the app delegate."
