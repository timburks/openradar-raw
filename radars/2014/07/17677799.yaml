    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's an issue with the NSStatusItem blinking when changing the NSStatusBarButton template image if:\r\n1. the button is currently highlighted\r\n2. the user has more than one display (status item window replicants are used)\r\n\r\nThe issue is particularly severe in my application, which has a timer and its representation in a status item. If the timer is short enough, the template image might update multiple times a second (which causes it to blink a lot)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSStatusItem\r\n2. Create an NSTimer which periodically updates the status item's image (as the NSStatusItem header suggests in beta 3, I'm using the button property directly â€” I'm setting the statusItem.button.image)\r\n3. Highlight the status item (I'm programatically setting statusItem.button.highlighted = true)\r\n4. Make sure you have two displays connected (in my case, Retina MacBook Pro + a non-retina display)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status item image smoothly changes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvery few frames, there's a white blink.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf it's a new bug to you, I can prepare a test case.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMore than one display\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[engineering asked for a test case]\r\n\r\nHere's the test case.\r\n\r\nI observed that the flicker happens more often in certain situations, e.g. when there are more screen updates going on. A sure way to trigger the flickering is to Ctrl+scroll to zoom in on the status item while it's highlighted.\r\n\r\nAlso note that in Beta 4, in addition to the flickering problem, the status item on inactive screen (on the replicant window) has a weird black \"highlight\" (when the status item is highlighted)"
