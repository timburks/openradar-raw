    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I add a CIFilter to a CALayer like this...\r\n\r\nfilteredLayer.filters = @[filter];\r\n\r\n...the filter works fine on a normal (1x) display. However, the same code running on a Retina (2x) display applies the filter, but the image is blurry.\r\n\r\nApplying the CIFilter to the image directly (not to a view) does not result in any noticeable blurring.  \r\n\r\nIf I don't apply the filter, the layer renders at the correct resolution.\r\n\r\nI don't think the blurriness is necessarily a 1x/2x issue â€“ it appears clearer than 1x would look but blurrier than 2x. It looks kind of like a box blur or resampling error.\r\n\r\nThe contentsScale attribute seems to be set correctly (it's 2).\r\n\r\nThis is on OS X Mavericks, and the same thing happens on the Yosemite beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n(Also occurs on 10.10 beta 3)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Retina display\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
