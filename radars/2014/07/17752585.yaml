        Summary:
        I received an iMessage and opened the Messages app to read it. Upon seeing that the message was still in my Notification Center, I tapped the X and then Clear to get rid of it, but it will not clear, despite how many times I have tried.

        Workaround: Reboot the device, and the notification disappears.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        No clear steps to reproduce.

        Expected Results:
        All notifications for an app should disappear when I tap Clear on them.

        Actual Results:
        This particular notification would not clear.
