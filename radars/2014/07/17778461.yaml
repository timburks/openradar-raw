    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, the iOS simulator captures command key sequences away from the simulated iOS device even when \"Simulate Hardware Keyboard\" is activated.\r\n\r\nOf course it makes sense for the Simulator to capture command keys so that we can use them, but not during \"Simulate Hardware Keyboard\" mode. In that mode, I want the Simulator to react to all keypresses just the same way the iOS device with a bluetooth keyboard connected would.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an iOS app in the simulator that recognizes command keys via hardware keyboard.\r\n2. Activate \"Simulate Hardware Keyboard\" mode in the Simulator\r\n3. Press some key commands using the Mac's keyboard\r\n4. Observe that command keys are not passed to the iOS app if they are command keys that are recognized by the Simulator (command C, for example)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that when I explicitly activate \"Simulate Hardware Keyboard\" then I really want my environment to act as if I was using a hardware keyboard on an iOS device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Simulator app is capturing keyboard commands instead of passing them on to the simulated iOS device."
