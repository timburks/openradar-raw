    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7 negative currency values for the locale en_US are surround by brackets, as it should be for financial negative values. See http://ux.stackexchange.com/a/1875\r\n\r\nSince iOS 7.1 (including iOS 8) this has changed and negative values are not surrounded anymore by brackets.\r\n\r\nIf this is the indented behaviour (what I do not believe), if would be nice to have it stated somewhere in the release notes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a NSNumberFormatter for currency style\r\n\r\nNSNumberFormatter *formatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];\r\nformatter.numberStyle = NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle;\r\n\r\n2. Set the locale to be en_US\r\n\r\nformatter.locale = [NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:@\"en_US\"];\r\n\r\n3. Create a string from a negative value\r\n\r\nNSString *string = [formatter stringFromNumber:@(-20.10)];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe variable `string` should be @\"($20.10)\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 7.1 and higher the string is @\"-$20.10\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRun the attached Xcode project on iOS 7.0 and iOS 7.1/8.0 beta 4 and see the printed string for locale \"en_US\" and you will see the differences.\r\n\r\nI've also attached the app output in txt files for iOS 7.0, 7.1 and 8.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator and iPhone 5NumberFormatter.zip - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NumberFormatter.zip' was successfully uploaded."
