    description: "Summary:\nThe compiler crashes when I try to compute the fixpoint of a higher-order function. In this case, the function is a left-fold-esque enumerator a la Oleg Kiselyov’s work on converting from cursors to enumerators and back (see Notes).\n\nI’ve reduced this as best I can.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Compile this hideously opaque but nevertheless near-minimal test case:\n\nfunc boom<T>(f: ((T, T -> T) -> T, T, (T -> T)) -> T) -> (T, T -> T) -> T {\n\tvar recursive: ((T, T -> T) -> T)!\n\treturn recursive\n}\n\n\nExpected Results:\nSuccess and joy, quickly turning to boredom and an inevitable move to the next interesting problem.\n\n\nActual Results:\n\U0001F4A5, and a sense of rapidly coming unglued as I try to work out how to produce this (crucial) fixpoint when I can’t give its type.\n\n\nRegression:\nDoesn’t crash if the second parameter of f is not a closure.\nDoesn’t crash if either parameter of f is omitted.\nApparently doesn’t require that the function actually do anything; the implicitly unwrapped function is just there to give it something to return, because it doesn’t crash if it can’t compile the thing in the first place.\n\n\nNotes:\nRelated reading on the Oleg Kiselyov’s work (which I believe was part of the lead-up to his implementations of and papers on Iteratees):\n\nhttp://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LL3-collections-enumerators.txt\nhttp://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/fold-stream.lhs\nhttp://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/enumerators-callcc.html\n\nUltimately, I desire a better way of bridging push and pull APIs. This comes up when trying to implement multireducibles a la zip as Clojure-style Reducers, and also when trying to generalize any (preferably lazy) formulation of map/filter/mapcat to signals of more than one argument."
