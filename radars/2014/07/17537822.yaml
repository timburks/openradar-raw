    description: "It's currently not possible to detect if the app's view is covered by a notification from some other app (like a text message).\r\n\r\nI develop a reading training app that shows a UITextView on full screen and uses word highlighting to guide users through the text. If a user is close to the top, the notification can cover the text. I'm unable to detect that and react to it accordingly.\r\n\r\nI'd expect to receive an NSNotification, similar to: UIApplicationWillChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification with a dictionary containing a key describing the visibility state of the notification's view.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the notification could be handled similarly to the extended status bar during a phone call."
