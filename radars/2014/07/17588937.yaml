        Summary:
        Apple Remote Desktop and VNC can't be connected to from Mavericks. Neither with ScreenSharing 1.5 nor with Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.2.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run 10.10 beta 3, enable ScreenSharing and/or Remote Management (ARD)

        Expected Results:
        A Mac running ScreenSharing or ARD Admin on OS X Mavericks should be able to connect, control and make other ARD tasks on a Yosemite Mac.

        Actual Results:
        The connection is not established at all.

        ARD Error message:

        Connection failed to “Yosemite Mac”.
        Please make sure that Screen Sharing (in the Sharing section of System Preferences) is enabled on the computer to which you are attempting to connect. Also make sure your network connection is working properly.


        Screen Sharing Error message:
        Connection failed to “x.x.x.x”.
        Please make sure that Screen Sharing (in the Sharing section of System Preferences) is enabled on the computer to which you are attempting to connect. Also make sure your network connection is working properly.




        Regression:
        This worked fine in Yosemite beta 2. (ARD 3.8 on the client side)
