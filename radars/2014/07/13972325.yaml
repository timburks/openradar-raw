    description: 'Summary: On iCloud.com, users can set custom repeat options for their Calendar events (e.g. every Monday and Tuesday), but on the actual Calendar iPhone app, this is not possible. Clearly this functionality is available, and so I''m not sure of the reason why it is not included in the native app.'
