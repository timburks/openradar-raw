    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a for loop over an array, it looks as though type inference looks at only the first value in the array to ascertain the type. I think it should look at all the values. Example: given this code:\r\n\r\n    for mult in [1, 2.0] {}\r\n\r\nThe type of `mult` is Int â€” even though there is a Double value there. However, given this code:\r\n\r\n    for mult in [1.0, 2] {}\r\n\r\nThe type of `mult` is Double. In my opinion, these two examples should produce the same type, Double. My guess is that the analyzer looks at only the first value in the array. It should look at them all.\r\n\r\nVersion: 6.0 (6A267n)"
