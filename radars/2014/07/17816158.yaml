    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UIScrollView with interactive zoom (viewForZoomingInScrollView), I use layoutSubviews to adjust the zooming view's frame, as was recommended in the WWDC sample code \"PhotoScroller 1.3\".\r\n\r\nIn iOS 8, there is now a glitch when animating back to rest from a small zoom scale; the zoom view jumps to an X-origin of 0 during the animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached sample project \"PhotoScrollerZoomAnimationBug\". (this is modified from the PhotoScroller sample project) in Xcode 6 and build against iOS 8 (Beta 4)\r\n\r\nPlace a breakpoint on the NSLog statement reading \"Breakpoint here to see animation glitch\"\r\n\r\nRun the project and pinch the image to shrink it, then let go. The breakpoint should fire.\r\n\r\nContinue from the breakpoint and watch the animation of the zoom view occur: the origin will suddenly jump to 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect that the frame in layoutSubviews would apply to the final frame of the zoom snapping animation, not apply immediately. \r\n\r\nThis was the behavior in iOS 7 and below\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust before the zoom snapping animation runs, the frame.origin.x of the zoom view immediately jumps to 0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 Verizon. Xcode 6/iOS 8b4 simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PhotoScrollerZoomAnimationBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
