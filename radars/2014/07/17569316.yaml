    description: "Today we can simulate location in different ways in iOS Simulator (Debug -> Location). Similarly, it would be great if there was a Debug->Time menu that would let us simulate the devices date/time in different ways. Very useful for apps that depends on date and time in different ways. \r\n\r\nA few possible options in this menu:\r\n\r\n- System date/time (default, like today)\r\n- Custom date/time (starts simulator with custom date/time and rolls from there each time).\r\n- Random date/time... (starts simulator with random date/time between x and y and rolls from there).\r\n- Time Jump (jumps between random date/time values. You can set interval to stay within and how often the time jump should occur).\r\n- Time Lapse (roll the clock at x speed from x to y. Repeat option)."
