    description: "Summary:\r\nI am trying to use the UIAutomation JavaScript API to set the location of my device.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 6, I am able to use the UIATarget.setLocation function.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 7 and iOS 8, the function returns true, but does not update the device's location.\r\n\r\nI used the sample project LocateMe to demonstrate.[1]  This example is not ideal, because it makes calls to several deprecated APIs and does not run (well) on iOS 8.  However, it exhibits the same behavior as the the app that I am currently working on and has the advantage of being public.\r\n\r\nI have attached 2 videos:  one for iOS 6 demonstrating the expected behavior and one for iOS 7 demonstrating the unexpected behavior.  I tried to capture an iOS 8 video, but when I launched the app with Instruments 6, the ui was unresponsive.\r\n\r\n[1] https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/samplecode/LocateMe/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. download LocateMe from the sample projects\r\n2. target an iOS 6 device, then build and run\r\n3. touch the 'track location' tab and confirm your location can be found.\r\n4. close the app\r\n5. start Instruments 5.1.1 and select the UIAutomation template\r\n6. target the LocateMe on iOS 6 device\r\n7. from the Script editor run with the boilerplate code (var = ...)\r\n8. repeat step 3\r\n9. in the Script editor, paste the following:\r\n\r\nvar target = UIATarget.localTarget();\r\nvar success = target.setLocation({\"latitude\":37.78358,\"longitude\":-122.4008});\r\ntarget.delay(0.2);\r\nif (success) {\r\n\tUIALogger.logPass(\"location changed\");\t\r\n} else {\r\n\tUIALogger.logFail(\"location did not change\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n10. execute the script\r\n10.1 repeat with an iOS 7 device using Instruments 5.1.1\r\n10.2 repeat with an iOS 7 device using Instruments 6.0\r\n10.3 repeat with an iOS 8 (b4) device using Instruments 6.0\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo see the location of my device change to 37.78, -122,40.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 6, my device location changed.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 7 + Instruments 5.1.1, my device location did not change.\r\nOn iOS 7 + Instruments 6.0, my device location did not change.\r\nOn iOS 8 (b4) + Instruments 6.0, my device location did not change.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion:\r\n* OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n* OS X 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nXcode 5.1.1\r\nInstruments 5.1.1 (55045)\r\n\r\nXcode6-Beta4\r\nInstruments 6.0 (56127.2)\r\n\r\niOS 6.14\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\niOS 8.0 b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19115497/uiautomation-working-in-ios-6-but-not-in-ios-7-uiatarget-setlocationwithoptions\r\n* https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/377\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nProblem occurs on iOS 7 (Instruments 5.1.1 and 6.0) and iOS 8 (Instruments 6.0).\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 5.1.1 on iOS 6 and iOS 7 Simulators, UIATarget setLocation works.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 6 b 4 on iOS 7 and iOS 8 Simulators, the LocateMe app never finds a location.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS6-demo.mp4' and 'iOS7-demo.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
