    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWith Touch ID disabled, the options are Immediately, 1 min, 5 mins, 15 mins, 1 hour and 4 hours. Users should still have those options when using Touch ID. Especially when using a device for development. Having to unlock the device before every build is pretty annoying and just causes us to turn off Touch ID."
