    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen paymentQueue:updatedDownloads: is called at the end of a download and for the download SKDownload *d\r\nd.downloadState == SKDownloadStateFinished  \r\n\r\nThe downloaded content is available at d.contentURL.path (at least in <contentURL.path>/Contents)\r\n \r\nIn ios7.x you can enumerate the files contentURL.path and <contentURL.path>/Contents, with:\r\n \r\n    NSArray *contentsDirectoryFiles = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:productPath error:&error];\r\n \r\nIn iOS 8 beta (1, 2, and 3) I'm getting Cocoa error 257 = NSFileReadNoPermissionError for contentsOfDirectoryAtPath. Also tried enumeratorAtPath and that returns an enumerator with  a count of 0. subpathsOfDirectoryAtPath also returns a 257 error.\r\n \r\n[[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:productPath isDirectory:&isDir] returns YES and isDir is YES\r\n \r\nFile attributes seem sensible. NSFilePosixPermissions of 0755 should allow the directory to be read.\r\n\r\nThe same code works fine on an iOS 7.1 device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an app with StoreKit to download apple-hosted In App Purchase.\r\n2. Use the generic (including the Apple-provided example) code to try to access the files at SKDownload.contentURL when SKDownload.downloadState == SKDownloadStateFinished\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to be able to enumerate the files at SKDownload.contentURL and copy them to a usable location for the App.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual results are Cocoa error 257 = NSFileReadNoPermissionError for contentsOfDirectoryAtPath. No files references are returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini retina 32gb wifi"
