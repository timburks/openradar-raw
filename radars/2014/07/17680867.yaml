    description: Unlike the former WebView class, the new WKWebView API doesn't seem to provide a means to access the underlying JSContext. This prevents code using the JavaScriptCore framework from acting on the JavaScript objects living in the context of the page loaded into the WKWebView. The provided WKUserContentController API is simply inefficient for marshalling and manipulating JS objects from native code. Therefore a new API should be added to provide access to the JSContext or JSContextRef that the WKWebView is running on.
