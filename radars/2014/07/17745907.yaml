    description: "Summary:\r\nInstance of UIWebView sets incorrect contentInsets and scrollIndicatorInsets when split keyboard pops up to the bottom of a screen (previously split keyboard has been dragged there). Mentioned insets stay the same even keyboard disappears and UIWebView's background is taking its place. This bug is reproduciable also on Safari. Problem described also: https://devforums.apple.com/message/919881#919881\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe easiest way is to reproduce on Safari:\r\n1. Open google.com (or any other page that contains <input>)\r\n2. Set focus for <input> element\r\n3. Split keyboard using pinch-out gesture\r\n4. Drag keyboard to the bottom of the screen using bottom right button with keyboard icon\r\n4a. Make sure that split keyboard is at the very bottom of a screen\r\n5. Lose focus of <input> or simply hide keyboard somehow\r\n6. Gain focus back to <input>\r\n7. Swipe up&down website to see UIWebView's background\r\n8. Lose focus of <input> to hide keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInsets are zeroing and no background canvas is visible on a screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWebsite has bottom insets and canvas background is visible: about 264/352px height (height the same as keyboard). Situation keeps the same when orientation changes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 (10A403), but seen on iOS7 too\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is reproducible both on custom UIWebView and Safari's UIWebView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3, iOS 6.0, Wifi"
