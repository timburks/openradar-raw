    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the documentation for SKTexture the phrase \"A number between 0.0 and 1.0\" is used often, usually along with an explanation that the value 0.0 or 1.0 is inclusive in that range. However, when using `textureByGeneratingNormalMapWithSmoothness:contrast:`, where the documentation states \"A number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much the texture should be smoothed before the normal map is generated. A value of 0.0 means that the texture is not smoothed at all before being processed\", a smoothness of 1.0 will cause an EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n2. Create a new Sprite Kit project\r\n3. Create an SKTexture\r\n4. Attempt to create a normal map texture from the texture in step 3, like: `[texture textureByGeneratingNormalMapWithSmoothness:0.9999999 contrast:1.0];`\r\n5. Observe that it doesn't crash at that line (assuming 64-bit)\r\n6. Attempt to create a normal map texture from the texture in step 3, like: `[texture textureByGeneratingNormalMapWithSmoothness:1.0 contrast:1.0];`\r\n7. Observe that it does crash at that line\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalling that method should never crash. If 1.0 is an invalid value then handle it and document it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalling that method crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A267n)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo test the sample project, click inside the window to try creating normal map textures with different smoothness values."
