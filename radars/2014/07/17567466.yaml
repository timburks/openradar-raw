    description: "The Swift documentation says:\r\n\r\n “Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number. Use it when floating-point values must be very large or particularly precise.\r\nFloat represents a 32-bit floating-point number. Use it when floating-point values do not require 64-bit precision.”\r\n\r\nThis seems at odds with the language, which defaults to Double for real constants. Developers who try to follow the recommendation to prefer Float over Double with find themselves fighting the type inference system.\r\n\r\nEither the documentation should make it clear that Double is preferred, or the language should default to Float for real constants."
