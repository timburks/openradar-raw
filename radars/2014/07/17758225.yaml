    description: "Marked as duplicate of 18272350\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAttempting to use a QOS class as an argument to the GCD function `dispatch_get_global_queue` in the Swift language fails with the reason \"error: 'qos_class_t' is not convertible to 'Int'\". It appears that unlike `dispatch_queue_attr_make_with_qos_class` which explicitly requires a dispatch_qos_class_t (a typealiased qos_class_t) argument, `dispatch_get_global_queue`'s signature accepts an Int so that it's compatible with the older dispatch_queue_priority_t values. In this case it means that it's not possible to use quality of service values as is recommended[1] by the documentation.\r\n\r\n[1]: \"It is recommended to use quality of service class values to identify the well-known global concurrent queues.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6 Beta 4\r\n2. Create a new OS X playground (note that this issue occurs on both platforms, but for the sake of example...)\r\n3. Enter the code `let queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND, 0)`\r\n4. Observe warning\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect `dispatch_get_global_queue` to accept both the older dispatch queue priorities and newer QOS classes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error occurs\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A267n)\r\nVersion 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs running Xcode 6 Beta 4 in Yosemite 10.10 Beta 4"
