    description: "Closed by Apple:\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following:\r\n\r\nThis just encourages dialects of the language to spring up.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n\r\n========\r\nOriginal issue:\r\n\r\nSwift has been designed as a modern programming language yet still retains many vestigial features of older languages. When performing logic operations, users are still forced to use logical operators like && and ||. I feel like it would help the readability of the language, and therefore increase it's appeal as a learning language, if Swift supported the use of \"and\" and \"or\" in addition to && and ||. I'm not proposing the removal of  the original logical operators, just offering more modern versions as an addition.\r\n\r\nNumerous languages support the interchangeable use of and/or and &&/|| - it would be nice to have this support in Swift as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new Swift playground in Xcode\r\n2. Enter the following code into a Swift playground: if 1 == 1 and 2 == 2 or 3 == 3 { }\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The code should be parsed without error\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The parsed code indicates errors due to use of \"and\" and \"or\""
