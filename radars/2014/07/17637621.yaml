    description: "Summary:\r\ninviting a peer that got disconnected due to a connection problem will sometimes cause a bug, that any further invitation attempt will not succeed (the other peer's didReceiveInvitationFromPeer will not be cauled anymore)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached XCode project and launch on two devices.\r\n2. Wait until both devices show the state \"Connected\"\r\n3. turn Wi-Fi / Bluetooth off on one of the devices\r\n4. turn Wi-Fi on again\r\n5a) wait until both devices show the state \"Connected\" => repeat from step 3 \r\n5b) if 5a won't apply, look if the console of one of the devices shows the log message \"Invitation not successful?\" => Congratulations, you triggered the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe invitation should succeed and both devices should show the state \"Connected\" when the Wi-Fi connection is turned on\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne device shows the state \"Inviting\" while the other device shows the state \"Disconnected\", as it's not knowing that it has been invited.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to stop advertising and browsing, creating a new advertiser and browser instance and start them again, once any peer disconnects.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 3, iPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MultipeerConnector.zip' was successfully uploaded."
