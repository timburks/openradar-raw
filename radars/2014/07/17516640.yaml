    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile programming swift, if we create an array which contains a series of tuples, we can append another tuple into the array by calling the “+=“ operator but not able using the “append” method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor example, we have code like this\r\n\r\n    var a = [(1,2), (3,4)]\r\n    a += (5,6)\r\n\r\nIt works fine. However, if we do this\r\n\r\n    var b = (7,8)\r\n    a.append(b)\r\n\r\nThe compiler says “Missing argument for parameter #2 in call”.\r\n\r\nThe screen shot is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"append\" method should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBut it does not work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 beta 2\r\nMac OS X 10.9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-07-01 at 12.14.20 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
