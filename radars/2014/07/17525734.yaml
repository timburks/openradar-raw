    description: "There is a UI bug with the Maps app when viewing Transport Apps after getting directions.\r\n\r\nThe table view header text overlaps with the table view cells and could potentially obscure the view of the app item. In addition, there is a large gray bar which appears, pushing the table view down in the view."
