    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's debugger console pane displays output from the running application. One can currently choose to display Target Output, Debugger Output, or All Output. One can also use the Find... command to search for text within the window.\r\n\r\nThe amount of debug output can be large and difficult to read in real time. It would be helpful if a developer could choose to filter the output using a regular expression or simple text match. For example, the developer may only want to see log messages that contain the text \"Network error\" or \"MyTableViewController\". Rather than doing a Find and multiple Find Next commands to hop between all the occurrences, it would be nice to be able to type the desired text, and then the console would show all matching lines, both existing lines and for any newly printed lines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun an application that produces a lot of debugger output\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a control that allows the user to filter the output down those things the developer wants to see.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such control. Developer has to wade through everything.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 (and Xcode 6 beta 4)"
