    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 2.0 the visible state of the networkActivityIndicator can only be set to YES or NO by setting networkActivityIndicatorVisible in UIApplication class. This is not sufficient for modern app design where multiple network connections work intertwined. With third party code added to the mix, it is impossible for the app to keep the networkActivityIndicator in a consistent state.\r\nWe need a pair of API calls like this:\r\n- (void)incrementActivityCount\r\n- (void)decrementActivityCount\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Component A calls [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:YES];\r\n2. Component B calls [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:YES];\r\n3. Component A calls [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:NO];\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNetwork activity indicator still visible (because component B stills performs network activity)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNetwork activity indicator hidden (because component A called it to hide)"
