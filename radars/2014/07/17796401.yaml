    description: "Summary:\r\nIn this forum post:\r\n\r\n  https://devforums.apple.com/message/1010631#1010631\r\n\r\nUser jckarter posted this code:\r\n\r\n    let two_one = Array(lazy([1, 2, 3, 4]).reverse().filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 / 2 })\r\n\r\nWhich seems cool. (Aside: lazy seems to be undocumented). So I pasted it into a Playground, where it never finished. The CPU spins up to 200%, and after a while Xcode freezes and I have to terminate it.\r\n\r\nIf I only use lazy reverse() it works fine. But both lazy filter() and lazy map() brings the compiler into a seemingly endless loop.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 (6A267n)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm on a MacBook Air (1.7 GHz Core i7, 8GB RAM) running Xcode 6 beta 4."
