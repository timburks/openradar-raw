    description: "Summary:\r\nThe dividers in Yosemite menus are very thick. I assume this was a conscious design decision, but I find them extremely odd. There are few, if any, lines like them anywhere else in Yosemite, especially on a Retina display. Most lines that divide an area are a single point thick, not even a full pixel. These menu dividers are a full two pixels (or four points on a Retina display). My best guess is that the intent was to match the weight of the type in the menus, but they’re even thicker than that—2 or at most 3 Retina points would be a better match.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a menu from the Yosemite menu bar.\r\n2. Look at the dividers that are between sections of the menu.\r\n3. Quietly contemplate them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHarmony.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDissonance.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
