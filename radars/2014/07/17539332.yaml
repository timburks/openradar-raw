    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you dismiss a UIAlertView programmatically using dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:animated: then the tintAdjustmentMode of the app is left as UIViewTintAdjustmentModeDimmed. This causes all the UI to be gray instead of the normal tintColor.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in iOS 8 the tintAdjustmentMode doesn't appear to change at all (i.e., nothing desaturates in the first place), and I'm not sure if that is intentional. I'm reporting this just in case that behavior is restored without fixing this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached app. An alert view appears when the app is launched. Notice the button in the background is gray.\r\n2. Leave the app (press the home button).\r\n3. Return to the app. The alert view is dismissed programmatically when the app resumes. Notice that the button is still gray. It should be blue (the default tintColor).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button should be blue after the alert is dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button is gray because the tintAdjustmentMode has been left as dimmed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini"
