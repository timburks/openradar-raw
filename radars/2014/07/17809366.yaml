    description: "Summary:\r\nAny rule that does a “Move” gets treated as a copy instead., i.e. the original message is still in the Inbox and a copy is placed in the destination mailbox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a rule that moves all messages into a Gmail Mailbox\r\n2. Reapply rules to messages (using Message => Apply Rules) or send new messages to account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessage should be moved from Inbox to destination Gmail box\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the message was in the Gmail Inbox (for the same account), it is moved properly, however, for Exchange, IMAP, and POP accounts the message is copied to the Gmail box and left in the original mailbox\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe this was working properly in the previous 10.10 beta (3), but I cannot confirm.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
