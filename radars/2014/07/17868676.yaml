        Summary:
        Yesterday, I bought a brand new AirPort Time Capsule and updated it to the latest public firmware (7.7.3). I live in Seattle, WA and use CondoInternet, a local Gigabit provider. My MacBook Pro 2013 running the latest public version of OS X Mavericks and another iPhone I have running iOS 7.0 are able to connect flawlessly to the AirPort with great speeds over WiFi.

        My MBP has 2 ms ping, 130.04 down, and 87.19 up
        My iPhone running iOS 7.0 has 4 ms ping, 101.60 down, and 80.07 up

        My iPhone running iOS 8.0, however, had a 16 ms on the first test, with 40.56 down, and 24.13 up, and then an abysmal 8 ms ping, 8.22 down, and 1.44 up on the second test. These tests were all performed in the same room, and no tests were run simultaneously. Obviously there’s some significant performance degradation on iOS 8.0.

        Worst of all though, often my iPhone just won’t be able to load any web pages or make any network requests (I haven’t actually inspected the requests being sent to see if they’re making it through, but apps will spin the activity indicator endlessly, loading no content, and web pages will have never-ending progress bars). The workaround to this is to turn off WiFi on the phone and turn it back on, but eventually the problem occurs again.

        Most confusingly, this did not seem to occur when connected to the Cisco router at my parents’ home across the country. The phone had perfectly respectable speeds for what they’re paying for there, and I never had any problems with loading anything. This seems to be very specifically related to the iPhone’s ability to connect to the AirPort Time Capsule.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Connect an iPhone running iOS 8.0 to an AirPort Time Capsule running the latest firmware (7.7.3).

        Expected Results:
        The iPhone running iOS 8.0 beta 4 should have equal speeds compared to iPhones running iOS 7.0.

        Actual Results:
        The iPhone running iOS 8.0 beta 4 performs abysmally when compared to an iPhone running iOS 7.0.
