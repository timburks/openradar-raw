        Summary:
        viewDidAppear/viewWillDisappear won't called any longer if I add the view controller to a hidden container view in the beginning

        Steps to Reproduce:
        If I add a view controller to a hidden container view, then viewWillAppear is called (which is wrong in the first place). viewDidAppear is not called, which is correct. If I make then the container view visible, then viewDidAppear is not called, or even if I hide the container view again the methods viewWillApear/viewDidAppear/viewWillDisappear/viewDidDisappear remains broken.

        Everything is ok if I add the view to a visible container view in the beginning.

        Expected Results:
        These lifecycle methods should works even if the container view is hidden in the beginning.

        Actual Results:
        The methods viewWillApear/viewDidAppear/viewWillDisappear/viewDidDisappear arenâ€™t called any longer if the container view is hidden in the beginning.
