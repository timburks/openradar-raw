        Summary:
        Tuples and structs are very very close to being the same thing. The language would be better if they were literally the same thing.

        Tuples:
        - can be instantiated anonymously
        - can be pattern matched against

        Structs:
        - can be defined type-parametrically
        - can have functions defined on them
        - can conform to protocols
        - can be extended

        Put these together and you have a much more compelling feature than either is on its own. Therefore, I would like tuples to be anonymous structs and for all structs to have pattern matching.
