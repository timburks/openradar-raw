    description: "Issue category: Bug Reporter\r\n\r\n• Detailed description of the issue\r\nWhen selecting the Component in a \"New Problem\" in Bug Reporter, the app automatically selects the necessary attachments to go along with that issue. However, continuously selecting the same Component results in duplicate attachments instead of the same attachments being added once regardless of how many times you reselect the Component.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, selecting a Component like Messages and then changing it to Mail results in attachments for both Messages and Mail instead of just Mail.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Cancel the \"New Problem\" and create a new one.\r\n\r\n• Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a New Problem\r\n2. Tap Component\r\n3. Select any component on the list\r\n4. Tap Component again\r\n5. Select the same component again\r\n\r\n• Expected result\r\nAttachments for a specific component should only be added once, regardless of how many times the Component is selected\r\n\r\n• Actual result\r\nAttachments are re-added as duplicates each time the Component is selected."
