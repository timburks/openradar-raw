    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a view controller is modally presented with presentation style `UIModalPresentationCurrentContext` on a view controller which is the primary view controller inside a split view controller the methods `viewWillAppear:` and `viewDidAppear:` are not called on the presented view controller.\r\n\r\nWhen the modal view controller is dismissed, the primary controller's view is resized to the split view controller's size during the dismiss animation and then resized to the original size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached Xcode project on the iPad simulator\r\n\r\n2. Press the compose navigation button which results in presenting a view controller (ModalViewController)\r\n\r\n3. Dismiss the view controller by tapping \"Done\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn 2. The methods `viewWillAppear:` and `viewDidAppear:` are called as in iOS 7.\r\n\r\nOn 3. The split view controller's primary view controller is not resized during the dismiss animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn 2. Methods on the presented view controller are not called\r\n\r\nOn 3. The split view controller's primary view controller has the wrong size during the animation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulatorUISplitViewController.zip - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UISplitViewController.zip' was successfully uploaded."
