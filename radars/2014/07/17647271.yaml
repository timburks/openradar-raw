    description: "When you link PushKit using Xcode beta 3 for iOS 8 Beta 3, it incorrectly links as an embedded framework. You can tell because the linker prints a warning:\r\n\r\nld: warning: relocatable dylibs (e.g. embedded frameworks) are only supported on iOS 8.0 and later (@rpath/PushKit.framework/PushKit)\r\n\r\notool also shows Pushkit is being linked with @rpath.\r\n\r\nLoad command 19\r\n          cmd LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB\r\n      cmdsize 60\r\n         name @rpath/PushKit.framework/PushKit (offset 24)\r\n   time stamp 2 Wed Dec 31 16:00:02 1969\r\n      current version 1.0.0\r\ncompatibility version 1.0.0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project that imports and tries to use PushKit\r\n2. Set the project to build for armv7 (not sure why this is necessary...)\r\n3. Run the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt crashes with this output:\r\n\r\ndyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/PushKit.framework/PushKit\r\n  Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/BAE1858F-CC2C-4449-81C4-A5CC895A4288/PushMissing.app/PushMissing\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:\r\n\t/System/Library/Frameworks/PushKit.framework/PushKit: mach-o, but wrong architecture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 12A4318c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you weak-link it instead (for projects also targeting iOS 7), it simply just doesn't link.\r\n\r\nI attached a sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PushMissing.zip' was successfully uploaded."
