    description: In my opinion, changes to a half-closed range operator to be ..< for less confusing in the Xcode 6 beta 3 is great but I think the syntax look ugly. So I want to propose the .._ as a new half-closed range operator. The "_" in Swift means ignore the value which would make sense in this context too.
