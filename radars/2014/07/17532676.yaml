        Summary:
        The NSRectEdge constants (NS{Min,Max}{X,Y}Edge) constants are not available in Swift.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to write a method call to NSPopover.showRelativeToRect(_:ofView:preferredEdge:).

        Expected Results:
        NSMinYEdge and other such constants are available (probably as NSRectEdge.MinY or .MinYEdge).

        Actual Results:
        They are not.

        Notes:
        NSRectEdge is a typedef to NSInteger, and the constants are actually macros aliasing equivalent Core Graphics symbols.

        The workaround is to use something like NSRectEdge(CGRectEdge.MinYEdge.toRaw()), which is pretty fugly.
