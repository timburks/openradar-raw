    description: "Summary:\r\nHello there,\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest a feature today that i think would improve a lots of people productivity.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to add the ability to move any Interface Builder canvas (storyboard or xib) the same way lots of designing tool work with their own canvas. It works on sketch.app, Indesign, Photoshop, illustrator and i'm sure many more.\r\n\r\nThis way you can easily move around the visible part of the canvas but always easily explore the hidden part, without having to play with the zoom-out / zoom-in technique or without using the scrollbar of the canvas. You just grab the canvas with your mouse and move it in the direction you want like you would move a piece of paper on your table.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\non sketch, photoshop and other the feature work this way even though the keyboard key might change :\r\n\r\n 1. hold the space bar.\r\n 2. grab the canvas\r\n 3. move the canvas around with your mouse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
