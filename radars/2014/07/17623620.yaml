    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are currently three possible combinations of horizontal and vertical size classes that correspond to the dimensions and orientations of the device's main screen:\r\n\r\n- H: compact, V: regular = iPhone portrait\r\n- H: compact, V: compact = iPhone landscape\r\n- H: regular, V: regular = iPad portrait *and* landscape\r\n- H: regular, V: compact = Does not correspond to device\r\n\r\nThis allows you to create different constraints for the iPhone, depending on whether it is in portrait or landscape mode, in the same storyboard. That's great! Before iOS 8 this required breaking the constraints in code and assigning new ones upon a rotation.\r\n\r\nFor the iPad, however, it still isn't possible to assign different constraints depending on the orientation, because the same size class is used for both orientations. (And not every iPad app will use a split view controller!)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Interface Builder and try to find a size class or other configuration option that corresponds to just iPad portrait or iPad landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can assign different constraints for iPad portrait and landscape. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 3"
