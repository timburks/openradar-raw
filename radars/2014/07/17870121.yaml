    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering data into fields in Interface Builder, it’s impossible to use constants defined in code. Instead, we must copy and paste them into the field, requiring us to modify values in two places to share values from IB to code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project with a view controller that has an associated .XIB file.\r\n2. In the view controller’s header, declare a constant:\r\n\r\nextern const CGFloat kLabelMargin;\r\n\r\n3. In the view controller’s implementation, give the constant a value:\r\n\r\nconst CGFloat kLabelMargin = 10.0f;\r\n\r\n4. Open the .XIB file and add a label. For its frame’s X value, enter “kLabelMargin” into the text field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode autocompletes the text of kLabelMargin as you enter it, and the value is used to construct the label’s frame.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode won’t let you exit the text field until a valid numeric value is entered.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be useful for strings, layout constants, and would also help track down hard-to-debug views where instead of properties, the developer uses tags to identify views. In general, allowing us to have constants in one place would allow designers to quickly tweak values and see results in views that use nibs as well as ones created programmatically."
