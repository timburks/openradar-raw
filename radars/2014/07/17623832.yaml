    description: "Code completion attempts to incorrectly insert a double quote at the end of a line when an interpolated string is passed to a function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis one is hard to describe. Please see the video at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/89457307/Radar%20Sample%20Projects/code-completion.mov . Note the additional double quote (â€œ) added by code completion to the end of the line being typed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo double quote is added to the end of the line\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn extra double quote is added to the end of the line resulting in an invalid Swift statement.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround is to escape the completion or delete the double quote, but this gets annoying.\r\nI used the println function to demonstrate this but it is reproducible with any function that accepts a string as a parameter."
