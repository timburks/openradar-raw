    description: "Summary: When sending messages in Messages, Messages will fairly consistently fail to send the first text I send in a batch of messages (i.e. a couple of messages in a row), while sending the following messages perfectly fine. If the batch only consists of 1 message, that message will also fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Send a message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The message to go through like a normal message should.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The message often does not go through, even though follow-up messages go through perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nRegression: Occurs on OS X 10.8.4 running Messages 7.0.1 on MacBookPro6,2"
