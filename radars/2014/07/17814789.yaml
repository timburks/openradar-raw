    description: "Summary:\r\nUINavigationController's call the \"interactionControllerForAnimationController\" delegate method *after* starting a transition and therefore makes it impossible to use interactive transitions with navigation controllers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample app on iOS 8 (this is the sample app from [objc.io's tutorial](http://www.objc.io/issue-5/view-controller-transitions.html) on [View Controller transitions](https://github.com/objcio/issue5-view-controller-transitions) with one edit to add an assert to highlight the bug.\r\n2. Tap the \"Push\" button\r\n3. With the \"Hello, World\" screen visible, do a left to right swipe gesture\r\n4. After performing #3 the app will crash on the \"The transition should be interactive\" assert.\r\n\r\n(The above works on iOS 7.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`UINavigationController` interactive animations should be possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`UINavigationController` interactive animations are not possible."
