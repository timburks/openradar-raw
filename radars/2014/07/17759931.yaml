    description: "when using a NSVisualEffectView as a sole view in a transparent window (custom vibrant HUD-style UI element), using a mask property causes the view's mask edges to appear jagged and aliased.\r\n\r\nYou can see the problem by right-clicking an app in the Dock. I don't know the details of implementation, but the dock menu/popover exhibits the same symptoms as when using NSVisualEffectView as described (NSPopover and NSMenu don't have that problem)\r\n\r\n[screenshot attached]"
