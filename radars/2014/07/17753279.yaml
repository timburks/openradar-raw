        Summary:
        Switching back and forth between apps for productivity tasks is already decently cumbersome since there is no way to use two apps at once. Slowing down the multitasking animation though, like in beta 4, not only reduces the animation improvements made in iOS 7.1, but it also makes tasks take even longer.
