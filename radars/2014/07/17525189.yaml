    description: "Summary:\r\nImplement would work exactly like 'override', but for methods implemented in a protocol instead of overridden in a subclass.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit is that if the protocol changes, the compiler would be able to catch all the methods that implemented the old version. It would also make it clear which methods were there to satisfy protocol requirements.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
