        Summary:
        Xcode 6b3’s CPU usage is very high when editing or even just viewing the GUI for editing Document Types and URL Types. Closing these sections makes the CPU usage drop instantly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a project and select it in the sidebar.
        2. Select a target app.
        3. Click the Info tab.
        4. Click the disclosure arrow next to the “Document Types” or “URL Types” section

        Expected Results:
        CPU usage should not increase significantly.

        Actual Results:
        CPU usage jumps from a few percent up to about 90% in just a few seconds. It stays there as long as the section is open. Clicking the disclosure triangle to hide that section drops the CPU back down.

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        Quitting and re-opening Xcode did not affect the problem. I am currently testing on Yosemite DP3.
