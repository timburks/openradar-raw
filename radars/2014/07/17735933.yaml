    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are at least three places within \"The Swift Programming Language\" where guidance is provided for how to capitalize when naming Types. I propose capturing this guidance in warnings given by the compiler when these suggestions are ignored\r\n\r\n“Each enumeration definition defines a brand new type. Like other types in Swift, their names (such as CompassPoint and Planet) should start with a capital letter. Give enumeration types singular rather than plural names, so that they read as self-evident:”\r\n \r\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l\r\n \r\n“NOTE\r\nWhenever you define a new class or structure, you effectively define a brand new Swift type. Give types UpperCamelCase names (such as SomeClass and SomeStructure here) to match the capitalization of standard Swift types (such as String, Int, and Bool). Conversely, always give properties and methods lowerCamelCase names (such as frameRate and incrementCount) to differentiate them from type names.”\r\n \r\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l\r\n \r\n“NOTE\r\nBecause protocols are types, begin their names with a capital letter (such as FullyNamed and RandomNumberGenerator) to match the names of other types in Swift (such as Int, String, and Double).”\r\n \r\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nenum test {\r\n    case Foo, bar\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWarnings for 'test' at least and possibly–though explicit guidance is not provided, all individual enumeration values in the book begin with an uppercase letter–for 'bar' as well.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo warning is emitted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
