        Summary:

        I’m trying to integrate here in Europe, so my computer is set to display time in 24 hour format and temperature in Celsius. The notification center sidebar thing now shows weather information. This new info is convenient, but it shows the summary info in Fahrenheit, which makes it hard to feel European.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        - Set your computer to display temperatures in Celsius.
        - Open the notification center sidebar
        - Notice the information in Fahrenheit.
        - Feel American.

        Expected Results:

        You should be feeling hip and European with your weather information in Celsius.

        Actual Results:

        You feel like an American, a citizen of one of the few countries who don’t use Celsius casually.

        Regression:

        This feature didn’t exist before, so there’s no regression.
