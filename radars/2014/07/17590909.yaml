    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to use CGVector where semantically appropriate as opposed to just using a CGPoint becomes more difficult because of the lack of constants and functions equivalent to those that are provided for other CGGeometry structs.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I would expect that there would be a CGVectorZero constant, CGVectorEqualToVector function and CGVectorApplyAffineTransform function.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these equivalent functions I would expect functions specific to CGVector, like a hypothetical CGVectorNormalize or a number of other functions that perform common operations on vectors such as those seen in https://github.com/samgreen/CGVector-Awesome, to exist and be defined in CGGeometry.h.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to create a zero vector with the constant CGVectorZero.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the constant exists and is defined in CGGeometry.h\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe constant is not defined.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7, iOS8 betas\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll"
