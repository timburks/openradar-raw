        Summary:
        Now that Spotlight no longer appears on the right side of the screen, there’s no reason for the Spotlight icon to be permanently on the right side of the menu bar. It also has more space around it than other icons on the right side of the menu bar, since it is still sized to match the  icon.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Look at the Spotlight icon.
        2. Try to move the Spotlight icon by command-dragging it.
        3. Try to remove the Spotlight icon by command-dragging it.

        Expected Results:
        The spacing around the icon should be similar to other menu bar icons. I should be able to move it around like other menu bar icons, or even completely remove it. (I only access Spotlight only with a keyboard shortcut—I don’t need an icon!)

        Actual Results:
        The icon has a lot of space around it and cannot be moved.
