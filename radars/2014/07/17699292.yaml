    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running on device Xcode will display a modal alert if the targeted device is locked. The only option for this modal is a solitary \"OK\" button. A modal that either waits for device to unlock or has the buttons \"Retry\" (default/return) and \"cancel\" (escape) would make developers' workflow more continuous.\r\n\r\nThis is something that happens every time your device locks (I think iOS defaults to lock after 1 minute) so it has a big impact. I run into it multiple times in each development session when running on device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock target device.\r\n2. Build and run on target device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nModal that either waits for device to unlock or allows me to retry running the built binary on device once I've unlocked it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nModal with a single \"ok\" button that cancels the previous build and run command.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 (6A215l) and earlier.\r\n\r\nScreen Shot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5mpp84syhez0iyo/terrible-xcode-modal.png"
