    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an enum type that has more than one object typed case, on iOS, attempting to use some cases of the enum results in an EXC_BAD_ACCESS. The same enum type works fine in OSX, and the same enum with only one typed case works fine on iOS.\r\n\r\nReordering or otherwise changing the layout of the enum type doesn't seem to help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Enums-iOS.playground\r\n2. Open the assistant editor to see the console\r\n3. Observe that execution of the file ends at line 25, and the console contains the results of an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.\r\n4. Open the attached Enums-OSX.playground.\r\n5. Observe that execution continues through to the end.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect this code to run properly on both platforms.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iOS version of the enum crashes, both when running in a Playground and on devices running iOS 8 and iOS 7.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode: 6.0 (6A267n)\r\nMac OS X: 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI am running Xcode 6 beta 4 on a mid-2011 iMac running OS X Mavericks v. 10.9.4.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Enums-iOS.playground.zip' and 'Enums-OSX.playground.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n(attachments as a gist here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ddded0394409658665fb)"
