    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I wire up a segue between a button and a modally presented view controller, all of the other \"Present Modally\" transitions work, *except* for the \"Flip Horizontal\" transition.\r\n\r\nThe transition *does* animate when I dismiss the modal view controller. It just doesn't animate in the forward direction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate view controller A with a button, in a storyboard.\r\nCreate view controller B.\r\nCreate a segue between the button and view controller B.\r\nSet the segue's attributes to  Segue: \"Present Modally\" and Transition: \"Flip Horizontal\".\r\nRun the app in the simulator (iPhone 5s, iOS 8).\r\nTap the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see the horizontal flip transition to the modally presented  view controller B.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen is replaced (without animation), going from view controller A to view controller B.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, Xcode6beta3: Version 6.0 (6A254o)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator, iPhone 5s"
