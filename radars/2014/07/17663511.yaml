    description: "Summary:\r\nAccess control has 2 sides:\r\n\r\n- What do I export\r\n- What do I import\r\n\r\nprivate/public/protected support the provider's access control needs, but not the client's.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for operators, which we cannot disambiguate, and are always top-level scope-clutterers.\r\n\r\nBeing able to do:\r\n\r\nimport AutoLayoutHelper hiding (+=, +, -)\r\n\r\nwhich would pull in all exported names expect those mentioned\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\nimport (Builder) from AutoLayoutHelper\r\n\r\nwhich would pull in only the mentioned names, or a combo:\r\n\r\nimport (Builder) from AutoLayoutHelper except (Builder.Unidirectional)\r\n\r\nwould be very helpful in controlling what's in scope, especially as splitting code into modules using Xcode right now seems to require heavyweight methods (vs. just wrapping some decls in `module X; â€¦ endmodule X;`).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Import a framework but only want one or two names from it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. Restrict the imported names to those names.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. Too bad, you get the whole lot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0\r\nBuild version 6A254o\r\n\r\nProductName:\tMac OS X\r\nProductVersion:\t10.9.4\r\nBuildVersion:\t13E28\r\n\r\nSwift version 1.0 (swift-600.0.38.7)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
