    description: "This may be a bug????\r\n\r\nIn iOS 8.0 Beta 2, from the Featured tab of the App Store, when pressing to view a featured app, tapping on the Version History button takes you to a separate area of the app. When pressing back, the app you were looking at has gone and the App Store returns you to the Featured section.\r\n\r\nI believe that when tapping back out of looking at previous app versions, you should be returned to the app you were last looking at."
