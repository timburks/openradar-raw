    description: "There is no way to indicate to compiler and/or other programmers that given function is 'pure' in a functional programming meaning of the word.\r\n\r\nIt's awesome that Swift gives us many facilities to write things in purely functional way, but having a compiler check for side-effects could help prevent entire category of bugs."
