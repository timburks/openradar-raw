    description: "Summary:\r\nIt can be desirable to create a custom keyboard using -inputView in the NSResponder class. It can also be desirable that when the user connects to an external Bluetooth keyboard, that the custom inputView keyboard be automatically hidden like the normal iOS keyboard is.\r\n\r\nBut this does not occur, and there is no legal way to determine when a Bluetooth keyboard is connected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set -inputView on an NSResponder object like a UITextField\r\n2. Set the UITextField to be first responder\r\n3. Observe the custom inputView appears\r\n4. Connect a Bluetooth keyboard to the iOS device\r\n5. Observe the custom inputView does not disappear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the inputView to hide when the external keyboard was connected, since there is no legal way for my app to sense the keyboard being attached, therefore how I can I hide my custom keyboard myself?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy inputView keyboard does not disappear\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 5, 6, 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIdeally, there should be a boolean property on NSResponder that determines if the system should hide my inputView as a result of an external keyboard being connected. \r\n\r\nWithout this option, user experience is being harmed.\r\n\r\nHere is the email I received as a result of my developer tech support ticket:\r\n\r\nHi Paul,\r\n\r\nYou are seeing the expected behavior. When inputView property is set, we assume that you want to handle keyboard all by yourself, so donâ€™t hide the inputView even when hardwdare is connected. \r\n\r\nThere is no supported way to detect if a hardware keyboard is present when inputView is not nil. If you want to hide your inputView when a hardware keyboard is present, you might consider adding something in your UI so that user can do it manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone, any iPad"
