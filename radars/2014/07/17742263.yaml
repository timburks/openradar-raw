    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new UIVisualEffectView should be available for initialization and customization in Storyboards. Additionally, it should be available in the Xcode Objects Library. This would allow developers to drag and drop a UIVisualEffectView (just like any other UIView or UIKit-Element) onto a UIViewController from the Xcode Objects Library. After adding a UIVisualEffectView it should be customizable using the Attributes Inspector (like any other UIView).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Xcode Project and run it on any simulator or device.\r\n2. A large solid grey box will appear at the bottom of the screen (this is supposed to be a blurred UIVisualEffectView).\r\n3. The code in ViewController.m attempts to setup the UIVisualEffectView which was added to the Storyboard (Main.storyboard).\r\n4. Any attempts to generate a UIVisualEffectView from a Storyboard fail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIVisualEffectViews can be created and customized in Interface Builder / Storyboards. At the very least, they should support Storyboard-initialization (via initWithCoder: or some other system). The optimal solution would be a UIVisualEffectView available in the Xcode Objects Library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIVisualEffectViews can only be created programmatically (in code). They fail to work in any way when added through the interface.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, Seed 3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Blur Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
