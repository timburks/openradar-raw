    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swift Standard Library currently provides a Zip2 sequence type and a ZipGenerator2 generator type that can be used to create a sequence of 2-tuples from the elements of two sequences. For consistency with other sequence-based library elements (map/filter/etc.), it would be helpful to provide a zip() function (or zip2() function) that has the expected capitalization.\r\n\r\nLibrary designers could provide overloads for zip() that handle specific sequence/collection types, different numbers of sequences, and/or different result types.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDo a case-sensitive search for \"zip\" in the Standard Library\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind a function with \"zip\" in the name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind no \"zip\" function, so you think you have to write one yourself.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A267n)"
