    description: "This is a request for a Cocoa API update.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nPlenty of apps have the need to delete files, and often it's smart to just move them to the Trash.\r\nImplementing this on our own is error-prone due to many special cases (authorization needed, locked items, volumes without a trash folder, renaming in case there are already same-named items in the trash, etc.).\r\nEffectively, what one needs is the very same one can get by sending an AppleEvent (AE) to the Finder for the \"delete\" command, with the SendMode values kAEAlwaysInteract+kAECanSwitchLayer.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that AppleEvents have been deprecated (legacy!) and are probably not allowed in App Store submissions, either.\r\n\r\nThe NSWorkspace performFileOperation method with the NSWorkspaceRecycleOperation parameter is not sufficient, for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- It's async. A synchronous operation is needed (works via AE).\r\n- One cannot pass a bunch of items from different folders (works via AE).\r\n- There is no user interaction when the operation need attention from the user.\r\n\r\nIn summary, there is no suitable replacement for what the Finder AppleEvent gave us, and that sucks.\r\n\r\nSo, please consider giving us something back in the way the good old AppleScripting feature gave us."
