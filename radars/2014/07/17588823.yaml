    description: In previous version of Xcode, we have been able to access the Organizer window using the keyboard shortcut ⌘⇧2, which has been very helpful in the frequent task of deleting derived data. Now that keyboard shortcut has been replaced with... nothing. You removed the shortcut, you monsters. How will I delete my derived data now?
