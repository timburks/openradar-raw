    description: "Currently, tapping the camera icon and tapping a photo at the top brings you into selection mode and allows the user to choose multiple photos to send. However, these messages are sent in completely scrambled order. \r\n\r\nSince the user at the very least probably intended for the photos to be sent in chronological order, this could potentially eliminate the convenience of not having to select the photos one at a time, as the user then has to explain what the order was intended.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, the photos selected should be sent in chronological order. However, Apple could take it a step further and actually send the photos in the order that they are selected. When a user taps a photo, it could acquire a number badge, similar to how Facebook does it (screenshot attached), and that would be the order in which the photos are sent."
