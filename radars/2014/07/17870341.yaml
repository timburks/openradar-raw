    description: "Summary:\r\nMany business-to-business web apps use a separate subdomain for each customer. For example, apple.myservice.com and beats-by-dre.myservice.com. Current handoff APIs such as the APIs around requesting safari saved passwords require the user to pass in a fully qualified domain name, and have a full list of FQDNs in their entitlements. This is impossible for B2B web apps like the one described above; the list of subdomains (and therefore the list of FQDNs) is variable and changes from day to day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the documentation in SecSharedCredential.h and watch WWDC 2014 session 506\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe FQDN used for the first parameter of SecRequestSharedWebCredential is allowed to have a wildcard character, and the list of associated-domains can include domains with wildcard characters\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe FQDN is apparently not allowed to have a wildcard character\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
