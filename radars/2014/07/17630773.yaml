    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a modal full screen view controller from the master view controller of a UISplitViewController, the modal VC presents as expected. However, upon dismissing the modal VC, the master view controller appears to resize to fill the entire screen (not just it's designated side-bar portion), and then is cropped (not resized) to fit in it's appropriate sidebar area.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create application with a UISplitViewController as the base view controller\r\n2. Configure the MasterViewController to have a button to present a modal full-screen view controller\r\n3. Configure the ModalViewController to have a button to dismiss itself\r\n4. Run the application, present the ModalViewController from the MasterViewController, then dismiss it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMasterViewController remains sized to fit in it's sidebar container\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMasterViewController is initially resized to fill the screen, and then is cropped (not resized) to fit in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample project, and also screenshots of the app before presenting the modal view controller, directly after dismissing the view controller, and then after the master view controller is cropped\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SplitViewBugs.zip', 'iOS Simulator Screen Shot Jul 10, 2014, 5.02.29 PM.png', 'iOS Simulator Screen Shot Jul 10, 2014, 5.02.33 PM.png' and 'iOS Simulator Screen Shot Jul 10, 2014, 5.02.34 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
