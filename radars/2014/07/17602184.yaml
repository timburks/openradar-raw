    description: "Summary:\r\nLearning, experimenting with and prototyping a new API is can be very challenging. Swift playgrounds make a lot of that much easier but having access to the device's sensors will really speed up development and allow faster simulator-based debugging of real-world/real-data situations.  \r\n\r\nGiven that 3rd parties have for > 5 years made tools to allow us to access all of the on-device sensors and use a connected iOS device to drive an app in the simulator, there's certainly no practical reason the DevTools team cannot main stream similar features.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
