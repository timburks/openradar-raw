    description: "Jeremy Novak28-Jul-2014 10:52 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nConsistently getting very high CPU usage that builds from nominal to over 100% in a short period when using iAd in any of my SpriteKit games. These games all perform with < 30% CPU and < 25MB on an iPhone 5 without iAd at consistent 60 FPS.\r\n\r\nAdding the bannerView to the ViewController causes CPU usage to climb steadily over a few seconds to ~ 110% - 130% and memory to slowly climb as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create iAd bannerView and add it as a child of the root view controller. \r\n2. Launch game.\r\n3. Watch resource usage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImpact of iAd to be a lot less noticeable. In my previous releases of games using iAd on the App Store adding an iAd banner had no appreciable effect on game performance. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVery high CPU usage and climbing memory usage that accumulates in just a few seconds after launch. The game doesn't need to be played, just setting in the SKScene for a few seconds is enough time to see the impact. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 4 7.1.12, iPhone 5 iOS8 Beta 4, iPad 2 iOS8 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAppreciate your attention in looking into this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested in iPhone4, iPhone5, and iPad 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
