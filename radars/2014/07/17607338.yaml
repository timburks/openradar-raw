    description: "Summary:\r\niOS should support an extension point for printing that would allow third-party developers to provide additional functionality to users during the printing process (e.g., routing the printed output to a managed printer, saving the output as a PDF file, etc.).  \r\n\r\nThe extension point should allow the app extension to present a UI letting the user specify the result of the operation, as well as presenting the extension with the printed output in some suitable format (PDF, most likely) for further processing.  \r\n\r\nOf course, the containing app can provide additional UI allowing the user to configure its functionality (e.g., logging into a printer server or cloud-based storage facility).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. The user taps a Share button in an app and chooses Print.\r\n2. The user is presented a list of printers as well as an opportunity to select an app extension. Perhaps the extension appears as a special kind of printer in the printer list; perhaps it has its own section in the standard print dialog.\r\n3. When the user chooses to send printed output to the extension, the extension can present a custom UI allowing the user to specify additional parameters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app extension is sent the output of the app's printing operations as a PDF or other suitable format.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently there is no way for an app extension to receive control during a print operation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS devices capable of running iOS 8"
