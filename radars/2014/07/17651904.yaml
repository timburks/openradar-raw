    description: "In previous versions of OS X, the WiFi menu bar icon indicated signal strength by turning partially black. In Yosemite DP 3, it is always gray.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Verify good signal strength by option-clicking the menu.\r\n2. Look at the menu bar icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu bar icon should indicate signal strength by turning the \"waves\" completely or partially black. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe waves are always gray. It looks like I am not connected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A283o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've tested this with two different Wi-Fi networks, and it shows the same behavior."
