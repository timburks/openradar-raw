    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to add a multi-line script in lldb in xcode, it only allows for one line. So it will return even if you are not done writing your script. Note: this is not a problem with lldb, as running lldb straight in terminal does not have this bug. It is only when lldb runs inside of xcode does this happen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a breakpoint in Xcode\r\n2. In lldb type `script`\r\n3. Try entering this snippet of code:\r\nif True:\r\n  print \"Hello\"\r\n  print \"World\"\r\n\r\n4. Notice after hitting return after the first print line, it executes, preventing you from entering a second line\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to write multi-line scripts in xcode lldb. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt executes my code before I am done typing and therefore I cannot write multi line functions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 3 6A254o (also a bug in previous betas)\r\nOS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
