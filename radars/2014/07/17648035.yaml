    description: "For callouts that specify a UIButton of type UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure as their rightCalloutAccessoryView, when tapping within the icon of the button, only the button is highlighted but not the callout. When tapping anywhere else in the callout (including right of the button icon), the whole callout is highlighted.\r\n\r\nThis seems illogical since in both highlight cases (the whole callout and just the right button) the same action is performed when the finger is released.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Maps.app where a simple chevron is used as the icon it definitely makes no sense to highlight just the chevron and not the rest of the callout."
