Create a new single view application in Xcode 6\r\n2. Add a UIScrollView to the view controller in interface builder\r\n3. Add auto layout constraints for leading, trailing to superview, and top & bottom to layout guides.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo errors or warnings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError that the scroll view contains ambiguous scrollable content."
