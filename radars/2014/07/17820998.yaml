        Summary:
        Using Contacts 8.0 on Mavericks 10.9.4 always hangs with networked home directory users.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Login to your OpenDirectory User over the network. For example, on an iMac running 10.9.4 bound to OpenDirectory Home over AFP on OS X Server.

        Expected Results:
        Launching Contacts should just work.

        Actual Results:
        Contacts.app hangs upon each and every launch. No matter if there is data in the account or not. Size of address book is irrelevant. Contacts.app is completely unusable.

        Regression:
        Addressbook.app has worked just fine with 10.6.8 and OpenDirectory network homes on the same setup.
        Contacs can't be used at all, neither with existing account, nor with freshly created accounts.
        This problem also affects Mail.app, which irregularly crashed while trying to access contacts.

        Notes:
        This worked very well in 10.6.8.
        Computers are connected over wired Gbit/s ethernet.
