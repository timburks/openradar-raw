        Summary:
        When calling a Swift function and passing in a variable/constant whose name is the same as the parameter name for which it is provided, Xcode’s editor mis-positions the caret after giving up on autocomplete, which leads to chopped textual content.

        Example: http://cl.ly/1z372w1w301o/rdar.mov

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Type the following into a Playground: (the first two lines can be pasted, but the third should be typed to observe the bug)

        let fooString = "foo!"
        let allowedCharacters = NSCharacterSet.URLQueryAllowedCharacterSet()
        let encodedRedirectURLString = fooString.stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters(allowedCharacters)

        Expected Results:
        typing “allowedCharacters” as the argument to stringByAdding… results in the text “allowedCharacters” between the parens.

        Actual Results:
        typing “allowedCharacters” as the argument to stringByAdding… results in the text “lowedCharactersal” between the parens.

        Regression:
        I have noticed this issue in all Xcode 6 betas to date.

        Notes:
        This does not seem to duplicate for all examples of function calls where the function parameter and passed-in variable have the same name, but it’s always reproducible for the symbols for which the bug does manifest.

        The only workaround seems to be to type the desired text elsewhere and paste it into the desired location.
