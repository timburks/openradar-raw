    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the user presses the home key to background my application after it has lowered the UIScreen brightness, it will NEVER be restored. The user is forced to manually reset the brightness.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. While foregrounded, programatically reduce the [[UIScreen mainScreen] brightness] to 0.1.\r\n2. User presses the home button\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs suggested by documentation quoted below, the brightness should be restored so that the user can see the home screen.\r\n\r\n\"So if you change the value of this property, you do not need to record the previous value and restore it when your app moves to the background.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe OS never restores the brightness to the system level. The user must manually restore the brightness - which may be quite challenging since the screen is essentially black at this point.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a very serious bug for use for two reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first is that, by dimming the screen, we were able to save material battery drain by reducing the screen's backlight.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is VERY hard for the typical user to recover from this situation.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, AT&T"
