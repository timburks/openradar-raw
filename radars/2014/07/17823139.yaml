    description: "Summary:\nUsers with networked homes over AFP using OpenDirectory can't use Mail.app in Mavericks.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nBind Mac with fresh Mavericks installation to OpenDirectory Server. Login with network home OD user.\nLaunch Mail.app and configure an IMAP account.\nAfter a moment Mail.app will crash.\nIf you have several accounts, Mail.app becomes absolutely unusable since it crashes after a few seconds.\n\nExpected Results:\nMail.app should not crash.\n\nActual Results:\nMail.app crashes, each and every launch while trying to create temp files with _NSCreateTemporaryFile.\nThe files are created in /private/var/folders to which the users do have read/write permissions. Mail.app even successfully creates its subfolders there.\n\nRegression:\nThis only seems to happen with OpenDirectory users which we have hundreds of. Mavericks rollout had to be stopped. We're back to 10.6.8 where this worked just fine. \n\nNotes:\nLost several days of admin productivity due to this bug. :-("
