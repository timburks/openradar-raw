        Summary:
        As Apple adds more and more built-in apps, these should be hideable, like the Bug Reporter app that was included up until beta 4. While I’m sure the Podcasts and Tips apps will be great for audio-inclined and novice users, respectively, these apps (not to mention the ever-present eyesore, Newsstand), should have settings to toggle them hidden instead of being relegated to an “Unused” folder on my many users’ home screens.

        This functionality is already possible with Restrictions and was easily possible for the Bug Reporter app. This should be made possible for all of Apple’s built-in apps as well.
