        Summary:
        A rule with actions in addition to a move (i.e. Mark as Read or Set Red Flag) are not properly completed when the source mailbox is an Exchange Inbox and the destination mailbox is another mailbox on the same Exchange Account.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a rule that moves any message from the Exchange Inbox to another mailbox on the same Exchange Account that also has the Mark as Read action (or Set Flag)

        2. Receive a message in the Exchange mailbox and see that the rule applies and the message is moved

        Expected Results:
        The message should be moved into the destination Exchange mailbox and also marked as read (or the flag set as appropriate)

        Actual Results:
        The message is moved from the Inbox to the destination mailbox, however, the other action(s) in the rule were not performed.

        Regression:
        I have only tested this on Mavericks 10.9.3

        Notes:
        If you actually watch the destination mailbox when the message is arriving, youâ€™ll see that the other action(s) (Mark as Read or Set Flag) are actually performed, but then the message is updated immediately (within 0.5 second) to be exactly as it was. It looks like the Exchange server is not getting the message updates (read status and flag info) before the local store is updated to reflect the server.
