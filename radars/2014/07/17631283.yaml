    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextDocumentProxy's documentContextBeforeInput and documentContextAfterInput properties are too limited in what they return. I understand that there are privacy concerns with returning the whole text, but even a small amount more context than we currently get would be a welcome change.\r\n\r\nIf the cursor is at the end of a word, before a space, the documentContextAfterInput just gives the space, not the next word. \r\n\r\nDocumentContextBeforeInput has some similar issues when the cursor is near the front of a string. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, documentContextBeforeInput is usually much longer than documentContextAfterInput, even though there's no reason to assume the text before is less private than the text after\r\n\r\nAlso, when text is selected, we get whatever is on either side of the selection, but not the selection itself, which is probably the most important piece of information for determining what the user is going to type next.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite an iOS Keyboard Extension, and despair.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMore context\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLess context\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
