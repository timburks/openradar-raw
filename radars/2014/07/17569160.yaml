    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an issue with compilation of fairly long arithmetic expressions. Code containing expressions up to 5 operands is compiled instantly, 6 or 7 takes like up to minute to compile, 8 takes few minutes, and 9 seems to take even more. Indexing also hangs in Xcode.\r\n\r\nImportant note: this only happens when a type should be derived from the expression.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an empty project or a playground and enter this code:\r\n\r\nlet test = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode compiles fine, test is an Int constant with value of 45.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompilation hangs indefinitely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A216f), OS X 10.9.3 (13D65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue doesn't occur if the type is specified explicitly, i.e.:\r\n\r\nlet test: Int = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\nfunc foobar(test: Int) { print(test) }\r\nfoobar(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested in OSX 10.9.3 running on MacBook Pro, Late 2013."
