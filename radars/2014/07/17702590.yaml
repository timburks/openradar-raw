    description: "In the attached screenshot, the last name of every contact in Messages.app is abbreviated. \r\n\r\nNO ONE thinks of their friends as \"Steve J\" or \"Tim C\". We think of them as either \"Steve\" or \"Steve Jobs\". Abbreviating the last name actually INCREASES the difficultly of finding the conversation I'm looking for because I have to mentally parse the abbreviation.\r\n\r\nOn the Mac, there is no need to abbreviate; you have all the space in the world. Look how much room there is after \"Zach H\" in the screenshot! For God's sake, man: USE IT.\r\n\r\nPlease find the engineer that did this, slap them, and then fix it. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A: See Description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLast names should not be abbreviated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLast names are stupidly abbreviated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.10 Developer Preview 3, Messages.app Version 8.0 (4706)"
