        Summary:
        URLs/hyperlinks embedded in comments do not parse properly for click-ability if the links contain hyphens, which are legal URL entities.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a comment such as:
        // found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24453808/how-to-create-a-nsmutabledictionary-in-swift
        in an Xcode file

        Expected Results:
        The entire hyperlink is parsed and clickable

        Actual Results:
        Characters after (and including) the first hyphen in the hyperlink are not clickable. Specifically, only “http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24453808/how” is properly hyperlinked.
