    description: "Summary:\nWhen developing my apps I usually create a category on UIColor and a custom color palette (CLR file) for Interface Builder for my specific colors. But this means I have to add new colors and update old colors in 2 places. I could create a bunch of IBOutlets, set colors in code, and not use the CLR file, but I hate creating a ton of IBOutlets.\n\nI would like to include the CLR file in my bundle and then access the colors wherever I need in code. On OS X I believe I could achieve this with the NSColorList class. \n\nNSColorList should be ported to iOS.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nn/a\n\nExpected Results:\nn/a\n\nActual Results:\nn/a\n\nRegression:\nn/a\n\nNotes:\nn/a"
