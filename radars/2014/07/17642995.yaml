    description: "The 'in' keyword for closures in Swift doesn't make sense to me (and many others).  I think a different keyword should be used for better readability. \r\n\r\nCould use 'do', since the following code is doing something, or perhaps '<-' to be similar to the '->' used for return values, or even '|' like in some other languages."
