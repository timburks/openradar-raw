    description: "One of the best features of Swift is that named types can be extended with new methods.  This encourages a development style that builds up libraries incrementally for expressive programs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the types bridged from CoreGraphics such as CGContext are an exception.  The compiler accepts extensions to CoreGraphics types, but the linker fails to link the program.\r\n\r\nThis is the essence of the code the exhibits the issue in Beta 3.\r\n\r\nimport Foundation\r\nimport CoreGraphics\r\n\r\nextension CGContext {\r\n    func fillRect(rect: CGRect) {\r\n        CGContextFillRect(self, rect)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe error in the Beta 3 linker is:\r\n\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n  \"_OBJC_CLASS_$_CGContext\", referenced from:\r\n      l__CATEGORY_CGContext_$_TryCoreGraphics in main.o\r\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64"
