    description: "31-Jul-2014 11:58 PM\r\n\r\nThis no longer seems to be the case (Xcode 5.1.1)\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\n06-Sep-2013 03:29 PM\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using a project or workspace that depends on things from multiple working copies, the xccheckout file contains not only the names of all those other working copies, (good) but also the name of the working copy that depends on the other ones (bad!).\r\n\r\nThis leads to problems as soon as one team-member chooses a different checkout name for the base repo, as any other team members:\r\nEvery new commit of that team-member will add a diff on said file.\r\nSubsequently, every following commit of another team-member will then add a diff on this file, basically _undoing_ this change, resulting in completely bogus/hilarious cascades of unnecessary changes.\r\nThus, greatly reducing value this otherwise really useful feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Workspace, and check that into a Subversion repo.\r\n2. Configure that repo in the workspace’s entry in the “Source Control”-menu.\r\n3. Add a couple of projects to that workspace, each from another checkout, such that you have several working copies on which that workspace depends, and configure those.\r\n4. Commit the xccheckout file for the workspace into its repo.\r\n5. Check the workspace out on another machine, under a different name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode asks whether it should checkout the dependencies, does so, and everything is fine.\r\nThe SVN-status of the main working copy is clean.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode asks whether it should checkout the dependencies, and does so.\r\nThe SVN-status of the main working copy is dirty because the folder name containing the working copy is contained in the xccheckout file.\r\n\r\nBonus points if your team has more than two members, that had a different idea of what name to choose for their local checkout…\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0 (5a11396k)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
