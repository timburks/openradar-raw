    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new NSLengthFormatter uses yards instead of feet or fractions of a mile in the USA. The only time I hear yards in the USA is when I watch football.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNSLengthFormatter *lengthFormatter = [NSLengthFormatter new];\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", [lengthFormatter stringFromMeters:1]);\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3.28 ft\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1.094 yd\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I'm thinking distance, as an American, I think of it terms of miles. In my apps when I've had to format distance in the past, my algorithm reporting anything less than 0.1 mile as feet and anything above as miles. Maybe it's just my opinion and a bad assumption of America, but I think it's worth a discussion internally."
