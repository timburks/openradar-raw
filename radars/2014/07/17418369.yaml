    description: "Issue category: Messages\r\n\r\n• Detailed description of the issue\r\n\r\nWhen receiving attachments from someone (who is not on iOS 8) in a message thread, the attachments do not show as downloaded in the thread. Selecting \"Details\" to view all of the thread's attachments, though, shows the attachments.\r\n\r\n• Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Receive a message with an attachment from someone.\r\n\r\n• Expected result\r\nA thumbnail of the attachment should appear in the message thread\r\n\r\n• Actual result\r\nThe attachment just says \"Downloading\". Viewing the attachment in \"Details\", however, allows the attachment to be seen."
