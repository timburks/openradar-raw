    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to improve testing the registration process with the developer's server for Push Notifications it should be possible to trigger the registration easily in Development builds. Currently the documentation at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2265/_index.html reccomends to either leave the app uninstalled for a day or set the time ahead for a day and reboot the device. This process can be very cumbersome.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install and open an app that registers for Push Notifications for the first time from Xcode\r\n2. The alert asking for permission for Push Notifications will open at the intended time\r\n3. Delete that app\r\n4. Reinstall the app from Xcode\r\n5. The permission alert will not appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Push Notification Status should be reset and and the permission alert should pop up again, executing - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken on the AppDelegate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe permission alert will not appear and there is no way to trigger \r\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that for users who reinstall an app it is better that the notification settings persist so if they previously allowed notifications for an app they will not be asked again after reinstalling, so this improvement should only be made for apps built in Development\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to have another option to trigger \r\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
