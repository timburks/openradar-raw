    description: "Hi. I think you should add `each` method to collection types. I realize that Chris Lattner (IIRC) said on ADF that it's not really needed as you can just use for..in, but here's why I think `each` is useful:\r\n\r\nYou can chain `each` with operations such as `filter` and `map` in a much more elegant way, like so:\r\n\r\n[1, 4, 7].map { $0 * 5 }.filter { $0 > 10 }.each { println($0) }\r\n\r\nVery nice, very expressive. Sweet like Ruby. Compare to:\r\n\r\nlet filtered_nums = [1, 4, 7].map { $0 * 5 }.filter { $0 > 10 }\r\nfor num in filtered_nums {\r\n   println(num)\r\n}\r\n\r\nFunctional-style maps and filters combined with ObjC-style for. Meh.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration."
