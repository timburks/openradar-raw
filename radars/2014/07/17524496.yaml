    description: "iOS 8.0 Simulator (541) fails to run apps in some circumstances, producing an error message in Xcode. This  error only seems to affect the simulator when trying to run an app for 64-bit devices (i.e iPhone 5S, iPad Air), and does not appear to affect older devices available on the simulator.\r\n\r\nThe error is not always reproducible.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to matter if the simulator is already open for the error to appear."
