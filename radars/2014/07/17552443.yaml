    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a rule is used to Forward a message, the message loses all formatting of the original content. Itâ€™s not quite plain text because images will go into the message, bunt all of the formatting of the original message is lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a rule that will automatically forward an incoming message to 2nd mail account with a small text addition.\r\n2. Send a new message with html formatting (i.e. divs with colors applied, etc.) from 3rd account to the 1st account which will apply the rule\r\n3. See that rule is applied and message is redirected\r\n4. View message in 2nd account and compare it to the message sent from 3rd account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFormatting of message received in the 2nd account should be similar to what was sent from the 3rd account\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessage received by the 2nd account has lost all of its formatting during the rule forward.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have attached some images to show an example of the problem\r\n\r\nOriginal Message:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.evernote.com/shard/s378/sh/e74d685c-d7a8-4e6d-9caf-7f34579c80ca/69b4d1b1a83b71f2310435ab5d99ba7a\r\n\r\nForwarded Message:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.evernote.com/shard/s378/sh/b76363a1-4781-4a58-adcf-a726183ea5a6/926bd33b7d8ccf53b9b649a7ab5a4607"
