        Summary:
        It is impossible to tell if one ForwardIndex or BidirectionalIndex comes before or after another. This makes certain algorithms quite difficult to write.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to implement this function in a playground. It should return the distance, whether positive or negative, between two indexes:

            func - <IndexType: BidirectionalIndex>(lhs: IndexType, rhs: IndexType) -> IndexType.DistanceType

        Expected Results:
        You can test whether lhs < rhs or rhs < lhs and then proceed accordingly.

        Actual Results:
        You cannot. I have not been able to find a way to implement this function.

        Notes:
        You also can’t implement this function by iterating in both directions, because you can’t get the predecessor of the startIndex, nor (presumably) the successor of the endIndex. That limitation is a bit more understandable, though.
