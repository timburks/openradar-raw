    description: "Summary:\r\nToday extensions in Swift do not work if you specify the NSExtensionPrincipalClass key unless you make your class Objective C compatible with the @objc flag.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Single View iOS Xcode project using Xcode 6.0 (6A254o)\r\nMake sure the language is set to Swift\r\nAdd a Today Extension target also with the swift language\r\nDelete the Maininterface.storyboard file generated by the template in the extension target\r\nIn the Extensions Info.plist, remove the NSExtensionMainStoryboard key\r\nIn the Extensions Info.plist, add the NSExtensionPrincipalClass key and set its value to the view controllers class name (TodayViewController)\r\nBuild and Run the Widget\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe widget should run and no exceptions should be thrown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn exception is thrown because the device cannot find the view controller specified by the NSExtensionPrincipalClass key.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5s Simulator from Xcode 6.0 (6A254o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can get around this by specifying @objc(TodayViewController) above the Class declaration in the swift file however the application shouldnâ€™t have to specify that its an Objective C class itself.\r\n\r\nI am assuming this i a bug because there is no mention of it in the App Extension Programming Guide\r\nI also started a thread before i fixed the issue on the devforms: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/235168?tstart=0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator from Xcode 6.0 (6A254o) \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
