    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a storyboard we cannot enable Auto Layout at the scene level. Either all scenes in the storyboard use Auto Layout or they don't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a storyboard\r\n- Add several View Controller scenes\r\n- Select a single scene\r\n- Attempt to enable / disable auto layout for a single scene\r\n- No such option exists\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a checkbox to enable Auto Layout for individual scenes in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such functionality. I cannot enable or disable Auto Layout on a single scene.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany projects have large storyboard files. Some of those storyboard files do not have Auto Layout enabled. If we had the ability to enable Auto Layout on individual scenes, converting an app to use Auto Layout would be greatly simplified. Currently it's all or nothing, and that is a huge barrier to entry."
