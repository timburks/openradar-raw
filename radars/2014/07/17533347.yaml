    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen leaving and re-joining a multipeer session with more than two peers, the reconnecting peer only gets connected to the peer it sent the invitation to. \r\n\r\nThe session's delegate does get a `session:peer:didChangeState:` call with `MCSessionStateConnected` for the peer that doesn't get connected, but the session's `connectedPeers` array doesn't contain that peer and any attempts to communicate with it fails. E.g. opening a stream fails with `Error Domain=MCSession Code=0 \"Peer not connected\" UserInfo=0x14658900 {NSLocalizedDescription=Peer not connected}`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project on three devices, subsequently called devices A, B and C.\r\n\r\n* Device A invites devices B and C to the session by pressing the \"Connect\" button and sending invitations via the peer browser.\r\n* Devices B and C accepts the invitation\r\n* Session with all three devices connected is established, everything works\r\n* Device A leaves the session by pressing the \"Disconnect\" button\r\n* Device B invites device A back into the session using the \"Connect\" button\r\n* Device A accepts the invitation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA session with peers A, B and C gets established\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice A and B are connected and can communicate but there is no communication between devices A and C possible. The connection between devices B and C is not affected.\r\n\r\nBoth devices A and C gets a `session:peer:didChangeState:` method call with `MCSessionStateConnected` in the session delegate, but the session's `connectedPeers` array doesn't contain the peer the delegate was notified of being connected. Also, attempts to communicate with the supposedly connected peers fails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1, iOS 8.0 beta2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, iPad mini retina, iPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'multipeer-reconnect-test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
