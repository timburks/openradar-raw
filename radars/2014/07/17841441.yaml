    description: "Summary:\r\nOn OS X, NSParagraphStyle has a public `textLists` method, which returns an array of `NSTextList` instances. This method and class don't exist as public API in the iOS SDK, but it would be extremely useful if they did. I'm requesting that NSParagraphStyle is made consistent across the iOS and OS X SDKs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to call `textLists` method on an `NSParagraphStyle` instance on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`textLists` should exist as public API in the iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`textLists` does not exist as public API in the iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7-8\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS SDK"
