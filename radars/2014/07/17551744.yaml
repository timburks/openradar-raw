    description: "Summary:\r\n-[NSExtensionContext openURL:completionHandler:] doesn't open the custom URL scheme its container app has and passes success = NO in its completion handler.\r\n\r\nI know that it's not supposed to open arbitrary URLs, but I couldn't see anything in the docs stating that I should do anything specific to enable this or make the extension recognize its container app's scheme, so I'm expecting it to work right away.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS 8 Beta 2 app.\r\n2. Specify a custom URL scheme for your app. (myapp://)\r\n3. Add an Action Extension to the app.\r\n4. in ActionViewController -viewDidLoad add:\r\n        [self.extensionContext openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"myapp://\"] completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {\r\n            NSLog(@\"%d\", success);\r\n        }];\r\n5. Attach debugger to the extension process\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe container app should be launched and \"success\" should equal YES.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe container app doesn't open and \"success\" equals no.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator"
