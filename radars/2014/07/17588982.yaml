        Summary:
        Yosemite comes with vulnerable OpenSSL 0.9.8y

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install Yosemite beta 3

        Expected Results:
        Yosemite should come with the current release of security relevant software like OpenSSL. At least with the latest release of the 0.9.8 tree.

        Actual Results:
        Yosemite still ships with a prehistoric version of OpenSSL with at least 7 known vulnerabilities.

        Regression:
        OpenSSL should be upgraded to the current OpenSSL 1.0.1 release and binaries delivered with OS X should be linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1.

        Notes:
        I am aware that OpenSSL is deemed deprecated on OS X by Apple.
        It's also irresponsible to ship an outdated version of a security library that is used by many binaries linked against it that ship by default in OS X.
