    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen having set Siri to German you can ask for a Timer to be started with “5 Minute Timer”, but not with “5 Minute Countdown”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Set Siri to German\r\n- Hold the Home Button to get Siri to listen\r\n- Ask for “5 Minuten Countdown”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- a 5 Minute Timer should begin to count down\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Siri performs a web search for “5 Minuten Count-down”\r\n- German user gets frustrated\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- This has been bothering me for quite some time\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn German both “Timer” and “Countdown” can be used synonymously, both being words borrowed from the English language, both being pronounced the English way."
