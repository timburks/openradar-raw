    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an Inbox Rule is reapplied to messages (“Apply Rules” in the Messages menu), if the rule changes the color of the message (either background or text), the message is not redisplayed as it should be with the changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a rule that changes the color (either background or text) or every message. \r\n2. Select one or more messages in a MessageViewer\r\n3. Select Message => Apply Rules\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe indicated color should be set on the message immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message in the list does not appear to have changed, actually if you select a different mailbox and then reselect the Inbox, it will then be shown properly colored, but not until then.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has changed from version 7.x of Mail, where it used to update immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
