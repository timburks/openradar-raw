        Summary:

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open up PDF or watch session video

        Expected Results:
        That key to be correct, my extension to work, me not to cry.

        The key is not correct (“NSExtensionActivationRule”), my extension doesn’t work, I cry.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        It’d be nice if these keys and values (https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/SystemExtensionKeys.html) were referenced, somewhere, on this (https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Services.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH13-SW1) page.
