        Summary:
        AppleID Two-factor authentication not used on iCloud.com

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Activate Two-Factor authentication for an AppleID on https://appleid.apple.com

        Expected Results:
        Two-Factor should be used for ALL logins that use my AppleID.

        Actual Results:
        I can't find ANY login that will require Two-Factor other than https://appleid.apple.com

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        This makes Two-Factor useless if it is not used at all.
