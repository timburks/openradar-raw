    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Yosemite, if you download and install an action, then try to run an Automator service that uses that action, it will just silently fail. The only way to understand and fix the problem is to open the Automator app and add the action to a workflow. Then you can click the \"Load\" button that is required to approve it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download an Automator action, for example: http://junecloud.com/beta/junecloud-automator-actions.xip\r\n2. Double-click the action and then follow the prompts to install it.\r\n3. Right-click a file in the Finder.\r\n4. Open the Services submenu and choose a service that uses the recently installed action. This could be an action you already had installed (perhaps the action had an update) or perhaps a service that came with the action.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause I am attempting to run code downloaded from the internet, at some point in this process I should be asked if I want to allow the action to run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. I don't even get an error in Console, strangely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 DP 3 (14A283o)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
