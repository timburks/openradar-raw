    description: "If an app is launched by another app we can extract the bundle name of the launching app from  \r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions.  The value for key UIApplicationLaunchOptionsSourceApplicationKey gives us the bundle name of the launching app.\r\n\r\nHowever, when an app is launched by Siri launchOptions is empty. It would be great if we could somehow know that our app was launched by Siri (if we for example would like to enable voice commands in our app)."
