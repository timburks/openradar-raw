    description: As of OSX SDK 10.10 beta3, WKWebView does not provide callbacks about events related to external resources (images, scripts, style sheets) being loaded in the current page as part of the navigation process. This is clearly a step backwards in functionality compared to the former WebView class which did offer the WebResourceLoadDelegate API to monitor resource loading. The most important aspect of this issue is to be able to observe/alter/cancel the URL requests corresponding to the page resources. WKWebView should have an API for this.
