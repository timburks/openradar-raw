    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of Xcode, the size of an iPhone screen in Interface Builder was 320 x 640. In Beta 4, the screen size has been increased to 400 x 800. However, when you build for any of the iPhones and run a program in the simulator, the simulator is only 320 x 640.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open XCode 6 Beta 4 and start a new project.\r\n2. Navigate to the main.storyboard\r\n3. Change the size class to Compact Regular.\r\n4. Add a label with a width of 320 pts, and change the background color to stand out from the background of the view. \r\n5. Align the label with the left side of the view. There should be 80pts of whitespace between the right edge of the label and the right side of the view controller. \r\n6. Build and run the project for iPhone 4s/5/5s. \r\n7. Compare view in Interface Builder with the view on the simulator. (See http://imgur.com/EpV4oOr)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view in the simulator should be the same as the view in Interface Builder. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view with the Compact/Regular size class is too large and doesn't match with the size of the simulator.\r\n\r\nEdit: Issue Closed for following reason:\r\n\r\nThis was an intentional design decision. A user should not be focusing on designing for a particular device in the canvas, instead they should be looking at the Preview Assistant to see what it will look like on an actual device. The canvas is meant to be generic."
