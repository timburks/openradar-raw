    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen pinching to zoom in Xcode 6â€™s view hierarchy debugger, the zoom motion should be centered around the cursor, not around the center of the view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run a GUI project in Xcode 6.\r\n2. Click the Debug View Hierarchy button.\r\n3. Position your cursor near a corner of the view being debugged (e.g. if you wanted to zoom in on some element in the corner).\r\n4. Pinch outwards on the trackpad to zoom in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe zoom is centered around the position of the cursor. If the cursor is at the corner of the view, when I am done zooming, the corner of the view should be large and visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe zoom is centered around the center of the view. If I wanted to look at the corner, I have to pan to find it after I have zoomed in.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A267n)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPreview and Safari on Mac get this right. Photoshop CC gets this wrong.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
