    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the attached project, I have a UICollectionView whose cells have non-scrollable UITextView subviews. The UITextView is constrained using AutoLayout to its parent cell's edges using top, bottom, and leading space constraints. The UITextView also has a fix width constraint.\r\n\r\nI am calculating the cell's size at runtime using the systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: method on a temporarily allocated cell, loaded from a nib in the bundle (the same nib that is registered with the UICollectionView). That size is then returned in the UICollectionView's flow layout delegate method: collectionView:layout:sizeForItemAtIndexPath:\r\n\r\nThis works in iOS 7, but not in iOS 8. In iOS 7 the systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: method returns a valid height for the temporary cell, but in iOS 8 it returns a height of 0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee description & attached project.\r\n\r\n1. Create a UICollectionView and define its cells in a separate nib\r\n2. Add a UITextView subview to the UICollectionViewCell nib\r\n3. Add constraints in IB from the UITextView to its parent view for top, bottom, and leading spacing, and add a fixed width constraint to the UITextView\r\n4. Calculate the cell's size at runtime using systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSize returned by systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: should be non-zero (which is true in iOS 7 but not iOS 8)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSize returned by systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: is zero in iOS 8\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8"
