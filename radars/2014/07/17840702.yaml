    description: "Summary:\r\nImmediately upon opening a second playground in Xcode 6b4, an error \"Playground execution terminated because the playground process exited unexpectedly.\" appears. Pressing \"OK\" brings the same error up a second or two later, repeatedly, until finally closing one of the two Playgrounds. Code in playgrounds do not contain any parsing errors, and all work normally when they are the only one open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Playground with some executable code in it.\r\n2. Open a second Playground with some executable code in it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect no errors to display, and to be able to use the playgrounds without interruption. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am constantly interrupted with the error message until closing one of the two playgrounds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 4 (6A267n). Mac OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)."
