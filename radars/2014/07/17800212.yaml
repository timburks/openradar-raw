    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scroll bars are set to always, you cannot see the right side of the content of the mail item list. Mostly it's the year that is clipped. Expanding the width of this column does not help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet Show scroll bars to Always in General preferences.\r\nMail then incorrectly clips the right side of the mail item list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content should not be clipped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe content, particularly the date, is clipped and cannot be seen under the scroll bar."
