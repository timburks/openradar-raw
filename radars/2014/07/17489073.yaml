    description: "In Objective C it is fairly easy to create an object at runtime that implements a certain interface by using things forwardInvocation. This makes creating mock objects in unit tests fairly nice. e.g. [OCMock niceMockForClass:[MyClass class]\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a similar feature-set for Swift that allows creating mock/stub objects. It would also be necessary to have a good reflection api that can understand types."
