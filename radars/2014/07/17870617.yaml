    description: "Summary:\r\nThe standard technique for rendering a WebGL context in Retina resolution is to set the CSS style for the canvas element to the 1x resolution while setting the direct dimensions of the context to the 2x dimensions. In Chrome, Firefox, and iOS 8 Safari, this technique works perfectly. In Safari and Webkit on OS X Yosemite, this causes some sort of image interpolation which blurs sharp lines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEasy version:\r\n1. Download the attached HTML file.\r\n2. Open the HTML file in Safari 8 on OS X Yosemite on a HiDPI display.\r\n3. Open the HTML file in Chrome on OS X Yosemite on a HiDPI display.\r\n4. Compare the two left boxes. These are 2D canvases. They should be sharp in both browsers.\r\n5. Compare the two right boxes. These are WebGL canvases. The Chrome one appears sharp, but the Safari one is slightly blurred.\r\n\r\nHarder version:\r\n1. Create an HTML file.\r\n2. Write WebGL code, using the standard scaling technique to support HiDPI rendering.\r\n3. Open the HTML file in Safari 8 on OS X Yosemite on a HiDPI display.\r\n4. Open the HTML file in Chrome on OS X Yosemite on a HiDPI display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe images rendered in Safari should be sharp and should match those provided by Chrome.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe WebGL canvas element provided by Safari is blurred on a HiDPI display and doesn't match Chrome's sharp image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 8.0 (10538.46) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the included HTML file, a 2D canvas is provided alongside the 3D WebGL canvas. This is to illustrate that the blurriness on the WebGL canvas is unique to it, as the 2D canvas gets scaled down correctly and appears sharp.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.10 Developer Preview 4 (14A298i), MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), Intel Iris Pro + NVIDIA GeForce GT 750m GPU, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD\r\n\r\nOpen Radar Note:\r\nThe attached HTML file is also available here:\r\nhttp://drewfitz-public.s3.amazonaws.com/WebGL-Bug-Radar/canvas-scaling-test.html"
