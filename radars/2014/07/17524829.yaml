    description: "The App Store search functionality does not work. When typing, the search gives out suggestions, yet tapping the Search button on the keyboard does not perform a search. In addition, tapping on a search suggestion in the popover does not work either. \r\n\r\nWhen tapping search, the popover disappears as expected, yet there is no change in UI, and search results do not appear."
