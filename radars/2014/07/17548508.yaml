    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the previous version of Xcode, it was possible to delete a constraint from the popover. In Xcode 6, this isn't the case anymore.\r\nSince you can't select a constraint in the Size Inspector, keyboard shortcuts don't work either... Nor does right clicking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to storyboard\r\n2. Add view and constraints\r\n3. Go to Size Inspector and look for Constraints\r\n4. Click a constraint\r\n5. A popover will show, without a remove button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA popover which has also a remove button. Or a menu with remove on right click.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo remove button visible."
