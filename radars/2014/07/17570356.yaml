        Summary:
        The Swift standard library reference should state whether sort()’s algorithm is stable or not.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write a pair of sort()s, as in <https://devforums.apple.com/thread/234618>.
        2. Wonder if the code will work the way you intend.
        3. Look it up in the Swift documentation.

        Expected Results:
        The documentation specifies this behavior.

        Actual Results:
        It does not. You’re left to wonder. (It turns out it’s not stable.)

        Notes:
        It’s perfectly acceptable for Swift to use an unstable sort, but that fact ought to be part of the sort function’s contract.
