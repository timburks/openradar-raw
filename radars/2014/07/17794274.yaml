    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to present a new view controller in an overlay style in the iPhone while keeping the underlying one visible I set the modal presentation style of my view controller hierarchy to UIModalPresentationCurrentContext. \r\nThis achieves the desired effect but whenever I use a unwind segue to dismiss that modal view controller I have to explicitly dismiss it but only if the origin view controller is embedded in a UINavigationController. This differs from all the other modal presentation styles where just triggering an unwind segue brings me back to the right view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the sample project and touch the \"Launch Modal\" button;\r\nVerify that you can see through the modal view controller;\r\nTouch the \"Dismiss this screen\" to go back to the origin view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter performing the previous steps the modal view controller should have been dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modal view controller is not dismissed and the developer has to dismiss it explicitly in the unwind method.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (iOS 8 does not let me see through)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices including the simulator"
