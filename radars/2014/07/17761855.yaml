    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating an iOS Share Extension should not require a storyboard. Currently this requirement implicitly exists because there is no other way to specify an initial view controller in a Share Extension. When writing applications, the root view controller of a window can be set programmatically in -application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:.\r\n\r\nBecause I do all of my view layouts programmatically, I would prefer to specify the Share Extension's initial view controller inside the info.plist for the target.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a Share Extension.\r\n2. Try to figure out how to delete that Storyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI hoped to find a solution that would allow me to delete the storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI did not find a solution that allowed me to delete the storyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 4 SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A267n)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
