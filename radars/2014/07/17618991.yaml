    description: "Developers should be given programmatic access to the user's WiFi and Bluetooth settings, with the user's permission.\r\n\r\nOn Android, a whole suite of automation apps are made possible through having programmatic access to the WiFi and Bluetooth settings. Imagine iOS apps that can turn off your WiFi to save battery while you're in the car while simultaneously turning on Bluetooth to interact with the car. It could turn on WiFi and turn off Bluetooth when you've arrived at home or work.\r\n\r\nThe configuration possibilities are relatively endless, but these sorts of apps currently aren't possible on iOS."
