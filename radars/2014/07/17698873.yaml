    description: "Summary:\r\nDouble tapping on content in a UIWebView should scroll/zoom to make that content visible. If the webview's scroll view has a content inset, then the web view gets confused. The content the user tapped on actually scrolls to the absolute top of the web view, rather than taking the content inset into account.\r\n\r\nThis is bad for the user, as if the web view is partially behind a navigation bar (or similar) then the content they double tap appears behind the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Launch app from the WebViewInset zip file\r\n2: Double tap content in the webview\r\n\r\nIn the attached zip, \"WebViewInset.mov\" shows the bug\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent should be within visible part of the webview (i.e. within content insets)\r\nIn this specific case I would expect the content to stay still\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent moves out of sight, above the content inset\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, AT&T 64 GBWebViewInset.zip - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WebViewInset.zip' was successfully uploaded."
