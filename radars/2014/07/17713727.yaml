    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working on ranging for iBeacons, we've noticed that multiple phones, ranging from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 5s have issues ranging for beacons and getting data back. Calling `startRangingBeaconsInRegion:` will work, but nothing will be returned from delegate calls for `locationManager:didRangeBeacons:inRegion` or `locationManager:rangingBeaconsDidFailForRegion:withError:`. While this bug is not consistently reproducible, out of the 10 devices we've been testing it on, it has occurred for 2 devices already.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create CLLocationManager\r\n2. Create CLBeaconRegion\r\n3. Be in range of the beacon/beacons\r\n4. Call `startRangingBeaconsInRegion`\r\n5. Observe beacons or error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeacons will be returned in `locationManager:didRangeBeacons:inRegion` or a failure from `locationManager:rangingBeaconsDidFailForRegion:withError`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo callbacks from either delegate method, but beacons will appear after rebooting the phone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1 and 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe reboot often solves the problem, but telling our users to reboot is not an optimal UX.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, Verizon, 16gb on WiFi, iPhone 4s, AT&T, 16gb on WiFi"
