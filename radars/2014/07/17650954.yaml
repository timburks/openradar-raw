    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen two classes, e.g. Foo and Bar, in which one inherits from the other, e.g. Bar: Foo, and in which the two classes are defined in separate .swift files, contain computed class properties that are overridden in the subclass, the subclass's implementation cannot be called without causing a compiler error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the attached sample project\r\n2. build+run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe program should output \"bar\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiler error:\r\n\r\nmain.swift:20:9: error: ambiguous use of 's'\r\nprintln(Bar.s)\r\n        ^\r\nBar.swift:12:24: note: found this candidate\r\n    override class var s: String! {\r\n                       ^\r\nmain.swift:13:15: note: found this candidate\r\n    class var s: String! {\r\n              ^"
