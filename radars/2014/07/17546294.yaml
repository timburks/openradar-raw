        Summary:
        In session 217 of WWDC14, the presenter demonstrates the use of extensions to allow third party manipulation of context menu content on Mac OS X. Allowing third party enhancement of the iOS context menus would open up some pretty neat text manipulation app extensions. Because text is something that is used throughout most apps, building extensions that are available to all apps in this way makes sense.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        See Summary

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        Here’s an oversimplified use case. I have an app that allows me to write beautifully formatted JavaScript and update my sites on the go. With iOS 8’s extensions (plus this suggested feature), I could offer users typing JavaScript in any text control the ability to Pretty Print their text, right from the context menu.
