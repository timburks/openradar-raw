    description: "Summary:\nThis function presents quite a handy use case, as is documented here:\n\nhttp://kmikael.com/2014/06/22/swift-type-conversions/\n\nAlthough, according to the dev forum thread here: \n\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/988450#988450\n\nthis is not a public API but a private “implementation detail”. Please consider making this a publicly available API, as it would save a considerable amount of coding\n\nThis may or may not duplicate radar 17410068."
