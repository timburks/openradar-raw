        Summary:
        Swift declarations are internal by default. Implicit initializers for structs cannot be made public even if the struct is public. You have to explicitly implement them if you want them to be public.

        EmptyGenerator does not have an explicit initializer; ergo, EmptyGenerator() does not compile.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to make an EmptyGenerator.


        Expected Results:
        Victory.


        Actual Results:
        Defeat.


        Regression:
        This worked in b3, because b3 didnâ€™t have access control at all.


        Notes:
        I have a feeling that the inability to specify access control for implicit initializers is going to be the source of further trouble.
