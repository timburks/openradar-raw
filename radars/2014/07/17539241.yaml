    description: "Summary:\r\nThe .xcappdata format is very useful, although underused. Part of this seems to be because the ability to create one of these packages is buried in the Organizer, even though the packages are usable when running either Simulator or Device by specifying the .xcappdata package as Application Data in the scheme's Run Options.\r\n\r\nAdding the ability to create the package from existing Simulator builds would make it easier and faster to create these packages for use in user scenario testing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\niOS 7.1.1 [11D201]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
