    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a SKScene as an overlay scene on a SCNView, calling -[SKScene convertPointToView:] will crash because SCNView doesn't implement -[SCNView _viewTranslation]. Attached is a playground with a minimal reproduction of this crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode beta 4 on 10.10 beta 4\r\n2. Create a new OS X playground\r\n3. Create a SpriteKit scene and a SceneKit view\r\n4. Set the view's overlaySKScene property to the scene you just created\r\n5. Call the scene's convertPointToView method\r\n6. Observe the crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the method works exactly as if the scene were set as the scene in a SKView.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe method crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A267n)\r\nOS X Version 10.10 (14A298i)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs always on a 13\" retina MBP with the Xcode and OS X versions noted below."
