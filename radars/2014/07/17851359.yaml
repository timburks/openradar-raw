    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to various Internet (blog / StackOverflow) postings, it used to be possible to launch an app in iOS Simulator from the command line by supplying the path to the app executable via -SimulateApplication parameter. As of Mavericks / Xcode 5, this no longer appears to work.\r\n\r\nNote: it *does* work when pointing to a build-in app (e.g. Safari)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build app targeting iOS Simulator\r\n2. Launch simulator from Terminal, supplying -SimulateApplication parameter like this: /path/to/simulator -SimulateApplication /path/to/MyApp.app/MyApp\r\n3. Observe that simulator launches but the app does not open\r\n\r\nHowever, the same steps, pointed to Safari.app/Safari do result in simulator launching and opening Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould expect the simulator to launch my app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimulator does not launch my app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks\r\nXcode 5.1.1\r\niOS Simulator Version 7.1 (463.9.41)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are developing a tool aimed at iOS developers, and forcing them to step out of our tool and into Xcode just to launch their app is cumbersome at best. We need a way to launch the app in simulator directly from our tool.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air\r\nOS X Mavericks\r\nXcode 5.1.1"
