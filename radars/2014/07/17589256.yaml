    description: "Summary:\r\nShouldn't the completion handlers of CloudKit convenience methods be called on the same thread of the methods that instantiated them?\r\n\r\nScenario: Save a record to CloudKit using CKDatabase saveRecord:completionHandler: on the completion handler reload a tableview.  Since the completion handler isn't called on the main thread (it's actually called on the com.apple.cloudkit.operation.callback queue), strange things happen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCall the completion handler on the same thread that the convenience method was invoked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Beta 3 with XCode 6 beta 3. Both device and simulators.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that there are no plans to address this based on the following:\r\n\r\nCompletion handlers can be called on any thread/queue. It is the responsibility of the caller to send them to a specific queue if necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether that helps you resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
