    description: "Summary:\r\nInterface Builder in Xcode 6 allows it to enable/disable layout constraints on views based on the size class. That way it is possible to design different UIs for e.g. iPhone Portrait, iPhone Landscape and iPad in a single XIB.\r\n\r\nWhat's missing is the possibility to specify other attributes based on the size class, for example the font of a label or the contentMode of an imageView. We have to resort back to change this properties based on the size class in code, which defeats the purpose of Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single XIB file using size classes\r\n2. Add a label to the XIB and set the font to system font of size 15\r\n2. Select any different size class than (wAny hAny), e.g. (wAny hCompact)\r\n3. Change the font of the label to system font of size 18\r\n4. switch back to the size class (wAny hAny)\r\n5. The font size is changed to 18\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe font size should stay at 15 in (wAny hAny) and should only be changed to 18 in (wAny hCompact)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe font size is changed globally and can't be changed for a  specific size class\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
