    description: "When sending an email from within an app (except Mail), the 'Notify Me' popover contains placeholder text, rather than the normal and informative text.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in all apps apart from the stock Mail app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app that contains a share sheet that supports email sending (i.e Maps, App Store, or any app downloaded from the App Store).\r\n2. Go to a share sheet within that app and select Email.\r\n3. Tap on the Subject text field.\r\n4. Tap on the bell icon to the side.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe popover should contain an informative message for the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popover contains placeholder text."
