    description: "While detailed comments are often useful when first reading a source code file, if later one wants to see the broad outline of a function or method it would be useful to suppress display of comments temporarily.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be, once the option to suppress comments is activated, to substitute all consecutive comment lines by a single line with a \"//\" inside a gray oval button, and also substitute comments at the end of a line with the same button. Clicking on such a button would pop up a small window containing the comment(s)."
