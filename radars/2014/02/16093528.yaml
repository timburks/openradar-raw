    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is at least one error dialog in Screen Sharing.app that uses double spaces after sentences. OS X standard seems to be one space after a period.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Screen share to another Mac by clicking the Share Screen button in the Finder.\r\n2. Drag two large files to the screen sharing window to begin transferring it to that Mac. (I use two because that’s how many I was transferring when I first reproduced the bug, and presumably the text in the dialog box is different when transferring one file.)\r\n3. Click the red Close button on the Screen Sharing window. A dialog box appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dialog box’s sentences have one space after them, like this:\r\n\r\nFile transfers are in progress.\r\nAre you sure you want to close this session? Screen Sharing is currently transferring 2 files. If you close the session now, the transfers will not finish.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog box’s sentences have two spaces after them. There is a screenshot attached, but the text of the dialog box is as follows:\r\n\r\nFile transfers are in progress.\r\nAre you sure you want to close this session?  Screen Sharing is currently transferring 2 files.  If you close the session now, the transfers will not finish.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B42)\r\nScreen Sharing 1.5 (480.53)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/Txv7"
