    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UIDatePicker control with the mode UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer, the event UIControlEventValueChanged is not called the first time the user selects a countdown duration, but is called all subsequent times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode.\r\n2. Create a new project using the iOS 7 SDK.\r\n3. Add a UIDatePicker control to the view.\r\n4. Set the mode of the UIDatePick to UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer.\r\n5. Setup a delegate for the UIControlEventValueChanged event.\r\n6. Run the app through the simulator or an iOS device.\r\n7. Scroll the UIDatePicker.\r\n8. Observer that the delegate for UIControlEventValueChanged on the UIDatePicker is not called the first time it is scrolled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the user sets the value on the UIDatePicker for the first time, it should fire the UIControlEventValueChanged event and call the appropriate delegate method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the user sets the value on the UIDatePicker for the first time, it does NOT fire the UIControlEventValueChanged event and does NOT call the appropriate delegate method."
