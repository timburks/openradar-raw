    description: "Summary:\r\nThe purpose of this request is to establish additional context for the presentation of SKStoreProductViewController.\r\n\r\nNumerous applications have relied on [UIApplication openURL:] to open the App Store in a context conducive to Gifting or Reviewing the app. This no longer appears to work in iOS 7. The former evinces an error that reads \"Feature Not Supported\".\r\n\r\nSKStoreProductViewController exists as a potential alternative, but opening an app actually disables the \"Write a Review\" link and suppresses the Share bar button item that allows you to gift an app (see attached).\r\n\r\nSKStoreProductViewController currently allows you to load the view controller with some context (e.g., SKStoreProductParameterITunesItemIdentifier). Perhaps additional parameters could be defined to optionally enable the Gifting and/or Reviewing of an app? It would also be nice if one could pass the iTunes affiliate ID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPresent an instance of SKStoreProductViewController (e.g., iBooks App Store ID is 364709193). Observe that \"Write a Review\" is disabled and Share Item does not appear (again see attached).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind that \"Write a Review\" and/or \"Gift App\" are visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to either Review or Gift an app in the App Store via SKStoreProductViewController.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks for your consideration!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis was attempted on an iPhone. Presumably it impacts the iPad as well."
