    description: "Summary:\r\nNative iOS mail app configured for use with gmail account. No other accounts configured. When viewing messages in the native iOS mail app, as messages are deleted, and the message detail view is accessed, the native iOS mail app is showing the same message twice when returning to the Inbox UITableview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure gmail account for usage with native mail app.\r\n2. Using single inbox, not unified (no other accounts configured).\r\n3. Launch native mail app to view messages, presented with normal-functioning tableview.\r\n4. Select top-most message and move to detail view. \r\n5. Delete 2-3 messages from the detail view.\r\n6. Return to the Inbox tableview.\r\n7. The 4th and 5th (i use smaller text in my UI, messages residing just behind the bottom bar during details view deletion) is shown as a duplicate in the tableview, and appears as a duplicate tableviewcell. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results is that the Inbox UITableview shows one unique message per UITableViewCell.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 4th and 5th (i use smaller text in my UI) is shown as a duplicate in the tableview, and appears as a duplicate tableviewcell (see screenshot attached, some names have been removed to protect the innocent).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7, 7.0.1, 7.0.2, 7.0.3, 7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDoes not seem like a sync issue, seems like an issue where the tableview viewdidappear/load (ie., method being used) is not caught up to the data stored for available messages in the account after the deletion occurs. Workaround is to exit the inbox tableview and go back to the static tableview mail homescreen, and then re-enter the inbox. Also, you can move the native iOS mail app to the background, switch to another application, and come back and the tableview is reloaded and displays properly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDid not occur prior to iOS 7.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'mail_bug', 'photo.PNG' and 'Message.zip' were successfully uploaded."
