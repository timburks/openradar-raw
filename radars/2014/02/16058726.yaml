    description: "Summary:\r\nI expreience the same problem that is described here : https://devforums.apple.com/message/920302#920302 .\r\n\r\n(I know that there are a lot of grammar issues in these forum entries but) I hope you don't mind if I quote from the developer's forum to describe the problem : \r\n\r\n\"I'm upgrading my app to iOS7 and i want sent text message programmatically, with iOS 6 all works fine, but with iOS 7 i have an issue.\r\n\r\ni use this code for open the message composer\r\n\r\nClass messageClass = (NSClassFromString(@\"MFMessageComposeViewController\"));\r\n    if (messageClass != nil && [messageClass canSendText])\r\n    {\r\n        MFMessageComposeViewController *picker = [[MFMessageComposeViewController alloc] init];\r\n        picker.messageComposeDelegate = self;\r\n        picker.recipients = //MY PHONE NUMBERS ARRAY;\r\n        [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthe iPhone display compose view with all contacts correctly inserted, but if i try to send, seem to be all ok but SMS don't sent.\r\n \r\nin messageComposeViewController:(MFMessageComposeViewController *)controller didFinishWithResult: result is MessageComposeResultSent\"\r\n\r\n\"We are seeing this happen frequently.  It seems to happen on 5s models more than others, but this could be just chance as it has been reported on most models at one point or another.\r\n\r\nSeems to be happening more when the sms is to a number that the phone has never sent a message to before.  In this case there is a record of the new phone number in iMessage at the top of the log, but no message, the message screen is blank.\r\n\r\nWe are also getting a MessageComposeResultSent result in our callback.  On failure, there is no sound being made after the \"Send\" button is pressed.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nRestarting the phone also seems to solved the problem, but we have no way of handling the failure to send and notifying the user.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to send a message using MFMessageComposeViewController .\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessage is sent\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessage is not sent\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7 (all current live and beta versions)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS7 (all current live and beta versions), all iPhone versions"
