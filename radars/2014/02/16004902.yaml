    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user moves a currently running application to a new folder, it can cause any number of problems, including the application in question crashing. The Finder should not allow this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Safari to download an application from a website packaged in a .zip file. Safari will automatically unzip the file and place the resulting application in ~/Downloads\r\n2. Open the application\r\n3. Go to the Finder and move the application from ~/Downloads to /Applications (or any other location)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Finder should present an error message saying the application cannot be moved because it is currently open.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder allows the application to be moved. If the user switches back to the running application, they will likely run into glitches and crashes, since Cocoa classes such as NSBundle will still be looking for resources such as nibs, strings files, etc. in ~/Downloads rather than in /Applications.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1/13B42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that the Finder already does present an error message if the user tries to move a running application to the trash. This should be extended so that an error message is shown regardless of the target location. Copying (not moving) the application can still be allowed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe behavior appears to be the same regardless of what hardware or version of OS X is being used."
