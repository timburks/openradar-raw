    description: "If a UINavigationController is removed from the view controller hierarchy during the same iteration of the event loop in which one of its child view controllers was popped from the navigation stack (animated or not) then the popped child view controller will be deallocated, but that child view controller's *view* will not be deallocated.\r\n\r\nIn some (common) cases this can lead to crashes.  For example, if the orphaned view is or contains a UITableView whose data source is the deallocated view controller, this will cause a segfault."
