    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a custom NSURLProtocol is provided to NSURLSession, even if the NSURLRequest has an HTTPBody non-nil when the request is passed to the NRURLProtocol (such as canInitWithRequest: or canonicalRequestForRequest:) has an empty body\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass NSURLProtocol\r\n2. Create an NSURLSessionConfiguration and set as protocolClasses an array containing the previously created NSURLProtocol\r\n3. Create an NSURLRequest with HTTPMethod = @\"POST\" and with non-nil HTTPBody \r\n4. Create a NSURLSession and an NSURLSessionDataTask with the given NSURLRequest\r\n5. resume the NSURLSessionDataTask\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the method of the NSURLProtocol subclass are called the provided request should contains the previously set body\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSURLProtocol subclass method are called with a request with a nil body\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn example project is provided. The project demonstrate that with NSURLConnection the behavior is as expected, with NSURLSession the request has nil body"
