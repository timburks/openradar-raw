    description: "It occurred to me that it would be really nifty to be able to create and mange through Xcode's UI an \"appearance\" file. That is, rather than having to write code and manipulate object classes' UIAppearance attributed, if developers and/or designers could do so using a visual interface through Xcode, a la storyboards, it would make creating a consistent user interface so much easier!\r\n\r\nDesigners could create the necessary Xcode asset (perhaps a .appearance file, just as storyboards are kept in .storyboard files) and implementers would see those appearance settings magically appear in the simulator and on device.\r\n\r\nSuch a feature would really eliminate the need for coders to translate designers' intent: the designers could do it themselves!\r\n\r\nWould love to see Xcode evolve this way, bringing designers closer to the actual creation of their vision."
