    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you dismiss Spotlight on the iOS home screen just right, it animates away over the course of many seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start on the home screen (icon grid) of an iPhone (reproducible on iPad, but more obvious on iPhone). Iâ€™m using a space gray 5s.\r\n2. Pull down with one finger to reveal Spotlight.\r\n3. While still holding your finger on the screen, pull down past the point where the search toolbar is fully visible.\r\n4. Very gently slide up and release. It should be with the minimum velocity required to dismiss the bar, rather than have it snap back to visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bar and keyboard disappear at a sane speed, say < 0.5 s.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf you do it just right, the keyboard dismisses normally, but the search bar moves glacially slowly. In the attached video, you can see it take over 2 seconds, and I have seen it take even longer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\nReproducible on iOS Simulator that ships with Xcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/Tgv9"
