    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a build or test fails, the Issue Navigator displays a list of the issues. Most of the time, fixing the problem will make that issue disappear from the list, but sometimes the issue remains in the list even though building and/or testing completes with no error.\r\n\r\nQuitting and reopening Xcode will sometimes make the phantom issues go away, but sometimes it is necessary to delete the projects' derived data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project with unit tests\r\n\r\n2. Add a new unit test case class to the test project and run tests. The test will fail because the \"testExample\" method in the test case template has an XCTFail() call.\r\n\r\n3. Change the name of \"testExample\" method to \"testExample1\" and remove the XCTFail() call.\r\n\r\n4. Run tests again. This time, tests will succeed, but the Issue Navigator will still show an error message saying that the now-non-existent \"testExample\" failed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIssue should disappear from the Issue Navigator when resolved\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIssue remains in the Issue Navigator\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2/OS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe provided reproducibility steps are focused on unit tests, but similar problems can occur for build errors.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
