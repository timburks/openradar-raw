    description: "Core Bluetooth on iOS 7 provides the ability for an application to register for notifications when a peripheral’s characteristic changes, and if the app is not in memory it will be re-launched and the CBCentralManager’s state restored.\r\n\r\nHowever, if while the app is not running (e.g. jettisoned for memory) the peripheral disconnects and later reconnects, the observation is not restored, nor is the app restored to be notified of the new connection.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we have a Fitbit activity tracker that maintains a connection to the iOS device to display notifications via ANCS, so iOS will re-connect to the peripheral when possible. The peripheral also notifies on a characteristic when it has data to sync to the user’s Fitbit account, which the app watches for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected behavior is for the application to be re-launched and notified of the new connection, via CBCentralManagerRestoredStatePeripheralsKey:\r\n\r\n“CBCentralManagerRestoredStatePeripheralsKey\r\nAn array (an instance of NSArray) of CBPeripheral objects that contains all of the peripherals that were connected to the central manager (or had a connection pending) at the time the app was terminated by the system.”\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication is not restored by the system."
