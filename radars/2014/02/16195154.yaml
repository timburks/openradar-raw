        Summary:
        On archiving then unarchiving an NSTextAttachment object with a UIImage payload, the contents, image and bounds properties all return null values. However, the image can be retrieved from the object's fileWrapper property.

        This means that, for example, an NSAttributedString with a text attachment will "lose" its attachment when saved to a Core Data attribute of type NSTransformableAttributeType.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached project (http://d.pr/f/kBFC/B3yaPwdX) in Xcode 5.0.2 and run on iOS 7.0

        Expected Results:
        The unarchived NSTextAttachment object should yield an image when its -image method is called

        Actual Results:
        The unarchived NSTextAttachment object doesn't yield an image, although it can be reconstructed from the object's fileWrapper property.

        Regression:
        Not known
