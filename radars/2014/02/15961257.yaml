    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I load my RAW-Pictures from my Camera (Canon 70D) to the MBP-Retina and have a look with \"quicklook\" it takes up to 10 seconds for the first image to open. Going to the next picture with the arrow-key takes 5-10 seconds to open the next one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load Camera-RAW Pictures to the Notebook\r\n2. Open them with quicklook (Spacebar) \r\n3. navigate with the Arrow-Keys through them\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLoading of pictures shouldn't take longer than a second to load. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see that the performance is rather poor. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.1 / 13B42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23527361#23527361\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina, 15\", Mid 2012, 258GGB SSD (125GB free Space), 16GB Memory."
