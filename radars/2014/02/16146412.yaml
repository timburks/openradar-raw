    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a target which contains source code that requires special compilation flags (e.g. -fobjc-no-arc), and you uncheck the target box in the file inspector, and re-check it, the compilation flags are not remembered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a project with a target with at least one source file that requires a compiler flag for that file.\r\n2. Navigate to the build phases setting of the target.\r\n3. Add the required flag to that file (or if it's already there, observe it)\r\n4. Navigate to that file. \r\n5. In the Target Membership Section of the File Inspector, uncheck the target. \r\n6. Check the same target.\r\n7. Navigate back to the build phases setting of the target.\r\n8. Observe the file. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile should still have the compilation flag set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompilation flag is not set. If the flag is required to prevent compilation errors (e.g. -fobjc-no-arc), attempting to build the target will cause the errors. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 5A3005\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
