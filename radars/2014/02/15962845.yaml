    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen displaying a UIWebView on a non-retina device running iOS 7 several Core Graphics logs are occasionally displayed in the log when playing an HTML 5 video / YouTube video. They are benign but the wording implies they are serious and there are like 25 of them logged out.\r\n\r\nExample of one of the 25:\r\n\r\nJan 31 18:16:52 Joshs-iPad WebViewTest[2868] <Error>: CGContextSaveGState: invalid context 0x0. This is a serious error. This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error in an upcoming update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single view project\r\n2. Add web view to nib\r\n3. Direct web view to a URL containing an HTML 5 or YouTube Video\r\n4. Run\r\n5. Tap play on the video and observe the log.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen every time, but will occasionally spit out the errors to the console.\r\n\r\nSample project is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo plays properly without displaying Core Graphics errors in the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSeveral errors are displayed like this: \r\n\r\nJan 31 18:16:52 Joshs-iPad WebViewTest[2868] <Error>: CGContextSaveGState: invalid context 0x0. This is a serious error. This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error in an upcoming update.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 running in Xcode Version 5.0.2 (5A3005)"
