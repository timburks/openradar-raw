    description: "To establish a bond/pair with a Bluetooth LE device, an application asks to read a characteristic and the Bluetooth device needs to reply with “not authorized” — then iOS will display a pairing alert, “transparently” to the app.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the user is using the accessory’s companion app (such as Fitbit), and performs an action that explicitly requires pairing (enabling ANCS), we’d like to be more involved in the process. For example, pairing may fail for multiple reasons, but also the user explicitly tapping “Cancel”.\r\n\r\nAs an app developer, we would like to know whether the pairing process failed because the user explicitly canceled, or if it was due to some other (possibly transient) error, such as losing connection, the peripheral going out of range, etc.\r\n\r\n“User canceled” could possibly be communicated via the characteristic value read error."
