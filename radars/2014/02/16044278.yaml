    description: "Summary:\r\nIn most cases, the Up Next list shows the set of songs that will be played following the current song. Clearing this list empties this set, but leaves the current song playing (since the current song is not, strictly speaking, \"Up Next\").\r\n\r\nWhile listening to iTunes Radio, however, the Up Next list shows only the banner \"Playing iTunes Radio.\" Despite this, I'd expect the Clear button to have the same behavior: the current song finishes, then the music stops. This is not the case; instead, the music stops immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start listening to iTunes Radio.\r\n2. Show the Up Next list.\r\n3. Toggle the History icon in the upper right (since it defaults to active).\r\n4. Press Clear in the upper right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iTunes Radio banner disappears and the music stops after the currently playing song.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe music stops immediately."
