    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a CIDetector multiple times, as recommended in the documentation, memory grows unbounded and the feature array is never released.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create project that reuses a single CIDetector.\r\n3. Create multiple calls to featuresInImage:\r\n2. Run project in Instruments.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nfeature array returned by featuresInImage is returned to app and released by the API.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nfeature array returned by featuresInImage is never released by the API, until detector is released."
