    description: "I have an app currently on the store called GIFwrapped. This app is for keeping a collection of animated GIFs and sharing them with others through other apps. At present, I use a UIActivityViewController to share a public URL for images (useful for places like Twitter and Facebook), and UIDocumentInteractionController for sharing the image itself (useful for things like Messages).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that two of the online services that are available for posting images in UIDocumentInteractionController don't support animated GIFs. This becomes a problem because I can't do anything to restrict these options in my code, which means that a large percentage of users end up posting images that don't animate, and being confused as to why. \r\n\r\nI would like to propose that, like UIActivityViewController, UIDocumentInteractionController should have a method for excluding certain activity/interaction types, so that the presented modal can be customised by the developer. Ideally, this would be implemented in the same way as UIActivityViewController.\r\n\r\nThere should be a property added called `excludedInteractionTypes` that accepts an array of strings that correspond to the interaction that the developer wants displayed to the user. There should be a predefined string available for all of the possible system interactions (i.e. social sheets, Airdrop, etc.). The property should also accept app IDs (such as com.jellystyle.GIFwrapped) to restrict the display of certain apps.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there should be a method for adding custom interactions, similar to that provided by the second parameter of UIActivityViewController's `initWithActivityItems:applicationActivities:`. This would allow, for example, the upload of the document data to a custom web service from within the standard view, or the sending of the document through a custom social messaging service implemented within the app.\r\n\r\nAdding these abilities would improve UIDocumentInteractionController and make it a far better method of sharing documents."
