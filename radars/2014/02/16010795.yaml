    description: Say you have a Mac and iOS Version of an app and you'd like to use the same "foo://" URL Scheme. It actually makes sense, because you can send an email to your customers and tell them "open this same URL on your Mac and on your iOS Device". The problem, for a developer, is that during testing, clicking on that "foo://" will try to open the iOS SImulator version of the app, before the OS X Version.
