    description: "Summary:\r\nI share my desktop with my others with separate password accounts. \r\n\r\nI recently discovered that notification for email, calendar events and reminders, and Safari push were being displayed on login screen. I did not expect these private events to be \"shared\" with everyone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a notification providers enabled with 'show' option checked on.This appears to be default.\r\n2. Switch to separate account\r\n3. Log out and return to main login screen.\r\n4. Trigger an event and have it displayed publicly to all with potentially sensitive data.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) I expect this setting to require explicit opt-in from users.\r\n2) Ability to set all notifications on lock screen to off with one-click (or setting option). Right now, this requires me to go to all notification entries and de-select individually.This also requires me to continually audit this when I install a new app.\r\n3) Perhaps a special case when using multi-user setup and have it be disabled by default.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPrivate info shared with all users that use the same computer."
