    description: "Summary:\r\nxcodebuild expects its arguments to be encoded as UTF-8 (composed form), and does not accept arguments encoded as UTF-8-MAC (decomposed form).\r\n\r\nNSTask encodes its arguments by invoking -[NSString fileSystemRepresentation], which encodes using UTF-8-MAC (decomposed form), which makes it extremely difficult to successfully invoke xcodebuild via NSTask when some arguments contain non-ASCII code points.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode\r\n2. Create a new Xcode project called \"EncodingBugTest\"\r\n3. Rename the main app target to \"Ä\" (that is the A-umlaut)\r\n4. Open Terminal\r\n5. Ensure that Terminal is using the \"Unicode (UTF-8)\" character encoding: (Preferences > Settings > (Selected profile) > Advanced > Character encoding)\r\n6. Use the `cd` command to change the Terminal working directory to the one where you saved the Xcode project\r\n7. Run: xcodebuild -project EncodingBugTest.xcodeproj -target $(iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8-MAC /dev/stdin <<< \"Ä\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected xcodebuild to successfully build the project target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead we see the following:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild: error: The project 'EncodingBugTest.xcodeproj' does not contain a target named 'Ä'.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.0.2 (5A3005)"
