    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Objective-C development, it is common to have a set of identifiers that contain the same words but different cases. For example, a class might contain this:\r\n\r\n- (Foo *)foo { return self._foo; }\r\n- (void)setFoo:(Foo *)newFoo { self._foo = newFoo; }\r\n\r\nIf one wants to change this, or copy-paste-and-replace to create similar methods for a different word, one has to perform two separate search-and-replace operations. For example, to change the above from foo/setFoo to bar/setBar, one to first replace \"foo\" with \"bar\" and then replace \"Foo\" with \"Bar\". And a third operation may be needed if there is also a need to replace \"FOO\" with \"BAR\".\r\n\r\nFor such situations, it would be helpful if the Xcode find/replace function offered an option to try to match the case when replacing. So, rather than requiring three separate find-and-replace operations, the editor would be smart enough to try to match the case pattern.\r\n\r\nSuch functionality already exists in Emacs (see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Replacement-and-Case.html) and in Sublime Text (the \"Preserve Case\" option).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2/OS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
