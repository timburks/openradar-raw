    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm seeing incorrect drawing (swapped channels) with\r\n(1) Images from asset catalog .car files\r\n(2) That are read (only read from, not modified!) with vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage before they are drawn.\r\n\r\nOr vice versa. Drawn first, then read with vImage also gets incorrect data, with swapped color channels.\r\n\r\nSee test app at https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xun5bu1psrz10c/AssetCatalogWoes.zip\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like there's a cache invalidation problem in a CoreUI asset catalog image provide. Once the cache gets created for use with vImage, it gets incorrectly used for drawing or vice versa."
