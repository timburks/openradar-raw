    description: "Summary:\r\n[CLLocationManager isMonitoringAvailableForClass:[CLRegion class]] returns YES ... even when Background App Refresh is disabled. It should return NO, and the documentation should reflect this.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 7, if you do not enable Background App Refresh for your device, but rather enable Location Services for your device and your app interrogates the state of the regions in your application, CLLocationManager's monitoringDidFailForRegion will be called with the error: kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied - \"Access to the region monitoring service was denied by the user.\" Unfortunately behind the scenes, region monitoring services seem to require Background App Refresh so that the app then has the ability to operate in the background, but `isMonitoringAvailableForClass` returns YES.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn iOS 7, if you do not enable Background App Refresh for your device, but rather enable Location Services for your device and your app and attempt to interrogate the state of the regions in your application CLLocationManager's monitoringDidFailForRegion with kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied - \"Access to the region monitoring service was denied by the user.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmonitoringDidFailForRegion would not be called and that didDeterminStateForRegion would be called instead. Also, isMonitoringAvailableForClass should return NO if Background App Refresh is disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmonitoringDidFailForRegion is called with the error: kCLErrorRegionMonitoringDenied - \"Access to the region monitoring service was denied by the user.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4"
