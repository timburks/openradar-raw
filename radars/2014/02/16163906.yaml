    description: "Summary:\r\nmDNS doesn't always communicate over WiFi IPv4 interfaces on iOS devices.  I've setup a network where an iPad and a Windows 7 PC running iTunes is connected to an Access Point that does not provide DHCP.  In this scenario, both the iPad claims a link-local address for both IPv4 and IPv6.  The Windows 7 machine claims a link-local for both IPv4 and IPv6 as well.\r\n\r\nIf I launch the Remote app on the iPad, iTunes never detects the Remote mDNS service in order to display the \"remote\" button that allows the pairing.\r\n\r\nIf I do a wireshark capture of the network traffic, I can see the iPad is communicating mDNS over IPv6, but not IPv4.  I can also see iTunes only communicating over IPv4\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPad to network with no DHCP\r\n2. Connect Windows 7 computer running iTunes to network\r\n3. Launch Remote app on iPad\r\n4. iTunes will never detect the Remote app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect mDNS to communicate over IPv4 and IPv6 at all times in accordance with mDNS RFC (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#page-52)\r\n\r\nI would expect iTunes on the PC to detect the Remote app on the iPad\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmDNS on iPad only communicates over IPv6 in certain circumstances and this means the remote app isn't detected from iTunes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.6 (11B651)\r\niPad MC980LL/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a wireshark capture of the iPad (IPv6 address fe80::14b7:a36f:1f2d:532d) and Windows PC, (IPv4 address 169.254.121.125)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2\r\nWindows 7 service pack 1\r\niTunes 11.1.4.62\r\nAccess Point with DHCP disabled"
