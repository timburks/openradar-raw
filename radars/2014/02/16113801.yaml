    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://15515678\n\nSummary:\r\nWhen executing a single XCTest the Notification will state the \"Test Failed\" despite the Xcode editor shows it succeeded.  Without changing any code upon the next execution the Notification will come in as \"Test Succeeded.\" The failed notification is intermittent but repeatable upon the most basic of tests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a New File > Cocoa Touch > Objective-C test case class\r\n2. Create a simple test. I used XCTAssertEqual(A, B, @\"Equality\"); on two of the same singleton objects.\r\n3. Execute test to invoke notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected \"Test Succeeded\" upon every execution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWithin a set of four test executions a \"Test Failed\" notification is encountered at least once.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.0 (5A1413) on OS X 10.8.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf we have a test fail, then change it to pass, we can repeatably get this to happen across our entire development group.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
