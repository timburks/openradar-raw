    description: "Summary:\r\nA Set-Cookie sent with an NTLM type 2 response is ignored. The old version of the cookie is sent in subsequent requests instead. Set-Cookies with other (non-NTLM-type-2) 401 responses are not ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReproduction requires a server doing NTLM auth and re-issuing cookies with each request.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs per RFC 6265 s. 3 and in other browsers (Firefox and Chrome).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe HTTP cookie set with an NTML type 2 response is never sent in subsequent requests by the browser.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.0.1 (9537.73.11) on OS X 10.9.1"
