    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a (layer-backed) NSView using a compositingFilter to a (layer-backed) superview, the superview flickers.\r\n\r\nIf the window's contentView is layer-backed, the whole window becomes briefly invisible.\r\n\r\nThe problem becomes more and more visible the more views using compositingFilter are added.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a layer-backed view (for maximum effect, make the window's contentView layer-backed).\r\n2. Add a (layer-backed) subview that uses a compositingFilter. (for maximum effect, add several dozen)\r\n3. See the superview become invisible (if the window's contentView is layer-backed, the whole window becomes invisible).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSubviews utilizing compositingFilter are added like all other subviews are: Not affecting principal visibility of their superview (ecxept where overlapping it, of course).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSuperview becomes briefly invisible. If the window's contentView is layer-backed, whole window becomes invisible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks (older OS X versions not tested)\r\n\r\nYou can find a minimal demo project at https://bitbucket.org/atlasti/blendmodeproblemtest/"
