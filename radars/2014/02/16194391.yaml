    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting with Mac OS 10.9, CoreData creates sqlite stores using the new WAL journal mode. This journal mode requires that database files always reside on writable media (See: http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html#readonly).\r\nThe spotlight architecture however, puts its importers into a sandbox which prohibits write access to the files it imports. Therefore it is not possible to implement a reliable spotlight importer for CoreData sqlite stores created under 10.9."
