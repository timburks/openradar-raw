    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Web Inspector, if you change the value of a property, hit return, then hit Command-Delete, Safari hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari.\r\n1a. Make sure the Develop menu is enabled in preferences.\r\n2. Navigate to apple.com/safari (I've reproduced it elsewhere; just using it as an example).\r\n3. Scroll to the first word of main marketing copy on the page. As of this writing, the word is “Safari”.\r\n4. Context-click the word “Safari”\r\n5. Choose “Inspect Element” from the context menu.\r\n6. The Web Inspector opens.\r\n7. In the right sidebar, make sure the Rules tab is selected.\r\n8. There is a rule on the <p> tag in base.css line 150. It is the 4th item after “+ New Rule” in the sidebar for me, and it reads: “margin-bottom: 18px;”\r\n9. Click to position the text cursor between the 8 and the p: “margin-bottom: 18|px”.\r\n10. Press Delete to delete the 8.\r\n11. Type a “4” to make the value 14px.\r\n12. Press Return. I did this accidentally, thinking it would commit the value. Instead, it puts a new line, so the value now reads: “margin-bottom: 14\r\npx;”\r\n13. Realizing your mistake, panic and press Command-Delete instead of just Delete. I think I was probably falling back to Xcode muscle memory, where if I accidentally press Return in the wrong place, auto-indentation will indent the part of the line after the cursor, and I will have to delete back to the beginning of the line.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProbably a no-op, because we are at the beginning of a line and Command-Delete usually does not delete across line breaks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Web Inspector pinwheels or hangs with a CPU core pegged at 100%, and I have to force quit that Safari Web Content process.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B3116)\r\nSafari 7.0.1 (9537.73.11)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is not reproducible if you just press Return. You have to modify the value first. And you can’t just delete the 8, either. You also have to type the 4 (or some new value).\r\n\r\nNot reproducible in WebKit Nightly r164564, but I’m filing the bug anyway in case that’s just a side effect.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
