    description: "Currently FaceTime allows the user to select the audio INPUT (from, strangely, the Video menu). It would be nice if the audio OUTPUT was selectable as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the system default audio output is always used, but that is not convenient in some cases. For example, I connect my default audio output to music speakers, but I take my FaceTime calls over a USB headset and would like to use it for audio output in only FaceTime, not system-wide."
