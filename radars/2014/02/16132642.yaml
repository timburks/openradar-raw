    description: "Imagine a game where you buy a new car via In App Purchase. The message would be\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to buy one Lamborghini?\" \r\n\r\ndoesn't make any sense in that context. It should be\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to a Lamborghini?\" or \"Do you want to the Lamborghini?\" \r\n\r\nMaybe there should then be an option in iTunes Connect specifying you can't sell more than 1."
