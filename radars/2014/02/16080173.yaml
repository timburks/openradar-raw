    description: "Summary:\r\ntl:dr; the animatable key path for SNCMorpher weights is \"weights[index]\" (plural), not \"weight[index]\" (singular)\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn the header for SCNMorpher, you can read that wieght has an animatable key which is \"weight[index]\". Quote below:\r\n\r\n/*!\r\n @method setWeight:forTargetAtIndex:\r\n @abstract Sets the weight for the target at the specified index. Animatable implicitly or explicitly with the keyPath \"weight[index]\".\r\n */\r\n- (void)setWeight:(CGFloat)weight forTargetAtIndex:(NSUInteger)targetIndex;\r\n\r\nHowever, when you try to animate such a key path (in this example \"weight[0]\" you get an alert saying that it's not animatable, console output below:\r\n\r\n[SCNKit ERROR] weight[0] is not an animatable path (from <SCNMorpher 0x6000000134b0>)\r\n\r\nThe real key path that works is \"weights[0]\". Note the extra \"s\" (weights instead of weight). The documentation should be updated with the correct key path.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a"
