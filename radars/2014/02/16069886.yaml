        Summary:
        We have a web page that appears to have a rendering problem on iPad running iOS 7.0.4. The margins of the body occasionally show blank white areas on both sides where the background should show. We could not reproduce this on desktop Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or IE. We also could not reproduce it on iPhone (iOS 7) or Android. An image of the odd rendering is attached.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch Safari on an iPad running iOS 7 (tested on iOS 7.0.4)
        2. Visit the following URL: https://edvocal-staging.appspot.com/about
        3. Scroll content up.

        Expected Results:
        The background image shows everywhere on the page.

        Actual Results:
        Occasionally, white bars appear on both sides of the scrolling content (as illustrated in the attached screen shot).

        Regression:
        The problem only appears to happen on iPads running iOS 7. The problem does not appear to occur with any other browser running on other devices, nor on an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.

        Notes:
        None at this time.
