        Summary:
        When animating the frame of a UITextView the content isn't revealed in an animated way but just shrinks in one go.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the sample project:
        https://www.dropbox.com/s/umw8y7sufra17q1/TextViewTest%20Animation.zip

        Tap the table view cell once to expand.
        Tap the table view cell once again to collapse.

        Expected Results:
        The collapse animation should be symmetric to the expand animation

        Actual Results:
        The collapse happens non-animated in one go.

        See the screen video. iOS 7.0 is first and you can see that the animation is OK in both directions. iOS 7.1 beta 5 is second with the collapse being non-animated.

        Regression:
        On iOS 7.0.x the collapse is animated correctly.
