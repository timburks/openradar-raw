    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAlthough Profile Manager and Configurator output several payload types related to certificates (com.apple.security.pkcs1, .pkcs12, .root), these types are not documented in the Configuration Profile Reference.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt would be good to also know how to package certificates for deployment via configuration profiles. For example, can I include the whole certificate chain in a single PKCS12 payload or do I have to have separate payloads for each certificate. Do I have to include the entire chain when deploying an S/MIME identity or can I just include the intermediate CA? Though trial and error, I've found that I have to include the root as well as the intermediate CAs, but maybe that's a bug.\r\n\r\nThere are certain keys that I only found through trial and error that would have been good to have known. \"PayloadCertificateFileName\" for example is necessary if you want the user to see something more descriptive than:\r\n\r\nEnter the password for the certificate \"(null)\"\r\n\r\nwhen entering the password for a PKCS12 payload."
