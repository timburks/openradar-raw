    description: "I use the ALAsset class to retrieve high resolution images from the image library on the iPhone. I create a new CIImage instance from that ALAsset instance. If the ALAsset is an image from an album on the iPhone the image contains orientation information as provided in the API documentation. If the images is selected from the \"My Photo Stream\" library there is no orientation information available - the value of the property ALAssetPropertyOrientation is always 0. All images I made tests with were taken with an iPhone and have orientation information if I select them from the Camera Roll or from another album (except \"My Photo Stream\").\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis small code snippet is from my code:\r\nThe variable asset is an asset the user has selected from the iPhone's foot library\r\nCIImage* originalImage = [[CIImage alloc] initWithCGImage:[[asset representationForUTI:(NSString*)kUTTypeJPEG] fullResolutionImage]];\r\nNSLog(@\"Orientation value %d\", [[asset valueForProperty:@\"ALAssetPropertyOrientation\"] intValue]);\r\n\r\nIf an image is selected from the album \"My Photo Stream) the orientation value is 0 for all images. If the user selects an image from another album, the value matches the image orientation."
