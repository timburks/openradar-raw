    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://16161674\r\nNote: The described warning would also be useful for some auto layout warnings that can't be muted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nibtool (and the Xcode 'Build settings' area that controls its use) have no way to suppress certain warnings/errors, like the llvm compiler has them.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we have an application that's been shipping boxed, with hardware. The boxes still claim support for 10.7 (and will until they're all sold off). In 10.8, Apple added better Arabic support and we started selling to Arabic countries. So we have XIB files that set the 'Allows Logical Layout Direction' flag. We get warned about that, because our XIBs are still saved for 10.7 compatibility. That's fine, since the boxes we printed in Arabic are new and say 'requires 10.8'. However, now we get five gadzillion warnings whenever the XIBs are built. Since we know it is OK in this case, we want to turn off just this one warning (and only for that one property).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a XIB.\r\n2. In the File Inspector, choose \"Builds for: OS X 10.7 and Later\" under \"Interface Builder Document\".\r\n3. Go to the Attributes Inspector for e.g. an NSPopUpButton \r\n4. Set the \"Mirror\" setting in to 'In Right to Left Interface' (the error message is very misleading in this case because the name it reports is different than what the UI shows).\r\n5. Build the project and you get a warning message like\r\n\r\n/path/to/foo.xib:11672: Allows Logical Layout Direction on Mac OS X versions prior to 10.8\r\n\r\n6. Go to the build settings for your target and search for 'xib'.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n7. There should be a bunch of checkboxes to turn on/off individual warnings, or ibtool's man page should document some compiler flags that I can specify under \"Other Interface Builder Compiler Flags\" to turn off this particular warnings (without hiding any other warning messages for other properties in the same XIBs that may not be available on 10.7.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7. There is only a general \"Show Warnings: Yes/No\" toggle, which would hide all warnings and make it too easy to break 10.7 support."
