    description: "There is a huge robotic, MakerBot, Arduino (and similar microcontroller boards) and home automation community that uses Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Profile) to communicate with their devices wirelessly. SPP is supported natively by Android devices but not by iOS devices. SPP is supported by Macintosh OSX.\r\n\r\nSerial Port Profile is described here:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/SPP.aspx\r\n\r\niOS support for Bluetooth profiles:\r\n\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3647?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\r\n\r\nThese people are using a very cheap Bluetooth module, usually a HC-05, which uses Bluetooth SPP. There are dozens of YouTube tutorials on how to do this (search YouTube for \"HC-05\"). Some examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vQK4vmZpy8\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI6Oda6fsSY\r\n\r\nAn Internet search on \"Bluetooth HC-05\" will result in a large number of hits. Here's one:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/like/310540196588?lpid=82\r\n\r\nThese Bluetooth modules only need 4 wires to connect to a microcontroller (power, ground, transmit and receive), so they are very easy to use. That is why they are so popular."
