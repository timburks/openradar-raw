    description: "Summary:\r\nCommands like `UIAElement.dragInsideWithOptions` have no effect when applied to a scroll view if the target is the iOS 7 Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from within the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scroll view (behind the visible UI elements) should be dragged as if the user were trying to scroll down.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1 (5B130a), instruments, version 5.1 (55044)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Instruments GUI can record the drag interaction, but UIAutomation cannot play it back, whether running in the GUI or from the command line. Some debugging reveals that the scroll view and indeed the scroll view's pan gesture recognizer does receive the synthetic touches created by UIAutomation, but the pan gesture recognizer never fires its action method.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects any attempt to drag a scroll view, including table views, swiping to delete table view cells (since as of iOS 7 they use an internal scroll view to implement this behavior), etc.\r\n\r\nThis was reproducible as of Xcode 5.1 Beta 4. I cannot test on Xcode 5.1 Beta 5 due to rdar://15994281 (http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5064788107329536).\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on both OS X 10.8.5 and 10.9 for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment: http://cl.ly/0E370a3z3s0N"
