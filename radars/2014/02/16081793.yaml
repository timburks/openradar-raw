    description: "In building an app for the national railroad (NSB) in Norway we were asked to create an arrival alarm based upon expected arrival time. The local notification doesn't provide an adequate approximation of the native alarm app and since we feel customers would be disappointed by this feature, removed it from the app. \r\n\r\nI think that being able to create real, native-app alarms is important for a variety of applications. Could Apple allow apps to request an alarm be created in the native app via a URL scheme like alarm:// just like launching Safari or making a telephone call?"
