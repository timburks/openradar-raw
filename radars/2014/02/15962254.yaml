    description: "Summary:\r\nAn error message repeatedly displays in iTunes Connect when attempting to change the sort order of any leaderboard or achievement item for a Game Center app. Any attempts to change the order of leaderboards or achievements fails with an error message, and changes are subsequently forgotten or reverted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login to iTunes Connect on any desktop computer with Safari 7\r\n2. Click on \"Manage Your Apps\"\r\n3. Select a Game Center-enabled app, or create a new app and enable Game Center.

Attempt to change the order of any leaderboard or achievement by dragging the triple-grey-line on the left side of each listing.\r\n5.
