    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been looking into XMPP implementations and whether they verify the source of iq replies. See http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2014-January/089824.html and http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2014-January/089838.html for more discussion.\r\n\r\nMessages does not verify the source of iq replies. I have verified that, upon signing in, if a roster result comes in from a different address than the server, it is accepted and displayed as the contact list. This can lead to spoofing of rosters, vcards, etc.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, Messages does not verify the source of roster pushes. This allows anyone to add new contacts to someone else's contact list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo spoof a roster push:\r\n1. Start Messages\r\n2. Send the following from a different client:\r\n\r\n<iq type='set' to='user@example.com/ComputerName' id='1'>\r\n    <query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'>\r\n      <item jid='evil@evil.com'/>\r\n    </query>\r\n</iq>\r\n3. Observe the contact list in Messages.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo unauthorized modification of my contact list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnauthorized modification of my contact list.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9.1, Messages Version 8.0 (4218)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
