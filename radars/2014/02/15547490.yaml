    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIWebView control does not scale its contents properly after the virtual keyboard has been shown and the control's dimensions are changed. Specifically, the control incorrectly scales the contents to the dimensions it had when the keyboard was shown. \r\n\r\nRefreshing the page sometimes fixes the issue, but not always. In any case, refreshing the page is not an option for us.\r\n\r\nWe ran into this issue because our app has a web view and a side bar that slides in and out. When the side bar slides in or out, it makes the web view next to it narrower. The web view stopped scaling the contents properly after the user tapped into a text field in the web page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a view with a UIWebView pinned to all sides.\r\n2. Turn on the \"Scales Page to Fit\" option for UIWebView.\r\n3. Add code to view controller to load a URL into the web view.\r\n4. Run the app on iPad.\r\n5. Tap into a text field on web page\r\n6. Rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIWebView scales its contents to its new dimensions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIWebView does scale its contents to its new dimensions. Instead it uses the dimensions it has before the keyboard was shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOccurs on iOS 6 and 7"
