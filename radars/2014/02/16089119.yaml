    description: "Summary:\r\nKeyboard shortcuts can be customized in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts—but it's not possible to remove an existing keyboard shortcut. I think most people could name at least one shortcut they hit accidentally more than they would like. Currently the only solution to this is to assign it to something complicated that you're not likely to press accidentally—but it'd be much nicer if you could simply set it to \"none\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Click \"Keyboard\"\r\n3. Click \"Shortcuts\"\r\n4. Select \"App Shortcuts\"\r\n5. Click the + button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis screen should allow you to click \"Add\" without entering a shortcut. (Or at least by explicitly selecting a \"none\" option.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's only possible to add or change shortcuts—not remove them.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2 (13C59)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
