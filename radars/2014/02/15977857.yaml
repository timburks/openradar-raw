    description: "Summary:\r\niOS shows a graphical overlay with playback controls whenever an app plays a video. When the user doesn't touch controls on this overlay, it fades away after some time. Using it by actively touching the controls keeps it from fading. Included in this overlay are controls for skipping the video 15 seconds forward or backward in time. When pressing them, the aforementioned behavior doesn't apply: The playback controls fade although the user might still be using the \"skip 15 seconds\" buttons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a video in any app that supports video playback\r\n2. Touch the display to bring up the video playback controls\r\n3. Skip 15 seconds of the video by pressing either the skip forward or skip backward button\r\n4. Repeat step 3 until the video playback controls fade away underneath your fingers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs long as the user touches and therefore uses the video playback controls, they should not fade away and disappear. This should include usage of the \"skip video 15 seconds in time\" buttons.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video playback control fades although the user is actively using it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4"
