    description: "AVPlayer supports \"External Playback Mode\", which allows users to play videos on Apple TV or other supported AirPlay device, without developers having to do, well, anything. \r\nYou can get status of such playback doing KVO on AVPlayer properties like rate and loadedTimeRanges, but you don't get any UIEvent objects, that would allow you to respond to users input from Apple Remote or AirPlay device controls in \r\n- (void) remoteControlReceivedWithEvent: (UIEvent *) receivedEvent.\r\n\r\nThat makes it impossible to implement app that for whatever reason don't want to allow users to forward/skip backward in video (e.g. fitness app that tracks your progress or flashcard type learning help app)."
