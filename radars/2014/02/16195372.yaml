    description: "Summary:\r\nHT5884 says, \"When you connect from a Mac using OS X Mavericks to another computer using file sharing, your Mac automatically tries to use SMB to communicate. If SMB is not available, Mavericks tries to connect using Apple File Protocol (AFP).\"\r\n\r\n\"using file sharing\" should be elaborated on or changed to say something like, \"through the sidebar in Finder,\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, in all releases of 10.9 to date, including 10.9.2, only a connection through the sidebar of Finder attempts to use SMB first. If you go to Go > Connect to Server in Finder, it still tries AFP first. Because Mavericks by default enables both protocols when turning on File Sharing (this is well documented in HT5884 :)), if you use Go > Connect to Server, you'll end up being connected via AFP when the assumption most people have is that it should try SMB first.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A, unless you consider this a bug within Finder's Go > Connect to server menu.\r\n\r\nIf so, connect to a Mavericks computer running file sharing via the Finder's sidebar and observe the connection being made via SMB. Then, disconnect and use Finder's Go > Connect to Server menu. Observe the connection to the Mavericks computer occurs over AFP.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the documentation should describe the differences, or the Finder's default connection protocol should be consistent throughout the application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation does not detail the differences between a sidebar connection and a Go > Connect to Server connection, and/or the Finder uses a different default protocol in each of these cases.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\"OS X: How to connect with File Sharing using SMB\"\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5884\r\n\r\nAny/all 10.9.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
