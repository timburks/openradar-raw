    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a tough one to describe, so please feel free to reach back out if you need elaborations on any aspect of this bug. In Mt. Lion, when adding a Xerox WorkCentre printer, specifically the 5855 for the purpose of this bug, a \"Two-Sided\" checkbox would always be shown next to the number of copies when attempting to print. This allowed users to easily enable/disable duplex printing for a particular print job at the time of printing. In Mavericks, however, this Two-Sided checkbox is almost always missing. Randomly, it will appear, but I'd say that 99% of the time, it's absent. The only way to override the default duplexing is to expand the \"Xerox Features\" menu of the print dialog and change \"2-Sided Printing\" to \"1-Sided\". Setting the Duplex option from Duplex or DuplexNoTumble to None via lpadmin or lpoptions also has inconsistent results that do not reflect in the Xerox Features menu.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot from Mt. Lion and one from Mavericks. We consider this to be a regression. This occurs with versions 2.94.3 and 2.113.0 of the Xerox drivers for this model.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Acquire a Xerox WorkCentre 5855 MFD\r\n\r\n2.) Install Xerox driver version 2.94.3 from [url redacted] onto a machine running 10.8.5 and also onto a machine running 10.9.x (or download the latest from Xerox)\r\n\r\n3.) On both the Mt. Lion and Mavericks machines, either via lpadmin with something like `lpadmin -p XeroxTest -L \"Location A\" -D \"Xerox Test\" -E -v lpr://ip.addr.goes.here -P /Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/Xerox\\ WorkCentre\\ 5855.gz -o printer-is-shared=false` or via system preferences, add the printer.\r\n\r\n4.) Go to print to the printer from Safari using a webpage like nytimes.com and observe the Mt. Lion gives users an easy option to override the duplexing and that Mavericks does not. Screenshots attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMavericks would display a checkbox for \"Two-Sided Printing\" next to the Copies box to allow users to easily override the default duplexing mode set for a printer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMavericks does not display a checkbox for \"Two-Sided Printing\" next to the Copies box to allow users to easily override the default duplexing mode set for a printer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXerox WorkCentre 5855\r\nOS X 10.8.5 - Works\r\nOS X 10.9.x - Bad behavior\r\n\r\nThis is a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n Detailed throughout.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MtLionTwoSided.png' and 'MavericksTwoSided.png' were successfully uploaded."
