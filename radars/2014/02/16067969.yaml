    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen placing an outgoing call, a user typically hears the outgoing call dial tone to indicate that the phone is ringing. \r\n\r\nUnder iOS 7.1 beta 5 (11D5145e), this tone is not played and no audio is heard until a moment after the call is picked up. This consistently results in the first word or two of a call being cut off, which are typically the person's greeting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place an outgoing call \r\n2. Listen \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe outgoing call dial tone is heard until the call is picked up\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSilence is heard until a moment after the call is picked up\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 beta 5 (build 11D5145e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is known to occur on Telstra in Australia on an iPhone 5s running iOS 7.1 beta 5 (11D5145e)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe correct behaviour is seen in iOS 7.1 beta 4 and earlier, including iOS 7.0.x and earlier"
