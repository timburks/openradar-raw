    description: "Analogous to UITableView, I'd like to be separately informed when a cell is displayed on screen. This would be useful for lazy loading of content, for animations and various other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe data source method â€“collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath: doesn't really solve that purpose since it's (probably depending on the layout) called much earlier and for cells that might never be displayed in the visible area.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's -collectionView:didEndDisplayingCell:forItemAtIndexPath: but not the inverse callback. So also for symmetry reasons it would make sense to add this method."
