    description: "Xcode 5 unable to run inline unit tests for OSX when static library unit tests are shared between OSX and IOS unit test targets.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nI want to create a static library that is cross platform for OSX and IOS.\r\nTherefore the OSX and IOS static library projects are located in a joint workspace.\r\nThe particular issue to be brought to attention is with the shared unit tests.\r\nThe shared unit test file is being added to both projects and added to both unit test targets.\r\nRunning all unit tests on the respective plattform works fine.\r\nRunning an inline unit test for the OSX plattform shows the following error message:\r\n\t“The run destination My Mac 64–bit is not valid for tests you have chosen to perform.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nLook at the provided sample project MultiPlattformLib\r\nFor each of the two schemes running all unit tests using cmd-U works (tests fail as expected)\r\n\r\nselect the CrossLibIOS Scheme\r\nSelect Project Navigator > CrossLibIOS > CrossLibIOSTests > CrossLibSharedTests.m\r\nclick on the run inline test button for testExample.\r\nnotice that the inline test runs as expected\r\n\r\nselect the CrossLibOSX Scheme\r\nSelect Project Navigator > CrossLibOSX > CrossLibOSXTests > CrossLibSharedTests.m\r\nclick on the run inline test button for testExample.\r\nnotice that the inline test does not start to run but the following error message sheet drops down:\r\n\t“The run destination My Mac 64–bit is not valid for tests you have chosen to perform.”\r\nrun al unit tests for the scheme\r\nnotice that all tests run as expected\r\nagain click on the run inline test button for testExample.\r\nnotice that the inline test does not start with the same error message as above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nThe inline test should be executed based on the currently selected scheme.\r\nActual Results\r\nFor the OSX target you get the message\r\n“The run destination My Mac 64-bit is not valid for tests you have chosen to perform. Please select a run destination which supports the tests that you wish to perform”."
