    description: "Summary:\r\nStarted noticing trouble with IB/Storyboards tonight.  While ctrl-click-dragging from one VC to another to create a segue, the segue context menu would very briefly appear then dismiss.  I restarted Xcode and tried this in a different project to try to remedy.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of what had changed since I last had to create a segue, I remembered adding a Wacom tablet to the system.  See below for work-around.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure 'Ink' in system preferences (this only appears if 'off' if I have a tablet connected, but once 'on' it will stay - bug happens whether or not tablet is connected)\r\n2. Turn Handwriting recognition on\r\n3. Turn on 'Allow me to Ink in any application'\r\n4. Open Xcode\r\n5. Attempt to add a segue in Storyboard/IB\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContext menu stays visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContext menu immediately dismisses itself\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 5A3005\r\nMavericks 10.9.1 13B42\r\nWacom Bamboo MTE-450A (as stated previously, it seems this is Ink related, not the make/model of the tablet)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWork-around: either turn off Ink or disable  'Allow me to Ink in any application'\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf either Ink is turned off or Ink is turned on with 'Allow me to Ink in any application' turned off, behavior is correct.\r\n\r\nWhile getting the Ink System Preferences widget to appear is dependent on the presence of a tablet, the bug occurs whether or not tablet is actually connected to the system.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
