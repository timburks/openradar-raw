    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 7 is been introduced a sneaky bug in the Game Center Sandbox.\r\nWhen in the development cycle a user refuse three time to login with a sandboxed login in the Game Center the login flow is disabled for the rest of the App lifetime, but although in iOS 6 to re enable the login is only a matter to delete and re-installing the App, in iOS 7 the user has to go in Settings->General->Reset->Reset All Settings. And for the beta tester with a personal device it is not feasible.\r\nMaybe it can be added a new setting only in the developer menu to reset the state of the Game Center Sanbox or somewhere where only development device can reach it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an App with Game Center enabled.\r\n2. Install the debug App on a Device\r\n3. Open the App three times and every time cancel the login to the Game Center\r\n4. Delete the App and re-install it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Game Center flow is re-established and the user has three more chance to log in the Game Center Sandbox\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Game Center don't show the login view controller with the error that the user has cancelled the action. To re-enable it you have to Reset All Settings from the Settings App.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.x"
