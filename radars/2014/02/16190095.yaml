    description: "Summary:\r\nThe source code for various Xcode 5 components which are under the GPL and similar licenses is not available. These components include the following:\r\nGit\r\nBison\r\ncctools\r\nm4\r\nMake\r\nThere may be others, but I verified these specifically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to opensource.apple.com\r\n2. Check for an \"Xcode 5\" section with the source code to these packages.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe source code for these components is available, as it is for Xcode 4.6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no Xcode 5 section, therefore source code is not available.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is technically a GPL violation."
