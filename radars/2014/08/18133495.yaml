    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the popover that appears when you click the yellow warning sign on a misplaced view in Interface Builder, you can't click the label next to a control to activate that control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a xib or storyboard in Xcode.\r\n2. Set up some constraints such that you have a warning about misplaced views.\r\n3. Click the tiny yellow arrow that indicates that the view has layout warnings.\r\n4. Click the yellow warning sign next to a misplaced view.\r\n5. Try to use the radio buttons or checkbox in the resulting popover to operate the controls.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking the label activates the checkbox or radio button, like it does in, for example, System Preferences â†’ General.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking the labels has no effect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 (6A280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not new in Xcode 6.
