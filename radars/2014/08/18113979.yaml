    description: "I noticed that rdar://17390183 and rdar://17158689 were closed.\r\n\r\nHowever this problem is still happening for me on the latest OS X 10.10 beta (14A329f). The main app keeps launching and connecting to the wrong copy of the helper (login item). Please see the attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this will be the expected behaviour in OS X 10.10 because we will be in a lot of trouble. Just like many developers tend to collect Xcode betas, there are many 1Password users that that try to keep the old versions around, just in case.\r\n\r\nThis issue without a doubt caused us the most grief so far on Yosemite.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nQuit the app and stop its LoginItem. Start the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app launches the LoginItem embedded in the app bundle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app launches a different version of the LoginItem.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A329f)\r\n\r\nLinks to the screenshots:\r\n\r\nhttp://com.roustem.screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/Bad-launchd-Bad-9CvbmN.png\r\nhttp://com.roustem.screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/Launchd-Problem-tUi3lY.png"
