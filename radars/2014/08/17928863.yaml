    description: "For some apps in the Mac App Store, the main app icon is displayed with wrongly rendered transparency. Mostly, only the main icon (the biggest) seems to be affected - smaller icons look fine. The icon of a downloaded app also isn't affected.\r\n\r\nI noticed this glitch on my own app (Apple ID nnn) but since have seen it on other apps, too (for example \"Better Rename Tool\").\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't local to my Mac nor my Network and exists at least since 2014-08-01.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the Mac App Store and search for the App \"Better Rename 9\" or \"Shazam\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe black areas of the distorted icons normally are transparent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlack glitches occur where normally is transparency.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApp Store 1.3 (Build 207)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (Build 13E28)\r\n- Problem is OS X and App Store version independent -"
