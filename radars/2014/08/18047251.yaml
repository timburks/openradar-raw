        Summary:
        Calling systemLayoutSizeFittingSize on a UICollectionViewCell that has layout constraints that define a valid height returns 0 for the height. The same layout works work fine for regular UIViews and also works fine in iOS 7.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Load a cell from a nib with constraints set to define the size of the cell. Notice that any call to systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: returns CGSizeZero.

        Expected Results:
        systemLayoutSizeFittingSize: should return a proper size.

        Actual Results:
        systemLayoutSizeFittingSize returns a height of 0.
