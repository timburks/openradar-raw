    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a generic class in any way refers to its type from the implementation (e.g. by having a property of the same type or an array of elements of that type), the execution hangs on the creation of this type.\r\n\r\nI discovered the issue when my OSS library failed to run after updating to beta 6: https://github.com/Thomvis/BrightFutures/tree/8e280e4554d39bf1eec39b5649cad44e00fb43b5. There is a minimum failing example below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPaste the following in a playground:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class A<T> {\r\n  var callbacks: A<T>?\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet before = \"before\"\r\nA<Int>()\r\nlet after = \"after\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the playground to compile and execute completely.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does compile, but it seems to hang on the initialization of the A<T> type (`A<Int>()`). You can see this because the `after` constant is never initialized.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis used to work perfectly fine in beta 5"
