    description: "Summary:\r\nThe property ABPeoplePickerNavigationController.displayedProperties can be used to configure the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController to display only certain properties of Address Book contacts to the user, for selection. The selected property is then returned to the client app via a delegate method.\r\n\r\nThe documentation says that name properties are always displayed. They are also always returned to the client app.\r\n\r\nHowever, in fact, the contact's photo is also always displayed to the user. But the contact's photo is returned to the client app only when displayedProperties is not set at all.\r\n\r\nThe problem: there is no way use displayedProperties and also get access to the contact's photo. You cannot add the photo to the list of displayedProperties list (since it is not technically a property), and if you do put anything in displayedProperties then the photo is excluded.\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n (1) the contact's photo should always be displayed and always accessible to the app, like the name property; or \r\n\r\n(2) it should be possible to include the contacts photo in the displayedProperties, like other properties, and then should govern both if it is visible to the user and if it is accessible to the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the included modified version of the WWDC2014 sample app, on a device with a populated address book.\r\n2. select tab 3.\r\n3. note that whether or not contact image data was accessible depends on whether or not displayedProperties was set in AAPL_8or7_PersonPickerViewController\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nexpect to be able to access contact image data\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncannot access contact image data\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PeoplePickerPickingaPersonorProperty_modified.zip' was successfully uploaded."
