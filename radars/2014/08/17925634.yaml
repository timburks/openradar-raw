    description: "If a function, class, or other symbol is private, it currently cannot be redeclared in another file. Since private limits the scope of the symbol to the file, the symbol should be reusable in another file, just as variable names in functions can be reused in other functions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate two files in the same module\r\nCreate a function marked private in one file\r\nCreate a function with the same signature, also marked private, in another file.\r\nCompile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should compile, and each should use their private method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInvalid redeclaration of '...'"
