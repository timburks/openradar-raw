    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI'm starting with an app that has foo.png as a resource, and the app is installed (either in the simulator or on the device). If I delete foo.png, do a clean build, etc., and install, then it still shows up in the bundle on the simulator or device. I know the file isn't in the bundle before copying to the simulator or device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty project\r\n2. Add an image file (such as foo.png)\r\n3. Build & Run either on the Simulator or a device\r\n4. Stop the running target\r\n5. Delete your image from the project (you can move it to trash, too)\r\n6. Clean all targets\r\n7. Build & Run again on the same destination as before\r\n8. Check out YourApplication.app's contents\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe image you added before should be removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nActially, it is still there.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt happens on all Xcode versions, all iOS SDK versions, all OS X versions and all iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf I update my application through iTunes using an ad hoc build I will see that my .app bundle will be replaced completely and old resources, such as the foo.png file described in the summary, will be removed.\r\n\r\n--- 10-Jun-2013 09:10 PM / ADR\r\n\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate. 12311258"
