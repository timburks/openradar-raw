    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app both provides a document picker extension and presents an import menu, then its own document picker appears on the list of pickers from which you can import. While it could make sense to have an option to open your own files through the document picker, it doesn't make sense to be importing a file from your own app.  The screenshot (attached) shows the nbox example app offering the option to import into itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app than both provides a document picker extension and presents an document menu for importing.\r\n2. App's own document picker appears on the list of available providers for import.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect an app's own document picker to not appear in the list of document providers for importing, since it makes little sense to provide a file to yourself for import.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, apps that both provide a document picker extension and presents an document menu for importing show the option to import from themselves.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'nbox.png' was successfully uploaded."
