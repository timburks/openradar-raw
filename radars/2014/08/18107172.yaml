    description: "Summary:\r\nI am building a share extension that uses an NSURLSession with a background configuration to create an NSURLSessionUploadTask. The extension writes a file into the app group's shared container, which the session task is supposed to upload. \r\n\r\nThis works in the simulator but the NSURLSessionUploadTask fails to read the file from the app group's shared container when the extension is run on a device (iPhone 5S).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Write a file to disk (in the app group's shared container), intended to serve as an HTTP request body\r\n* Create an NSURLSession with a background configuration\r\n* Create an NSURLSessionUploadTask with the file path of the aforementioned request body file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSURLSessionUploadTask should be able to read the file out of the app group's shared container and POST it to the server\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSURLSessionUploadTask fails to read the file when the extension is being run on a device. It works when being run in a simulator. Here are the device logs (also included in the attached .zip file):\r\n\r\nAug 22 17:37:34 BryPhone-5 ShareExtension[1484] <Error>: Failed to issue sandbox extension for file file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/DAC0CE53-E97B-40D8-B636-18F85460DC2B/requestBody.txt, errno = 1\r\nAug 22 17:37:34 BryPhone-5 nsurlsessiond[101] <Error>: Error linking upload file: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=257 \"The operation couldn’t be completed.
