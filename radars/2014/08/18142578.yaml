    description: "As the documentation says, an Identity is a combination of a certificate and a secret key, and the documentation for searching says \"kSecClassIdentity item attributes: Since an identity is the combination of a private key and a certificate, this class shares attributes of both kSecClassKey and kSecClassCertificate\".\r\n\r\nHowever, the kSecAttrSubjectKeyID search key, which works when searching for certificate refs, is ignored when searching for identities.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a query dictionary containing a subject key identifier under kSecAttrSubjectKeyID, and other attributes to perform an identity search (kSecClass=kSecClassCertificate, kSecAttrCanDecrypt=kCFBooleanTrue, kSecReturnRef=kCFBooleanTrue)\r\n2. Call SecItemCopyMatching()\r\n3. Observe that the returned identity (or identities, if kSecMatchLimit=kSecMatchLimitAll) does not match the provided subject key identifier.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you're using kSecMatchLimitAll, you just get all of the identities in your keychains.\r\n\r\nA simple test program is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search keys for identities should be the combination of those for certificates and keys.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search keys are some undocumented subset.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.4/13E28\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'skidIgnored.c' was successfully uploaded."
