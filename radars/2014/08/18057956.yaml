    description: "Summary:\r\nA sample project that demonstrates this behavior is attached. In this project, there's a simple table view with 3 sections. The middle section, Section 1, is intentionally left empty (contains 0 rows). Selecting any of the rows will reload the row selected with reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:\r\n\r\nThe data store returns pre-determined data thus reloading a row shouldn't cause much to happen. Tapping on any of the rows beside \"Section 2 Row 0\" shows the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTap the first row in section 2 with the label: \"Section 2 Row 0\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRow is deselected and no other animation occurs just like tapping on any other row in that table.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA weird animation happens with that row. The text appears to be positioned higher than it should be, then it animates into the correct position soon after. This behavior is different than tapping on any other row in the same table.\r\n\r\nAttachment:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30096/EmptySection.zip"
