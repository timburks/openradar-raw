    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile adding code to an Objective-C source file, one may use a class or function that is provided by the platform, a library, or another file in the project but which has not been declared in the current source file. To remedy this, the developer must scroll up to the top of the file, add a #include or @import line, then go back to wherever they were.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if Xcode would automatically suggest adding the necessary include/import directive when the developer types the name of a type or function that Xcode knows about but which is not already declared, and then automatically add it if the developer chooses to do so without moving the insertion point position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 and Xcode 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis feature is provided by IDEs for platforms (Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.) and by AppCode for iOS/OS X development. It seems like it is \"missing\" from Xcode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
