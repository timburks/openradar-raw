        Summary:
        When adding a new Framework project to an iOS application project, all the necessary settings are added to the app’s project except for the “Embed Frameworks” step. This prevents the app from running on device if it references code in the Framework

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create an iOS project, add a Framework project to it.

        Expected Results:
        All the necessary settings changes are made to the iOS project - including adding the “Embed Frameworks” step

        Actual Results:
        The “Embed Frameworks” step is missing and the application will fail to run on device if it references any code in the Framework
