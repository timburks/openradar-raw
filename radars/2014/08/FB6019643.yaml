    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing UIAppearance proxy with UIBarButtonItem subclasses is causing an unrecognized selector being sent to UINavigationButton.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple app with UINavigationController with one child view controller\r\n2. Create a new subclass of UIBarButtonItem\r\n3. Create a new property tagged with UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR\r\n4. Set this property using appearance proxy in e.g. App Delegate\r\n5. In your view controller set self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = <your button>;\r\n6. Run the application\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can open my attached demo project and run it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe property is being set correctly by UIAppearance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn \"unrecognized selector sent to instance\" exception (NSInvalidArgumentException) is raised, sending a property setter message to UINavigationButton\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis behavior may be caused because of UIBarButtonItem inheritance. UIBarButtonItem inherits from NSObject, not UIView and it uses a custom appearance class (_UIBarButtonAppearance). Its forwardInvocation: method may be forwarding the property setter to UINavigationButton, not the UIBarButtonItem itself.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis behavior is present only if you initialize your UIBarButtonItem subclass with all methods except initWithCustomView:, because initWithCustomView: does not create a UINavigationButton.\r\n\r\n--- 13-Aug-2013 02:16 PM\r\n\r\n'UIBarButtonItem Subclass Demo.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n--- 13-Aug-2013 02:16 PM\r\n\r\nThis feedback was created from radar ID 14722948"
