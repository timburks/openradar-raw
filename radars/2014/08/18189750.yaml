    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is impossible to using Core Foundation collections directly in Swift, because `CFDictionaryGetValue`, `CFArrayGetValueAtIndex`, etc return `UnsafePointer` (and you can't downcast that to anything useful). So, we're stuck casting the collection to its bridged Foundation counterpart.\r\n\r\nWhich leads us to the problem: kSecSharedPassword is declared as `Unmanaged<AnyObject>!` in the Swift header. Since `kSecSharedPassword` is meant to be used as a key to a dictionary, it should be declared as NSCopying.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to get a password with `SecRequestSharedWebCredential()` in Swift. You'll end up with code that looks a bit like this:\r\n\r\nSecRequestSharedWebCredential(nil, nil) { (cfCredentialsArray: CFArray!, error: CFError!) -> Void in\r\n    let credentialsArray = cfCredentialsArray as NSArray\r\n    if let credentials = credentialsArray.objectAtIndex(0) as? NSDictionary {\r\n        let username = credentials[kSecAttrAccount] as? String\r\n        let password = credentials[kSecSharedPassword] as? String\r\n        let service = credentials[kSecAttrService] as? String\r\n        NSLog(\"username: %@, password: %@, service: %@\", username, password, service)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should compile.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n>> let password = credentials[kSecSharedPassword] as? String\r\n\r\nType 'Unmanaged<AnyObject>!' does not conform to protocol 'NSCopying'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A280e), iOS 8 SDK, beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
