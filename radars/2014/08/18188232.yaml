    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iOS 8 GM seed, it appears that URLStringProbe on-demand VPN rules are matched regardless of the HTTP status code returned. (200, 302, 404, etc. all match when only 200 should.)\r\n\r\nThis bug is not present in production iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a configuration profile with a VPN payload that has OnDemandEnabled set to 1, and a URLStringProbe rule to a nonsense URL, and with the Connect action, in the OnDemandRules dictionary (see example file)\r\n2. Install the profile\r\n3. Try to access a website in mobile safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected: The VPN does not turn on because the URLStringProbe does not match (it points to a server that always returns non-200)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual: The URLStringProbe incorrectly matches, and the VPN always turns on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 GM seed (12A365)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression in the iOS 8 beta builds. This bug is not reproducible in iOS 7. It will no doubt impact many enterprise customers.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch MD723LL/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'example-vpn-config.plist' was successfully uploaded."
