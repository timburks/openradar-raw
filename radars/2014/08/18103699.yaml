    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 7, subclasses of UITextField receive the -deleteBackward message when the backspace key is pressed, even when the text field is empty. On iOS 8, subclasses of UITextField never receive -deleteBackward. This makes it impossible to detect backspace on an empty text field, which is necessary for implementing e.g. token field controls.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSubclass UITextField and override deleteBackward with:\r\n- (void)deleteBackward\r\n{\r\n    NSLog(@\"deleteBackward\");\r\n    [super deleteBackward];\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see \"deleteBackward\" every time backspace is pressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis works fine on iOS 7. On iOS 8, the method is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached sample project.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestDeleteBackward.zip' was successfully uploaded."
