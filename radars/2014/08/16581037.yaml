    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing \"Convert to XCTest\" in Xcode from a workspace doesn't update the project to work with XCTest.\r\n\r\nI previously though this was expected behaviour and I figured out these steps to manually convert a project which is listed at http://kylefuller.co.uk/posts/migrating-from-ocunit-to-xctest/\r\n\r\nLater on I have discovered that it does work if I convert from within a project directly, but if I try converting a project which sits in a workspace. It doesn't perform the changes to the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with older Xcode using SenTestingKit (iOS empty project)\r\n2. Close the project\r\n3. Create and open a new workspace\r\n4. Place project from step 2 in the workspace\r\n5. Perform the conversion to XCTest (Edit > Refactor > Convert to XCTest)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy project should work with XCTest and there should be no traces of SenTestingKit in the project\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy project does not build, the .m and .h files have been updated. The project has not been updated, and still references SenTestingKit"
