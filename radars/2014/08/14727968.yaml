    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7, when a UIPageViewController is added as a child view controller of a container view controller, which is in turn placed inside a UINavigationController, it doesn't correctly set the initial frame of its current view controller's subview.\r\n\r\nThe UIPageViewController's view appears shifted vertically off screen by the height of the navigation bar. Interacting with the view causes it to animate into the correct position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create a UIViewController subclass FooController\r\n- Add a UIPageViewController as a child view controller of an instance of FooController:\r\n\r\n- (void)viewDidLoad\r\n{\r\n    [super viewDidLoad];\r\n\t\r\n\t// page view controller containment\r\n\t[self addChildViewController:_pageViewController];\r\n\r\n\tUIView *pageView = [_pageViewController view];\r\n\t[pageView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blueColor]];\r\n\t[pageView setFrame:[[self view] frame]];\r\n\t[pageView setAutoresizingMask:UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight];\r\n\r\n\t[[self view] addSubview:pageView];\r\n\t\r\n\t[_pageViewController didMoveToParentViewController:self];\r\n}\r\n\r\n- Create a UINavigationController with the instance of FooController as the root view controller and set it as the root view controller of the application's window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view is not translated vertically offscreen. This is what occurs in iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view is translated vertically offscreen. Tapping the view causes it to animate into the correct position. This only occurs in iOS 7.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee sample code. I'm fairly certain this didn't occur in beta 4."
