    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 8 when trying to animate things along the keyboard animation (using the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification) the animation seems to be canceled (or not working) when using UIView or UILayer properties (e.g. UIView.layer.position)\r\n\r\nI have provided sample code which works on iOS 7. \r\n\r\nWhen using UILayoutContstraints for the animation it also works on iOS 8 (I have included an example in my sample code)\r\n\r\nAlso see the screen casts to get a better understanding.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the sample code and the demo screen casts\r\n\r\nBasically a view is animated with the keyboard triggering the animation when the keyboard notifications arrive. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animation should work like they do in iOS 7 (while keeping the animation curve of  iOS 8 for the keyboard animation)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view is not animated correctly. It is moved to a wrong position. Also see demo screencasts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5 (Simulator, iPod Touch)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator, iPod Touch \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BrokenKeyboardAnimation.zip', 'demo-iOS7.gif', 'demo-iOS8.gif' and 'demo-iOS8-using-constraints.gif' were successfully uploaded."
