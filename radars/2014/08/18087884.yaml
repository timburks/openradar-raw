    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm presenting a UINavigationController modally, from within an iOS app extension.\r\n\r\nWhen the navigation controller appears, its root view controller's UIBarButtonItems jump position (see included animated gif).\r\n\r\nI'm creating and adding the buttons in viewDidLoad. They are just standard bar button items.\r\n\r\nI'm not overriding viewDidAppear (which appears to be the point where the buttons jump).\r\n\r\nPresenting this same navigation controller/root view controller from within my app, instead of the app extension, doesn't give me this same problem. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Create app extension with default ShareViewController\r\n2. Present a UINavigationController modally from the ShareViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBar appears as normal\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBar items change position after transition animation is complete\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 32GB"
