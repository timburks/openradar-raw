    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen expanding the candidate bar for the japanese language while using a bluetooth keyboard on iPad, the expanded candidate view appears in an unexpected location instead of expanding from the original location. This issue does not happen in iOS 7 under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - With an iPad running iOS 8, attach a Bluetooth keyboard;\r\n2 - Add Japanese as one of the keyboard languages;\r\n3 - Compile the project using iOS 7 SDK and run;\r\n4 - When the app runs, just start typing on the keyboard with the japanese language selected until the candidate bar appears.\r\n5 - Expand the candidate bar \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe candidate bar should expand by animating up from the original position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe candidate bar appears expanded in an unexpected location, in this case, in the upper right part of the main view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 16gb Model MD531BR/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CandidateBarTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
