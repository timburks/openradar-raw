    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode, it is possible to use tools like bison or ragel to generate efficient code from a specification. The tool creates (Obj-)C code which is then compiled along with the rest of the project. However, unlike other C code, there is no way to specify per-file C compiler flags for this derived file.\r\n\r\nFor example, this makes incremental ARC conversion of a project that uses any parser generators or other higher-order programming tools especially difficult.\r\n\r\nI know this bug has been reported by many people already over the years, so this report is just here so you can mark it as a duplicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations  30-Apr-2014 04:04 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed."
