    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Done\" button in the top-right corner of the document provider extension interface performs a cancel action and does not allow the extension to actually \"do\" the thing that is being \"done\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHere is an example in \"export\" mode; similar confusion arises in the other three modes.\r\n\r\n1. User would like to export a file from Foo App into the Bar Document Provider.\r\n2. In Foo App, user launches the Bar Document Provider extension.\r\n3. The document provider extension shows a list of folders where the document can be saved.\r\n4. The user navigates to the appropriate folder.\r\n5. The user wishes to save the document into this folder and taps \"Done\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document is saved into the folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Done\" does not provide any callbacks to the extension and dismisses the view as a \"cancel\" button should. The extension does not get any chance to save the file or perform any action.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS 8 beta <= 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone device and simulator"
