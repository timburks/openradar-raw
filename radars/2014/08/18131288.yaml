        Summary:

        Running an executable for debugging results in the message:

            2014-08-26 09:56:22.887 Test Harness[52342:10057425] Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting

        Removing the derived data folder fixes this problem.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        I have not found a repeatable method for causing this problem, but it happens periodically.

        Simple run an application from within Xcode.


        Expected Results:

        The application should launch normally.


        Actual Results:

        The application fails to launch, and the console contains the message:

             2014-08-26 09:56:22.887 Test Harness[52342:10057425] Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting


        Regression:

        This is an XC6 problem.
