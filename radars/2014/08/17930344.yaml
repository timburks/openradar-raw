    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm having intermittent issues with MFMailComposeViewController in production. I can't reproduce it on my device, but I have multiple customers complaining that the mail sending doesn't work. They hear the little \"woosh\" like the mail has sent but then the recipient never receives the email. It's not in the user's outbox or sent mail and they can sent mail normally from Mail.app.\r\n\r\nAfter sending some beta users an updated version with debugging enabled, it appears that the MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate is returning no error and a result of MFMailComposeResultSent.\r\n\r\nI'm on an iPhone 5S (T-Mobile), but I've seen this happening on:\r\n\r\niPhone 4S (AT&T) iOS 7.1.1 & 7.1.2\r\niPhone Model A1429 (Verizon) iOS 7.2.1\r\n\r\nI also tried moving the mail sending into its own class that I call from my view controller. See attached code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCheck if the user can send mail\r\nif ([MFMailComposeViewController canSendMail])\r\n\r\nCreate the MFMailComposeViewController, set its subject and message. Doesn't matter if you make it html or text.\r\n\r\nPresent the view controller to the user.\r\n\r\nHit the send button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou would hear a \"woosh\" sound and the message will go to the intended recipient. The mail should also be in the sent email box in Mail.app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"woosh\" is heard (indicating the email was sent)\r\nThe email is never received by the recipient\r\nThe mail is not in the Mail.app sent mailbox\r\n\r\nThe delegate method is called:\r\n- (void)mailComposeController:(MFMailComposeViewController*)controller didFinishWithResult:(MFMailComposeResult)result error:(NSError*)error {\r\n}\r\n\r\nerror is nil and result is MFMailComposeResultSent\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1 & 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee description above. This is happening on multiple devices running ios 7.1+"
