    description: "Summary:\r\nWith specific versions set in the Version editor's Comparison view, using \"Jump to Line in <file>...\" resets the versions selected in the panes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open/create a project w/ >= 2 committed revisions\r\n2. open a file in the Version editor's Comparison view (I was looking at a storyboard file)\r\n3. change the right pane to the (BASE, HEAD) revision\r\n4. change the left pane to that revision's predecessor\r\n5. click/focus in the right (i.e., \"(BASE, HEAD)\") pane\r\n6. press Command-L (assuming standard keyboard mappings) to open the [jiump to] \"Line Number\" overlay\r\n7. enter a valid number (500 for me in my 600+ line storyboard XML)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nright pane jumps to line 500 in the (BASE, HEAD) revision;\r\nleft pane jumps to the related lines in the prior revision\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nboth panes \"blink,\" flashing \"No editor\"\r\nwhen they stabilize, the right pane has become \"Local revision\" and the left \"(BASE, HEAD)\""
