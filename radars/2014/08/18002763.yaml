    description: "Sample code:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xxx9pkagnd3gbri/DBAppDelegate.m.txt?dl=0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe top view controller on the stack of a UINavigationController will not get invoked with the `willMoveToParentViewController:` or `didMoveToParentViewController:` methods when the navigation controller's `setViewControllers:animated:` method is called.\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs for `willMoveToParentViewController:`:\r\n\r\n\"If you are implementing your own container view controller, it must call the willMoveToParentViewController: method of the child view controller before calling the removeFromParentViewController method, passing in a parent value of nil.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to indicate that child view controllers will have their willMoveToParentViewController: method invoked when they are removed from their parent container view controller, but this strangely does not seem to be the case for UINavigationControllers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UINavigationController (`nav`) with a few view controllers in the stack, e.g. `@[ vc1, vc2, vc3 ]`.\r\n2. Call `[nav setViewControllers:@[ someOtherVc ] animated:YES]`.\r\n3. Note that the `willMoveToParentViewController:` and `didMoveToParentViewController:` are only called on `vc1` and `vc2`, but not the top view controller `vc3`.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll original view controllers to be called with the `*MoveToParentViewController:` methods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the non-top view controllers are called with the `willMoveToParentViewController:` and `didMoveToParentViewController:` methods.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso confirmed that this exists with the current beta of iOS 8 (Beta 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 and iPad Air"
