    description: "Summary:\r\nI am interested in detecting when a keyboard user is pressing delete in an empty text field. Overriding deleteBackward is a good way to detect this case.  Other methods don't do what I need. It looks like something changed in Beta 4, and suddenly the override is not being called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Subclass UITextField\r\n2) Override deleteBackward\r\n3) Open App\r\n4) Press Delete Button on Keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOverridden method should be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOverridden method isn't called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator, iPhone 5 ATT"
