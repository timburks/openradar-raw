    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you swipe upward on the ,/! key on the main alphabetic keyboard on an iPad, iOS correctly inserts an apostrophe. However, autocorrect misinterprets this apostrophe when followed by an s, leading to consistent (and nonsensical) misspellings, which is not the case if you switch to the 123 keyboard and tap the apostrophe key. This was true in at least later builds of iOS 7 as well. See examples below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Notes on an iPad and create a new note.\r\n\r\nOn a new line, try to type \"There's Bob\" using the swipe-up gestureâ€”i.e., type There, swipe up on the comma key, and continue typing s followed by a space.\r\n\r\nOr try it with \"She's\" or \"What's\" or \"Who's.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTyping \"There's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) should produce \"There's .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"She's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) should produce \"She's .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"What's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) should produce \"What's .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"Who's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) should produce \"Who's .\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTyping \"There's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) produces \"There'so .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"She's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) produces \"She'so .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"What's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) produces \"What'so .\"\r\n\r\nTyping \"Who's\" followed by a space (using the swipe-up shortcut for apostrophe) produces \"Who'so .\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have occasionally seen this with other contractions (not ending in 's), but I can't reliably reproduce the problem with other combinations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini with Retina Display"
