    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 5 Beta 5 crashes when jumping to definition from a Swift file, when \"OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS\" build setting include \"-D <#flag#>\". A sample crash file is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6 Beta 5 (6A279r)\r\n2. Create a new Swift project (let's use any template under iOS Applicaton category)\r\n3. Open the primary target's build settings\r\n4. Set the following setting for Debug configuration: OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -D DEBUG\r\n5. Open the generated AppDelegate.swift file and command-click on any external symbol (e.g. UIResponder)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode jumps to the \"swiftified\" version of the symbol definition (e.g. UIResponder).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes with a failed assertion.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 Beta 5 (6A279r)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\nMacPro5,1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing \"OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -D\" (without the flag name after \"-D\") results in \"Symbol not found\" HUD error after a command-click.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n1. Issue occurs only when \"-D <#flag#>\" is the value of OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS setting.\r\n2. A similar issue occurs when using \"-D\" without the flag name (more information in Additional Notes).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Xcode_2014-08-05-190345.crash' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n--- 28-Aug-2014 07:46 PM\r\n\r\nIssue has been fixed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 (6A280e).\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
