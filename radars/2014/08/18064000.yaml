        Summary:
        When selecting a mail thread in Mail, all messages from the email thread are shown. However the emails that are not in the current post box are no longer visually separated.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open Mail
        - Select a email that has a thread that is filed in a mailbox
        - other emails in the thread are shown

        Expected Results:
        - other emails are visually distinct (e.g. faded like in Mail 7.0)
        - other emails show the name of the mailbox they are in

        Actual Results:
        - other emails look exactly like the selected mail
        - other emails do not show which mailbox they are located

        Regression:
        - this worked as expected on 10.9â€™s Mail 7

        Notes:
        - This is a serious usability regression for me.
