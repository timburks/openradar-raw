    description: "Summary:\r\nWith default setting time zone for Odessa/Ukraine is shown as Moscow Standard Time. That is wrong. In whole Ukraine is Eastern Europe Time.\r\n\r\nsudo systemsetup -gettimezone\r\nPassword:\r\nTime Zone: Europe/Simferopol\r\n\r\nAbove is the reason of the bug. Simferopol is in Crimea. Crimea is part of Ukraine occupied by Russia. Russia set Moscow time in Crimea. Odessa is closer to Simferopol than to Kiev. Probably that's the reason why time in Odessa is set to Simferopol time but not to Kiev time.\r\n\r\nProblem could be solved by setting timezone in command line:\r\n\r\nsudo systemsetup -settimezone Europe/Kiev\r\nPassword:\r\nSet TimeZone: Europe/Kiev\r\n\r\nBut system should set time right by default!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCome to Odessa and check time in system with default settings and compare with wristwatch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime in Odessa and in whole Ukraine should be set by Kiev, not by Simferopol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime is wrongly set to Simferopol time (Moscow time).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHave a look on image - it's obvious time is set wrongly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDefault configuration.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'odessa time zone.tiff' was successfully uploaded."
