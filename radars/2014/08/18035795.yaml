    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to generate an image using -[CALayer renderInContext:] never returns _if_ the layer has zero width, zero height, a corner radius, a border width _and_ the app is running on a retina device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached Xcode project in a retina simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-[CALayer renderInContext:] returns and has the same behaviour as non-retina devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-[CALayer renderInContext:] enters into an infinite loop inside CG::Cubic::is_near and never leaves the function. The app is eventually killed by the watchdog timer (0x8badf00d).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur app creates 3 of these empty layers in -loadView and skips them in -layoutSubviews because they have no content to display. If the user taps a bookmark, the app captures a snapshot of the current view hierarchy before navigating away.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina simulator (32-bit or 64-bit)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CoreGraphicsFreeze.zip' was successfully uploaded."
