        Summary:

        Xcode 5.1 complained about a setting needing an upgrade in the project. This is despite the projects having already been upgraded by various Xcode 6 betas.

        Allowing it to perform an upgrade (although with the single action that it was suggesting un-ticked) caused it to update all projects and schemes in the workspace so that their LastUpgradeVersion attribute was set to 0510.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open a project that needs upgrading in XC6
        2. Allow it to upgrade, but untick the suggested actions. The various projects/schemes should now have an LastUpgradeVersion of 0600
        3. Now open the project in XC5
        4. It will suggest the same upgrade (since we unticked the actions)
        5. The LastUpgradeVersion attribute has now been downgraded.

        Expected Results:

        Xcode should notice that a newer version has already performed an upgrade, and should not suggest it again.

        Actual Results:

        Xcode attempts to perform another upgrade, and if you allow it, it will lower the LastUpgradeVersion value.

        Regression:

        I think that this is an XC5 problem, as I have often worked with betas and release versions simultaneously, and I don’t remember this happening previously.

        Notes:

        Incidentally, the reason that I untick the suggested action is that it is incorrect. Xcode is trying to add a project setting which I have already explicitly specified in an xcconfig file. I have already reported this as a separate bug - I’ll try to add a note with the bug number.
