    description: "The 75% and 50% barely makes any sense on a Retina Display because they make the Simulator big as a letter stamp ;-)\r\n\r\nOn the other side, a 150% (for 13\" MacBook) and 200% (for 15\" MacBook) perfectly makes sense.\r\n\r\nShortcut would ideally be Cmd 4 and Cmd 5 since they aren't taken."
