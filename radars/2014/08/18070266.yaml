    description: "Summary:\r\nI've added a UIImageView to display a UIImage from a file found in the Assets Folder.  Under 8.0 beta 5 (via the simulator), the image displays fine.  \r\n\r\nWhen I run the app under 7.1, I get the following error on the console:\r\n\r\n  Unable to create unsliced image from csi bitmap data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create sample project with a single view controller using swift.\r\n2. Set the Deployment Target for 7.1.\r\n3. Add an image to the image asset library.\r\n4. Add a UIImageView to that view in the storyboard.\r\n5. In the class code somewhere, create a UIImage for the image added to the assets.\r\n6. Add that UIImage to the UIImageView.\r\n7. Run the app in Simulator for 8.0.\r\n8. After confirmation that it works, run for Simulator for 7.1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImage should be displayed correctly for both 7.1 and 8.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage is displayed correctly in the image view for 8.0.\r\n\r\nImage is not displayed correctly for 7.1.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 5, iOS 7.1 (both the simulator and on device).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSeems it was a problem in beta 3, but was potentially resolved according to this SO post:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24643904/xcode-6-beta-3-unsupported-pixel-format-in-csi-or-unable-to-create-unsliced-i\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWorks in 8.0.\r\n\r\nDoes not work in 7.1, in simulator or device.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
