    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIPresentationController(PC) is used to present a ViewController(VC) which does not take up the full window, and the VC presents a modal ViewController(ModalVC) â€“ when the ModalVC is dismissed, the VC is first displayed taking up the full window, then \"jumps\" to it's proper size as defined by the PC.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is reproducible in all iOS 8 betas up to and including beta 5 on both device and the simulator, both iPad and iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Launch included sample project.\r\n- Tap \"Red Controller\" button to present ViewController over partial window, using the included PresentationController class.\r\n- Tap \"Blue Controller\" button to modally present BlueViewController full screen over the RedController.\r\n- Tap \"Dismiss\" button in BlueController, and watch.  The window will briefly flash the RedController at the wrong size, then adjust to the size specified by the PresentationController class.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ViewController managed by the UIPresentationController should be set to it's proper size BEFORE being displayed during dismissal and not flash at the wrong size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window will briefly flash the ViewController managed by the UIPresentationController at the wrong size (full screen), then adjust to the size specified by the PresentationController class.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4345d) and others\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8, any beta include at least b5, iPad, iPhone or simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BUG_PresentationController.zip' was successfully uploaded."
