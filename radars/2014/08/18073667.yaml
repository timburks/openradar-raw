    description: "Summary:\r\nSwift documentation encourages to declare protocol conformance using extensions, but implementation of more sophisticated protocols sometimes requires a presence of stored properties.\r\n\r\nIn Objective-C, I would divide my implementation into chunks using the \"class extension\" concept, as long as they're in the same source file as the main implementation:\r\n\r\n    @interface Foo ()\r\n    @property NSString *baz;\r\n    @end\r\n\r\nIn Swift, however, this is not possible:\r\n\r\n    extension Foo {\r\n        var baz: String?\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAllowing this would be a very welcome addition, even with restrictions (i.e. this kind of extension would have to be declared within the same target).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFeature is not yet available as of Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 (6A280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n--- 23-Aug-2014 01:08 AM / ADR\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.\r\n\r\n11437733"
