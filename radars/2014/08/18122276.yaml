    description: Since iOS 7 UIWebView has provided several properties (gapBetweenPages, pageCount pageLength, paginationBreakingMode, paginationMode) for paginating content. As a developer of an app that displays paginated HTML content I would love to be able to move to WKWebView for the performance benefits (and improved JavaScript integration), but currently am not able to. It appears that the pagination properties may exist as private APIs â€” are there plans to make them public before the public release of iOS 8?
