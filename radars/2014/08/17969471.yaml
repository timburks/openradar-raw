    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom time to time, but not always (I have had this working for a bit), the app/extension gets in a state where I can't read a flag set in my App Group between my companion app and my app extension. Don't know how it gets in this state or why the values differ, but it's ***critical*** to my application these always be in sync.\r\n\r\n**Companion app viewDidLoad**:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NSUserDefaults *myAppSettings = [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:@\"group.myapp\"];\r\n\r\n    .....\r\n\r\n    [myAppSettings setBool:true forKey:@\"myBool\"];\r\n        \r\n    [myAppSettings synchronize];\r\n    \r\n    NSLog([myAppSettings boolForKey:@\"myBool\"] ? @\"Companion app - bool TRUE\" : @\"Companion app - bool FALSE\");\r\n\r\n\r\n**App extension viewDidLoad**\r\n\r\n    NSUserDefaults *myAppSettings = [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:@\"group.myapp\"];\r\n        \r\n    [myAppSettings synchronize];\r\n    \r\n    NSLog([myAppSettings boolForKey:@\"myBool\"] ? @\"App extension app - bool TRUE\" : @\"App extension - bool FALSE\");\r\n\r\n**Console output**\r\n\r\n    Companion app - bool TRUE\r\n    App extension - bool FALSE\r\n\r\nI also synchronize before my companion app will enter background. I have my app group set up in the portal etc.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nApparently others having this problem too:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/977151#977151\r\n\r\n> \"I think that this is currently very glitchy.\r\n \r\n> Sometimes the data sharing works, then a change and all of a sudden the widget can't see the shared data anymore (both on Simulator and device).\r\n \r\n> Annoying and hope it's a bit more reliable in next beta!\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse NSUserdefaults with group suite to set a bool, read the bool from an app extension\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBool value should always be set/read accurately, and it's sometimes inconsistent\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes inconsistent data, e.g. companion app shows it in one state, app extension shows it in another\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that this could be because the keyboard is losing it's RequestOpenAccess privileges, either because it crashed, or just over time."
