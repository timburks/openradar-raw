    description: "The attached project has a parent view controller that supports portrait orientation only. It presents a modal view controller that supports all orientations. When rotating the modal view to landscape, then dismissing it, the presenting view, which does not support landscape orientation, is forced into landscape anyway.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when built with the iOS 8 SDK and running on iOS 8. This does not happen when run on iOS 7, or on iOS 8 when built with a pre-8 SDK.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a regression from iOS 7, and possibly from earlier betas of iOS 8, but I don't have the capability of confirming that.\r\n\r\nThe primary and very common use case here is a portrait-only design with the exception of video playback, which permits landscape.\r\n\r\nPlease advise a workaround if this problem cannot or will not be fixed. The only ones I can think of are:\r\n\r\n1) Force portrait-only video playback (not at all desirable)\r\n2) Keep building with the iOS 7 SDK in the near-term (not at all desirable)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith Xcode 6:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached project. Note the root VC does not rotate\r\n2. Hit the \"Show Basic Rotatable View\" button from portrait orientation\r\n3. Rotate to landscape after the modal view shows\r\n4. Hit the \"Back\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInitial view remains in portrait, as on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInitial view does not remain in portrait.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6A280e / iOS 12A4345d"
