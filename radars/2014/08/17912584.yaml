    description: "Summary:\r\nThe organizer in Xcode 5 was pretty useful. Being able to just click the device logs or the console log and get the full pane was just fine.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 6, it's necessary to use a button on the device info to pull up a modal sheet in order to view device logs. It just doesn't feel right to have to do this, when so much of Xcode is delightfully modeless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most annoying part is that when I finally figured out how to reveal the console log, I only get to see about two inches of it. That makes it really difficult to effectively use the console. If we install a chatty version of our app, it's really hard to get a big enough window on the console log to see what's going on.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to figure out how to resize that pane, and there's huge empty real estate above it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run Xcode 6\r\n2. Hook up a device\r\n3. Open Window->Devices\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWell, if not the old Xcode 5 interface, something that's easier to use.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDifficult to use interface that gets in my way when I'm trying to diagnose problems in my app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 5\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Xcode 6 installation\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
