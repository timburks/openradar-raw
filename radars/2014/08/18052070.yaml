    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to reliably check revocation status of SSL certificates with the Security Framework.\r\n\r\non iOS all flags except kSecRevocationOCSPMethod, kSecRevocationCRLMethod, and ..AnyMethod are ignored\r\n\r\nThis might be a duplicate of rdar://12925208\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs I encountered it at first:\r\n1. Let an app connect to an https site with a valid certificate issued by verisign via NSURLConnection\r\n2. Let the leaf certificate be revoked\r\n\r\nI attached a demo project, including screenshots of the tests that failed for several days after revokation on a device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSecurity Framework on iOS should not verify the certificate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app now might not notice the revokation for several days. A specific trust evaluation with SecPolicyCreateRevocation and kSecRevocationRequirePositiveResponse fails to detect the revocation, when getting passed the certificate chain.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nthe behaviour is a little different when not passing the certificate chain, but only the leaf cert into the trust evaluation, as my tests have documented.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone5, iOS Simulator, Any Platform\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SecurityExperiments.zip' was successfully uploaded."
