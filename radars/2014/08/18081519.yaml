    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a custom tint color throughout our app. However, when we present the UIDocumentMenuViewController, we cannot change the color of the images added with our custom options (added by addOptionWithTitle:image:order:handler:). We tried compensating for this by manually changing the colors of the images themselves and setting them to render with UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal, but it seems UIDocumentMenuViewController ignores this setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a UIDocumentMenuViewController\r\n2) Add an option with a custom image via addOptionWithTitle:image:order:handler: (and optionally make the UIImage render with UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal)\r\n4) If UIImage is not UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal, manually set the tintColor of the UIDocumentMenuViewController’s view to something other than blue.\r\n3) Present UIDocumentMenuViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the tint color changes the color of the images in the UIDocumentMenuViewController, or the images preserve their original colors when set with a rendering mode of UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll images are rendered as templates regardless of renderingMode, and also are always rendered with the same blue tint.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are able to change the color of the Cancel button, but that’s about it. It just doesn’t fit in with the rest of our application without the same tint color.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 5s, Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
