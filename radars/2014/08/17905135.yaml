    description: "It should be possible to extract the tail() (everything but the head) of a Sequence. Many algorithms rely on splitting a list into its head and tail. Ideally this should be pattern-matchable, at least for certain subtypes (such as Array).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is mostly addressed by dropFirst(), but a pattern-matchable version would still be very helpful (something that splits head/tail)."
