    description: "Summary:\r\nI tried to update an app, and my phone dropped off Wi-Fi. I rebooted my phone, stopped the update, and the app disappeared and now I can't install it again. My description is as close to the order of events as I can remember, but may be inaccurate. I will try to reproduce it the next time I have an update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Join a Wi-Fi network.\r\n2. See that you have pending updates in the App Store. I believe it was Reeder 2, Pandora Radio, and Wikipanion Plus.\r\n3. Tap Update All.\r\n4. Sleep the phone (tap the Sleep/Wake button).\r\n5. During the update, drop off the Wi-Fi network, falling back to AT&T LTE.\r\n6. A minute or two later, look at phone, and notice that Reeder 2 has not finished updating. The icon is dimmed out, and the text below it says \"waiting\" (I think that is the word, but I don't have a screenshot).\r\n7. Tap the Reeder icon to try to resume the download, but nothing happens.\r\n8. Restart the phone (hold power button, slide to power off, power back on).\r\n9. Reeder is still stuck in \"Waiting\" state.\r\n10. Search for Reeder in the App Store. (Still on LTE.)\r\n11. Find Reeder. It has the little circular progress indicator that is normal when an app is updating, but it shows zero progress.\r\n12. Tap the progress indicator, which has a square indicating \"stop\" in the center.\r\n13. Progress indicator turns back into a button. I don't remember whether it said \"Update\" or \"Open\".\r\n14. Press the home button.\r\n15. Reeder is now gone from the phone. It does not show up on any home screen, nor when I do a Spotlight search.\r\n16. Search for Reeder in the App Store again.\r\n17. When I find it, its listing has a button that says \"Open\", instead of the usual price or a cloud icon for apps that are not installed on the phone.\r\n18. Tapping \"Open\" does nothing. If I look at the console, I see the following message:\r\n\r\nAug 25 22:05:46 Zevs-5s SpringBoard[16] <Warning>: Unknown application display identifier com.reederapp.rkit2.ios.\r\n\r\n19. Open Xcode 6.\r\n20. Open the Organizer.\r\n21. Click on the device in question. Reeder shows up, with no icon, under Installed Apps. This is odd, because this list usually shows only apps that I built onto the phone or installed over-the-air via a beta testing service such as Hockey App. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app update would either fail, or resume and succeed silently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhone is now stuck in a weird state where I can't install or uninstall Reeder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will try deleting Reeder from Xcode's organizer (see screenshot), but I wanted to leave it there in case you had anything you wanted me to look at. It appears that the app's document container is still intact, 392 MB of caches and other data, which I can provide on request. Could something have gotten stuck in there? Perhaps a race condition between background updates (it was my first time in a day or two joining a Wi-Fi network, and I was on for less than 5 minutes) and the app update mechanism?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, iOS 7.1.2, starting on a latest-model AirPort Express and switching to AT&T LTE.\r\n\r\nAttachments: Xcode Organizer screenshot: http://cl.ly/XE1J"
