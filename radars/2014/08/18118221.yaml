        Summary:
        Webviews from keynote documents created with Keynote '08 or '09 do not work anymore

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use any Keynote document that contains a web view and open it in Keynote 6.x

        Expected Results:
        Presentations should work as they were created.

        Actual Results:
        Web Views get removed making the presentation unusable.

        Regression:
        WebViews were working perfectly fine in Keynote '08 and Keynote '09.

        Notes:
        Keynote is often used to show Websites, especially live websites. Now Keynote has to be paused to switch to a browser to show a live website. This breaks the flow of any presentation.
        Especially annoying since this was working fine for years.
