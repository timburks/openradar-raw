        Summary:
        QuickTime Movies with Camera Tracks not working anymore

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open a Keynote document with an embedded QuickTime movie that contains a camera track to show live video. For example to show a certain small object via a camera, possibly on a microscope, or an iOS device in Yosemite.

        Expected Results:
        Camera tracks should be displayed live in a presentation.

        Actual Results:
        Upon opening a presentation with such a video the movie file gets converted to H.264 or ProRes trashing the video file and the camera track. The camera video is lost.
        This makes it impossible to seamlessly integrate live video sources into a presentation. (For example like Apple uses for demos in their keynote presentations to show off iOS devices and Apps.)

        Regression:
        This worked fine in Keynote '08 and '09 allowing seamless presentations with live video sources.

        Notes:
        It's especially annoying that this is not working anymore since it has been fine for many years in former versions of Keynote and also since Apple now adds camera video support in Yosemite/iOS 8 to show and record iOS screen video.
