    description: "Summary:\r\nUIApplication provides several notifications to notify apps of lifecycle changes, e.g. UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification, UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification. However, none of these notifications can be observed from an app extension (specifically, a Document Picker), and there do not seem to be any alternatives that work from within an app extension.\r\n\r\nOne use case is to acquire/release locks on entering/leaving foreground. Since an extension can run as multiple processes concurrently, it is important to synchronize data accesses between them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read through iOS 8 SDK and API documentation to find a notification or callback that occurs when the app extension's host app is put into foreground or background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Find some API that allows the app extension to observe lifecycle state changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Find no such API, return home very sad.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0  (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
