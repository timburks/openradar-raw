    description: "Summary:\r\nCovariant array assignment doesn't work as expected in Swift â€“ it should either be prevented at compile-time or work properly at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode6-Beta4, things like\r\n\r\n    let array : [MyProtocol] = [MyClass()] as [MyClass] // MyClass conforms to MyProtocol\r\n\r\nshould work without any error, since MyClass is a subtype of MyProtocol.\r\n\r\nYet doing such operation ends up with a runtime EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode6-Beta4\r\n2. Open the attached \"covariant-array-assignment.playground\" file\r\n3. Execute the playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo runtime error, console displaying \"1\" (the array's count)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRuntime EXC_BAD_ACCESS error, console displaying the backtrace (attached as \"error-backtrace.log\" for reference)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 Beta 4 (6A267n)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\nMacPro5,1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated Apple Developer Forums thread: https://devforums.apple.com/message/1015772\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue is always reproducible, on any installation of Xcode6-Beta4 (6A267n)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'error-backtrace.log' and 'covariant-array-assignment.playground.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n--- 28-Aug-2014 07:54 PM\r\n\r\nI noticed that the uploaded playground file is damaged. Here is a link to the valid archive.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/3j0a2b2t2D3K/download/rdar-17894354.zip\r\n\r\n--- 22-Jan-2015 05:43 AM / ADR\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\n18480439"
