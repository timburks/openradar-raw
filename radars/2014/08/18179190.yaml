    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen configuring IKEv2 on iOS 8, the RemoteIdentifier key is documented (vaguely) as accepting FQDN, UserFQDN, Address, and ASN1DN formats. If you use an ASN1DN value in this field, iOS will mistakenly identify it as FQDN and report it as such to the server. If the server is expecting an ASN1DN value, it will reject the connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an IKEv2 VPN configuration with a RemoteIdentifier of, say, \"C=US, ST=California, C=Apple\". Point it to a server that it can at least try to connect to.\r\n2. Turn on the VPN and capture the device logs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs part of the negotiation, the device should send a payload of type ASN1DN with the given DN.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device sends the given DN with a payload type of FQDN. This is clearly visible in the client logs. You can also verify it on the sever side if you like.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch (MD723LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
