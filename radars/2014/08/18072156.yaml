    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting a UIInputView as a UITextView's inputAccessoryView, it gets presented and its blur perfectly matches the keyboard's. However, if you rotate to a different interface orientation without dismissing the keyboard first, the blur suddenly no longer matches the keyboard and is quite ugly. Dismissing the keyboard then presenting it fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a UIInputView as a UITextView's inputAccessoryView.\r\n2. Run the app, and begin editing the UITextView.\r\n3. UIInputView should look normal and match blur of the keyboard.\r\n4. Rotate the device to landscape if in portrait, and vice versa if in landscape.\r\n5. Observe the UIInputView, it should be a different blur than the keyboard (but this is only visible when there is colorful content behind the keyboard).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blur of the UIInputView would always match that of the keyboard\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blur of the UIInputView doesn't match the keyboard when rotating to a different interface orientation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 (This does not occur on iOS 7)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are 4 screenshots and sample code. Two screenshots show what the blur should look like in both portrait and landscape orientations, since they were taken before being rotated. The other two show the messed up blurs after rotating the device.\r\n\r\nThe sample project can simply be built and run, and then you can tap on the included screenshot (it's a UITextView I promise) to make the keyboard appear. Rotate to a different orientation, and the blur will be messed up.\r\n\r\nThis may possibly be related to radar #18072018 \"UIInputView blur doesn't match keyboard when taking screenshot (and looks rather ugly)\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 5s, iOS Simulator"
