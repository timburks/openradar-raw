    description: "Summary:\r\nAn IKEv2 configuration on iOS 8 using SharedSecret device authentication will generate a MAC that is not accepted by a strongSwan server configured with the same PSK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up strongSwan 5.1.2. I recommend Ubuntu 14.04. Sample config files are attached, although you'll have to bring your own PKI.\r\n2. Add an IKEv2 configuration using the PSK configured in step 1. Trivial XAUth can be provided, although it won't get that far.\r\n3. Try to connect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe server should accept the PSK provided.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe MAC generated by iOS will not match the configured PSK.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nStrictly speaking, this symptom doesn't indicate which side is at fault. However, since iOS appears to be the newer implementation and only Apple has the ability to debug both sides, I think it will have to be on your plate.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch (MD723LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ipsec.conf' and 'ipsec.secrets' were successfully uploaded."
