    description: "Summary:\r\nYosemiteâ€™s Finder progress bar windows have no visual distinction between the title bar and the rest of the window, but they are draggable only by the title bar region. They should be draggable by any pixel with the possible exception of the Cancel button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start copying a large file (or lots of small files), such as Xcode.\r\n2. Decide you want to drag the progress window.\r\n3. Seeing no visual demarcation between title bar and content, you praise the gods of Fitts's Law and try to grab the window by the invitingly large gray area around the middle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window is draggable by any pixels except the Minimize widget and the Cancel button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window is draggable only by the title bar, even though a couple of years of brushed metal and the Safari and Finder Status Bars taught us all that any part of the window that has the same texture as the title bar is also draggable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A329f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments: http://cl.ly/X8P6"
