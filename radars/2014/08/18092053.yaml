    description: "Summary:\r\nApple's recommendation for preventing sensitive information from appearing in the task switcher recommends use of applicationDidEnterBackground:; however, this no longer works in the latest iOS 8 beta 5. When running the sample code, the app is not obscured in time, and the task switcher displays the sensitive information that was properly hidden in iOS 7. When returning to the app, the app content is displayed briefly before the blocking view appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample code here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1838/_index.html\r\n2. Switch to some other app\r\n3. Open the task switcher\r\n4. Return to the first app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Task switcher shows a blank thumbnail, rather than the sensitive contents of the sample app\r\n4. The app displays a blank view without revealing what is underneath\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Task switcher displays thumbnail of the sample app's contents, and not the blank view\r\n4. The sample app displays its contents briefly before the blank view appears\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wish to emphasize that Apple's sample code, posted only 3 months ago, does not work. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1838/_index.html\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPad device and multiple simulators."
