    description: "Summary:\r\nIn The Swift Programming Language book it states:\r\n\r\n“NOTE\r\n\r\nThe index constant exists only within the scope of the loop. If you want to check the value of index after the loop completes, or if you want to work with its value as a variable rather than a constant, you must declare it yourself before its use in the loop.”\r\n\r\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l\r\n\r\nHowever, when I declare a var before its use in the loop the value is not as expected once the loop has exited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the following code.\r\n\r\nlet a = [1,2,3,4]\r\nlet valueToFind = 2\r\nvar value: Int?\r\n\r\nfor value in a {\r\n    if value == valueToFind {\r\n        break\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nif value != valueToFind {\r\n    println(\"This is supposed to be \\(valueToFind) according to the Swift book but instead it's \\(value). Sad panda.\")\r\n} else {\r\n    println(\"Hooray! \\(value) is the right value according to the Swift book. Happy Panda!\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Inspect the output and see if you have a happy panda or a sad panda.\r\n\r\n3) There is no step three.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the output would show a happy panda.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a message about a sad panda. :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0b6 (6A280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not sure if the implementation is incorrect or the documentation is incorrect so I'll leave it up to you to decide which it should be. :)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
