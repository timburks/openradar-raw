    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing an Action extension, there is no way to control the status bar style when the extension is displayed fullscreen (NSExtensionActionWantsFullScreenPresentation).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see attached demo xcode project and follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run the 'Test App' target. \r\n2. Click the button\r\n3. Select the 'TestExtention' Action Extension\r\n4. The extension with a dark background is presented, but the status bar is black\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the extension has a dark background, I expect to have control over the status bar style. This can be done like it's implemented for applications:\r\n\r\n- Set the preferred status bar style in the info.plist\r\n- Use view controller based status bar appearance \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe extension has a black status bar, instead of the white color I specified in - [ActionViewController preferredStatusBarStyle]. There is no way to set the status bar style in the info.plist \r\n\r\nSince it's an extension, it's also not possible to call:\r\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];\r\nbecause UIApplication cannot be used for extensions. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8 & xCode6 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestApp.zip' was successfully uploaded."
