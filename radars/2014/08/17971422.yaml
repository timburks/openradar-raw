    description: When sending a Push to ssl://gateway.push.apple.com:2195 one need to specify the token. Many many people actually wants to send to "all tokens". It would be nice if the token parameter would not be necessary and all known token for this app would receive a push. If you're concerned about the user being spammed, then allow only "content-available:1" to be sent in "aps".
