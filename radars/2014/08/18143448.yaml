    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPad Air device, the Cancel button in the top left of the MFMailComposeViewController is almost untappable. You need to tap very close to the \"el\" to trigger it. Users won't have a way to exit the controller if they can't find the sweet stop to tap.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run project.\r\n2. Tap \"Open Composer\"\r\n3. Tap the \"Cancel\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe popover should appear asking us to Delete or Save draft.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTap does nothing unless it's close to the \"el\" in \"Cancel\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air (MD785LL/A)"
