    description: "Summary:\r\nXCode's debugger just shows a blank white view where the view hierarchy is supposed to appear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run Apple's NewBox sample code. It may be necessary to first provide an entitlements file.\r\n2. Choose \"Import\" on the right-hand side.\r\n3. Choose NBox as the document provider to start running the extension.\r\n4. Attach to the Document Picker extension using XCode's debugger\r\n5. Click the inspect view hierarchy button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXCode shows a hierarchy of views within the Document Picker extension like it does with regular apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXCode shows a blank white screen where the views should appear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 6.0 (6A254o), OS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on simulator.
