Even though I select different kind of simulators from specific simulators UI (as can be seen in screenshots), the bots summary view only list one simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Xcode 6 beta 4 version\r\n2. Server 3.2 version on 10.9.4 mavericks\r\n3. Create a bot and select specific simulators during the process (screenshots above)\r\n4. Run the integration\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected simulators to be difference because I chose different simulators. I expect iOS 7.0.3 simultor , iOS 8 simulator, iOS 7.1 simulator. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSame simulator names (iOS 7.1 simulator) are returned. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode6 beta4 - 6A267n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-08-01 at 2.52.08 PM.png', 'Screen Shot 2014-08-01 at 2.52.24 PM.png' and 'Screen Shot 2014-08-01 at 2.52.33 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
