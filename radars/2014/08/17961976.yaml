    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS8 Beta 5, the `viewForKey:` method of UIViewControllerContextTransitioning always returns nil for the presenting view controller's view. In a presentation action, this means that it returns nil when called with `UITransitionContextFromViewKey`. In a dismissal, the `UITransitionContextToViewKey` is nil instead.  This makes it impossible to create modal animations that animate the presenting view (for instance by sliding down to reveal a view underneath, or by scaling down with a transform to provide a zoom-up effect when showing the modal, or recreating something similar the flip-horizontal or page-curl modal transitions).\r\n\r\nIn iOS7, you would instead use the `view` property of the respective view controllers, which continues to work correctly on iOS7 devices. If you try this on iOS8, the view hierarchy becomes broken following dismissal transitions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing the attached sample project:\r\n\r\n1. Build the project using Xcode 6 Beta 5 to an iPhone running iOS7.\r\n2. Tap the present/dismiss buttons\r\n3. Observe the working transition.\r\n\r\n4. Build the project using Xcode 5 Beta 5 to an iPhone running iOS8 Beta 5.\r\n5. Tap the present/dismiss buttons\r\n6. Observe that the broken transition.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS8 device should maintain the slide transition effect that this transition provides on iOS7.\r\n\r\nThe original controller slides off, as a new controller underneath fades in. On dismissal, the animation reverses.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS8, the original controller disappears immediately, and the new controller fades in. The slide transition does not occur.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5, Xcode 6 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project also available on GitHub: https://github.com/bcherry/TransitionBug\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 16GB A1533. Also iPhone Simulator."
