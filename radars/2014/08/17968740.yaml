    description: "Summary:\r\nSourceKitService crashes if a currently open Swift file includes a lazy variable declaration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6.0 Beta 5 (6A279r)\r\n2. Create a new Swift playground file.\r\n3. Start typing the following code:\r\n\r\n    class foo {\r\n        lazy var bar: String = {\r\n            return \"baz\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that copying & pasting the code won't necessarily trigger the bug, one has to type it character-by-character to see the crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo interruption during the typing, no crashes, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEditor \"crashes\" with a HUD message: \"SourceKitService Terminated. Editor functionality temporarily limited\". A crash report file is attached.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 Beta 5 (6A279r)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\nMacPro5,1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue occurs both in playgrouds and in project files, regardless of the SDK. Even if a file already includes a lazy variable declaration, SourceKitService tends to crash from time to time after the editor receives a keyboard input.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SourceKitService_2014-08-09-123927.crash' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n--- 12-Aug-2014 05:23 AM / ADR\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.\r\n\r\n17918143"
