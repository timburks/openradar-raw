        Summary:
        UITableViewRowAction is a great addition to UITableView, but it should allow for more customization, such as:
        - ability to use NSAttributedString for `title` property
        - ability to use an image as a title or even a full UIView. There are instances where you would want to use an icon instead of text. An example of this would be an “X” for delete, or a share indicator
