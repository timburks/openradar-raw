    description: "Summary:\r\nAs far as I can tell, a Today extension cannot access local notifications at all, since [UIApplication sharedApplication] is not available to the extension. I think this is a significant oversight.\r\n\r\nThere are many good reasons I can think of to want this feature, but here's one of the best examples I can think of: I use an app to remind me when to take medications. I would really, really love to have a simple Today widget that shows my pills and lets me check them off after I've taken them. But there's no good way to do this.\r\n\r\nEven if the app was using background refresh, a local notification reminding me to take a pill might fire between the time I check it off in the Today widget and when the app next runs in the background. (And really, there's no good reason to have the app refreshing in the background anyway.)\r\n\r\nI assume this problem could be solved with push notifications, but then I'm telling a third party about all the medications I'm on AND relying on a good internet connection to receive an important reminder. So that's really not a good solution at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with a Today extension.\r\n2. Use UIApplication's features for local notifications, like scheduleLocalNotification:\r\n3. Attempt to cancel or add a notification from the Today extension.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNCExtensionContext should offer some way to access these notifications through the following methods:\r\n\r\nscheduleLocalNotification:\r\npresentLocalNotificationNow:\r\ncancelLocalNotification:\r\ncancelAllLocalNotifications\r\nscheduledLocalNotifications\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs far as I can tell it's not possible to do anything with location notifications from an extension."
