        Summary:
        IntegerType should require that conforming types implement min and max type properties. This would allow generic code to use these properties.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Write a generic function that takes IntegerTypes (or (Signed|Unsigned)IntegerType).

            func headroom<Integer: IntegerType> (x: Integer) -> Integer {

        2. Try to use the generic type’s .max and .min properties:

                return Integer.max - x

        Expected Results:
        You can do so.

        Actual Results:
        This is an error because these protocols don’t require min and max properties. Nor do any other protocols.

        Notes:
        I’m trying to write a generic “perform a truncating conversion” function, and I believe that doing this will require me to access at least IntegerType.max.
