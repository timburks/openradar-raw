    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to use Xcode 6 Add Apple ID account in the Preferences dialog, and your account name or surname includes accented characters, Xcode will fail with the undescriptive message “Could not parse server’s response as a plist”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com, log in with your credentials and change your name or surname to include accented characters (my surnames has both í and ñ”).\r\n2. Go to Xcode 6 Beta 5, Preferences, Accounts, delete the existing Apple ID account (if already there), and try to add it back.\r\n3. You will get the error “Could not parse server’s response as a plist”.\r\n4. Go back to https://appleid.apple.com, and remove any accented characters from your name or surname.\r\n5. In Xcode try to repeat Step 2.\r\n6. You will be log in without problems.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to log in with your account credentials, even if your name or surname includes accented characters, or at least get more descriptive error of the situation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou cannot use your login credentials, and the error doesn’t provide the enough information on how to solve the problem, leaving you to guess how to fix it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS: 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\nXcode: 6.0 (6A279r)\r\n\r\nNot reproducible: Xcode: 5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven’t look too much further, but I suspect that the problem is either different encodings (ISO-8859 vs. UTF-8) or just support for ASCII characters (which will be bad).\r\n\r\nI could not find anything in the Console.app related to the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs: Apple ID surname: include í and ñ\r\nNot occurs: Apple ID surname: substitute í and ñ with just i and n."
