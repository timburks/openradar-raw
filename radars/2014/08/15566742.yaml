    description: "Summary:\r\nUIScreen UIScreenBrightnessDidChangeNotification does not always get called if screen brightness is manually turned down to 0 using the brightness slider in the control center\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register for notifications for UIScreenBrightnessDidChangeNotification\r\n2. Start app\r\n3. Pull up the control center\r\n4. Swiftly slide the brightness to 0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIScreenBrightnessDidChangeNotification should fire\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIScreenBrightnessDidChangeNotification does not always fire. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4(11B554a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the slider is at 100% and you pull it all the way to 0, in one go, it works as expected. Sliding from any other position to 0 seems to cause the issue."
