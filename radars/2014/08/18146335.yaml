        Summary:

        Hitting tab to auto-complete just picks the first option if there are more than one. It should work like auto-complete in command line shells (eg bash), and auto-complete up to the point where there is some ambiguity.


        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Hit Cmd-Shift-G in the Finder.
        2. Type ~/Library/A
        3. Hit the Tab key

        Expected Results:

        It could auto-complete to either “Application Scripts” or “Application Support”, so it should fill in “Application S”.

        Actual Results:

        It just picks the first alternative, and fills in “Application Scripts”

        Regression:

        As far as I know, this has always been the behaviour. It’s wrong though!
