    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swift compiler will hang when trying to compile a switch statement that does a nested pattern match with a type-cast. I have attached a playground file which demonstrates the problem, as well as callstack samples from Activity Monitor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached playground file. Specifically, write a switch statement that includes at least 2 cases that look like the following:\r\n\r\ncase .C(.A, let foo as String):\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe compiler should never hang\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compiler hangs forever\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode6-beta5 (6A279r)\r\nOSX 10.9.4 (13E28)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook pro running mavericks\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SwitchTypeCastBug.playground.zip', 'Sample of SourceKitService.txt' and 'Sample of com.apple.dt.Xcode.Playground.txt' were successfully uploaded."
