    description: "Summary:\r\nI've noticed that the assistive touch icon is still rounded to ios6 standards, and not the new ios 7 standards. I also think it would be much more beautiful and useful if users could have the option (UISwitch perhaps) to snap the icon into the icons' grid. Not only would it look nicer on the screen, but the interface would appear more seamless. It could remain in that area when inside apps, and the user could move it around freely in the app, but once they go back to the home screen, it would go back to its assigned icon place.\r\n\r\nAlso if a user hasn't touched the screen within a few seconds the icon should disappear when inside an app, until a user interacts with the screen again (removes the feeling of it constantly getting in the way).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen up assistive touch in the Settings app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAssistive Touch Icon resembles ios7 icons.\r\nOption to snap it in place of an icon on the home screen (can hover at that location in other apps as well).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIcon is rounded to ios 6 standards.\r\nLooks ugly on top of other icons.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe wording beneath the icon should dissapear when in free-mode (not snapped to grid).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 7 devices.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Usability.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nLink: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ux32ze6y9yhomof/Usability-2.zip"
