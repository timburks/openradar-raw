        Summary:
        Currently, Xcode saves only the UUID of a provisioning profile in the project file. This is super-annoying since every device addition or team member change or re-generation of the profile requires to change the project file. FOR NO REASON. Please just store the name and make the profile selection more stable by that.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Have a project
        - Select a provisioning profile like “Mac Team Provisioning Profile: *”
        - Make changes to the team in Dev Portal
        - Refresh profiles from Xcode
        - Observe the provisioning profile link breaking

        Expected Results:
        - The new version of the “Mac Team Provisioning Profile: *” should be selected AUTOMATICALLY

        Actual Results:
        - A hash identifier is shown, the project no longer compiles

        Regression:
        - The new profile must be selected manually.
        - The change must be committed.
        - This has to be done of every single branch.

        Notes:
        - This can be solved by saving the NAME of the profile instead of the identifier
        - Identifier could still be saved to avoid ambiguities
        - This issue is mega-annoying when working with many branches and team members.
