    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached xhtml file, when included in an EPUB book, causes iBooks to badly misformat certain lines of text.\r\n\r\nI've determined that the problem only occurs when there are multiple <tspan> tags within a single <text> tag that uses a matrix transform.  The content is legal SVG, and renders correctly in Safari/WebKit/Chrome, so this is purely an iBooks bug.\r\n\r\nI've worked around it in my toolchain by hacking up the SVG, adding extra <text> tags for each <tspan> tag, but that's really a kludge, and iBooks really should handle this edge case correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open the test.epub book.\r\n2.  Look at the title page.\r\n3.  Notice the corruption.\r\n4.  Open the test2.epub book.\r\n5.  Notice that it works fine.\r\n6.  Notice that the only change was duplicating the <text> tag so that each <tspan> tag is in a separate <text> tag.\r\n\r\nIn iBooks on iOS, the problem may only occur after you rotate to landscape orientation.  In iBooks on OS X, the problem occurs immediately, because it does a 2-Up spread by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected valid SVG to be rendered correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second <tspan> element inside a given <text> element is partially rendered atop the first <tspan> element's contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.0.1 on OS X\r\nAnd whatever the latest version is on iOS 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on all hardware, all operating systems (iOS and OS X)."
