    description: "Summary:\r\nDisabled Swift unit tests in Xcode 6 still get executed\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode 6 project that uses unit tests\r\n2. Add a new test case with Swift set as language\r\n3. Add a test method that fails using XCTFail\r\n4. Disable the test in the test navigator\r\n5. Run all unit tests using Product->Test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo tests should fail because none are enabled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe disabled test gets executed and fails because of XCTFail\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDisabling tests created using Objective-C as language works as expected, even in a mixed project"
