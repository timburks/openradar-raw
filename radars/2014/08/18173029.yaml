    description: "Summary:\r\nLetâ€™s assume you have a Swift-project containing two targets (e.g. one for the App and one for Unit Tests). If the App-Target contains a public class that is not used in this target it cannot be instantiated in the Unit-Test-Target either because it will be stripped from the App-Build before the Unit-Test-Target has a chance to link against it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. Try to test the target on an actual device (Cmd-U)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test should compile and pass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe linker fails with the error message:\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture armv7:\r\n  \"__TMaC14BugDemoProject6ClassA\", referenced from:\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT10invocationGSQCSo12NSInvocation__S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT8selectorV10ObjectiveC8Selector_S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT_S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n      _get_field_types_BugDemoProjectTests in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n  \"__TFC14BugDemoProject6ClassACfMS0_FT_S0_\", referenced from:\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT10invocationGSQCSo12NSInvocation__S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT8selectorV10ObjectiveC8Selector_S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n      __TFC19BugDemoProjectTests19BugDemoProjectTestscfMS0_FT_S0_ in BugDemoProjectTests.o\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A280e) on OS X Yosemite Beta 6 compiling for iOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEverything works as expected on the iPhone Simulator\r\nThe test compiles and passes if ClassA is used at least one in the App-Target (may be achieved by toggling the line comment in ViewController.swift:13\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26477957/BugDemoProject.zip"
