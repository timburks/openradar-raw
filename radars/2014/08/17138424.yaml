    description: "Summary:\r\nThe version of SSH provided in Mavericks does not support pkcs8 private keys. Using our client management software, we want to enforce that all private keys in our organization are using PKCS#8 based keys with PBKDF2 instead of SSH's default (MD5), but making this change would be difficult until Apple patches this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upgrade your an SSH private key, following instructions in this blog post: http://martin.kleppmann.com/2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html\r\n2. Try to use it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected result is that I am prompted to enter the passphrase, I have the option of storing it in Keychain, and then the connection succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user gets prompted for the password repeatedly. The private key is never decrypted and cannot be used to initiate SSH connections.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.3/13D65\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated bug report: 14776937"
