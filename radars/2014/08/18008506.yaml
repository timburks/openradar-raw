        Summary:
        Apple discussion blocking access for some IPs?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Since today I'm getting this error message when trying to access Apple Discussions.

        Access Denied

        You don't have permission to access "http://discussions.apple.com/" on this server.
        Reference #18.91b61402.1407954979.3fd1873

        The hex ID changes with each attempt.


        Expected Results:
        Apple Discussions should be available from any IP for everyone.


        Actual Results:
        Some IPs seem to be denied access for an unknown and undisclosed reason.
        Also the error message refers to http://discussions.apple.com/ without TLS!
        Might this just be a temporary misconfiguration?


        Regression:
        I've never had problems with Apple Discussions denying access that way in the past years. Login and posting always worked just fine.


        Notes:
        I've tried with multiple browsers:
        Chromium Version 37.0.2062.0 (278899)
        Safari Version 7.0.5 (9537.77.4)
        TorBrowser 3.6.3

        I need access to Apple Discussions as part of my work as iOS/OS X systems administrator and Cocoa developer.
