    description: "Summary:\r\nThe presentation of the above controllers is very limited and they provide different presentation methods for iPhone and iPad. Since iOS 8 userInterfaceIdiom is deprecated and shouldn't be considered, but the presentation of these controllers requires to differentiate between iPhones and iPad. \r\n\r\nThese separate presentation methods make the presentation of those controllers very restricted and don't work well in conjunction with size classes. It should be possible to present these controllers and add them to the view hierarchy like any other UIViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample for UIPrintInteractionController:\r\n\r\nPresentation on the iPhone:\r\n- (BOOL)presentAnimated:(BOOL)animated completionHandler:(UIPrintInteractionCompletionHandler)completion\r\n\r\nPresentation on the iPad:\r\n- (BOOL)presentFromBarButtonItem:(UIBarButtonItem *)item animated:(BOOL)animated completionHandler:(UIPrintInteractionCompletionHandler)completion\r\n\r\n- (BOOL)presentFromRect:(CGRect)rect inView:(UIView *)view animated:(BOOL)animated completionHandler:(UIPrintInteractionCompletionHandler)completion\r\n\r\nThose methods are clearly modeled after UIPopoverController, but since UIPrintInteractionController is a subclass of NSObject and not of UIViewController we are limited to use them.\r\n\r\nThe provided delegate method\r\n\r\n- (UIViewController *)printInteractionControllerParentViewController:(UIPrintInteractionController *)printInteractionController\r\n\r\nmakes the presentation cumbersome to use and still unflexible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIPrintInteractionController, UIDocumentInteractionController, UIImagePickerController (and any other controller I might have missed) are all UIViewController subclasses and can be presented with\r\n\r\n- (void)presentViewController:(UIViewController *)viewControllerToPresent animated:(BOOL)flag completion:(void (^)(void))completion\r\n\r\nor added as a child view controller anywhere in the view controller hierarchy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncustom presentation methods for UIPrintInteractionController/UIDocumentInteractionController and limited presentation possibilities of UIImagePickerController (iPad: Popover/Fullscreen, iPhone: Fullscreen)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nall hardware\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
