    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the attached file, I've created a sample program that showcases the bug. It is always reproducible. When the steps to reproduce are followed, the view being pushed to the nav stack will go black. The nav bar is still visible and when tapped to go back, the previous view became black too. This was not happening in iOS7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run program. A red view in a navigation controller will be pushed to the screen\r\n2. Press the button on the red view to \"Push a modal view\". A blue modal will be pushed formsheet style with cross dissolve animation.\r\n3. Press the button on the blue modal to \"Remove me\". This causes the blue modal to call dismiss on itself, as well as cause the red view controller under it to push a new blue view controller to its navigationcontroller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new blue controller should stay visible. When tapping Back, the red controller should still be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSo there are two animations occurring at the same time, one to remove the blue modal from the red controller and one to push a new blue controller to the nav stack. When the animations end, the new blue view controller becomes black. When you tap Back on the nav bar, the red controller is black too. Note that if we dismiss or push with animated:NO, the problem goes away.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8, xcode 6 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also occurs on our iPad test devices, not just the simulator.\r\nThis also occurs on iOS8 devices running a build built with xcode 5 (ios7 SDK). Also, after the views go black, it seems they were removed from the view hierarchy (no superviews). The superview they had before they were removed is of class _UIParallaxDimmingView.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Retina (8.0) simulator"
