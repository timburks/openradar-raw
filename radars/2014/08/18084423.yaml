    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an iOS application is deleted from the Xcode 6 beta 6 iOS 8 simulator, its NSUserDefaults are not deleted along with the app. \r\n\r\nThis can be resolved by: 1) using a device rather than a simulator or 2) resetting content and settings on the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached sample project. \r\n2. Build and run application in simulator. Note that screen says \"NO\", indicating the application has not yet run. \r\n3. Build and run application in simulator again. Note that screen says \"YES\", indicating the application has run. \r\n4. Uninstall application from simulator, which in theory should nuke the user defaults. \r\n5. Build and run application in simulator again. Note that screen says \"YES\", indicating that the boolean value for the given key is still set, which it should not be if the user defaults were nuked. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Open attached sample project. \r\n2. Build and run application on device. Note that screen says \"NO\", indicating the application has not yet run. \r\n3. Build and run application on device again. Note that screen says \"YES\", indicating the application has run. \r\n4. Uninstall application from device, which in theory should nuke the user defaults. \r\n5. Build and run application on device again. Note that screen says \"NO\", indicating that the user defaults were appropriately nuked. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(see steps to repro)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 beta 6, iOS 8 SDK beta 5, OS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThough the sample app is in Swift, this happens regardless of whether the language used to access the NSUserDefaults is Swift or Obj-C. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens every time on the sim using my configuration. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n(single-VC app with the following code in the ViewController:\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n\r\n        let key = \"hasLaunchedBefore\"\r\n        let hasLaunched = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().boolForKey(key)\r\n        testLabel?.text = hasLaunched ? \"YES\" : \"NO\"\r\n        \r\n        NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().setBool(true, forKey: key);\r\n        NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults().synchronize()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nOn device, it will display NO every time you uninstall and rerun the app. On simulator, it will display NO the first time you ever run the app, and then YES every time thereafter unless you reset content and settings.\r\n\r\n)"
