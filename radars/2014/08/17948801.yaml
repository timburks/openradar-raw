    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be helpful if Xcode provided a mechanism to automatically manage the #import, @import, and #include directives in a source file.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would do the following:\r\n\r\n- Remove unneeded directives (that is, imports of modules/headers declaring types and functions that are not used in the current source file)\r\n- Sort the directives alphabetically or by some other useful ordering scheme\r\n\r\nThere should be a project-wide setting that controls whether this feature is automatically applied whenever a source file is saved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 and Xcode 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis functionality is provided by IDEs for other platforms (Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
