    description: "Summary:\r\nI was filling in Billing information while renewing my iOS developer program. When I picked up 'Belarus' in country list the 'State, region' field got updated with the only one choice - 'White Russia Region'. This is incorrect. Belarus is not Russia at all! It's a separate country with its own dictator. Please respect this!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to developer portal\r\n2. Purchase or extend a developer program membership (I was renewing iOS developer program membership - https://developer2.apple.com/programservices/manualpurchase/programManualPurchase.action?selectedProductIds=ds1)\r\n3. In Billing Information section choose 'Belarus' in 'Country' field.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nField `State, Province, or Region:` is hidden or at least inactive. Or has the only value like \"doesn't apply\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt requires me to choose 'White Russia region'. Belarus is not Russia at all!!!! What a disrespect!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 7.0.5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://screencast.com/t/eHjyiRjj"
