    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Core Data Model Editor ideplugin of Xcode, users are not able to move between some editing fields using the keyboard.\r\n\r\nCannot move from Attribute name to Attribute type when editing attributes.\r\nCannot move from Relationship name to Destination or Inverse\r\n\r\nIt IS possible when editing Fetched Properties to move from the property name to the predicate using the tab key. This is the behavior users are likely to expect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Core Data model in Xcode.\r\n2. Add an attribute to an entity\r\n3. edit the attribute name.\r\n4. Hit tab to move focus to the next column in the editor (attribute type)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should move focus to the attribute type popup, which should be editable using the arrow keys.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode does not move focus to the attribute type popup when the user hits the tab key. No known keyboard shortcut seems to work here.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.1.1 (5B1008)\r\n6.0 (6A280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnnotated screenshot attached for clarity\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IDEModelEditorTab.png' was successfully uploaded."
