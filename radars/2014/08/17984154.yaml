    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS8 document picker extension view controller displays inside a navigation controller-style view, but it cannot access the navigation controller object. Specifically, self.navigationController is nil and so the picker has no access to the navigation bar and is unable to push items onto the navigation stack. As a result, navigating hierarchical file/folder structures requires awkward UI.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached screenshots: the iCloud picker is able to push views onto the navigation bar, resulting in a UI consistent with the rest of iOS. However, this is not possible with third-party apps, resulting in subpar UI, for example stacked navigation bars.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate a UIDocumentPickerExtensionViewController.\r\n2. Attempt to push any view onto navigation controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n[self.navigationController pushViewController:...] should push a view controller onto the navigation stack.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nself.navigationController is nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device or simulator."
