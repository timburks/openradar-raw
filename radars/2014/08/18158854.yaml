    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a developer, the link conditioner is an exceptional tool for testing and debugging network-intensive iPhone apps. However, it is very easy to forget to turn it on or forget to turn it off. It would be extremely useful, and save hours of frustration, if the current Link Conditioner status was shown in the iPhone status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTurn on Link Conditioner. Run iPhone app. There is no indication that the link conditioner is on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be great if the status bar showed a small link conditioner icon of some sort.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo indication is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 64 GB"
