    description: "Summary:\nI would like to be able to do literate-style Swift programs in e.g. .lswift files.\n\nThe structure of these would be arbitrary text (tho Markdown by convention would be reasonable), with the Swift code occurring as e.g. any block indented by one level, or any blocks of text whose lines are prefixed with >\n\nXcode would ideally provide syntax highlighting only for the Swift code, leaving the rest as plain text. Bonus points if documentation comments can occur in the \n\nThe rest of the Summary section is an example:\n\n\nA naïve, primitive recursive implementation of the factorial function is quite inefficient, because it recomputes the results it needs at every step.\n\n\tfunc naïveFactorial(n: Int) -> Int {\n\t\treturn n > 0 ? n * naïveFactorial(n - 1) : 1\n\t}\n\nA memoizing implementation is much more efficient, at the cost of some space.\n\n\tlet memoizingFactorial = memoize { recur, n in\n\t\tn > 0 ? n * recur(n - 1) : 1\n\t}\n\nWe use the memoizing combinator given in the Advanced Swift session of WWDC2014.\n\n\tfunc memoize<T : Hashable, U>(body: (T -> U, T) -> U) -> T -> U {\n\t\tvar memo = [ T : U ]()\n\t\tvar recursive: (T -> U)!\n\t\trecursive = { x in\n\t\t\tif let found = memo[x] { return found }\n\t\t\tlet result = body(recursive, x)\n\t\t\tmemo[x] = result\n\t\t\treturn result\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn recursive\n\t}\n\nTo-do: wax philosophical about memoization and fixpoints…\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nN/A\n\nExpected Results:\nN/A\n\nActual Results:\nN/A\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\ncf http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming"
