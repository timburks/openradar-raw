    description: "Summary:\nUsing the build in OS X Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts to set a new shortcut for Safari’s Show Previous Tab and Show Next tab doesn’t work.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOn OS X Mavericks 10.9.4 go to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts. Add a new shortcut under “All  for “Select Next Tab” and set it to Option-<right-arrow>. Add a new shortcut for “Select Previous Tab” and set it to “Option-<left arrow>”.\n\nExpected Results:\nThose new keyboard shortcuts would work in Safari to change tabs. \n\nActual Results:\nIn Safari, only the original commands work, Cmd-Shift-Right and Cmd-Shift-Left. In the Window menu, it doesn’t show the overridden keyboard shortcuts, it only shows the original ones.\n\nNote, Safari is the only app I know that doesn’t respect this. Many other apps, including Apple apps like Terminal.app do.\n\nRegression:\nThis has happened for years now. I should have filed a bug earlier."
