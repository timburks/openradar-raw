    description: "Summary:\r\nif an iOS app is using the core bluetooth framework and is scanning for peripherals to connect to, both device names (mapped to peripheral.name and advertisementData[@\"kCBAdvDataLocalName\"] appear to stick to the first values encountered when the peripheral is scanned. If the peripheral subsequently updates its GAP and GATT device names, the original values persist. This caching seems to persist across app relaunches and device reboots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. peripheral advertises with scan RSP name \"foo\"\r\n2. iOS app scans for peripheral and sees peripheral(didDiscoverPeripheral..) with name \"foo\"\r\n3.peripheral stops advertising\r\n4. peripheral starts advertising with scan RSP name \"bar\"\r\n5. iOS app scans for peripheral and..\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nin step 5 I expect the name to update to \"bar\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nint step 5 the name stays at \"foo\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nfrom reading around, this bug seems to have been in existence since iOS 6.  I have not yet attempted with iOS8. Any chance it is addressed there?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
