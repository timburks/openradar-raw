    description: "Array.subscript currently returns an element or crashes. This is highly unsafe, especially compared to Dictionaries which do not have this problem. Rather then crashing, Array.subscript should return an Optional<T>.\r\n\r\nIn general, callers should not be accessing Array subscripts directly; they should iterate with for...in. The very small overhead of using an Optional will encourage that. For users who wish a dangerous behavior, they can unwrap with !."
