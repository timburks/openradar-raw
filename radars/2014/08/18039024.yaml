    description: "Summary:\r\nWKWebView cannot load files using file:// URL protocol that is within the app sandbox since iOS 8 beta 4 and 5. This worked in beta 3, and still works in the iOS 8 beta simulators (all beta versions).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a file in your Documents folder (or Library, or Library/Caches, or tmp, or even load something in your app bundle)\r\n2. Load that file in WKWebView as a file:// URL\r\n3. The file will not load and result in an error \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKWebView can load a file from a file URL from the app's sandbox (Documents, Library, Library/Caches, tmp, app bundle)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWKWebView will not load a file from a file URL from the app's sandbox (Documents, Library, Library/Caches, tmp, app bundle)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI included a sample project demonstrating the issue. The sample project is also here: https://github.com/shazron/WKWebViewFIleUrlTest\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 17761459 (Open) - as of Aug 21st 2014"
