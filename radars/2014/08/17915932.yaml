    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Full Screen button on windows looks more like a square with a crossout line through it than like two arrows, especially at small sizes/resolution, and especially in its grayscale variation (like in QuickLook).\r\n\r\nEven worse is its \"Exit Full Screen\" rendering, which reads more like a bowtie or some kind of hazmat symbol.\r\n\r\nThis is partly caused by its \"too clever\" rendering—trying to fit it into geometric primitives—and partly by it being different in style from the X and — buttons next to it. The glyphs on those buttons are rendered as thin lines, while the Full Screen button uses chunky shapes.\r\n\r\nThe old + symbol would fit better, or perhaps two chevrons (such as those already used for dropdown menus).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at the Full Screen button (\"< >\") on any window that supports it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Full Screen button should clearly communicate its purpose and fit well with other similar controls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Full Screen button does not clearly communicate its purpose. It can be misread in a way that disincentivizes the user from using it. It is also visually inconsistent with the X and — buttons next to it."
