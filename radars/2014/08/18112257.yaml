    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the beta iOS Simulator is running on a computer connected to wi-fi, and the host computer switches networks, the Simulator can lose the ability to access the Internet.  This happens to me consistently when I am using my laptop at my workplace, close it and take it home, and attempt to resume development there.  It does not happen when I manually switch from one wi-fi network at my workplace to another.  It's unknown whether this issue also occurs with physical Ethernet connections (I only have physical network access at my home, so can't come up with an easy way of testing this).\r\n\r\nThe longest period of time I've left it in this state for is about 16 hours.  The Simulator does not appear to automatically pick up the new network information, ever - once it's gone, it's gone.  In order to restore network functionality in the Simulator, the user must quit and restart it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. (Using Xcode 6 beta 4 / iOS Simulator for iPhone 5S 8.0:)\r\n1. While connected to a wireless network, launch the simulator.  Within the Simulator, open a page in Mobile Safari and confirm that the page loads successfully.\r\n2. Leaving the Simulator open, put the computer to sleep and move it to a different location with a new wireless network already saved in the computer's network preferences.\r\n3. Wake the computer and allow it to connect to the new network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Simulator should route network requests through the currently connected wi-fi network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe computer itself connects to the new network.  Pages can be successfully loaded in Safari, e-mail can be successfully fetched using Mail, etc.  However, within the Simulator, attempting to load any webpage in Mobile Safari immediately fails with the message \"Safari cannot open the page because the network connection was lost.\"  When using Xcode 6 to debug an app which attempts to connect to the network, all network results immediately fail with Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 \"The network connection was lost.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6, Beta 6 / 6A267n; OS X 10.9.4 / 13E28\r\n(was also present in Xcode 6, beta 4)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRestarting the Simulator each time my computer transitions between networks allows me to work around this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina MacBook Pro (15\") [MacBookPro10,1] Mid-2012, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\r\n\r\nAdditional wireless card info, just in case:\r\n  Software Versions:\r\n  CoreWLAN:\t4.3.3 (433.48)\r\n  CoreWLANKit:\t3.3.2 (332.36)\r\n  Menu Extra:\t9.3.2 (932.35)\r\n  System Information:\t9.0 (900.8)\r\n  IO80211 Family:\t6.4 (640.36)\r\n  Diagnostics:\t3.0 (300.40)\r\n  AirPort Utility:\t6.3.2 (632.3)\r\n  Interfaces:\r\nen0:\r\n  Card Type:\tAirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0xEF)\r\n  Firmware Version:\tBroadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.106.98.100.22)\r\n  MAC Address:\t20:c9:d0:47:b2:a3\r\n  Locale:\tFCC\r\n  Country Code:\tUS\r\n  Supported PHY Modes:\t802.11 a/b/g/n\r\n  Supported Channels:\t1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165\r\n  Wake On Wireless:\tSupported\r\n  AirDrop:\tSupported\r\n  Status:\tConnected\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
