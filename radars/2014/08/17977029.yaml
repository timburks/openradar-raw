    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7 when an NSURLConnection is downloading and the device connection gets lost, (like when switching to airplane mode), the NSURLConnection handler is triggered with a connection error like NSURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet. If the application checks SCNetworkReachabilityFlags (through Reachability or directly), the response will be that the application is currently not connected so we can be sure that throughout the application all completions will be handled just fine as any check will return the correct value.\r\n\r\nIn the same case on iOS 8 when the device connection gets lost, the NSURLConnection handler is stll triggered with a connection error like NSURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet. However, if the application checks SCNetworkReachabilityFlags the response will be that the application is currently still connected which can be difficult to handle as the connection obviously knows the device is not connected but the only way we have to check for the status returns a false positive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) in an application, launch a long download through NSURLConnection\r\n2) switch to airplane mode before the end of the download \r\n\r\nSample available at https://github.com/eKaiju/RDAR_Reachability_IOS8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) The connection handler is called with a connection error like NSURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet\r\n2) if we check for SCNetworkReachabilityFlags or  [[Reachability reachabilityForInternetConnection].currentReachabilityStatus we get informed that application is not connected \r\nThat's the current result in iOS 7\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1) The connection handler is called with a connection error like NSURLErrorNotConnectedToInternet\r\n2) if we check for SCNetworkReachabilityFlags or  [[Reachability reachabilityForInternetConnection].currentReachabilityStatus we get informed that application is currently connected \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample demonstrating the problem on github https://github.com/eKaiju/RDAR_Reachability_IOS8"
