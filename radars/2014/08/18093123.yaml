        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Build a project with a XIB file that causes the error "View is clipping its contents" e.g. by giving an NSButton a huge image then making it smaller than its title and image.
        - Open Xcode's Issue Navigator and double-click the "View is clipping its contents" error message.

        Expected Results:
        The XIB should open and select the problematic view.

        Actual Results:
        The XIB opens. Noting is selected.

        The only way to find out what is causing this error message is to
        1. Switch the issue navigator to text view for this error
        2. Locate the line number for the error (which sometimes is missing, replaced by random characters)
        3. Open the XIB as "Source Code" (which switches the Issue Navigator back from text mode)
        4. Dig through the raw XML and find the line, and try to divine which view this chunk of XML corresponds to.
        5. Switch back to IB view and fix the view.
        6. Switch back to the issue navigator and find the next error message, and perform all 5 steps again, patiently waiting for the same 2 files to re-load slowly, because the Issue Navigator doesn't remember it was switched to text, nor does the XIB file.
