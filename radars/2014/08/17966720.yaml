    description: "Summary:\r\nwhen operating in the debugger for Xcode 5.1.1, if the editor window in which one is working has been using \"Version Editor\" mode and has \"blame\" selected in the version editor, Xcode will always hang if, when debugging, one ends for various reasons either in assembler (often from stepping out from a file in the git repo) or a system header (sometimes arrived at by jumping to a definition found in a file being debugged).\r\n\r\nthe workaround is obviously to turn off blame mode while debugging, but it is easy to forget to do this.\r\n\r\nthis seems to have been a problem for more than one recent version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project that has files in a git repo\r\n2. Show the Version Editor\r\n3. use the \"blame\" mode for the version editor\r\n4. set a breakpoint in the project\r\n5. start the debugger\r\n6. step in a fashion that will cause you to end up in assembly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nafter step 6, everything should keep working\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nafter step 6, Xcode hangs and must be \"force quit\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1.1 / OS 10.9.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nhas happened on several versions of Mavericks, with a project that has source in a git repo"
