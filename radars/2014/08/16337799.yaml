    description: "Summary:\r\nMany developers tend to create a lot of open-source projects for iOS. The only possible way to distribute those projects is by creating a static library targets. This is fine, but the process of setting things up in Xcode is very complicated and misleading for new-comers.\r\n\r\nThis issue, however, has been solved many years ago, in Mac OS X, by using the frameworks. The drag-and-drop process is very easy and the build time of the project is shorter, because frameworks contain pre-compiled binaries and those can be code-signed using the developemnt certificates. They also provide the Info.plist, and it is sometimes helpful.\r\n\r\nThe iOS SDK, however, doesn't support the framework targets. There is a tool () that re-enables this feature, but like many tweaks, it could lead to unexpected results.\r\n\r\nPlease, enable the developers to create frameworks for iOS deployment, they're so useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe tool used to tweak Xcode to be able to create iOS frameworks: https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n--- 19-Mar-2014 00:06 AM / ADR\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. 14982301"
