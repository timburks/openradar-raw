    description: "Summary:\r\nWebKit was designed to crash if FastMalloc failed to allocate additional memory.\r\n\r\nSee the comment here: http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/JavaScriptCore/JavaScriptCore-721.26/wtf/FastMalloc.h\r\n\r\nLook for the comment near the top: \"These functions call CRASH() if an allocation fails.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI reproduced the crash by continually malloc'ing chunks of memory in a loop until malloc returned NULL, then I used the Safari webview developer console to eval large amounts of JavaScript in my UIWebView.  This caused the app to crash.\r\n\r\nA low memory warning was never sent at any point.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf WebKit cannot allocate enough memory, then it should stop loading content, release the memory associated with the partially loaded content, and post a low-memory warning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWebKit crashes the app since it does not gracefully handle allocation failure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.6 [11B651]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI marked the \"reproducibility\" of this crash as \"sometimes\" because occasionally, other (non-webview related) systems would crash due to being out of memory.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2"
