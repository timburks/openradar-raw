    description: "There does not seem to be any way to shut down a SecureTransport connection by sending a specific fatal alert. The only options are a clean shutdown (which can be incorrect behavior) or to drop the underlying TCP connection without terminating the TLS session (which is usually sufficient for basic correctness, but makes the resulting system hard to debug).\r\n\r\nOne particular case where this is necessary is when using kSSLSessionOptionBreakOnServerAuth in order to perform application-specific certificate validation."
