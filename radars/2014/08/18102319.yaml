    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Location Services setting for apps are cleared out when the app runs\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a basic app that created and starts a CLLocationManager in the viewDidLoad of the view controller. I've tested this with both startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges and startMonitoringForRegion: on the location manager.\r\n2. Load the app onto a device, then stop it\r\n3. Go into Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Note that the app does not have a value.\r\n4. Tap on the app and set it to Always. Tap the back button to confirm Always is displayed for the app in the list of apps.\r\n5. Launch the app again\r\n6. Go back into Privacy > Location Services, and note that the Always setting has been cleared out\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApps will retain their location services privacy settings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps lose their location services privacy settings\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 (12A4345d) on iPad, 8.0 (12A4331d) on iPhone 4s\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini retina (Verizon), iPhone 4s (no SIM)"
