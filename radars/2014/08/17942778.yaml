    description: "Summary:\r\nOn some smaller projects, I usually delete the ProjectTests folder completely. This has been working fine with all previous versions of XCode.\r\nIn Beta 5, any of my existing projects which does not contain a Tests folder fails.\r\nerror: could not read data from '/Users/user/Desktop/deleteMe/deleteMeTests/Info.plist': The file “Info.plist” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. New XCode iOS Project\r\n2. Delete the Tests folder (move to trash)\r\n3. Compile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompile and run the project\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompile error\r\n'/Users/user/Desktop/deleteMe/deleteMeTests/Info.plist': The file “Info.plist” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0 (6A279r)\r\nOS X 10.9.4 (13E28)"
