    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a simulator only problem. \r\n\r\nMFMailComposeViewController does not populate and is not clickable. After a few seconds, the delegate callback didFinishWithResult: is automatically triggered with MFMailComposeResultCancelled. This call is on a background queue, even though this callback should be on the main thread. Basically, MFMailComposeViewController is unusable on simulator (I know you can't actually send mail on simulator) and will crash for any main thread assertions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached project.\r\n2. Tap \"Open Composer\"\r\n3. Wait a few seconds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo: field should have my email. Email form should be editable. didFinishWithResult: should not trigger without UI interaction. When didFinishWithResult: does trigger (i.e. tapping Cancel), it should be on main thread\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTo: field is blank. The email form is not editable. After a few seconds, didFinishWithResult: is called. I put a main thread assertion in there, and it'll crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8.0 (12A4345d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone or iPad simulator"
