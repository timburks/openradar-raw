        Summary:
        Selecting a mail shows other mails in the same thread. However there is no way to conveniently move an email to the same mailbox as the other mails in the shown thread.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - select a email
        - see other mails in the same thread
        - try to find a way to move the selected message(s) with the rest of the thread

        Expected Results:
        - a shortcut / menu item to move the selected messages with the thread

        Actual Results:
        - no shortcut / menu item

        Regression:
        - if the shown mails come from multiple mailboxes, either disable the shortcut or (preferably) just move with the first other mailbox.
        - the “move to ABC again” shortcut is NOT what I am looking for. The target mailbox in this command is a) not obvious from the main window’s contents b) agnostic of the current window selection c) not very precise (multiple mailboxes with identical names across accounts).
