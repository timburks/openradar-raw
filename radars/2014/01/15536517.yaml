    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the appropriate preferences enabled \"Sync playback information across devices\" and \"Sync podcast subscriptions and settings\", it is expected that iTunes, the Podcast app on iOS, and the Podcast app on Apple TV will sync subscriptions, played/unplayed status for episodes, and playback position and bookmarks for episodes. Subscriptions sync successfully, but playback position, bookmarks, and played/unplayed status do not sync across any combination of devices and platforms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable \"Sync playback information across devices\" and \"Sync podcast subscriptions and settings\" in iTunes.\r\n2. Subscribe to a podcast.\r\n3. Download an episode.\r\n4. Mark the episode as played.\r\n5. On iOS, enable \"Sync subscriptions\".\r\n6. Open Podcasts.\r\n7. Observe that the subscription syncs, but the played episode is marked as unplayed.\r\n8. Observe the same on another iTunes installation or Apple TV.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that iCloud would sync played/unplayed status, playback position, and bookmarks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCloud syncs subscriptions, but no other data for podcasts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 build 13A603\r\niOS 7.0.4 builfd 11B554a"
