        Summary:
        Creating a pushbutton in code and giving its layer a shadow causes the shadow to be clipped to view bounds (i.e. ugly, useless). Creating a pushbutton that has a shadow from a XIB and then changing its attributes works fine and causes the shadow to draw properly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the following code in a Cocoa application:
        ==== SNIP! ====
        NSRect          wdBox = NSMakeRect(0,0,100,100);
        NSWindow    *   theWindow = [[[NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRect: wdBox styleMask: NSTitledWindowMask | NSClosableWindowMask | NSMiniaturizableWindowMask | NSResizableWindowMask backing: NSBackingStoreBuffered defer: NO] autorelease];
        NSView* cv = [[[NSView alloc] initWithFrame: wdBox] autorelease];
        cv.wantsLayer = YES;
        [cv setLayerUsesCoreImageFilters: YES];
        theWindow.contentView = cv;
        [theWindow setCollectionBehavior: NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenPrimary];
        [theWindow setTitle: @"foo"];

        NSButton* mView = [[NSButton alloc] initWithFrame: NSMakeRect(10, 10, 100, 80)];
        [mView setLayerUsesCoreImageFilters: YES]; // *
        [mView setWantsLayer: YES]; // *
        mView.layer.masksToBounds = NO; // *
        [mView.layer setShadowColor: [NSColor.redColor CGColor]];
        [mView.layer setShadowOffset: CGSizeMake(4, 4)];
        [mView.layer setShadowRadius: 8];
        [mView.layer setShadowOpacity: 1.0];
        [mView setBezelStyle: NSRoundRectBezelStyle];
        [mView setTitle: @"bar"];
        [theWindow.contentView addSubview: mView];
        ==== UNSNIP! ====

        Expected Results:
        A window containing a pushbutton with a red shadow below it.

        Actual Results:
        The shadow draws, but is clipped to the NSView's bounds.

        Regression:
        This used to work in 10.8 and earlier. The issue is new since 10.9.0.

        Notes:
        Here's my Stackoverflow thread on the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20962005/why-is-my-layer-shadow-clipped-to-my-nsviews-rect/

        The workaround is to use the following code to create the button:

        ==== SNIP! ====
        @interface WILDButtonOwner : NSViewController

        @property (retain,nonatomic) IBOutlet NSButton* button;

        @end


        @implementation WILDButtonOwner

        @end
        ==== UNSNIP ====

        ==== SNIP2 ====
        WILDButtonOwner * mButtonOwner = [[WILDButtonOwner alloc] initWithNibName: @"WILDButtonOwner" bundle: nil];
        [mButtonOwner view];
        NSButton* mView = [mButtonOwner button];
        ==== UNSNIP2====

        And a WILDButtonOwner.xib containing a pushbutton (type is irrelevant, it seems, I can change it afterwards), whose button already has a shadow offset, blur radius and color set. The button created from the XIB doesn't clip its shadow.
