    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I add a search bar inside a view that is in turn nested inside a table view I get an unexpected UI effect where the search bar shrinks horizontally and the cancel button becomes unclickable. I am still able to type characters and search.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new empty application.\r\n2. In Builder create a navigation controller pointing to a table view.\r\n3. Create a view as a table header (above the Table Cell View).\r\n4. Drag a \"Search Bar and Search Display Controller\" into the view you just created.\r\n5. Run the application.\r\n6. Activate the search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Search bar should not shrink, and the cancel button should still be active and let me return to the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search bar shrinks horizontally and the cancel button becomes inactive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nBroken on both\r\niOS7 7.0.4\r\niOS7 7.1b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis always occurs in iOS7, not 6 in the simulator and on device.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TBLTableSearchExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
