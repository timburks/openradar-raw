    description: "Summary:\r\nThird party Quicklook plugins are not being called even though they have Valid Image UTIs in the Document Content Type  in their info.plist file.\r\n\r\nUsing for example public.image UTI, jpeg, Tiff, Png and so are not recognised by the plugins.  The only exception to this is .icn and .PSD images.\r\n\r\nAlso if you add the defined Image UTIs i.e public.jpeg, public.tiff and so on. These are also not recognised.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Xcode: \r\nAdd the public.image UTI to the Document Content Type  of the info.plist\r\n\r\nBuild the project.\r\n\r\nCopy the qlgenerator plugin to the users Quicklook directory. ( ~/Library/QuickLook/ )\r\n\r\nIn Terminal:\r\nRun the CLI : \r\n\r\n qlmanage -r \r\n\r\nTo reset the quicklookd so it picks up the plugin.\r\n\r\nIn Finder:\r\n\r\nSelect  Images of various Type and use the Space bar to invoke Quicklook\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy plugin embed the images in html. There are also some NSLogs used to debug.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting an image in finder and hitting the space bar. I expect the Quicklook Preview to open showing the image and the html. \r\nThere should also be  various NSLog output showing in Consol.app.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen selecting an image in finder and hitting the space bar.\r\n\r\nThe images do not have the HTML and appear to be using the native Quicklook qlgenerator for images.\r\n\r\nThe only exception is when using public.image UTI. Images of .icn and .PSD work as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\n\r\n  System Version:\tOS X 10.9.1 (13B42)\r\n  Kernel Version:\tDarwin 13.0.0\r\n  Boot Volume:\tMacintosh HD\r\n  Boot Mode:\tNormal\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI initially thought the problem was with changes to take the plugin from running on 10.8 and lower to 10.9. And sandboxing\r\n\r\nBut just discovered that the plugin gets called only on .icn and PSD files. \r\n\r\nWhich then led me to this  discussion https://github.com/Nyx0uf/qlImageSize/issues/4  where others are seeing the same problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis doe not occur on Macs running 10.8 and lower\r\n\r\nThis occurs on Macs Running 10.9.x\r\n\r\nAs an example on my:"
