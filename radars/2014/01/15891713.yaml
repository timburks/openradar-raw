    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a new bug at radar.apple.com, pressing the [esc] key goes back from the \"New Bug Reporter Problem\" page to the \"Select a product\" page. The current bug is not discarded, but that's not apparent in a world of webmail clients and wiki editors that throw away your text if you accidentally click the Back button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to bugreport.apple.com and sign in.\r\n2. Click the \"New\" button to file a new bug.\r\n3. Choose a category, for example, \"Bug Reporter\"\r\n4. Start typing.\r\n5. Type a weird word, and wait for the OS X autocorrect popup to appear, or do anything else that would lead you to:\r\n6. Press [esc] to dismiss the popup, because you really did want to spell it liek taht.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe spelling correction popup is dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popup is dismissed, but the page also changes so the text you were typing is gone, and you're back on the \"Select a product\" page. Your text is still there, and if you choose the same (or a different) category, you are returned to your bug. However, there is no indication that your text was saved, and the uninformed user might assume that the bug was discarded, lose all respect they ever had for Apple, never end up filing the bug, and go to live in a hermit cave made out of Nexus 7s.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 7.0.1 (9537.73.11)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would argue that [esc] should never navigate back in this case. It wouldn't be enough just to fix the spelling suggestion popup issue. It's too easy to hit esc accidentally if you're trying to dismiss some other popup, or if you're trying to hit F1 to change the screen brightness and you miss. It is slightly slower to go back if you pick the wrong category, but that is an edge case and I think the appearance of data loss would trump it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproducible in Safari and Chrome on Mac. Chrome doesn't show the OS X spelling suggestion popup, but [esc] still exits the current text editing view.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
