There should be an option to do so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, visit a site (such as www.forecast.io) that asks for your location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dialog box that appears will contain an option to always allow the given site access to your location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog box that appears has an option to remember this choice for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
