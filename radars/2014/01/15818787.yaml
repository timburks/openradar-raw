        Summary:
        As part of the UIPageViewControllerDelegate protocol, there is a pageViewController:willTransitionToViewControllers: method, but there isn't any didTransitionToViewControllers: method. Since the willTransition method doesn't ensure that the action completed, it adds needless complexity to things like updating the current page on a UIPageControl. It would be better to have a didTransition for this.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an object that conforms to the UIPageViewControllerDelegate protocol.

        Expected Results:
        1. The object gets a callback when the Page View Controller completes the transition to a new view controller.

        Actual Results:
        1. There is no callback for the didTransition state. Instead, we have to rely on the willTransition state.
