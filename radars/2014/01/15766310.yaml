    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Music.app used to have a way to select a chapter from an iTunes audiobook by tapping the cover and revealing a chapter list. That feature has been gone since iOS 7 Beta 1 and while support for audiobooks in general came back in 7.1 Beta 3, there is no way to select a specific chapter any more.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Transfer a AAC based Audiobook with iTunes (ending in .m4b if bought in the iTunes Store or .aax if bought from Audible)\r\n2. Open Music.app\r\n3. Go to the Audiobooks category\r\n4. Select the synced audiobook for playing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA toggle or gesture to reveal a chapter list should be made available. The player interface has a button which looks like it should contain a list of the current playing item, but instead of chapters it just shows a list with a single entry for the complete audiobook.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo option to select a chapter is given.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.1, iOS 7.1 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe player ui in general is far worse than it's last iteration, but there is no one to blame for that. I just hope it will regain that feature, I really miss it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny release of iOS 7 on any iPhone I had access to (iOS 7.0.1 on iPhone 5, iOS 7.1 Beta 3 on iPhone 5, iOS 7.0.1 on iPhone 5s)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
