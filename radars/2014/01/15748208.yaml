        Summary:
        When iPhone is connected to CarAudio Connect AUX with Bluetooth from Belkin and Siri is activated from the hardware button on the device, the siri sound plays but it does not accept audio. subsequent presses of the button will not restart music or activate siri again.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect Belkin CarAudio Connect AUX with Bluetooth to Aux. port on car stereo.
        2. Pair iPhone running 7.1 Beta 2 to the Belkin device.
        3. Play music over bluetooth.
        4. tap the Belkin hardware button to activate Siri.

        Expected Results:
        Music should pause and Siri should activate, allow me to speak commands and then return to music playback. Subsequent presses to the button should do the same.

        Actual Results:
        Music pauses and Siri beeps but takes no input is registered. The iPhone screen looks like a Siri command has completed but requires you to press the iPhone Home button to return to music playback.

        Regression:
        Under iOS 7.0, this issue was not present. Testing with another phone, running 7.0, the issue did not occur.

        Notes:
        Belkin is about to release a new version of this hardware. I do not know if this will address the issue with updated blutooth support.
