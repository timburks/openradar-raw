    description: "The lack of support for frameworks/dylibs on iOS has become the status quo, and has been and continues to be enormously limiting and costly to the iOS development ecosystem, as described here: http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/ios/Radar_15800975_iOS_Frameworks.20140112.html and in rdar://15800975\r\n \r\nNearly 7 years after the introduction of iOS, it well past time for Apple to prioritize closing the feature gap between iOS and Mac toolchains. A real framework solution plays a central role in how we as third-party developers can share and deliver common code."
