        Summary:
        OS X does not provide any interface or public means to configure which cipher suites are supported in OS X or its crypto stack.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Search for a prefPanel or defaults command to configure which cipher suites are supported to turn off insecure and weak ciphers and protocols.

        Expected Results:
        There should be a UI to configure supported cipher suites and protocols.

        Actual Results:
        There is no way for a user to configure this via GUI, preferences in Safari.app, Mail.app or any defaults command at all.

        Regression:
        This sadly has never been supported in OS X.

        Notes:
        The currently very fast progressing crypto scene gives us new knowledge about ciphers becoming insecure almost on a daily basis now. Yet there is no way to turn off now-known-to-be-insecure ciphers like RC4 in OS X to secure one's operating system from adversaries. This results in OS X becoming a very insure platform overall and no way to mitigate this situation for users or system administrators.
