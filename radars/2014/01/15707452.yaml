    description: "Summary:\r\nMail will refuse to synchronise despite new mail present in a gmail account after a number of days of continuous running.  This usually occurs after an overnight of inactivity from my iMac.  I have had this problem before the Mavericks Mail patch AND after Mavericks upgrade 10.9.1.\r\n\r\nPlease note after installation of the Mavericks upgrade the initial Mail Database upgrade/consistency failed (Mail.app beach balled).  Post Force-Quit and Mail restart the upgrade/consistency process never restarted.\r\n\r\nOnce out of sync you cannot force Mail to acquire the new mail - Only a restart of the app cures the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure Mail with gmail account I have an account of 2GB>\r\n2. Run Mail.app\r\n3. Periodically check gmail on iOS7 device for new mail and compare to see if they are in equality.\r\n4. Leave running on OSX overnight.  Note since 10.9.1 upgrade the frequency of occurance is less.  My last failure took 3 overnights before the devices went out of sync.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail on 10.9.1 should report the exact number of new mail that is reported on an iOS7 devices configured with the same GMAIL account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe count of new mail is not the same of a comparison iOS7 device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 7.1 (1827)\r\nOSX 10.9.1 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see note regarding Mail Database Update/Consistency check failure after 10.9.1 upgrade mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2012 iMac 27\" 3.2 GHz i5, 8 GB Ram."
