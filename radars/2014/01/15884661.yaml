    description: "When you right click on a drive and encrypt it until that process is completed the contextual menu in the finder will say \"Decrypting\" this is incorrect.\r\n\r\n1) Right click a drive in Finder that is not encrypted \r\n2) Click Encrypt\r\n3) Observe\r\n\r\nContextual menu should report appropriate and accurately what is happening.\r\n1) When a drive is Encrypting say that instead of erroneously reporting that it's decrypting\r\n2) Provide user with % complete for encryption. If this information is deemed to technical or complicated to convey in UI of Finder locate it in Disk Utility somewhere. Users should have a GUI way to locate this information and not need to resort to terminal to understand the progress of such a function."
