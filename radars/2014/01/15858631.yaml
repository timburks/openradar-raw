    description: "Summary:\r\nThe image slicing feature in Xcode 5 is fantastic: it allows devs to easily create buttons and other simple images that can size with the superview. It assumes a single middle area that needs to be sized, with the edges being added on the outside.\r\n\r\nThere are situations where the image slicing isn't useful. Imagine a background bar image with a chevron in the middle. I want the width of the bar to resize, but keep the middle chevron unchanged. To accomplish this, I'd like to create two sizing zones: one on each edge, while keeping the middle unchanged.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Xcode 5 assets manager, manage an image with a middle portion distinct from the outsides.\r\n2. Use the slicing tools to try to create a slicing region.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like the slicing tools to allow me to create multiple slice regions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can only create one slicing region.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5"
