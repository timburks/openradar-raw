    description: "Summary:\r\nUI testing using Automation is not possible for apps that show an alert immediately upon launch (e.g. an app that has a location services popup after fresh install). The Automation script never starts, since the \"target application is not frontmost.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app that has a location services popup immediately when the app is launched.\r\n2. Launch the app using Automation (e.g. Profile using Xcode).\r\n3. Create a new script (the default, \"var target = UIATarget.localTarget();\" is fine).\r\n4. Run the script.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script runs (i.e. the script is able to start and the alert is able to be clicked on).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script fails to start.\r\nLog Type: Fail\r\nLog Message: Could not start script, target application is not frontmost.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n1. Build the app.\r\n2. Launch in the Simulator.\r\n3. Wait.\r\n4. osascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to tell process \\\"iOS Simulator\\\" to click button \\\"OK\\\" of window 1\"\r\n5. Close the app.\r\n6. Run the Automation script.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo regression testing was performed, but this seems to be a problem that other people have faced in the past. This is the root cause of a bug in Appium (see https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/955).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks!"
