    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, it is useful to find all the places where a particular function is called in a particular way.  I can search for [myObject callMyFunctionWithParameter:@\"foo\"], but I can't set a breakpoint on each line of results without visiting each result.  If I could do so from the context menu of search results, I could work more quickly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search for a term in a workspace\r\n2. Select all the results\r\n3. Right-click\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe context menu would contain \"Add breakpoint\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe context menu does not contain \"Add breakpoint\""
