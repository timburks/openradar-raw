    description: "Summary:\r\nApp icons on the web version of the App Store have new corner radius (introduced in iOS 7), e.g.: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id778846279?ls=1&mt=8 However, the same icon in the iTunes Store (inside iTunes) has corner radius from iOS 6. Icons in the App Store on devices are correct.\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot (https://www.dropbox.com/s/n8ji78xva3k9yar/5609xgkv.png) on which the difference is easily visible."
