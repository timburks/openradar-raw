        Summary:
        A smart app banner is never showed again if it was dismissed once. Even Private browsing and "Settings > Safari > Clear Cookies and Data" don't fix this.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open any web page with a smart app banner. Dismiss the Smart Banner by tapping the x button. Reload the web page.

        Expected Results:
        The Smart Banner should reappear.

        Actual Results:
        It does not.

        Regression:
        Occurs on iPhone running iOS 7.1 beta 3. Does not occur on iPad 3 running iOS 7.0.4.
