    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a layer-backed standard NSBox control (dragged from the Interface Builder palette) on a document view of a document-based cocoa application, App Kit leaks memory whenever a document is opened and closed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Xcode 5 and create a new document-based cocoa application\r\n2. In Interface Builder, add a single NSBox to its document’s .xib by dragging one from the component palette onto the document view\r\n3. Still in Interface Builder, select the NSBox and open the View Effects Inspector by pressing ⌥⌘8. Set the appropriate checkbox (second from top) to make this NSBox have a core animation layer\r\n4. Profile the app with Instruments using the „Leaks“ template\r\n5. Create and destroy several instances of the document by pressing ⌘N and ⌘W respectively\r\n5. Inspect the resulting leaks in Instruments: after every close of a document among other leaks NSBox’ _updateBackgroundView leaks 640 bytes of memory.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere shouldn't be any memory leak.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments shows that there are memory leaks within AppKit and QuartzCore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1"
