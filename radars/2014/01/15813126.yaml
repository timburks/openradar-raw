    description: "Summary:\r\nI am trying to test the effects of NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication on my app's files when the app is launched in the background by performFetchWithCompletionHandler:\r\n\r\nIt is seemingly impossible to debug issues relating to this problem using Xcode, because Xcode refuses to launch an app when the device is locked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project in Xcode that supports background fetching.\r\n2. In your app's debug scheme, enable the \"Launch due to a background fetch event\" setting.\r\n3. Reboot your iOS device and connect to Xcode (do not unlock the device).\r\n4. Build & run your app on device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should launch in the background and the performFetchWithCompletionHandler: method should be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode refuses to launch the app because the device is locked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1b3 / Xcode Version 5.1 (5B71o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
