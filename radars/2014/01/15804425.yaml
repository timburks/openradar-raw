    description: "Summary:\n \nThe lack of support for frameworks/dylibs on iOS has become the status quo, and has been and continues to be enormously limiting and costly to the iOS development ecosystem, as described here: http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/ios/Radar_15800975_iOS_Frameworks.20140112.html and in rdar://15800975\n \nNearly 7 years after the introduction of iOS, it well past time for Apple to prioritize closing the feature gap between iOS and Mac toolchains. A real framework solution is plays a central role in how we as third-party developers can share and deliver common code.\n \nSteps to Reproduce:\n \nShip or consume 3rd party libraries on iOS.\n \nExpected Results:\n \nWe can leverage the long-standing functionality of dylibs and frameworks as exists on Mac OS X.\n \nActual Results:\n  \n- Anyone distributing libraries has had to adopt hackish workarounds to facilitate their use by other developers\n- Anyone shipping resources to be bundled with their library have had to adopt similar work-arounds.\n- Reproducibility and debugging information is lost, and common debug info can not be shared or managed by the library provider.\n- The limitations of Xcode and the need for multi-platform building for both iOS+Simulator (and often Mac OS X) forces developers to deploy technically incorrect complex solutions, such as lipo'ing together device and simulator binaries.\n- Standard static libraries do not support dylib linker features that are hugely useful when shipping and consuming libraries, such as two-level namespacing, LC_LOAD_DYLIB, etc."
