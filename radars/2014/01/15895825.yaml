    description: "Canceling an event on the iPad that a user has been invited to removes all instances of a recurring event rather than just one or prompting the user to make that decision. Using EKEventStore removeEvent:span:error with the span property set to EKSpanThisEvent to delete the event.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a recurring event on the calendar and invite the user of the iPad to the event.\r\n2. From the user's iPad, cancel that event using EKEventStore removeEvent:span:error.\r\n3. Open the user's calendar in the native calendar app; all instances of the event have been removed.\r\n4. The event still remains on the calendar that invited the attendee.\r\n\r\n#Expected Result:\r\niPad either only deletes the selected instance of the event, or prompts the user to decide whether or not to delete all instances.\r\n\r\n#Actual Result:\r\nAll instances of the recurring event are automatically deleted and removed from the user's calendar."
