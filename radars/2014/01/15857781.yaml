        Summary:
        Property attributes (get by objc runtime API) of overrided dynamic property is specified as dynamic.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Has 2 classes A and B. B is subclass of A. Class A is declare property named name.
        2. In the Class A implementation, declare property name as dynamic.
        3. In the Class B implementation, override the getter name.
        4. Obtains the property attributes via property_getAttributes API.

        Expected Results:
        Property name of Class A is specified as Dynamic but is not in Class B.

        Actual Results:
        Both classes is specified as dynamic.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        If I redeclare property name in Class B interface, the property_getAttributes would specified that property name of Class B is not dynamic.
