    description: "Summary:\r\nThe version of curl, and presumably libcurl, bundled with mavericks includes support for insecure ciphersuites in the ClientHello by default.  These ciphersuites provide no confidentiality of the communications used.\r\n\r\nIdeally the client will only support ciphersuites which provide confidentiality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. using howsmyssl.com, get a list of the ciphersuites provided in the ClientHello\r\n> curl https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check\r\n2. Check the resulting json for given_cipher_suites and insecure_cipher_suites\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ninsecure_cipher_suites should be empty, and the given_cipher_suites list should only contain ciphersuites that provide confidentiality and integrity protection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe cipher suites actually include:\r\n\r\n        \"TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384\",\r\n        \"TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256\",\r\n        \"TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA\",\r\n        \"TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256\"\r\n\r\nThe NULL ciphersuite shouldn't be included by default.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nappears to occur on all computers I have access to which run mavericks\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
