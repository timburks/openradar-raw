    description: "I have an 802.1x mobile profile that works correctly under 10.8.5, that does not work correctly under 10.9.1. Under 10.8.5, the login screen shows a drop down menu for selecting the proper access point and displays the yellow light (\"Network access requires login.\") and I am able to login with network credentials (LDAP/krb5). Under 10.9 the login screen shows no drop down menu and network credentials are not accepted, but 802.1x is configured correctly in the network WIFI panel.\r\n\r\n1/23/14: Resolved.\r\n\r\nI made two simultaneous changes, at this time I'm not sure which one finally allowed the profile to work:\r\n1. Changed the encryption type to \"Any\", from \"WPA/WPA2-Enterprise\". Although the field in Apple Configurator says \"Any (Enterprise)\"\r\n2. Manually edited the SetupModes section to include \"Loginwindow\" in addition to \"System\"\r\n'University of Utah 802.1x Setup v0.2a.mobileconfig' was successfully uploaded."
