    description: "Summary:\r\nThe method `popViewControllerAnimated:` removes to top most view controller on the navigation stack. But there is currently no way to get notified when the pop animation is done.\r\n\r\nThe method `dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:` to dismiss a view controller already provides a completion block which is nice.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect a method like `popViewControllerAnimated:completion:` which would be very useful in general.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently I have to workaround this problem by implementing this kind of method for myself.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 SDK and previous."
