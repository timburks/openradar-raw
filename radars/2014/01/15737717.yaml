    description: "Summary:\r\nThe screenshot of an app and the animation that occurs when switching out of an app can get stuck, while closing the app with the four finger gesture and swiping at the same time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch an app, start closing the app with the four finger gesture and scroll the UI, while doing it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI shouldn't scroll, the app should close, the screenshot should go away and the closing animation should complete fully, giving control back to the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screenshot of the app that's being closed stays on screen, the closing animation gets stuck and the user can't interact with the device.\r\nPressing the home button sometimes gets the user out of this situation, though sometimes a reset is required.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe issue occurs on all iPads that support iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA video of the issue can be found at - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ev8X43S7k"
