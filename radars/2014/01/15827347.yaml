    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the dynamicAnimator to which a UIGravityBehavior is attached has been deallocated, and the gravity's angle value is change, a crash occurs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a dynamic animator and attach a UIGravity Behavior (do not attach to properties or ivars)\r\n2. With a dispatch_after block, modify the angle of the gravity behavior (ensuring a weak reference to the gravity behavior is not used)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe modified value should have no effect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA crash occurs -- the gravity behavior attempts to modify a value on it's currently bad pointer to it's dynamicAnimator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS SDK 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://github.com/jerryhjones/BadGravity"
