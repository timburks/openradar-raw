    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you select a cell in Numbers '13 (Mac) you'll be able to see the full content of that cell in that kind of bar on the bottom of the window. It would be very cool if you made it possible to edit the cell there (now you need ti double-click the cell itself and you get that little overlay-window to edit what you want the cell to do)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a cell\r\n2. click on the bottom bar\r\n3. edit the text (formulas etc.)\r\n4. press enter to confirm\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bar/text field should switch to a write-mode for letting the user edit the cell\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text-field is read-only and you need to use that overlay window next to the cell (after double-click) to edit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niWork Numbers version 3.0 (1470) & Mac OS 10.9, iMac late 2009"
