    description: "* SUMMARY \r\nWhen popping up a Dock menu by holding down the mouse button, it's possible to type-select, unlike with other menus. Once you do this, the menu appears to change modes, such that you can no longer select with the mouse or dismiss the menu by releasing the mouse button.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE \r\n1. Click and hold down on one of the application icons in the Dock.\r\n2. Continue to hold down the mouse button while typing a letter.\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nExpected: Both mouse and keyboard selection is available without releasing the mouse button.  Releasing the mouse button or pressing return causes the selected item to be highlighted. Keyboard selection takes priority until the mouse is moved, just as in menubar menus.\r\n\r\nActual: Once the keyboard is used, mouse movement within the menu does not highlight items until the mouse button is released and the mouse reenters the menu. The menu cannot be dismissed by releasing the mouse button, as expected; you must click elsewhere subsequently.\r\n\r\n[Modern note: This bug still exists in 10.9.1 â€” discovered it in another developer account I didn't use much.]"
