    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you search for \"expedited\" on the developer site, the search results are misleading.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to developer.apple.com.\r\n2. Click on the search box at the upper right.\r\n3. Type \"expedited\" (no quotes).\r\n4. Press Return.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first search result is a page describing how to submit an expedited App Store review.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first search result's title is \"Sign in with your Apple ID\", which at first pass looks like a help document about signing in to the dev center. However, if you click it, you find that the actual page title is \"Contact the App Review Team\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 7.0.1 (9537.73.11)\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B3116)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like your search indexer may not have gotten past the login page when trying to index the app review team contact page.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
