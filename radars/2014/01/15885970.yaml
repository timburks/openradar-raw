    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “next keyboard“ button on the Emoji keyboard is located in the lower left corner, but on the English or German iOS keyboard the \"123\" button is located at this point and the \"next keyboard\" button moved to the right of it (I don't know if the location of the \"next keyboard\" button differs on any other than the Emoji keyboard, but I guess most of us use that one often enough to get confused). This behavior leads to unwanted touches of the \"123\" keyboard, especially because the button switches to the last or most recently used keyboard and thus the order of the keyboards changes and you can only guess if the Emoji or another keyboard is going to show up. As this button is in need on every iOS keyboard, it should stay at the same point to provide maximum usability.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse minimum one standard and the Emoji keyboard.\r\nChange the keyboards with the \"next keyboard\" button in the lower left corner. \r\nGet confused when you want to change the keyboard back and the button moved to the right of the \"123\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like the \"next keyboard\" button to stay in place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"next keyboard\" button moves to the right of the \"123\" button on the Emoji keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7"
