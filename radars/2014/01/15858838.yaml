    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven files or folders names with the unicode code points U+2160 to U+2188 (for roman numerals, e.g. stuff like these: Ⅷ Ⅻ) these are not sorted by their numerical value but lexicographic by lexicographic value in decomposed form. This seems wrong. \r\n\r\nThe Finder has a pretty good sorting algorithm for digit-based numbers. It should be expanded to cover roman numerals (composed and decomposed) and maybe other characters which have a numeric value in the unicode database.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make twelve files.\r\n2. Name them each with one of the following chars: Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ, Ⅷ, Ⅸ, Ⅹ, Ⅺ, Ⅻ\r\n3. Sort the Finder window ”by name“\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsort order: Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ, Ⅷ, Ⅸ, Ⅹ, Ⅺ, Ⅻ\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsort order: Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅸ, Ⅴ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ, Ⅷ, Ⅹ, Ⅺ, Ⅻ\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor additional glory try to attach a numeric value to decomposed notation of roman numerals in basic latin, e.g. XXIV."
