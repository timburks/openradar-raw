    description: "I've installed Xcode 4.6.3 on OS X 10.9.1 alongside with Xcode 5. To differentiate the two, I renamed the old \"Xcode\" to \"Xcode 4.6.3\". Everything works fine in the app except uploading a binary to iTunes Connect. This fails with the not very informative error message \"An error occurred uploading to the iTunes Store\". The same problem occurs when using Application Loader to upload the binary.\r\n\r\nWhen replacing the space in the app name (\"Xcode-4.6.3\") the upload works just fine."
