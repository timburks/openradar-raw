    description: "Dear Apple, I want to join the Fix Radar or GTFO campaing without the attitude, so I ask for the following enhacements for Bug Reporter:\r\n\r\n- Let us file radars from Xcode to reduce the context switch needed to file a bug. Add a Radar tab to the organiser and let us quickly search and view existing radars. Save our login details —or let us login with our certificate— so we don't have to login each and every time. Provide us with a nicely laid out form for filing new radars. If a report needs a system profile attaching then automatically generate one and send it if we don't include one ourselves. Let us drag and drop attachments onto the report. Add a checkbox to let us include the current Xcode project as an attachment. And let us save reports as drafts. This way we can make a note of all bugs and feature requests when we think of them, but properly file them when we get the time.\r\n\r\n- Open up Radar. What we want is the ability to click a checkbox on our own radars that says \"make this searchable and viewable by other 3rd party developers\". Many of the radars we file don't include anything that cannot be shared with other developers. At worst they contain information about pre-release software, but you already provide ways to deal with that in things such as the developer forums, so it is a solvable problem. Along with this checkbox, let us browse and search these opened up radars to see if one already exists.\r\n\r\n- Provide upvote and comment mechanism for open radars. We spend a lot of time filing radars that are just marked as duplicates and we hear nothing more. We are doing duplicate work. On top of this you have to spend a lot of time going through these radars, reading them and seeing if they're duplicates of other radars. So let us find the duplicates by searching and let us just press a button to +1 an issue and say \"this is important to me as well\". This saves time for everyone and so makes it easy for us to tell you what is really important to us. By letting us comment on each other's radars, we can expand upon what is already there rather than duplicating work. We can provide workarounds that enable us to keep writing our apps while you work on a fix.\r\n\r\nSo please fix Radar. You've worked hard to give us great APIs, a great language, great documentation and great developer tools. Please allocate some resources to giving us a great tool to help us help you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open https://bugreport.apple.com\r\n2) Try to file a bug\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to provide contextual information from the system software and the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way (other than copy and pasting) to provide contextual information from the system software and the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll builds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll platforms.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
