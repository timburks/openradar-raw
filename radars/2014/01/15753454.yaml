        Summary:

        When opening App1 workspace that references LibA project, the LibA scheme is modified to reference App1 workspace. This is a problem, as LibA is used in multiple workspaces, and having such references is against the logic of subproject/workspace architecture + it causes some other versioning issues.

        Please see attached screenshot of the diff from our SCM to better understand the issue.
