    description: "Summary:\r\nUIActionSheet as of iOS 7.0 and through 7.1 has an unstable and unusable UIActionSheet for any sheets representing more than 20 options such as a list of years. When more than 20 options are supplied, two UITableViews are created resulting in a ghosting effect as one scrolls the top table, the bottom table stays where it is producing a confusing appearance for the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIActionSheet with more  than 20 options.\r\n2. Present a UIActionSheet.\r\n3. Attempt to scroll.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIActionSheet should handle any amount of options as previous versions of iOS. When one scrolls, it should be a fluid, single UIScrollView or UITableView not multiples and certainly not with ghosting presented to the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIActionSheet can't handle more than 20 options as of iOS 7.0 and through 7.1. When one scrolls, it is a janky mess of multiple UITableViews and ghosting presented to the user. Getting pissed off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem in iOS versions 1.0 through 6.1.5. It became a problem as of iOS 7.0 and continues through iOS 7.1 beta 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA terrible work around floating on the internet is to loop through UIActionSheet subviews and set their backgrounds to white. This is dangerous and fragile. Workarounds should be avoided and Apple should fix this crucial bug.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/19025852/xcode-ipad-uiactionsheet-with-many-buttons-do-not-correctly-displayed-ios7"
