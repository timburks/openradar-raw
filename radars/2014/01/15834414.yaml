        Summary:
        The UIDocument documentation refers to a method in NSFileManager, setMobileSynchEnabled:forItemAtURL:destinationDirectory:replacementURL:error:, which does not exist

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the UIDocument documentation and go to the section about initWithFileURL:. Read the Discussion section. The last bit mentions this:
        "In the completion handler, if you want the document to be automatically synced with other devices and computers on which the application is installed, you should call the NSFileManager method setMobileSynchEnabled:forItemAtURL:destinationDirectory:replacementURL:error:."
        Then look up the NSFileManager documentation, or header file, and discover that no such message exists.

        Expected Results:
        The documentation should be accurate and complete.

        (Ha! I hope you got a good chuckle out of that one.)

        Actual Results:
        NSFileManager has no method setMobileSynchEnabled:forItemAtURL:destinationDirectory:replacementURL:error:.

        Regression:
        No such method exists in the deprecated methods section.

        Notes:
        The documentation at this point seems to be trying to describe what you should do if you want to place a document in iCloud right away. Can the file URL start out as one in the Ubiquity container, or does it need to be local first and then moved to the Ubiquity container with the NSFileManager method setUbiquitous:itemAtURL:destinationURL:error:? My tests seem to indicate it's OK to start in iCloud.
