    description: "Summary:\r\n“Toggle Slow Animations” is super useful in the iOS simulator, but it only applies to UIView-based animations. It should also affect CAAnimations applied directly to CALayers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project in Xcode.\r\n2. Run the project in the iPhone simulator.\r\n3. Press the Animate button. Note that the red and blue squares move at the same speed.\r\n4. Type Command-T to toggle slow animations.\r\n5. Press the Animate button again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth squares move at the same reduced speed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe red square, which uses UIView-based animations, slows down, but the blue square, which uses a CABasicAnimation, does not slow down.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is possible to enable app-wide slow animations, regardless of how they are animated, by pausing the app and running this command in the debugger:\r\n\r\np [(CALayer *)[[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] windows] objectAtIndex:0] layer] setSpeed:.1f]\r\n\r\nSource: http://gavrix.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/how-to-toggle-slow-animations-on-device/\r\n\r\nThis should be possible from the UI.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/TdwF"
