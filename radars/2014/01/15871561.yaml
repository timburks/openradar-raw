    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder Xcode, as part of building a project that contains .xib files, ibtool will crash with exit code 255.\r\n\r\nAlso the crash doesn't seem to be related to a specific xib file since triggering a subsequent build on the same project, has the likelihood of succeeding.\r\n\r\nHave attached the related crash files in case they shed some light.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEven though I have an Xcode project I haven't been able to isolate the issue and make it reproducible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo gracefully handle the exception and provide a compiler error with a possible fix.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCommand /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/ibtool failed with exit code 255--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2\r\nBuild version 5A3005\r\n\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B42)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReference\r\nhttps://twitter.com/cjwl/status/408264053035786241\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ibtoold_2014-01-16-101424_akropolis.crash' and 'Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool_2014-01-16-101418_akropolis.crash' were successfully uploaded."
