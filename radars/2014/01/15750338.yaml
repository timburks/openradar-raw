    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile refactoring an existing class or building new functionality into an application in a test-driven style, running a script to monitor the file system for changes and re-run the test suite in the background gives a developer a steady update of the state of the existing behaviors in the app and whether breakages have occurred during development. However, when a test suite becomes large and requires more than a second or two to run, using a more focused script for running individual tests reduces the amount of lag between feedback cycles when tests break.\r\n\r\nCurrent development tools have partial support for this functionality:\r\n\r\n* Xcode can run individual tests from Test Navigator context menu, but is not easily automated to run tests as files change.\r\n\r\n* The xcodebuild binary has the ability to run a project's tests, but only the entire suite at once.\r\n\r\n* The otest and xctest binaries support specifying an individual test as a command-line argument like \"-test <TestCaseClassName/testMethodName>\", but do not automatically have the proper library and framework paths configured as needed like xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n\r\nAdd a \"-testScope\" option to xcodebuild, which can then be passed to otest and xctest to run an individual test class or test method. Tests could then be run like:\r\n\r\n    xcodebuild -testScope \"MappingsTests/testSupportsManyToMany\" test\r\n\r\nand output the results of running a single test, or preferably also support:\r\n\r\n    xcodebuild -testScope \"MappingsTests\" test\r\n\r\nwhich would run all of the tests in the MappingsTests class.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun \"xcodebuild -testScope <TestCaseClassName/testMethodName> test\" from a terminal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the specified test class is run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpecifying an individual test class is not supported.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
