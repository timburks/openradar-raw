    description: "iOS stores bonding data for Core Bluetooth (CoreBluetooth) peripherals, which can be seen by devices in Bluetooth settings with an (i) next to them. This Radar requests an API to query whether iOS has bonding data, and whether the current connection is encrypted.\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround it to switch on certain CBATTErrors; when requesting a secure characteristic from a peripheral and iOS has bonding data but the peripheral does not (so connection isnâ€™t encrypted), the error is CBATTErrorUnlikelyError (but this can occur in some other scenarios too). In this case, to re-establish a bond, the user must go manually to Bluetooth settings and forget the device before the application tries accessing the secure characteristic again."
