    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OS X 10.9, the thumbnails from the Contacts app (stored in /private/var/folders/[random characters]/[random characters]/C/com.apple.AddressBook/com.apple.AddressBook.thumbnailcache) have accumulated over time until they were eating 30 GB of space on my main system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe system install needs to be several months old, presumably with a populated address book (with contact icons).  I have contact syncing turned on with Facebook and iCloud, but am unsure if that's related.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Contacts app should use no more space than is necessary for caching address book thumbnails.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Contacts app is using 30 GB on my boot drive for caching address book thumbnails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://rad.consol3.com/how-to-fix-address-book-thumbnails-filling-up-system-drive-in-osx\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/24179680#24179680\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
