    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm seeing an excessive memory usage (in All Anonymous VM > VM: CoreAnimation category) of UITextView under iOS 7.0.4 and 7.1beta3. For example when the 774 KB text file (http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/98/pg98.txt) is loaded into the text view and the app is run only 6 MBs are allocated at the beginning. When scrolling, memory consumption keeps growing. When the end of the document is reached, around 800 MBs (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2u540r0b7rupkp/bug_report_text_view_memory.png) are allocated by VM:CoreAnimation.\r\nOn the iPhone 4 the text starts disappearing (the background is still visible) when about 70% progress is reached and then the application crashes. iOS doesn't send the low memory notification in this situation.\r\n\r\nI know that loading such a large string into UITextView is uncommon, however it's useful as an example of this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Single View Application, add a text view and load the text from the large file, e.g. the one I linked above OR use the project I attached to this bug report\r\n2. Profile the app with Allocations template\r\n3. Check \"All Heap & Anonymous VM\" in \"Allocation Type\"\r\n4. Scroll the text view and observe the growth of memory consumption\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMemory usage shouldn't grow so rapidly. iOS should send the low memory notification. The app shouldn't crash. When the same file: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/98/pg98.txt is opened in Safari everything works fine, so the performance of the native view is worse than the web view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMemory consumption grows continuously while scrolling, causing the app to crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 & iOS 7.1b3"
