    description: "Summary:\r\nOS X doesn't appear to include DisplayPort 1.2 drivers, preventing MST compatibility with the new crop of 4K displays.\r\n\r\nThunderbolt 2 includes the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, and 60Hz is supported in Windows 8.1 at 3840x2160 resolution, so this should also be supported in OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a Dell UP2414Q monitor to a 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro using a DisplayPort 1.2 cable, and select the highest supported resolution, 3840x2160, in System Preferences > Displays.\r\n2. In the monitor's settings, select \"Display Settings\", then enable \"DisplayPort 1.2.\"\r\n3. On the connected UP2414Q, observe the compatible refresh rates in System Preferences > Displays.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n60 Hertz should be an option for the connected UP2414Q monitor at 3840 x 2160 resolution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe fastest available refresh rate is 30.3 Hertz, which results in no video signal being displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n4K support in OS X is currently lackluster at best.  Please refer to this article on Anandtech for more information.  http://www.anandtech.com/show/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013/11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis configuration requires a DisplayPort 1.2 cable, a Dell UP2414Q display, and a 2013 15\" Retina MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
