    description: "We use svn for version control. Recently, i changed a SVN property of a folder via command line. Xcode is able to detect this and marks this folder with a big \"M\" as modified. But there is no way to diff between the local revision and the server revision to see, what changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- check out an existing SVN repository via Xcode\r\n- open your favorite command line tool and navigate into your local copy of the repository\r\n- change a svn property e.g. use \"svn propedit svn:ignore .\" and add the folder \"foo\" to ignore list by typing \"foo\" and saving the editor.\r\n- go back to Xcode and hit \"Commit\" in the \"Source Control\"-Menu.\r\n- the folder with the changed property will be marked with a \"M\" as modified.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you click the folder, there should be a diff of the changed properties on the right, like a usual source file has.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf you click the folder with the changed property, nothing happens"
