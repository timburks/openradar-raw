    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are some occasions where wifi networks are unsuitable for background downloads and it would be useful if background network activity could be controlled/and or restricted like when using cellular data.\r\n\r\nA common example is a quota restricted hotel connection, another example is a mifi device which appears as a wifi network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go on vacation to a foreign country without cellular data\r\n2. Connect to your quota-restricted hotel connection \r\n3. Sleep for the night\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n I should be able to mark the connection as indelible for background transfers because I know my quota is limited.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the bandwidth quota available has been used downloading podcasts which I would've been happy to wait for and I can't get the information about my next days activities which i'd prefer to use the bandwidth for."
