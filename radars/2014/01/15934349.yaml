    description: "I've a dual display setup with a retina MacBook Pro and an external non-retina display attached to it. The non-retina screen is configured as the main screen (with the main menu bar).\r\n\r\nWhen I focus a Finder window on the retina screen and launch the Time Machine UI, the retina window is displayed in double size on the non-retina display within the Time Machine UI."
