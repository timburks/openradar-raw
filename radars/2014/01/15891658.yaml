    description: "Summary:\r\nIn my workflow, I render all graphical assets out of a single PSD using Adobe Generator. If I have made a large change, I have to then take each pair of 1x/2x pngs and move them to the correct .xcasset subfolder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an app.\r\n2. Get a sweet designer to make some awesome graphics. Since they're hip and with it, they use Adobe Generator to automatically export all assets from a single PSD at once.\r\n3. ???\r\n4. Profit.\r\n5. Declining profits.\r\n6. Decide you need a visual refresh.\r\n7. Open the original PSD in Photoshop and make some sweeping changes. Every single asset in the app will need to be overwritten with the one from Photoshop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a simple process to replace every element of an asset catalog with a new file of the same name (and likely the same metrics).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to either grab every 1x/2x pair of pngs, find the appropriate element in the catalog, and replace the existing images one or two at a time. One could possibly write a script, but it's infrequent enough that each developer writing his or her own script just won't be worth the time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
