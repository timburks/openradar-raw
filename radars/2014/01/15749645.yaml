    description: "STR:\r\n- Turn off \"enable source control\" in Xcode's Preferences (Source Control pane)\r\n- Choose a source file in the sidebar (in my case one with a \".m\" suffix)\r\n- Click its name to edit it and change its suffix (in my case, I changed it to \".cpp\")\r\n- Now edit the file's contents and save.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- The change should be saved in the file, all is well in the world.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nError message 'The document “WILDHostCommands.cpp” could not be saved. The file has been changed by another application.' Clicking \"Save Anyway\" saves it anyway, but there is *no other application*. It's Xcode's left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing."
