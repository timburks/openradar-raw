Set wallpaper to one of several bright/multicolored ones included in iOS 7.\r\n2. Receive a notification\r\n3. Begin swipe on the \"slide to unlock\" UI.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBlur should remain as it appeared initially.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlur becomes very bright, adding a jarring \"glow\" effect to the control.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BesknrFIcAAq8rJ.png-large.png' was successfully uploaded."
