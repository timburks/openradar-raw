    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a local notification in the lockscreen on iOS7 with a sound playing, there is no way to stop the sound from playing.\r\nUsing cancelLocalNotification: or cancelAllNotifications: won't stop the sound.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Start you app and lock the screen\r\n* Ask iOS to present a local notification while the app is in background and the screen is locked:\r\n\r\n    data->notification = [[UILocalNotification alloc] init];\r\n\t\t\t\tif (data->notification) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdata->notification.repeatInterval = 0;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdata->notification.alertBody =[NSString  stringWithFormat:NSLocalizedString(@\"IC_MSG\",nil), address];\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdata->notification.alertAction = NSLocalizedString(@\"Answer\", nil);\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdata->notification.soundName = @\"ring.caf\";\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdata->notification.userInfo = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:callId forKey:@\"callId\"];\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[[UIApplication sharedApplication] presentLocalNotificationNow:data->notification];\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the user slides on the notification, he is led to the application screen, and the notification sound is stopped\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the user slides on the notification, he is led to the application screen, but the notification sound continues to play. No call to either cancelLocalNotification or cancelAllNotifications will stop the sound.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere seems to be a workaround for *remote* notifications (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19124882/stopping-ios-7-remote-notification-sound?lq=1 ) but it doesn't seem to be working for local notifications.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini and iPhone 5S\r\n\r\nNote: I can reproduce the issue only when the device doesn't have a code for unlocking. If you have a code, sliding the notification leads you to the code prompt, which seems to cancel the sound."
