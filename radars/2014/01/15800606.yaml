    description: "Recent revelations about NSA bulk surveillance have made it clear that the future of email will include robust, easy-to-use encryption with no means for intermediaries (ie. mail providers, governments) to intercept content.\r\n\r\nAny mail client that does not support this is not suitable for modern security threats by rogue surveillance states.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, it would be highly beneficial for Apple to implement OpenPGP support into Apple Mail, both on the desktop and on iOS.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openpgp.org/about_openpgp/\r\n\r\nNote that there is a free/open-source Mail plug-in implementation that achieves this for the most part. However, Apple could greatly improve uptake and overall Internet security by implementing an easy-to-use built-in implementation.\r\n\r\nhttps://gpgtools.org/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Mail on OS X.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Mail supporting a user-friendly OpenPGP implementation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Lack of built-in OpenPGP support.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail v7.0 (1822) on OS X 10.9\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny version of Mail under OS X. Currently seen using Mail under OS X 10.9 on a 2012 MacBook Pro Retina."
