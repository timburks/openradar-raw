        Summary:
        Cannot get number of weeks in month with -[NSCalendar rangeOfUnit:inUnit:forDate:] with NSCalendarUnitWeekOfMonth unit

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Trying to get number of week in this month with
        - [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] rangeOfUnit:NSCalendarUnitWeekOfMonth inUnit:NSCalendarUnitMonth forDate:[NSDate date]] API
        PS. [NSDate date] is Jan 16 2014

        Expected Results:
        Return (NSRange) { 1, 5 }

        Actual Results:
        Return (NSRange) { NSNotFound, NSNotfound}

        Regression:
        If I use deprecated NSWeekCalendar enum, it will return the expected results.

        Notes:
        If I try to the the number of week in next month, the NSWeekCalendar will return { 5, 5 } which is the expected results too.
        The NSWeekCalendar enum is deprecated and the documentation said we should used NSCalendarUnitWeekOfMonth or NSCalendarUnitWeekOfYear which don't work for this case.
