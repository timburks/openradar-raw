    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be really helpful, if Xcode were able to auto-create stubs for methods of a delegate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Object Class and let use a Delegate in the <>-Part.\r\n2. Xcode detects, that some of the delegate-Methods are missing and throws some warnings lige \"Method 'methodname' in protocol not implemented.\" and \"Required for direct or indirect protocol 'protocolname'. So Xcode knows, what es wrong with the class.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking the warning should also provide something like \"create method stub for this missing method\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking the warning takes me to the place with the <delegatename> in the header file. Of course, this is helpful, but no more help is provided.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2"
