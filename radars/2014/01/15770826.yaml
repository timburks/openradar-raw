        Summary:
        Creating an NSTextField in code and giving its layer a shadow causes the shadow to disappear as soon as the text field gains keyboard focus. Creating an NSTextField that has a shadow from a XIB and then changing its attributes works fine and causes the shadow to remain even when focused.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the following code in a Cocoa application:
        ==== SNIP! ====
        NSRect          wdBox = NSMakeRect(0,0,100,100);
        NSWindow    *   theWindow = [[[NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRect: wdBox styleMask: NSTitledWindowMask | NSClosableWindowMask | NSMiniaturizableWindowMask | NSResizableWindowMask backing: NSBackingStoreBuffered defer: NO] autorelease];
        NSView* cv = [[[NSView alloc] initWithFrame: wdBox] autorelease];
        cv.wantsLayer = YES;
        [cv setLayerUsesCoreImageFilters: YES];
        theWindow.contentView = cv;
        [theWindow setCollectionBehavior: NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenPrimary];
        [theWindow setTitle: @"foo"];

        NSTextField* mView = [[NSTextField alloc] initWithFrame: NSMakeRect(10, 10, 100, 80)];
        [mView setLayerUsesCoreImageFilters: YES]; // *
        [mView setWantsLayer: YES]; // *
        mView.layer.masksToBounds = NO; // *
        [mView.layer setShadowColor: [NSColor.redColor CGColor]];
        [mView.layer setShadowOffset: CGSizeMake(4, 4)];
        [mView.layer setShadowRadius: 8];
        [mView.layer setShadowOpacity: 1.0];
        [mView setStringValue: @"bar"];
        [theWindow.contentView addSubview: mView];
        ==== UNSNIP! ====

        Hit tab or click to get keyboard focus in that field.

        Expected Results:
        A window containing a pushbutton with a red shadow below it.

        Actual Results:
        The shadow draws, but as soon as the field gains focus, it disappears. Tabbing back out of the field doesn't restore the shadow.

        Regression:
        This used to work in 10.8 and earlier. The issue is new since 10.9.0.

        Notes:
        Here's my Stackoverflow thread on the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20962005/why-is-my-layer-shadow-clipped-to-my-nsviews-rect/

        The workaround is to use the following code to create the field:

        ==== SNIP! ====
        @interface WILDButtonOwner : NSViewController

        @property (retain,nonatomic) IBOutlet NSTextField* textField;

        @end


        @implementation WILDButtonOwner

        @end
        ==== UNSNIP ====

        ==== SNIP2 ====
        WILDButtonOwner * mButtonOwner = [[WILDButtonOwner alloc] initWithNibName: @"WILDButtonOwner" bundle: nil];
        [mButtonOwner view];
        NSTextField* mView = [mButtonOwner textField];
        ==== UNSNIP2====

        And a WILDButtonOwner.xib containing an NSTextField that already has a shadow offset, blur radius and color set. The field created from the XIB doesn't lose its shadow.

        This bug may be related to rdar://15770532, but filing separately since it may be a similar fix in several places.
