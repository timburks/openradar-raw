    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a Pobox Mailstore account, which uses a standard IMAP implementation for mail. I also have a *lot* of IMAP folders, and server-side filters set up to deliver mail to them (from mail lists and whatnot). As I go through a folder and delete messages, they disappear quickly, but the unread badge over the folder may or may not change. If it doesn't, and I change folders and change back, I will see many or all of the messages I just deleted still in the folder. Usually they disappear after a while, but even if it's taking a while in the background, it should appear immediate in the UI, I think.\r\n\r\nThis has always happened, frankly, but has become much worse on Mavericks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Browse to an IMAP folder with unread mail\r\n2. Delete some or all of the messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The unread badge on the folder should immediately drop to zero\r\n2. Switching to another folder and back, deleted messages should not be listed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The unread badge on the folder may not change, or decrement slowly\r\n2. Switching to another folder and back, deleted messages will appear to still be present\r\n3. Messages will eventually be gone, but it could take many minutes (I have not timed it)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 7.0 (1822), Mac OS X 10.9 Build 13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens with my IMAP folders on Mavericks.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
