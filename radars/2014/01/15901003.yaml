        Summary:
        Cannot view/edit view that is in placeholder section (not in the controller view)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Place the ViewController object in the canvas.
        2. Add UIView to ViewController as the placeholder object
        3. Try to edit/view that added view in canvas.


        Expected Results:
        Interface Builder provide some way to view/edit the placeholder views in canvas. (temporally appeared in the canvas, etc.)

        Actual Results:
        We can't view/edit the placeholder views

        Regression:
        IIRC, we can view/edit placeholder views in Xcode 4
