    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is an important feature for me, because I need to constantly have my Mac read to me as I'm writing. It still works fine in MS Word and Pages 4.3, but has been broken since Pages 5 was released, and hasn't been fixed in any of the updates. You *can* make a work-around by clicking on EDIT -> Speech -> Speak Selection, but that's a bunch of menus and a real pain when I regularly speak-selection after every paragraph, to make sure there is flow. Why is it that I can listen to text in every application, except for Pages 5.1?!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPre-requesite: Make sure you have a Text-to-Speech shortcut set up in System Preferences -> Dictation and Speech -> Text to Speech -> Speak selected text when the key is pressed. (I use CMD+/, but have also used CTRL+OPT+CMD+/) 1. CMD-A to select all text in document. 2. Execute keyboard shortcut for \"speak selection.\" 3. Hear the \"error\" sound.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to hear the words read to me, like I could in Pages 4.3 and every other App on the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError sound.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPages 5.1, OSX 10.9.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a rather simple issue, which should also probably have a simple fix, but is keeping me from using the software since it's mission-critical for me. It might apply to Numbers and Keynote, but I haven't tried...\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-01-24 at 2.13.31 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
