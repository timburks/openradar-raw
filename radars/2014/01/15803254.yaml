    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a custom delegate of interactivePopGestureRecognizer is used, buttons tapped close to the left side of the screen (x coordinate from 0 to about 55) don't receive UIControlEventTouchDown. It causes them to not transition to a highlighted state. They only go to the highlighted state if a user taps and then slightly moves his finger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UINavigationController stack with one view controller and set a custom delegate in it, e.g. (it's a simplification, but it works as an example):\r\n   self.navigationController.interactivePopGestureRecognizer.delegate = self;\r\n2. Push another view controller on the stack\r\n3. Try to tap \"< Back\" button close to the left bezel of the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Back\" button should receive UIControlEventTouchDown and change its state to highlighted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Back\" button doesn't change its state to highlighted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.4 and 7.1 beta 3"
