    description: "Summary:\r\nOn Retina screens it can be desirable to have a view with fractional size (for hairlines etc). You can achieve this in Interface Builder by setting a constraint on the view with a fractional constant. However, IB does not support fractional values for frames, so you get a Misplaced View warning that you cannot fix.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a constraint to a view with a fractional constant (e.g. 0.5)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe frame of the view in IB should be allowed to be the same as the constraint.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a warning about the misplaced view that the Fix function does not fix, because IB does not support fractional values for frames.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 5.0.2"
