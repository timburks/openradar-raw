        Summary:
        When using UIPageViewController with the built in UIPageControl, the internal scroll view is resized to accommodate the page control at the bottom of the view. This isn't actually desirable in some situations. Many people would rather have the subview frames remain untouched, and let the page control float on top of the content. The current solution to this would be to manage your own instance of UIPageControl and hook it up to the UIPageViewControllerDelegate methods, but it would be _much_ simpler if we could tell UIPageViewController to just not mess with the frames in the first place.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Implement UIPageViewController/DataSource/Delegate to have multiple screens and use the built in UIPageControl

        Expected Results:
        1. I can set a boolean property on UIPageViewController to disable the resizing of the frames of the subviews, letting the UIPageControl float on top

        Actual Results:
        1. UIPageViewController modifies the frames of the incoming view controllers so that it leaves room for the UIPageControl at the bottom of the frame. There is no way to disable this.
