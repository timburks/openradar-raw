    description: "Summary:\r\nAPI Documentation Does Not Include Whether or Not A Given Property Will Generate KVO Change Notifications. It would be helpful to know ahead of time if a given property of an NSObject subclass — any of them — will generate observable KVO change notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFor example, the `state` property of NSURLSessionTask is observable via KVO, which could have many possible uses, such as tracking an active task count across an application in order to update the status bar activity indicator on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the documentation for each property, a there should be a brief note about whether that property supports KVO. Even just a simple yes or no would suffice.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProperty documentation does not specify which, if any, properties support KVO."
