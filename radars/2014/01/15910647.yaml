    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a vertical line NSBox as a subview of a layer-backed view it does not respond to requests resizing its frame unless its layer-backed superview is set to \"autoresizeSubviews\". The bug is that it should make no difference if its superview is layer-backed or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an NSView that you enable layer-backing on with setWantsLayer:YES\r\n2. In Interface Builder or by code add a \"Vertical Line\" NSBox element to this view\r\n3. Adjust that vertical line's frame by setting a new frame in code with setBounds: or setFrame:\r\n4. Observe that there is no visual change of the vertical line's frame\r\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 with a NON-layer-backed view. Observe that the vertical line changes its frame correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSBox should adjust its frame according to the values set by setFrame: or setBounds:. It should make no difference if its superview is layer-backed or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSBox doesn't change its size at all, unless its superview is set to \"autoresizeSubviews\". When the superview isn't layer-backed \"autoresizeSubviews\" is not needed - as one would expect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 / OS X 10.9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPossibly related to rdar://13059657"
