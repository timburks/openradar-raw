    description: "# Summary\r\nUsing NSAttributedString creating with HTML data (using NSHTMLTextDocumentType) is a lengthy operation, but internally makes the main runloop run in a common mode, which leads to other methods, delegates and notifications being delivered while parsing. \r\n\r\nThis in turn leads to serious, hard-to-debug crashes.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\nSee minimal UITableViewController demo at https://gist.github.com/n-b/8397563\r\n\r\nBasically, it's a UITableViewController that parses and sets attributed text to each of its cell in -cellForRowAtIndexPath.\r\n \r\n# Expected Results:\r\nHTML parsing should completely block the thread, or at least run in a specific mode.\r\n\r\nFor example, in -scrollViewDidScroll, one can expect that -visibleCells and -indexPathsForVisibleRows return coherent results. This is no longer the case, because -scrollViewDidScroll is called while parsing HTML, inside -cellForRowAtIndexPath.\r\n\r\n# Actual Results:\r\nDuring HTML parsing, the rest of the app continues to run as if nothing, but the cell is not returned yet.\r\n\r\n# Version:\r\n7.0, 7.1b3"
