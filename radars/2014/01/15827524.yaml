    description: "App crashes with a variety of stacks which all include \"-[_UIGestureRecognizerFailureMap _queueRecognizersForResetIfFinished]\".  In every case it looks like this method is trying to message deallocated objects.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt's unclear exactly how to reproduce the issue, but we've seen it a few times, always on first generation iPads, always around the time that view controllers managing UIWebViews were being deallocated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crashes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 5.1.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've seen the crash once and another developer on my team has seen it three times, always on a first generation iPad running iOS 5.1 and around the time that view controllers managing UIWebViews were being deallocated (and new ones were being allocated)."
