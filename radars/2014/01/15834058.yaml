Add container views and embed view controller\r\n2. Open Preview Assistant\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShown the contents of the embedded view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe containers just show an unhelpful grey box with the word \"Container\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a real life storyboard showing three container views on the left with the preview assistant on the right."
