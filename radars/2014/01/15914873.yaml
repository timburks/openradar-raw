    description: "Summary:\r\nSimply try to import a new certificate (a real one, paid for) and make it the one used to secure all services.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* 10.9 (stock) system, ie, 10.9.1 upgrades not yet applied.\r\n* Using a real (ie, paid for) SSL wildcard certificate, everything worked for securing all services\r\n* Now that we've got a new (updated) certificate, we were able to \"Import new Certificate Identity...\" with no issue.\r\n* Attempting to choose that new cert for \"Secure services using\" now shows \"2 certificates chosen\". Looking at each service in detail, the only service still on the OLD (soon to expire) certificate is the Open Directory service - all other services successfully took the new one.\r\n* Attempt to manually change the certificate specifically for Open Directory, using the \"Custom\" pulldown. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected Open Directory to also use the new certificate. I also expect that if I change a specific service to use a new certificate, that would work, or there'd be an error in /var/log/system.log (there is not a peep).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOpen Directory stubbornly refuses to take the new certificate, and does not issue any errors anywhere that I can see\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9, stock."
