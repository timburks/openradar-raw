        Summary:
        As is, the only way to set the renderMode for a UIView is from code. It would be great to be able to change that setting from inside Interface Builder, or even the Image Asset Library.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UIImageView inside a xib file
        2. Set the tint color on the UIImageView

        Expected Results:
        I should be able to change the renderMode so that the tint color is taken into effect.

        Actual Results:
        I have to find somewhere in the code to create a copy of the image while changing the renderMode, then reassign it to the image property on the image view.
