    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, Xcode bots are tied to a specific branch. It would be desirable to be able to have a bot run tests on any/all branches.\r\n\r\nIn a workflow where master is the only canonical branch, and other branches are only merged when they have been reviewed and tested, waiting for the tests to run on the code when it enters the master branch is too late.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a bot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Create a branch.\r\n2. Specify a branch OR wildcard (all branches)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Create a bot.\r\n2. Forced to specify a branch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0.2"
