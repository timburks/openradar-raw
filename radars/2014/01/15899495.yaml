    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling \"downloadTaskWithResumeData\" on an NSURLSession where the resume data references a temp file that no longer exists causes a crash.  The temporary file can be cleared out by iOS at any time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Begin a download on an NSURLSession.\r\n2. Cause it to fail half way through (turning on Airplane mode is a handy way to do this) and save the resumeData is generated in the didCompleteWithError delegate method.\r\n3. Manually clear the /Library/Caches/com.apple.nsnetworkd/ folder.\r\n4. Try to resume the download with the resumeData.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe download should begin from 0 if the file does not exist any more or at worst, the task should return nil. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt crashes.\r\n\r\niOS itself can clear the temporary files any time to recover space, so the app has no control over the lifetime validity of resumeData.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHappens on iOS 7.0.4 and iOS 7.1b4 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
