    description: "OS X Server includes a feature which caches app store downloads, as described at <http://www.apple.com/osx/server/features/#caching-server>.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be useful to any Apple customer with more than one Mac and/or more than one iOS device. However the majority of these users have no need of the rest of OS X Server. They're unlikely to purchase it, and if they do they're likely to be intimidated by the many other features in which they have no interest.\r\n\r\nHowever, Time Capsule and Airport Extreme both support local networked storage devices.\r\n\r\nTherefore, these devices should include an app store caching feature, to provide the benefits of this feature to end users who don't want or need OS X Server."
