        Summary:
        We use Xcode's Open Quickly panel a lot, it's a great tool productivity-wise.

        But there's one use case where it does work as expected. When working with an Xcode workspace, with a couple subproject, each project having localized resource with the same name (translate.strings, etc.)/

        Open Quickly, when typing "trans|" lists all resources translate.strings resources with random order. As there can be 50-100 files with that same name sorted in a random fashion, it is therefore very complicated to choose the right file from the list. (See attached screenshot)

        I would like to suggest improving the sort mechanism to have such resources sorted based on language and project (sort descriptor).

        Thank you for considering this feature.
