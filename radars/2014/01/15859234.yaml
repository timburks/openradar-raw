    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7.0 the shift key would turn dark grey for upper case, an empty arrow outline for lower case and this makes sense because the upper case solid felt like a highlight. \r\n\r\nWith iOS 7.1 beta 3 lower case is indicated with a solid white color which feels more like a highlight than solid grey and hence feels like it should be the upper case indicator.  Since testing on iOS 7.1 I can't look at the keyboard and figure out which mode it's in (upper case or lower case) so I have to type a character and, typically, delete it because it's not what I expected or wanted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open mail\r\n2. Tap new message\r\n3. Tap in message body\r\n4. Look at keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect keyboard to appear ready to write out an upper case letter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDark grey key looks how I would expect it to appear for lower case so I tap it and see a white shift key icon which feels like I've swapped to upper case. Tap a letter and realize it's in lower case.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1b3 11D5127c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn intuitive version would be to make the shift key white for upper case, dark grey for lower case and/OR change the letters on the \"keys\" of the  keyboard to reflect the current case mode e.g. upper case appears as QWERTY, lower case as qwerty."
