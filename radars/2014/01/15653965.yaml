    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a Pobox Mailstore account, which uses standard IMAP and SMTP for mail. Since upgrading to Mavericks, when I send an email, Mail regularly hangs until the mail sends. When I hear the send sound, I know it will work again. But until then, it feels like thereâ€™s a Mac OS Classic modal dialog open somewhere and Mail will respond to no interactions at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send mail via SMTP (may require getting a Pobox account to reproduce)\r\n2. Try to browse IMAP folders or move messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn previous versions of Mail, I have always been able to continue working with my messages after hitting Send, without having to wait for the SMTP send process to finish.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail hangs until the message finishes sending.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 7.0 (1822), Mac OS X 10.9 Build 13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSeems to happen with my Pobox/SMTP/IMAP account, but not with Gmail.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
