    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder Xcode 5 it should be possible to configure and run logic tests without the simulator launching as described in the (now retired) document \"UnitTesting\" under \"Setting Up Logic Unit Tests\" for Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nSee https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/UnitTesting/UnitTesting.pdf\r\n\r\nThis is a pressing issue when it comes to automatically running logic tests as part of a build which is against the \"red, refactor, green\" cycle of test driven development and what the test navigator in Xcode 5 strives to achieve.\r\n\r\nXcode 4 didn't have \"launching the simulator\" as a requirement when running logic tests and the now deprecated \"Test After Build\" elevated that promise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 Install Xcode 5.0.2\r\n2 Create an \"Empty Application\" project\r\n3 Select the \"*Tests\" target\r\n3.1 Select \"Build Settings\"\r\n3.2 Remove \"Test Host\"\r\n3.3 Remove \"Bundle loader\"\r\n4 Select the \"*Tests\" target\r\n5 Select \"Product\", \"Run\"\r\n\r\nAlternatively using xcodebuild\r\nxcodebuild -project Bar.xcodeproj -scheme Bar -destination \"platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone Retina (3.5-inch)\" test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHave the logic tests running without the simulator launching\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe simulator is launching as part of running logic tests\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2\r\nBuild version 5A3005\r\n\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\"This is why Xcode launches the iOS Simulator even for logic tests — the tests need to actually run in an iOS environment to behave correctly.\"\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/867874#867874\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like you may want to test using the iOS Simulator, but not have the iOS Simulator app launch and show its GUI? If so, then that's not currently possible.\"\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/908014#908014\r\n\r\n\"@joar_at_work given your comment on the developer forums, is that a \"known issue\" or a deliberate change? Can still file a bug report if so.\"\r\nhttps://twitter.com/qnoid/status/412888557473107968\r\n\r\n\"How do I automatically perform unit tests on each “build and run” action in XCode 5?\"\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20605509/how-do-i-automatically-perform-unit-tests-on-each-build-and-run-action-in-xcod\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nNo known workarounds under Xcode 5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Bar.zip' was successfully uploaded."
