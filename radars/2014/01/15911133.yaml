    description: "Summary:\nChanging Xcode font presets doesn't apply to previously-viewed files from the current session.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch Xcode. \n2. Open a couple tabs.\n3. Navigate to various .h and .m files in your project on each tab.\n4. In Xcode's preferences, change the font preset to a different color scheme.\n5. Only the files currently visible will change theme.\n6. Navigate back to previously-viewed files.\n7. These files (from step 6) will have the correct background color but incorrect text colors.\n\nExpected Results:\nChanging themes should apply across all files.\n\nActual Results:\nSee step 7 above.\n\nRegression:\nThe only workaround is to change font presets then quit and relaunch Xcode. This bug has been present since at least Xcode 3.x."
