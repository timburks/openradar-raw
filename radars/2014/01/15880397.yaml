    description: "# Description\r\n\r\nOn a 64-bit device (an iPhone 5s for instance), Reachability sample produces incorrect values for cellular availability when the sample is built with armv7 - armv7s - armv64 architectures.\r\n\r\nBuilding the sample with only armv7 - armv7s produces the correct values for cellular data availability.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the Reachability sample from the developer library (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007324).\r\n2. Build the sample with Xcode 5.0.2\r\n3. Run it on an iPhone 5s with cellular connection available; the sample shows that: \"Cellular data network is active. Internet traffic will be routed through it.\"\r\n4. In the sample build settings, select \"Standard architectures (including 64-bit) (armv7, armv7s, armv64)\" (the default configuration is \"Standard architectures (armv7, armv7s)\")\r\n5. Re-run the sample on an iPhone 5s with an active cellular connection: the sample doesn't show the availability of the cellular connection.\r\n\r\n# Expected result:\r\n\r\nReachability sample should show the availability of the cellular connection, even if the sample has been built with 64-bit architectures.\r\n\r\n# Actual results\r\n\r\nReachability sample doesn't show the availability of the cellular connection.\r\n\r\nXcode 5.0.2\r\n\r\niPhone 5s 7.0.4"
