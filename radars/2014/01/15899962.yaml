    description: "Summary:\r\nI had a custom view controller with container views for UITableViewControllers with UINavigationControllers. On a push You can see the previous table view that just pushed it behind it until the full animation is over. I then switched over to UITabBarController and it has the same issue\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a table view controller\r\n2) Make it push a view controller from the delegate or a storyboard\r\n3) put it in a navigation controller\r\n4) put the navigation controller in a container view or UITabBarController\r\n5) present from a popover (might not have anything to do with it but thats how i found the bug)\r\n6) run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth transition from table view to table view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nViewing the previous table view. Looks really bad and ugly\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRun the demo project, press the button and press the first table cell. During the animation from the view table view to second you will se the bug\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad iOS 7.0.X\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
