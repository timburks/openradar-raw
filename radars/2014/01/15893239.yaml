    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UINavigationController is a child view controller, and is presented via a custom animation, the navigation bar wrongly assumes the height of 44pt, hence causing the status bar to overlap with it, even though it should be 64pt. The animation is like the weather app on iOS 7.\r\nHowever, when the child view is placed directly at the required position (without any animations), the navigation bar's height is correctly set to 64pt.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a UINavigationController as the child view controller\r\n2. Set it's frame to [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]\r\n3. Add as subview to a view (call it A) in the hierarchy of the parent's view\r\n4. Animate A to fill the parent view controller's view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UINavigationController's view is presented with a correctly sized navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf view A's origin is not {0, 0}, and has to be animated to there, the navigation bar is given a height of only 44px."
