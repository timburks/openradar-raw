    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the release of iOS 7 the GameKit framework has diverged within the two SDK. Like in OS X for initializing an GKScore object is present the initWithCategory: and not the initWithLeaderboardIdentifier: as is in the iOS SDK.\r\nIt would be immensely useful if the two framework will be identical in the same manner as the SpriteKit one because much more code in a multi platform game can be reused between the two platform (with the exclusion of the standard UI part of course).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a game project targeting iOS and OS X platform\r\n2. Create an SKScore object sharing the code between the two platform\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code is a one line [[SKScore alloc] initWithLeaderboardIdentifier:identifier]\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code must be branched with an #ifdef statement between the iOS 7 version [[SKScore alloc] initWithLeaderboardIdentifier:identifier] and the OS X version [[SKScore alloc] initWithCategory:identifier]"
