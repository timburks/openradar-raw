    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to verify an iPad as a trusted device for an Apple ID which has enabled two-factor authentication, if the user has the keyboard undocked and split, the entry of the verification code will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove an iPad from the list of verified devices for a known Apple ID.\r\n2. Attempt to make a purchase in iTunes or the App Store.\r\n3. Request that a code be sent to another verified device, or via SMS.\r\n4. Undock and split the iPad keyboard.\r\n5. When the verification code is received, attempt to enter it in the verification dialog.\r\n6. Observe that the following error appears briefly: \"Server unavailable. Please try again later.\"\r\n7. Observe that the follow error appears: \"Code is invalid. Please try again.\"\r\n8. Observe that the device remains unverified, and unable to make new purchases.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that any keyboard configuration may be used to enter the device verification code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the keyboard must be united (not split) for verification entree to succeed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe problem occurs when the iPad keyboard is undocked and split."
