    description: "14-Jan-2014 00:40 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the Clock app, there is an option to stop audio playing after the timer ends. It doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start some audio playing, something longer than 1 minute.\r\n2. Go to Clock->Timer\r\n3. Set the timer for 1 min.\r\n4. Tap \"When Timer Ends\"\r\n5. Scroll to the bottom of the list and choose \"Stop Playing\"\r\n6. Tap Set and the start the timer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe audio should stop playing once the timer finished.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe audio continues. \r\n\r\nYou have unleashed an unstoppable audio force which continues unrestrained by the Clock app's broken promises. Your only hope now is to press pause manually, like some kind of animal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not occur on 7.0.4, occurs on 7.1b3\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
