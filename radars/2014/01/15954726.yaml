    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I receive a pass update via push notification, the pass name and topic appear on the lock screen.\r\n\r\nI slide the notification, like any other notification, and instead of opening the pass in Passbook, the phone crashes. Apple logo comes up, looks like a complete reboot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the pass from https://ococoa-push.appspot.com/passes/Ococoa.pkpass\r\n\r\n2. Trigger an update via push notification\r\n\r\n3. Push notification appears on-screen\r\n\r\n4. Slide push notification to unlock device and go to passbook.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPassbook opens and displays the Ococoa pass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhone crashes. Black screen, Apple logo, spinner, wait, Springboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDoes not seem to occur in iOS 6. Seems to be pretty widespread amongst iOS 7 devices (4S, 5, 5S) from talking to friends.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
