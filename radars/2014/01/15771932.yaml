    description: "Summary:\r\nUISlider's maximumTrackTintColor is ignored when it's set in the Storyboard. It's showing in the preview in the Interface Builder, but when run the default color is used.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed that even when maximumTrackTintColor is set in code its value is nil when it's read later (I've seen this in a subclass of UISlider). On the other hand, minimumTrackTintColor seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Single View Application\r\n2. Open Main.storyboard\r\n3. Drag UISlider from the Object Library\r\n4. Change Max Track Tint, e.g. to blue\r\n5. Build an application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMax Track Tint set in the Interface Builder should be used\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMax Track Tint set in the Interface Builder isn't used\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 Beta 3 (11D5127c)"
