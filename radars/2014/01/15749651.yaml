    description: "Summary:\r\nRename a file in the project navigator, changing only a few characters from uppercase to lowercase makes Xcode abort the rename with a series of errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Take e.g. the project Stacksmith.xcodeproj from http://github.com/uliwitness/Stacksmith\r\n- Go in the project navigator and find 'WILDHostCommands.m'\r\n- Rename it to 'WildHostCommands.m'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should change the name of the file so the prefix isn't all uppercase anymore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError message '“WILDHostCommands.m” couldn’t be moved to “Instructions” because either the former doesn't exist, or the folder containing the latter doesn't exist.', immediately followed by an error message '“WildHostCommands.temp_caseinsensitive_rename.m” couldn’t be moved to “Instructions” because either the former doesn't exist, or the folder containing the latter doesn't exist.'\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs you can see from the above link, the file is in the folder \"Instructions\" already."
