    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen receiving a new message: the Notification Center banner appears, the alert sound plays, but the App icon does not have any badge. This is persistent across restarts of the App, and the machine. It did work as expected under OS X 10.8 but stopped working in 10.9 and continues to not work in 10.9.1. Added accounts include Google Talk, AIM, iMessage, and Jabber, of which all exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login to Messages.app.\r\n2. Wait until a new message is received.\r\n3. Observe icon in Dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere will be a badge showing the number of unread messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no badge showing the number of unread messages\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.1/13B42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've observed discussion of this problem in the Apple user forums, and tried all workarounds mentioned. None have worked in my case.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23536900#23536900\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23510020#23510020\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached screenshots for Notification Center configuration (1) and Messages Preferences panes (2).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-01-06 at 4.25.17 PM.png', 'Screen Shot 2014-01-06 at 4.25.45 PM.png' and 'Screen Shot 2014-01-06 at 4.25.48 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
