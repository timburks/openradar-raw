    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the UI changes in iOS 7 the button labeled \"Slide to unlock\" became much smaller (now it's only one line high, before it was like 80px high or so). Normal users who don't use Voice Over on the iPhone can swipe the lockscreen away by touching and swiping anywhere on the screen, but blind users who use Voice Over can only unlock the phone by tapping the mentioned software-button. But it's very hard to find that button because it's so thin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock iPhone\r\n2. Press the hardware unlock button/home button to get tot the lock screen.\r\n3. Try and find the software button \"> slide to unlock\" without looking (using voice over)\r\n4. Not easy\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be much easier to unlock the screen if the button was way bigger (like the whole or at least half display). Or just make it as big as in iOS <= 6 ...\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlind persons who rely on the integration of accessibility features in the iPhone are already doing hard to unlock it. Please change that and it would make life much easier to my blind dad.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 - iOS 7.1 beta 3"
