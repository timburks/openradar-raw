    description: "Summary:\r\nThe shifted vs. unshifted state of the Shift key in the iOS keyboard is not obvious at a glance. In iOS 7.0 it was somewhat visually ambiguous; in the most recent 7.1 seeds (3 and 4) it is even more ambiguous, due to a poor choice of colouring.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the Shift key is rendered using a different colour scheme compared to the rest of the keyboard, providing no contextual reference for what is an active vs. inactive state.\r\n\r\nIn 7.0, the unshifted state is drawn using an open black outline, consistent with other keys; the shifted state was shown in a filled grey.\r\n\r\nIn 7.1, the unshifted state is drawn in a filled white, completely opposite to the other keys; the shifted state is shown as before, which bears a closer resemblance to inactive keys.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the unshifted state in 7.1 appears bright and highlighted (filled white), giving the impression of an active (shifted) state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the white keyboard in any application.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Shift keys should display an image that is visually consistent with the rest of the keyboard and conveys an easily-inferred state.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is difficult (or impossible) to intuit at a glance whether the Shift key is pressed or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI first noticed this problem with 7.1 seed 3.  It persists with seed 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'7.0 unshifted.png', '7.0 shifted.png', '7.1 unshifted.png' and '7.1 shifted.png' were successfully uploaded."
