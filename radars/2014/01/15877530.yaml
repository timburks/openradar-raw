    description: "Summary:\r\nSome values, such as 2.22222222222222E17, display correctly in Scientific mode, but incorrectly (by a factor of 10^16) in Basic mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI prefer entering values with the keyboard, so that is how I will be notating it, but it works with onscreen key-presses as well. The number is arbitrary - any number with enough significant figures will suffice. The sequence I present here is just a convenient way to enter a number that will reproduce this bug.\r\n1. Open Calculator.app.\r\n2. Make sure you are not in RPN mode.\r\n3. Enter Basic mode with Command-1.\r\n4. Make sure the calculator is cleared\r\n5. Enter the following value: 2.222222222222222222 (18 2s after the decimal point).\r\n6. Multiply by typing * (star).\r\n7. Enter 10.\r\n8. Type ^ to raise the 10 to a power.\r\n9. Enter 17 as the power.\r\n10. Press Return to finish the calculation.\r\nThat calculation one one line, as copied from the Paper Tape window, is: 2.2222222222222222 * pow(10,17) = 2.222222222222222E17\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe value 2.222222222222222E17 appears on the calculator's onscreen LCD. If the full expansion can't fit, the values after the decimal place are truncated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value 2.22222222222222E1 appears on the screen. This is equivalent to 2.22222222222222 * 10 ^ 1, or 2.22222222222222. This is incorrect by a factor of 10^16, which in the words of Richard Dawkins regarding the creationist estimate of the age of the earth, \"is not a trivial error.\"\r\n\r\nIf you type Command-2 to switch to Scientific mode, you will see that the correct exponent is 17, not 1. Switch back to Basic mode with Command-1, and the 7 is truncated again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B3116)\r\n10.8 (123)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on Retina and non-Retina screens.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
