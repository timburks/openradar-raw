    description: "Kevin Chen10-Jan-2014 05:38 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAVSpeechSynthesizer provides a method called stopSpeakingAtBoundary:, which is supposed to stop speaking and clear the queue of utterance. However, it does not work after the first AVSpeechUtterance has been spoken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVSpeechSynthesizer and give it AVSpeechUtterances faster than it can speak.\r\n\r\nAVSpeechSynthesizer *synthesizer = [[AVSpeechSynthesizer alloc] init];\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\r\n    [synthesizer speakUtterance:[AVSpeechUtterance speechUtteranceWithString:@\"I am a particularly annoying bug.\"]];\r\n\r\n2. Some time later, attempt to stop speech synthesis\r\n\r\n[synthesizer stopSpeakingAtBoundary:AVSpeechBoundaryImmediate];\r\n\r\n(AVSpeechBoundaryWord works too)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpeaking stops immediately or after the current word is done, whichever was specified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpeaking will only stop if stopSpeakingAtBoundary: was called during the first AVSpeechUtterance. Afterwards, stopSpeakingAtBoundary: will not affect speech synthesis and will return NO, indicating that speaking did not stop.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor more information: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19672814/an-issue-with-avspeechsynthesizer-any-workarounds\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPersonally, I have only tested on iPhone 5S, but it seems like other people have this problem too.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
