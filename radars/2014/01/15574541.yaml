    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an record/play audio session with an audio unit, the systemwide double height \"Recording\" status bar state is displayed for about one second after switching apps (This does NOT happen when returning to the home screen)\r\n\r\nI've attached both a code sample that triggers, and a video that shows the issue.\r\n\r\nI first contacted DTS to make sure it wasn't my fault, and they told me that I should resubmit the issue as a bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n  Expected Results:\r\n  When switching app, the audio session should deactivate, and no \"Recording\" status bar shown\r\n\r\n  Actual Results:\r\n  Recording bar is shown for ~1 second even though the audio session has already been deactivated"
