    description: "Summary:\r\nSiri will happily tell anyone who asks the home address of the owner of an iPhone, without requiring the phone to be unlocked. This might be reasonable if no security code is set, but if one is set, it seems unfortunate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Steal an iPhone\r\n2. Activate Siri\r\n3. Say, “Take me home.”\r\n4. Write down the address\r\n5. Until the phone is remotely wiped, follow Siri's directions to the address.\r\n6. Steal more stuff.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the phone is locked, any request for personal information should require that the phone be unlocked before revealing that information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri tells the bad guys where to find me!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
