    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Settings app, I deleted a Citrix XenMobile/Zenprise MDM profile from my iPhone 4. Immediately after deleting the MDM profile, I tapped on the Mail configuration profile (tied to my company's email). The Settings app did not respond by going to the profile detail view. I hit the home button, and there were no app icons on the home screen. I swiped between pages and no app icons were visible. After some time (less that 60 seconds), app icons did show up when swiping to another page. After that everything looked fine. I re-entered the Settings app  and my Mail profile had been deleted. I think iOS or XenMobile does this automatically after deleting the MDM profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register device with XenMobile/Zenprise MDM\r\n2. Open the Mail app, log in, and wait for email to download\r\n3. Go to Settings/General/Profiles\r\n4. Delete the MDM configuration profile\r\n5. Immediately after #4, tap the Mail profile. No response.\r\n6. Immediately, hit the home button\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormal operation would be that the iOS launch screen looks like normal. App icons all there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The iOS launch screen will have no app icons. Screenshot attached.\r\n2. Swipe to other pages. No icons either.\r\n3. After some time (less than 60 seconds), swiping will show icons and everything looks normal.\r\n4. Go into Settings/General/Profiles. The Mail profile will be gone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4, Model A1332\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'No app icons.png' was successfully uploaded."
