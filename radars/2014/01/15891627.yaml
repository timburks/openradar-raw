    description: "Summary:\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\nWhen putting computer A into target display mode over thunderbolt it shows brightness set to zero, and doesn't allow it to be adjusted. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\nPut computer A into target display mode using command + f2.\n\nExpected Results:\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\nShows normal brightness, allows brightness to be controlled.\n\nActual Results:\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\nBrightness on display A set to zero. No brightness control on A.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\nIf I put computer B into sleep, and then log back into computer A and adjust the brightness, then sometimes when I go back into target display mode I will be able to adjust A's brightness. This solution only works intermittently.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
