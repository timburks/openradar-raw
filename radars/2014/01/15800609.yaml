    description: "Recent revelations about NSA bulk surveillance have made it clear that the future of email will include robust, easy-to-use encryption with no means for intermediaries (ie. mail providers, governments) to intercept content.\r\n\r\nAny mail client that does not support this is not suitable for modern security threats by rogue surveillance states.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, it would be highly beneficial for Apple to implement OpenPGP support into Apple Mail, both on the desktop and on iOS.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openpgp.org/about_openpgp/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Mail on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Mail supporting a user-friendly OpenPGP implementation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Lack of built-in OpenPGP support.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail on iOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUsing Mail under iOS 7 on an iPhone 5s."
