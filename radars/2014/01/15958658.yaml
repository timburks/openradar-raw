    description: "Summary:\r\nI created a new project and tried to swipe back on my trackpad with two fingers, and Xcode got stuck in a bizarre state where the projects/targets sidebar was upside down, and the main Project settings editor was scaling like a bitmap instead of a live UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode.\r\n2. I chose iOS â†’ Single-View Application.\r\n3. Change the deployment target to iOS 6.0.\r\n4. Attempt to swipe back, or possible switch to another file and then attempt to swipe back, by swiping to the right with two fingers on the trackpad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot amazing graphical glitches.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAmazing graphical glitches. The Project/Targets sidebar (not the fully leftmost sidebar) was slightly shifted, as if in mid-swipe, and its contents were flipped vertically. No keyboard shortcuts worked, but the window could be resized, and the buttons on the upper right to show and hide various sidebars were functional. If I resized the window or changed the sidebars' visibility, the main project editor would resize as though it were a bitmap image instead of a live UI, which leads me to think this could be related to grabbing a screenshot of the view for swipe animation purposes. When I tried switching to the Assistant Editor by using the toolbar button, the left pane was a squished version of the same project settings. However, switching to the Version editor and then back made the problem go away, and restore the use of keyboard shortcuts such as Command-Option-0 to show and hide the left sidebar.\r\n\r\nHowever, the inverted left bar has persisted through relaunching Xcode, on every project that I open, as demonstrated in the attached video. I will restart after filing this radar, and will post the results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\nOS X 10.9.1 (13B3116)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in Xcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\nDoes not occur in Xcode 5.1 (5B90f)\r\nDoes not occur in Xcode 5.0.2 on coworkers' computers\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nscreenshots and screen recording at http://cl.ly/Tg54"
