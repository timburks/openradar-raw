    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a large list of input / output files for a `Shell Script` build phase Xcode build fails with the following error: \r\n\r\nBuild operation failed without specifying any errors. Individual build tasks may have failed for unknown reasons. Some of these (up to 12) may be listed below.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour depends on the length of a full path to input / output files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. You'll need an Xcode project consisting of several targets with `Shell Script` build phases. Each build phase should have sufficiently large list of input / output files. For example you could use Chromium Open Source project when building for iOS (http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-ios).\r\n\r\n2. Place Xcode project in directory with sufficiently long full path (I have something like /Users/amishanin/Projects/C753D996-0356-4A74-8EAA-6E4C07A56319/6E5A541B-DA0E-41BD-83FD-35858B749D1F/Browser/src/yandex/ios on my local machine; a path like this triggers the error, whereas path like /Users/amishanin/Projects/Browser/src/yandex/ios does not).\r\n\r\n3. Start building the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project builds successfully regardless of the full path to input / output files of `Shell Script` build phase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild fails with the following error:\r\n\r\nBuild operation failed without specifying any errors. Individual build tasks may have failed for unknown reasons. Some of these (up to 12) may be listed below.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X: Version 10.9.1 Build 13B42\r\nXcode: Version 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\nClang: Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0\r\nThread model: posix\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nError message showing up in Xcode UI is rather unhelpful, but you can add a breakpoint on -[XCWorkQueueCommandInvocation emitBuildMessageOfType:toTranscript:message:forFileAtPath:lineNumber:] and start building the problematic project. Soon breakpoint will be hit and inspecting r8 register will show the \"real\" error message:\r\n\r\nerror: couldn't run '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/Xcode3Core.ideplugin/Contents/Frameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Resources/xcexec' because an internal error occurred (Argument list too long)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n15-inch MacBook Pro w/Retina Display (early 2013)\r\nCPU: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory: 16 GB 1600 Mhz DDR3"
