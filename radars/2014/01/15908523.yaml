    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is tough to summarize at this point—I've had similar problems many times but I'm just starting to get an idea of what's happening. Basically, Finder will freeze up on me at some point. Relaunching it just results it in freezing again. Then other apps start to freeze up. If I try to restart… it freezes trying to shut down and I have to force shut down. (Then—I don't know if this is connected or a separate issue, but the Mac also fails to boot, stuck on the grey Apple logo and spinner. If I reinstall OS X it's back to normal.) The last time this happened I did more thorough troubleshooting before attempting to restart, and discovered something interesting: I turned off file sharing, caching, and Time Machine on my server (a different machine), and everything went back to normal immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Mac mini Server with 10.9.1, running caching, file sharing, Time Machine, and web sites.\r\n2. Connect to that Mac regularly from a MacBook Pro running 10.9.1.\r\n3. Use file sharing and Time Machine normally. In at least two cases the thing that finally caused Finder to lock up was starting a search (from the toolbar) that defaulted to \"Shared\" scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder shouldn't lock up, and if it does, force quitting it should get things back to normal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder starts to beachball and doesn't respond. I've waited up to half an hour for it to recover, then try force quitting it. It fails to relaunch. Other apps start to freeze up too. Safari continued to run fine, and even downloaded a large file without problems. I was able to browse files in TextEdit, and used that to disconnect the shared drives I was connected to. I also stopped a Time Machine backup in process. Quit everything I could aside from Safari. Terminal showed multiple \"stuck\" processes for up to an hour. Eventually I tried shutting down various services on the Mac mini Server and the other Mac went back to normal instantly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.1 currently—but the last time this happened it was with the latest 10.9.2 beta that's available to developers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are two samples of Finder from the time it was beachballing. I tried to sample it again after force quitting it, but got an error that it couldn't be sampled even though it appeared to be running. I've also included the console log from the time period where things were freezing up—unfortunately I didn't make a note of the exact time it started, but I think it was around 11PM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n13\" MacBook Pro (Late 2013), 2.6GHZ Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
