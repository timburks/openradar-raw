    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 7 introduced SSReadingList class to SafariServices framework. Currently it only allows for adding new items, but in my opinion it would be beneficial if API for accessing stored items was available.\r\n\r\nThere's one drawback I can think of â€” access to stored items should be given only when a user gives his permission. It means that another item would have to be added to Settings.app > Privacy."
