    description: "Abdullah Al Mazed13-Mar-2014 10:54 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe have an app that uses Safari to install configuration profile. App uses localhost (127.0.0.1) to provide the configuration file. This works fine in 'normal' situation, with or without internet.\r\n\r\nBut Safari fails to connect to localhost if the device has VPN connection and that VPN is broken. it says \"Safari cannot open the page \"http://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/\" because your iPad is not connected to the Internet.\"\r\n\r\nNote: Safari can load page from localhost just fine when there is no connectivity on the device otherwise:\r\n - It works when an Wifi only ipad's wifi is turned off.\r\n - It works when device is set to airplane mode.\r\n\r\nWe expected VPN connection will not affect when connecting to 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRequired files:\r\n - The attached config (which will install a VPN config that will fail to connect)\r\n - iPhoneHttpServer app from the code provided (The code is based on a sample app of https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer)\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n  1) Install Sample/iPhoneHTTPServer and launch the app.\r\n  2) Tap 'Launch localhost'. Safari will be automatically launched.\r\n  3) Safari will show a page with text 'Welcome to CocoaHttpServer!'.\r\n  4) Now install the localhosttest.mobileconfig.\r\n  5) Repeat step 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari will show a page with text 'Welcome to CocoaHttpServer!'.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari says \"Safari cannot open the page \"http://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/\" because your iPad is not connected to the Internet.\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167) \r\niOS 7.0 (11A465)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- We are working on an app that will provide VPN configuration easily.\r\n- In combination with another bug we have submitted already (16109161 : iOS IPSec VPN client fails to reconnect after idle time), this bug became a serious problem for us.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S, MD239KS/A,  iOS 7.1 (11D167) \r\niPad mini retina, ME276KS/A, iOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\niPad Retina, MD328KS/A, iOS 7.0 (11A465)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'localhosttest.mobileconfig'  (A config that a VPN setup that will always fail)\r\nand 'TSI-iOS-LocalHost-Via-VPN.zip' were successfully uploaded. (Based on CocoaHTTPServer iPhone sample, only a button added to launch safari to load localhost)"
