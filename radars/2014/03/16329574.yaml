    description: "Repeated requests for a cacheable resource does not result in the correct entry for \"Cached\" attribute and moreover the HTTP Status code should not be 200.\r\n\r\n1. You need Safari with Developer tools\r\n2. Try loading the Google Logo and Apple Sprite that contains the logo\r\nhttps://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/global/nav/images/globalnav_text.png\r\n\r\n3. Make repeated requests (like atleast 3) by clicking Enter \r\n4. Watch the \"Cached\" Column to be No and HTTP Status Code to be 200\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result is the Dev Tools Column for \"Cached\" should say \"Yes\" and the HTTP Response Code should NOT be 200  but 304 (as subsequent requests should fire a IMS request)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCached is set to \"No\"\r\nHTTP Status responds as \"200\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll my repros/tests are on Version 7.0.2 (9537.74.9)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease note the RTT between the laptop and the site in question. Usually its on the order of 20-30ms\r\nHowever the object latency as reported by Safari DevTools is usually on the order of 5 ms.\r\n\r\nI setup Charles Proxy on my mac to view if there is an outstanding request made but I do not see any. For completeness I also setup a proxy and do NOT see a HTTP request being made"
