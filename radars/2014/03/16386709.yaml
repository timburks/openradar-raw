    description: "Summary:\r\nThe delegate method is called, even though when it shouldn't when tapping delete button multiple times, with indexPath == nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a basic project with UITableViewController.\r\n2. Add a few items.\r\n3. Trigger editing mode / just swipe to delete the last row.\r\n4. When the delete button appears, tap it multiple times. (Keep tapping even though the button is no longer there).\r\n5. tableView:commitEditingStyle:forRowAtIndexPath: is called with the value of indexPath == nil.\r\n\r\nThe delegate method is only called this way if the current row is the last row.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ntableView:commitEditingStyle:forRowAtIndexPath: not being called at all. Delete button is no longer visible, user shouldn't be able to interact with it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelete button is still interactive even though it's not longer visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 above."
