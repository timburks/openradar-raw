    description: "Summary:\r\nA number of UISearchBar methods have documentation that suggest that UISearchBar can be disabled. These methods include:\r\n\r\nimageForSearchBarIcon:state:\r\nsearchFieldBackgroundImageForState:\r\nsetImage:forSearchBarIcon:state:\r\nsetSearchFieldBackgroundImage:forState:\r\n\r\nAll of the documentation for these methods state that the valid control states include UIControlStateDisabled. However, there is no way to actually disable a UISearchBar. UISearchBar inherits from UIView, and there is no public way to access the UITextField within the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect there to be a way to disable UISearchBars. Otherwise, I expect the documentation to remove references to UIControlStateDisabled as it does not appear to be a valid state.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation is currently misleading as UISearchBars cannot be disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would prefer that functionality be added to allow UISearchBars to be disabled. Until that happens, the documentation should be fixed."
