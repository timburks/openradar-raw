    description: "Summary:\r\nMail will let you use boolean terms (AND, OR, NOT) in the main search bar in the upper right corner, but if you attempt to save this search as a Smart Mailbox, the Smart Mailbox does not seem to search in the same way, and the search fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Mail\r\n2. Type a simple boolean search in the upper right-hand search bar, such as \"Lucas OR Kasdan OR Brackett\". This produces search results as expected.\r\n3. Click the \"Save\" button in the search filter bar. The search gets translated as [Entire message][contains][Lucas OR Kasdan OR Brackett].\r\n4. Save the Smart Mailbox as-is, without any changes, by clicking \"OK\".\r\n5. Click on the title of the new Smart Mailbox to reveal its contents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the saved search, in Smart Mailbox form, would give the same search results as received from the search bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Smart Mailbox does not seem to obey the same boolean commands as the search bar, and the search fails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 7.2 (1874)\r\nOS X Version 10.9.2 (13C64)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only known workaround is to do the search as a Spotlight search (as shown in the 4th attached screenshot), instead of a Smart Mailbox. Spotlight even gives easy access to complex boolean operations in GUI form, by option-clicking the + button. However, this workaround is clumsy at best, as it does not integrate into the Mail interface.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in all known versions of Mavericks on multiple machines."
