    description: "It would be useful to developers to have access to a speech recognition or voice dictation API, similar to what the built-in keyboard or Siri uses.\r\n\r\nWe develop a language education app that plays a sentence to the user in a foreign language and asks them to speak it aloud. We record their audio and run it through our own speech recognition software to grade them. It would be simpler if we could use a native speech recognition API to judge on the device how well they spoke the sentence."
