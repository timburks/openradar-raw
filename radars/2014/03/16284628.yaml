    description: "Summary:\nTwo similar constraints, one updates in the sidebar the other doesn't.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nAdd a \"box\" to a view controller in IB with storyboards enabled.  Add a leading edge constraint with a value of 60 points.  Add a trailing space constraint with the same values.\n\nThen select the constraints in the tree and set the values to greater than 40 points, priority High (750).  \n\nExpected Results:\n\nBoth constrains would have \"Horizontal Space (> 40)\" as a label.\n\nActual Results:\n\nOne of the constraints still says \"Horizontal Space (60)\" as a label\ncur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nScreenshot:  http://cl.ly/image/0r2u1B1o2B04"
