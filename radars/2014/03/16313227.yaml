    description: "Summary:\r\nIn all versions of iOS prior to 7.1, if the user had a high-resolution picture of the caller, the caller picture appeared full-screen.  If the user had a low-resolution picture of the caller, the image appeared in a circle next to the name.  In iOS 7.1, the caller picture appears in an circle next to the caller name, regardless of the caller picture's resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of iOS 7's deference to content, I propose that this change be reverted.  It was such a great experience to have the caller's picture show up and added a touch of humanity to the experience.  The new call screen feels cold and digital, especially with the blurred background and sparse caller screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a high-resolution (from the iPhone camera, for example) picture for a contact in Contacts.\r\n2. Have the caller make a call to your iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA full-screen caller picture\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA tiny thumbnail of the caller picture.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1/11D167\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know that not everyone has high-resolution caller pictures, but the way it was implemented in iOS prior to 7.1 was so much nicer than anything offered on any other platform.  Please consider bringing it back.  Thanks :)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (A1428)\r\niOS 7.1 GM\r\nNE488LL/A \r\niPhone 5 (A1428)\r\niOS 7.1 GM\r\nNE488LL/A\r\n32GB\r\nT-Mobile 16.0\r\nModem 6.02.00\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
