    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 5.1 auto-edits tool versions of NIB files when viewed but not otherwise edited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project with a NIB file in Xcode 5.0.3 or earlier\r\n2. Place the project under version control and commit all files\r\n3. Open the Nib file in Xcode 5.1 that was created in Xcode 5.0.3\r\n4. Look at the version control, the NIB file will be changed only in tool versions\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode won't edit a NIB file, including tool versions, unless the file is edited. Viewing a file should not change it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTool version values in the NIB file are changed for a file that is not otherwise edited.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe previous version of Xcode, 5.0.3, did not edit NIB files on viewing."
