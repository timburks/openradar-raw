    description: "If I try to build onto a locked device, Xcode presents a dialog box indicating that the device is locked and that I must unlock it before proceeding. The dialog should dismiss itself without my intervention.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iOS app project in Xcode.\r\n2. Connect an iOS device to the computer over USB.\r\n3. Make sure the device is locked, such that it will require a passcode or Touch ID authentication to unlock.\r\n4. Click the Run button in Xcode to run the app.\r\n5. A notice appears telling me that I have to unlock the device to proceed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce I have unlocked the device, the build and run either continues automatically, or else the dialog dismisses itself and I can just click Run (or type Command-R) again to run the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to press Return or click the OK button to first dismiss the dialog box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1 (5B130a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot here: http://cl.ly/UcTk"
