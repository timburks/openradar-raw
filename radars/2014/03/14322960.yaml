    description: "Summary: Folder zoom action uses old-style roundrects\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to a Home Screen page that has folders.\r\n2. Tap a folder to \"zoom in\" to it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder zooms in smoothly with the new Jony-licious, improved roundrects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe background of the folder (the light gray, blurred-background roundrect) uses the old-style, harsh corners during the animation, and as soon as the animation finishes, the corners snap to the new style corners.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshots of during and after the animation: http://cl.ly/ULfy\r\nVideo of it in action: http://cl.ly/UM0v\r\nApple asked me to check if it was fixed in iOS 7 beta 4, and it was. It is still present in the shipping version of iOS 7.1 as well, although the new animation curve makes it a bit harder to notice."
