    description: "Summary:\r\nWhat (I think) happens is that LaunchServices expects a bundle’s ‘Resources’ dir to contain a ‘Info.plist’. Copying the ‘Info.plits’ to the ‘Resources’ dir makes the application install and launch again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS application in Xcode.\r\n2. Create a new directory called ‘Resources’ inside new project’s source root.\r\n3. Add the new ‘Resources’ directory to the project as ‘a folder reference’, so that it’s copied as-is into the application bundle.\r\n4. Try to run the application on the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither that the application simply installs, and works, or if that’s not possible at all that Xcode warns the user that a directory called ‘Resources’ is not allowed and it thusly can’t be installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication doesn’t get installed and Xcode shows a generic alert stating “iOS Simulator failed to install the application.” which does not help the user troubleshoot the issue at all."
