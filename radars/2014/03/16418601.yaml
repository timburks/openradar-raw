    description: "Closed as a duplicate of rdar://8259324.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nConsider the string @\"TEXT:Ω%iΩ%iΩ%iΩ%0.2fΩ%0.2fΩ%@\", where NSIntegers are being inserted at those %i tokens. Xcode will give an error, with a default \"Fix-it\", that inserts %li and (long). Currently Xcode inserts these characters at the wrong position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample project, and attempt to auto-fix the warning.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode inserts the Fix-it characters at the correct position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode inserts the Fix-it characters at the wrong position."
