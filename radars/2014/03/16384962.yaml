    description: "A UISplitViewController that has a UINavigationController for the master and a UIViewController for the root does not correctly place the top Guide underneath the navigation item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the sample code.\r\n2. Build & run the app.\r\n3. Run the app on an iPad (or simulator) in portrait orientation.\r\n4. Tap the Master button.\r\n5. Notice the red toolbar is under the navigation bar.\r\n6. Rerun the app in landscape.\r\n7. Notice the red toolbar is now correctly placed.\r\n8. Rotate the app into portrait.\r\n9. Tap the Master button.\r\n10. Notice the layout is different than the initial run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe red toolbar is constrained to the view's Top Layout Guide. This should be below the navigation bar, regardless of orientation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the app is launched in portrait orientation the toolbar will be approximately 50% under the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample is also available on Github: https://github.com/HiddenJester/SplitView-Toolbar-Autolayout-Test\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air running 7.1. iPad simulator running 7.1 I didn't explicitly run this test in iOS 7.0 but I'm confident the bug was present in 7.0 as well.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SplitView+Toolbar Autolayout Test.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nThis was marked as a dupe of 14791829 on 2014-04-02."
