    description: "Summary:\r\nA UITextView created using Interface Builder shows some strange scrolling behavior, particularly when dismissing the keyboard, and then adjusting the text view. The view scrolls much more than it needs to. When a visually identical UITextView is created through code, the problem is gone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project Text1. This version has a UITextView included in the Storyboard, created through Xcode's Interface Builder.\r\n2. Build and run the app. The bug is present in the simulator as well as on a device.\r\n3. Scroll down in the text view, and tap next to \"In a row\", for example.\r\n4. Wait for the keyboard to appear, then tap \"Done\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text view should appear exactly how it did before the keyboard was shown. The text \"In a row\" should still be on screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view is scrolled up much higher than necessary. The words \"In a row\" are far off screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0 and 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've also included a project Text2, showing the bug is not present when the UITextView is created in code. There's a comment pointing out one line in particularâ€”the creation of the NSTextContainer. If initWithSize: is given CGSizeZero instead of frame.size, it behaves the same way as the Text1 project. Hopefully that's useful in finding the cause of the bug.\r\n\r\nAttachment:\r\nhttp://junecloud.com/journal/bugs/uitextview.zip"
