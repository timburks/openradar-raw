    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for NSUUID states: \"UUIDs created by NSUUID conform to RFC 4122 version 4 and are created with random bytes.\"\r\n\r\nBut RFC 4122 states: \"Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values \"a\" through \"f\" are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.\"\r\n\r\nWhen using an NSUUID, the letters \"a\" through \"f\" are the *upper* case variants, not lowercase, in violation of RFC 4122\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. NSLog(@\"%@\", [[NSUUID UUID] UUIDString])\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe string should output with lowercase letters\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe string outputs with uppercase letters\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
