    description: For an alarm clock respectively routines type of app it would add a lot to the user experience if a user could record a personalized sound (e.g. speaking something into the microphone) and attach it to a local notification (representing the alarm). This is (as of iOS 7) not permitted by public Apple API since a sound attached to a local notification must originate from the app's bundle which is not writable by the app itself.
