    description: "I have an object of class `SGBContainer` which has an array named `objects` that contains objects of class `SGBObject`.  Currently, they each implement NSCoding but not NSSecureCoding.  The `-initWithCoder:` for `SGBContainer` looks like this:\r\n\r\n    - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder\r\n    {\r\n        self = [self init];\r\n        if (self)\r\n        {\r\n            _objects = [aCoder decodeObjectForKey:@\"objects\"];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nI want to switch to using NSSecureCoding, and from what I can tell, it would mean changing the above to this:\r\n\r\n    - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder\r\n    {\r\n        self = [self init];\r\n        if (self)\r\n        {\r\n            _objects = [aCoder decodeObjectOfClass:[NSArray class] forKey:@\"objects\"];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n...which isn't much of an improvement, as the contents of the array will be instantiated whatever their class."
