    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 7.1 added a new \"Button Shapes\" option in Settings -> General -> Accessibility. Enabling this option can cause many UIBarButtonItems to look bad if the UINavigationBar is using a custom barTintColor. Standard UIBarButtonItems with a title gain a completely black background over the normal tint color. If that UIBarButtonItem is then disabled, the text color turns black, making the button completely unreadable as it still has a black background. This only happens if the UINavigationBar is translucent. Setting translucent to NO makes the UIBarButtonItems look as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a translucent UINavigationBar with a barTintColor of: [UIColor colorWithRed:54.0/255.0 green:190.0/255.0 blue:185.0/255.0 alpha:1.0]. This seems to occur for many, but not all barTintColors.\r\n2. Add an enabled UIBarButtonItem with a text title to the UINavigationBar.\r\n3. Add a disabled UIBarButtonItem with a text title to the UINavigationBar.\r\n4. In Settings -> General -> Accessibility activate the \"Button Shapes\" setting.\r\n5. Return to the application. Note the incorrect look of the navigation bar items.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the UIBarButtonItems to be readable and look approximately like they do when the UINavigationBar is not translucent. That is the button shape should be a subtle highlight or darkening.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIBarButtonItems have a completely black background. When the UIBarButtonItem is disabled it has black text over a black background and is completely unreadable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the attached sample project and screenshot that demonstrates this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on my iPhone 5S on iOS 7.1."
