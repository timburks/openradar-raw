    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Aztec and PDF417 Core Image barcode generators are currently in iOS 7 as private APIs. Please make them public so that we developers can also generate these in our apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevelopers should be able to have access to the Aztec and PDF417 Core Image barcode generators for use in our own applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThese barcode generators are private and so we are forced to use a 3rd party library to generate them, even though the ability is right there built in to Core Image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
