    description: "Summary:\r\nEven though Xcode supports playing a sound on a breakpoint, it takes 5 steps to set up one. This enhancement should add support to add a sound breakpoint in one step with only a keystroke/action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click to set the breakpoint\r\n2. Edit breakpoint\r\n3. Select “Sound” action\r\n4. Select the sound\r\n5. Select “Automatically continue after evaluating”\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to set a sound breakpoint with one click.\r\nBe able to assign a different sound breakpoint with one click.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1\r\nBuild version 5B130a\r\n\r\n10.9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA straight forward implementation would be to add Xcode support for a custom keyboard shortcut to assign a sound.\r\n\r\nAn enhanced implementation could offer a \"Compose\" view to be able to compose a tune by assigning sounds across a codebase.\r\n\r\nA related talk was given at NSConference 6\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/qnoid/sound-debugging-nsconference-2014\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
