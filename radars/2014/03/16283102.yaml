    description: "Summary:\r\nThe icons and text in the Phone.app favorites list are misaligned by what appears to be half a pixel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Phone.app on iOS 7.1.\r\n2. Add at least one contact as a favorite. This bug is easier to see with contacts that have no photo assigned to them.\r\n3. Look at the top of the circle icon that appears next to the name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe circle is as smooth as it could get, given that it is a curve represented by pixels.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe top of the icon has a little blip, like the kind you would expect if it were vertically misaligned on the pixel grid. If you run the Core Animation Instrument and check Color Misaligned Images, the icons, names, and number types (home, work, mobile) all turn purple, indicating that they are misaligned.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression. Attaching a screenshot of iOS 7.0.6 with Color Misaligned Images enabled, as evidenced by the yellow rectangle around the Battery Charge indicator. Nothing else on the screen is colored.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nscreenshots at http://cl.ly/ULYn"
