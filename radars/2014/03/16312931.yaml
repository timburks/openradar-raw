    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an app with a UIPickerView. To allow users more flexibility in choosing from the pickerView, we added a UITapGestureRecognizer to the UIPickerView, so that a user can scroll multiple times if needed, and then tap on the selection to confirm it before we take action on their selection. While this works in iOS 7.0.6 and below, the new release of iOS 7.1 no longer responds to the tapGestureRecognizer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a UITapGestureRecognizer to a UIPickerView:\r\n\r\n-(void)setupTapGesture:(UIPickerView *)sender {\r\n    UITapGestureRecognizer *tapTest =[[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self\r\n                                                                             action:@selector(pickerTap)];\r\n     [sender addGestureRecognizer:tapTest];\r\n }\r\n\r\n- (void)pickerTap {\r\n   NSLog(@\"picker was tapped\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. Run the app, change the selection in the pickerView, then tap the selection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe console will show \"picker was tapped,\" indicating that the tapGestureRecognizer fired.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, indicating that the tapGestureRecognizer did not fire.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1/11D167\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround we've implemented at this point is to check for iOS 7.1, and manually fire the pickerTap method for those users; Users no longer get to choose an option and then confirm, but otherwise this works well enough. We keep the tapGestureRecognizer in place for all iOS versions <7.1.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs in the Simulator running iOS 7.1, on an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1, and on an iPhone 4S running iOS 7.1.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
