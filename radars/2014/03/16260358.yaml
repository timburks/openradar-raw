    description: "Summary:\nKeynote supported WebViews up until 6.x. Now they get removed when opening a presentation breaking the presentation. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nHave an existing .key file with a web view slide.\nOpen it in Keynote 6.1\nWebViews get removed.\nNow your presentation can't be presented anymore because it has empty slides where content was.\n\nExpected Results:\nSlides should not be altered by the application and no content should get deleted from my presentation.\n\nActual Results:\nSlides with web views are empty since the web views get removed.\n\nRegression:\nThis worked fine up until Keynote 5.x\n\nNotes:\nThis is extremely inconvenient when you buy a new Mac and find yourself on stage with a broken presentation that is lacking content. Ideally in a location without Internet access so you likely are not able to at least fetch screenshots.\nThis makes Keynote 6 an unusable product when I can't trust my presentations to my presentation application anymore."
