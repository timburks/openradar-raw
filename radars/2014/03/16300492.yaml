    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are many good reasons to put curly braces on the next line; enough so that some companies and individuals use it as their coding standard. Most (but not all) of Xcode’s build-in autocompletion snippets leave the brace on the same line. There should be a way to choose, or a way to soft-wrap braces without affecting the source code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project.\r\n2. Edit a C or Objective-C source file.\r\n3. Type “if” (no quotes), wait for the CodeSense popup to appear, and press Return to create an if statement.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe opening curly brace is on the next line if that is how I or my company prefers to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe opening curly brace is on the same line as the condition.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.1 (5B130a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI maintain a project on GitHub that patches the built-in snippets file in Xcode: https://github.com/ZevEisenberg/ios-convenience\r\n\r\nThere are good enough arguments on both sides that it would be nice to have some kind of soft wrap approach, so that if you prefer next-line but your team uses same-line, you can configure Xcode to display one format but save another. I can’t think of any cases where the intent of the braces is ambiguous, so it should at least in theory be possible.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
