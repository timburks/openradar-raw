    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the prompt of a UINavigationItem is set, the title label doesn't animate correctly when a new view controller is pushed.\r\n\r\nThere are also various animation glitches in the contained UITableView's.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qmxo3x29iopynm/PromptTest.zip\r\n\r\nTap the \"Push\" cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The \"Second View Controller\" title should be animated in horizontally.\r\n- The size of the UIButton's in row 3 should not be animated.\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Back\", the UITableView of the Root View Controller should not be scrolled vertically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The \"Second View Controller\" title is moved in from the bottom.\r\n- The size of the UIButton's in row 3 is animated (enlarged from zero size).\r\n\r\nWhen tapping \"Back\", the UITableView of the Root View Controller is scrolled vertically.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression: This worked fine in iOS 6.x.\r\n\r\nNote 1: The issue can be reproduced in this minimal Storyboard-only project on either the device (e.g. iPhone 5s) or the Simulator (32-bit or 64-bit).\r\n\r\nNote 2: To best notice the animation issues in detail, enable Slow Animations or record the screen and play back slowly."
