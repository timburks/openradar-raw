    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7.0.3, it appears that an unused UIToolbar can cause a system crash when an MKMapView is present. This crash only occurs on certain devices. It appears to only affect the iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S, and the iPod Touch 5th Generation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S, create a UIViewController that displays a map.\r\n2. In viewDidLoad of that view controller, create a black transparent UIToolbar but do nothing with it.\r\n3. When the system attempts to layout and display that viewController, it crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the view controller to display without crashing the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the attached Xcode project for a simple reproducible test case. Run the app on an iPhone 4S running iOS 7.0.3 and it should crash on launch.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 7.0.3\r\niPhone 4\r\niPhone 4S\r\niPod Touch 5th Generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ToolbarCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded."
