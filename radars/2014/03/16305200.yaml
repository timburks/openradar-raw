    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the lock screen \"pops in\" (when phone wakes) or \"pops out\" (when phone sleeps), the lock screen moves. This is despite having \"Reduce Motion\" turned on in the accessibility settings. This is new in iOS 7.1, and did not happen in iOS 7.0.x.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set lock screen image\r\n2. Turn on \"Reduce Motion\" in Settings>General>Accessibility\r\n3. Sleep phone using power button\r\n4. Lock screen background should not move as phone sleeps\r\n5. Wake phone using Home or Power button\r\n5. Lock screen background should not move at all as phone wakes up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the lock screen background image to remain still.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe lock screen background image \"breathes\" in/out as phone wakes/sleeps."
