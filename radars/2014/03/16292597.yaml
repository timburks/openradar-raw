    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling -setLength: on an NSMutableData can invalidate pointers previously returned by -bytes or -mutableBytes if the length is increased. This is not documented anywhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open NSMutableData documentation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. -setLength: should say something like \"Note: you should assume that all pointers returned from -bytes or -mutableBytes prior to sending a -setLength: message are invalidated by that message.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. No such note exists.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNSMutableData Class Reference: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSMutableData_Class/Reference/NSMutableData.html\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDocumentation problem always occurs. Crashes/data loss happen depending entirely on the state of the heap and the requested resize. \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
