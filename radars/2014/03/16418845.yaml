    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIToolbar is placed directly below the navigation bar a black shadow appears temporarily on the right side of the screen in the translucent navigation bar and the translucent tab bar when a view controller is pushed onto the navigation controller stack. \r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in iOS 7.1. The shadow does not appear if the same code is executed on iOS 7.0.\r\n\r\nThe shadow can be prevented if the background view of the UIToolbar is hidden during the view controller transition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project (BlurShadowExample)\r\n2. Run the project on either the iOS Simulator or a device running iOS 7.1\r\n3. Click the button \"push next view controller\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo shadow is visible during the view controller transition on the navigation bar and the tab bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA black show is visible during the view controller transition on the navigation bar and the tab bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEnable the statement\r\n\r\n#define HIDE_TOOLBAR_BACKGROUND_DURING_TRANSITION\r\n\r\nin THViewController.m to hide the UIToolbar background view during the view controller transition. This prevents the shadow artefact.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BlurShadowExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
