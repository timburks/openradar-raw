    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing the iOS 7.1 update, Mobile Safari on my iPad Air often crashes causing the entire device to completely reboot. This has occurred several times in just 2 days since upgrading the device to iOS 7.1 This actually seems to be worse than under 7.0.6. Other iOS devices running iOS 7.1 do not exhibit the same crashing behaviour (I have tested on iPhone 5). The crash and reboot creates a LowMemory.ips log file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Mobile Safari on iPad Air\r\n2. View websites, open new tabs, load/reload pages, utilise javascript heavy websites\r\n3. Mobile Safari crashes and iOS reboots to the 'Apple' logo and then restarts\r\n\r\nI have been able to recreate the crash/reboot fairly consistently by logging in to a corporate Outlook Web Access site (running Exchange 2010) and by either deleting a number of large no. of emails (10 or more) from the inbox in fairly quick succession and then by switching to the 'Deleted Items' view and clicking the 'Empty Deleted Items' button (there must be a large number of deleted items in the folder to be deleted). Both of these actions sometimes cause the crash/reboot. The crash did not occur under iOS 7.0.6. Another website that seems to cause the crash/reboot is www.digitalspy.co.uk - simply navigating across this site, reading articles and then swiping back to the previous page eventually causes the crash / reboot. But it is not 100% consistent or reproducible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMobile Safari should not crash and if it does crash, it should not cause the entire device to reboot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMobile Safari crashes and causes the entire device to reboot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI cannot locate any Safari specific crash logs in the Logs\\Crash Reporter\\Mobile Device directory on my Mac, even after syncing the device. The only logs are LowMemory.ips logs. There seems to be an IPS log created after each crash/reboot.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the iOS crash/reboot whilst my iPad Air was attached to my Mac running the iPhone Configuration Utility. I was deleting an email in Outlook Web Access at the time. I was able to grab the Console Log and new IPS file from the time of the crash. This is an extract of the log when the crash and reboot occurred:\r\n\r\nMar 13 14:41:34 iPad-Air MobileSafari[3436] <Warning>: Encountered an XPC error while communicating with backboardd: <error: 0x1960efcd0> { count = 1, contents =\r\n\t\t\"XPCErrorDescription\" => <string: 0x1960f0108> { length = 22, contents = \"Connection interrupted\" }\r\n\t}\r\nMar 13 14:41:34 iPad-Air kernel[0] <Debug>: virtual void IOMobileFramebuffer::swapping_client_will_stop(IOMobileFramebufferUserClient *), AppleMobileADBE0, client (0x0xffffff800103c000) going to wait on swap \r\nMar 13 14:41:34 iPad-Air kernel[0] <Debug>: virtual void IOMobileFramebuffer::swapping_client_will_stop(IOMobileFramebufferUserClient *), AppleMobileADBE0, client (0x0xffffff800103c000) exiting wait on swap \r\nMar 13 14:41:34 iPad-Air UserEventAgent[15] <Notice>: jetsam: kernel termination snapshot being created\r\nMar 13 14:41:34 iPad-Air imagent[23] <Warning>: [Warning] Unable to get entitlements for client task.
