    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are experiencing an issue with IPSec VPN. We use iOS 7.0.4 as a client and strongSwan 5.1.1 as a server. When the VPN connection is established for the first time, things are working fine. But after some time (more than hour) client gets disconnected and cannot establish connection anymore. The problem does not happen every time.\r\n\r\nWe consider it's a serious bug because when this happens, device does not have internet connectivity (because vpn is down, and profile is such that VPN must be used for all connections).\r\n\r\nOur setup is based on http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IOS_(Apple)\r\n\r\nBelow are logs from the client:\r\n\r\n00:49:21 configd[42] : IPSec Controller: IKE FAILED. phase 6, assert 0\r\n00:49:21 configd[42] : IPSec disconnecting from server xxxx\r\n00:49:21 kernel[0] : SIOCPROTODETACH_IN6: utun0 error=6\r\n00:49:21 configd[42] : network changed: v4(en0:10.64.18.135, utun0-:198.18.64.2) DNS! Proxy!\r\n00:49:21 configd[42] : network changed.\r\n00:49:21 configd[42] : SCNC: stop, triggered by (85) apsd, type IPSec, reason User Requested\r\n00:49:21 racoon[7636] : IPSec disconnecting from server xxxx\r\n00:49:21 racoon[7636] : failed to send vpn_control message: Broken pipe\r\n00:49:21 racoon[7636] : glob found no matches for path \"/var/run/racoon/*.conf\"\r\n00:49:21 mDNSResponder[50] : getExtendedFlags: SIOCGIFEFLAGS failed, errno = 6 (Device not configured)\r\n00:49:21 racoon[7636] : IPSec disconnecting from server xxxx\r\n00:49:21 racoon[7636] : pfkey DELETE failed: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this problem happens, server does not receive any packet from iOS client.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps:\r\n1) Install VPN using the attached configuration profile. VPN icon should appear\r\n2) Browse to apple.com to check if internet is working.\r\n3) Lock the device and leave device idle for an hour +\r\n4) Unlock the device. VPN icon should not be shown.\r\n5) Browse apple.com\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVPN icon will appear and apple.com will be loaded\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVPN icon does not appear, network activity indicator keeps spinning. \r\n\r\nDevice has no internet connectivity and user cannot do anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther notes:\r\n-------------------------\r\n- The server works fine with other platforms (for example, Android).\r\n\r\nRelated links:\r\n-------------------------\r\n- https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2670311\r\n- Related Mavericks issue: https://community.hide.me/threads/cisco-ipsec-and-os-x-mavericks-our-experience-and-why-its-broken.631/\r\n- We have first submitted a TSI (Ref: 603725110) and have been suggested to submit this bug report\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S, MD239KS/A, iOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\niPad mini retina, ME276KS/A, iOS 7.0.4 (11B554a) \r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n04-Mar-2014\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed."
