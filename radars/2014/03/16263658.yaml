        RadarWeb requests your Configuration and then your Version information. However, when it submits radars, it does not apply the same ordering.

        For example, in 16263601, I referenced information about my configuration in the version field.  However, the version field was inserted before the configuration, so, it doesn't make sense anymore. If I hadn't reread my report after submitting, I wouldn't have noticed, and, I imagine that people would have been confused.
