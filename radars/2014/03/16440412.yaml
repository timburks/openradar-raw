    description: "26-Mar-2014 06:51 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur beta testers keep buy new iOS devices, non stop. These take up lots of our device slots, so we only end up with about 20-30 actual testers.\r\n\r\nWe only have one app and all slots are occupied already. As we build more, this will be even more frustrating.\r\n\r\n1000 device slots, along with the current ability to clear them out annually would work far batter, and might even improve the quality of our app store releases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign up some beta testers\r\n2. Now you have no slots\r\n3. Complain on Radar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Sign up lots of beta testers\r\n2. Sign up more beta testers\r\n3. Release only 100% perfect apps every time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis radar and presumably the ones it's duplicating.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"

    title: A device limit of 1000 instead of 100 would really help us out.
