    description: "I'm repeatedly calling sizeThatFits: on an NSAttributedString that has a paragraph style with a non-zero hyphenationFactor. It doesn't always crash, even under identical use, but it crashes fairly often on iOS 6.1, 7.0 and 7.1.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project. Just start the app in the Simulator, and tap the Start button repeatedly. Will eventually crash in both the Simulator and on a device.\r\n\r\nNo crash.\r\n\r\nCrash about 10% ~ 20% of the time.\r\n\r\niOS Simulator, iPad 3, iPad mini, iPad 2, iPad 4\r\n\r\niOS 6.1.3, 7.0, 7.0.2, 7.0.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.6, 7.1"
