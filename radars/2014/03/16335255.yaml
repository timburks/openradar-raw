    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the tintColor of UITextField this has no effect on the cursor or the color of a selection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new Single Page Application.\r\n2. Add UITextField to Main Storyboard and only view in there.\r\n3. Set tintColor of field to red.\r\n4. Start app on 7.1 and see that it has no effect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTintColor should affect the cursor and selection color (in this situation red).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor and selection color do not change, but stay in their standard blue color.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (I have also tested on a device which runs 7.0 and it is correctly showing red there)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs."
