    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 6 and earlier, if you set delaysContentTouches to NO on a UITableView, then touch events in table cells are handled immediately in the cell with no delay, as expected. In iOS 7, however, touches in table cells are always delayed, regardless of the delaysContentTouches setting. The behavior should be the same as in pre-iOS 7 table views, so that controls in table cells can give feedback to touches immediately.\r\n\r\nI have attached an Xcode project that demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode.\r\n2. Run the project in an iOS 7 simulator.\r\n3. Click on the button in the top table cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button should immediately change to its highlighted state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button changes to its highlighted state after a delay.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7/GM seed 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you switch to using an iOS 6 simulator, the button changes to the highlighted state immediately, as expected. So this appears to be a change related to iOS 7."
