    description: "There is a way to delete an app in iTunes Connect mentioned in the documentation (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html).\r\nThere should be a delete button even. But there is none! The status of my app is 'Prepare for Upload' and has no Game Center connection (I can edit the bundle id).\r\nIt should be possible to delete an unused app in iTunes Connect to avoid clutter."
