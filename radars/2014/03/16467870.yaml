    description: "Kevin Meaney30-Mar-2014 04:23 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI've not been able to get the inputBacksideImage key for the CIPageCurlTransition CoreImage filter to assign an image. I've had no trouble applying it for the CIPageCurlWithShadowTransition filter. In the CIPageCurlTransition filter all the other options work as expected just not the inputBacksideImage.\r\n\r\nI've attached a single source file that you can use to create a command line tool to demonstrate the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using Xcode 5.1on OS X 10.9.2\r\n2. Create a New Project/Application/Command line tool\r\n3. Replace the contents of main.m with the contents of the attached file.\r\n4. Add an argument passed on launch to the tool scheme run section. This argument is a path to where you want the generated image to be saved.\r\n5. Run the tool.\r\n6. Look at the generated image. Notice that there is no backside image. The backside image should be a blue triangle on a green background.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the inputBacksideImage applied to the filter should be visible on the reverse side of the page being turned over in the CIPageCurlTransition.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo image on the reverse side of the turned page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2. Xcode 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 9,1. \r\nmain.m - configuration file has been successfully uploaded\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'main.m' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nThe contents of main.m can be viewed at: https://gist.github.com/SheffieldKevin/9873485"
