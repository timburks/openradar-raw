    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the page where you view an iOS app’s details, the 4-Inch Retina Display Screenshots are squished to be the same size as the 3.5-Inch Retina Display Screenshots, resulting in stretching.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in to https://itunesconnect.apple.com\r\n2. Click Manage Your Apps.\r\n3. Click an app. In my case, it takes me to the URL https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wo/73.0.7.3.0.9.3.11.11.3.0.4.0.1\r\n4. Click View Details for a version of the app. In my case, it is an app that is Waiting For Review (at the time of this writing) at URL https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wo/74.0.0.7.3.0.9.3.3.1.0.13.3.1.1.11.9.1.1.7.0 (attached as Screenshot 1).\r\n5. Note shape and size of screenshots.\r\n6. Click Edit next to Metadata and Uploads. In my case, this takes me to https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wo/74.0.0.7.3.0.9.3.3.1.0.13.3.1.1.11.9.1.1.7.0 and is attached as Screenshot 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 3.5-inch and 4-inch screenshots are shown in the correct aspect ratio, and are the correct size relative to each other (in other words, the same width, and the 4-inch ones are taller than the 3.5-inch ones).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the first page, the 4-inch screenshots are the same width and height as the 3.5-inch ones, which causes them to appear distorted. The circular shapes in the third app screenshot in the attached files make this particularly apparent - they are squished and ellipsoidal.\r\n\r\nOn the second page, the images all appear to be the correct aspect ratio, and there is no distortion. However, the 4-Inch Retina Display Screenshots are the same height as the 3-inch ones, but are narrower, so they appear smaller than their 3.5-inch counterparts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nReproduced in:\r\nSafari 6.0.5 (8536.30.1)\r\nChrome 29.0.1547.65\r\nFirefox 23.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttaching the two screenshots that I mentioned, plus all of my app’s screenshots that I uploaded to iTunes Connect so you can compare the original files to how they are rendered in the browser.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe screenshots appear correctly in the App Store on devices and in iTunes, as well as in the app’s online listing: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/padiddle/id588582342?ls=1&mt=8\r\n\r\nThey appear distorted only iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSample screenshots: http://cl.ly/UJLo"
