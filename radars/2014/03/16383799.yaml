    description: "Summary:\r\nCommand clicking or option-clicking-then-selecting-jump-to-definition on a method signature or selector jumps to an implementation in another target, not the desired implementation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode project with a class in it, with at least two methods. Have method1 call method2, so you can jump to definition within the implementation file.\r\n2. Create a new target, and create a new implementation (.m) of that class.\r\n3. Jump to the definition of method2 from method1 from the first target.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJumping to the definition of method2 from method1 should jump to method2's implementation in target1, or at least provide a list of available targets to choose from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost of the time, jumping to the definition of method2 from method1 in target 1 jumps to method 2's definition in target 2."
