    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen playing media via the Movies or TV Shows channels on Apple TV the media is always streamed over the Internet. In order to play a locally cached copy of iTunes media on a local computer the viewer has to know to go to the Computers channel. If a local and authorized computer is on the network and it's got a local copy of the media that has been selected to play the local copy should be used rather than streaming over the Internet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. purchase Season 1 of the Fox television show Almost Human on the iTunes Store (either via the Apple TV or in iTunes on a Mac).\r\n2. On the local Mac that is authorized to share with the Apple TV download all episodes of Almost Human.\r\n3. After all episodes of Almost Human are downloaded to the Mac got the Apple TV to view an episode\r\n4. Navigate on the Apple TV to TV Shows > Purchased > All > Almost Human > Episode 1\r\n5. Select \"Play\" to begin viewing the episode\r\n6. Notice that even though you've already downloaded the episode on the Mac the Apple TV starts buffering the episode from a server over the Internet.\r\n7. Wait as buffering takes more time and bandwidth than needed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf a local computer is already authorized and synced to an Apple TV the Apple TV should always check the local computer for local copies of the media files it's trying to play. This will reduce bandwidth usage and increase the time to viewing for Apple TV users.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvery time the user does not navigate to the Computers channel the Apple TV penalizes them by streaming over the Internet when a local copy of the media file exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n- Apple TV 3rd generation\r\n- OS version 6.1\r\n- wired ethernet connection\r\n- local Mac running OS X 10.9.2 and iTunes v11 \r\n- local copy of media in iTunes library on Mac"
