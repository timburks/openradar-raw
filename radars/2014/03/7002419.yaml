    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI would like to have the ability to allow users to enter phone numbers into a UITextField. Setting the keyboard type to UIKeyboardTypePhonePad works great, but I would like the contents of the field to automatically be formatted according to the user's locale. Thus, if the user types 1234567890, it would automatically be formatted as (123) 456-7890, just like is done in the contacts application.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add this functionality? Either with an NSFormatter class or with a property on the UITextField? Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
