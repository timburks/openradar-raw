        Summary:
        -[NSDateFormatter dateFromString:] returns nil when an iPhone is set to 24hr time. The same code works in 12hr time, and -[NSDateFormatter getObjectValue:forString:range:error:] works as expected in both cases.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set your device to 24 hr time (Settings, General, Date & Time, set 24-Hour Time to ON).
        2. Build and run the linked sample project on the device.

        Expected Results:
        The app should not break, and the console log should display the values of both variables.

        Actual Results:
        The app breaks on line 39: "NSAssert(dateFromString, @"Value returned from -dateFromString should not be nil");"

        Regression:
        Turning the 24-Hour Time switch OFF will cause the app to run successfully.
