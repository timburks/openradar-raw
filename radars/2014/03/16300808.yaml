    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UIWebView is created and put in a navigation controller, then presented modal and dismissed.  It should clear all memory after it deallocates but it's adding 200-500kb in heap growth every time it's presented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached test project\r\n2. Run in Instruments with allocations\r\n3. Get a baseline in instruments, mark the generation\r\n4. Press test in the app, wait till the page loads then close it.\r\n5. Mark the generation in Instruments\r\n6. Repeat as needed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect little to no heap growth once the web view deallocates.  If it is caching the url request, that should go too.  I've cleared the NSURL cache and that has no affect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe heap grows by about 200-500 kb, I'm seeing 1mb in a real app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 and 7.1 with Xcode 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExact problem on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20234462/uiwebview-leaks-js-garbage-collector-webcore-vms\r\n\r\nSample project on bit bucket: https://bitbucket.org/tassinari/mtwebviewtest"
