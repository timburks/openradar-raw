    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen our app sends out a local notification a sound file is attached to it.  If it is accepted from the locked screen (by flicking \"slide to accept\"), the app comes to the foreground as expected, but the sound continues to play.  After about 30 seconds, it will stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou should be able to reproduce it with the attached sample project file(LocalNotificationSample).\r\nAfter installing the app to your device, but before starting it\r\n1) Make sure the sound is turned on for the application's Local Notifications in the ios' Settings.\r\n2) Make sure a passcode is not required for unlocking the screen\r\n\r\nNow,\r\n3) Start the app,\r\n4) When the white view displays, turn the device's screen off by pressing the device's Power button.\r\n5) After about 5 seconds, the device should display a local notification with a sound file playing. \r\n6) Accept the notification by sliding the \"slide to accept\" button from the locked screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application will come to the foreground and the sound that the local notification was playing will end.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application will come to the foreground and the sound that the local notification was playing continues to play for about 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iPhone5s/5/4s\r\nall running ios 7.1.0 (latest version)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem originally appeared for us with our VoIP application when answering incoming calls.  But we have since reproduced it in the attached sample application.  \r\n\r\nWe have not been able to come up with a workaround yet, so any assistance or support you may be able to provide us will be totally appreciated.  \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt seems to occur only when a local notification is accepted from a locked screen.\r\nIt does not occur if the screen is locked with passcode.\r\nIt does not occur if the notification is accepted with the \"slide to unlock\" button.\r\nIt does not occur if the notification is accepted from an unlocked screen, (ie., the app is in the background because the \"home\" button was pressed.)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LocalNotificationSample-console_output.txt' and 'LocalNotificationSample.zip' were successfully uploaded."
