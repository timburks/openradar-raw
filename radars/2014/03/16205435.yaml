    description: "Summary:\r\nSimply reading the topLayoutGuide property on a view controller alters properties on the view in that view controller. Because of this, there are cases where it can cause the scrolling behaviour of table views to break.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass of UIViewController\r\n2. In -[UIViewController loadView], create a UITableView and set the receiver's view property to be equal to this created table view. Also set up the view controller to be the data source and delegate of the table view, just to keep things simple.\r\n3. In any method, but just for consistency with the docs, in -[UIViewController viewDidLayoutSubviews] call \"self.topLayoutGuide\". It doesn't matter what you do with the return type, just access the getter.\r\n4. Make sure that your data source is returning enough cells to require scrolling, say 50.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the scroll view that makes up the table view to scroll to see all of the cells.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen you try to scroll, observe that the table view can be pulled up, but as soon as you release it bounces back to the initial position, i.e. it cannot really be scrolled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7"
