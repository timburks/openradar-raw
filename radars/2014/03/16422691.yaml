    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iCloud website bizarrely automatically logs me out after a few minutes of inactivity even when \"Remember me\" is checked.  This completely defeats the purpose of having that checkbox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Enter your login credentials.\r\n2.  Check \"Remember me\".\r\n3.  Put the window in the background.\r\n4.  Open a new iCloud window an hour later.\r\n5.  Swear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to remember my login credentials and not ask for them again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBecause of the background window logged me out, it asks for the credentials again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS: OS X v10.8 (Safari)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari (OS X v10.8).  Probably occurs everywhere.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
