    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, one cannot use \"Open Quickly…\" (⌘⇧O) to directly open an image that exists inside of an Asset Catalog. This used to be a great way to quickly open any resource in your Xcode project. With the addition of Asset Catalogs in Xcode 5, it has become much more difficult to quickly view an image in your project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an Xcode 5 project that contains an Asset Catalog.\r\n2. Find an image inside of the asset catalog.\r\n3. From the file menu, select \"Open Quickly…\"\r\n4. Type the name of the image in your asset catalog. The image does not appear in the Open Quickly menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the asset to appear in the \"Open Quickly\" menu. Selecting that asset would jump to the Asset Catalog and select that particular asset in the catalog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image asset does not appear in the Open Quickly menu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
