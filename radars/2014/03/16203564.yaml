    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I pull up View > Show View Options in Finder, the View Options palette initially shows the name of the current folder in its title bar. However, if I am in a Finder window using column browser view (View > as Columns), the View Options palette doesn't update to refer to each subsequent folder I click on within the window. Most often it remains labeled as pertaining to the original folder that I was in when I invoked the palette; but sometimes instead the palette's title bar shows my user home folder or my computer's root (the folder that contains the boot volume).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a folder in Finder.\r\nSelect View > as Columns.\r\nSelect View > Show View Options. (Note the current folder's name appears in the View Options palette's title bar.)\r\nSelect another folder in the same Finder window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe View Options palette should show the name of the currently-selected folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe View Options palette does not show the name of the currently-selected folder. Sometimes it shows the name of my user home folder; other times it shows \"atuyka\" (the name of my Mac).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe problem only occurs when I have the Finder window set to view in Column mode; it doesn't happen when viewing as Icons, List, or Cover Flow. In those view modes, the palette updates whenever I open new folders.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
