    description: "Summary:\r\nThe background color of a NSTextField label can be set via Interface Builder to other values than \"Control Color\". Since OS X 10.9.2, this setting isn't respected anymore and all labels have a clear background color. This only applies when the parent view of the label is Core Animation layer-enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag a new label onto a view in Interface Builder (IB).\r\n2. Set the background color of the label to something other than the default \"Control Color\", for example to \"Text Color\"\r\n3. Switch the label's border type to another border type and back again to reflect the background color changes in IB (another bug?). Note that the color has been changed correctly in IB.\r\n4. Set the view to be layer-backed by checking its \"Core Animation Layer\" checkbox on the \"View Effects\" inspector tab\r\n5. Build and Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label should now have a black (\"Text Color\") background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label has a transparent background, i.e. it isn't affected by the changed background color property.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis problem occurred with OS X 10.9.2, it used to work from at least OS X 10.8. until 10.9.1"
