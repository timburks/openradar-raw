    description: "Xcode has a useful functionality to copy attributes or relationships from the Core Data model editor and paste the declaration or implementation into the source file. While documented in the Model Editor Help, it's not very discoverable. In my experience, adding attributes and relationships is not a frequent occurrence after initial model generation so it's easy to forget the mechanics for this powerful feature \"hidden\" in the innocuously standard \"Copy\" menu item.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request a \"Copy {Attribute,Relationship}\" menu item be added to the Editor menu when editing a Core Data model. While this _does_ effectively duplicate functionality, it should also serve to make it more discoverable when trying to find possible actions upon the model.\r\n\r\nA contextual menu item when an attribute or relationship is selected would also be welcome.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily wed to the suggested implementation, I'd just like to not forget the feature exists any more. :^)"
