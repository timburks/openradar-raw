    description: "On iOS 7.1, we have started seeing erroneous behavior of Core Bluetooth. We will scan for a service, find an appropriate peripheral (and successfully connect to it), remember its identifier, and save it. A few moments later another part of the app will attempt to retrieve the peripheral by the identifier, and CBCentralManager will provide an empty array (claiming there is no peripheral known by that identifier). Our code will then go back to scanning, and the process repeats.\r\n\r\nWhen Core Bluetooth is in this state, the Bluetooth pane in Settings will show a bonded peripheral (Bluetooth LE) as “Accessory”, seemingly like it also became disassociated. Cycling Bluetooth power will restore the normal behavior of Core Bluetooth and the peripheral name in Settings will return, but this state can come back in several hours. (See attached screenshots.)\r\n\r\nWe have observed this behavior both on peripherals that were bonded on when the device was running iOS 7.0.4 and then updated to 7.1, as well as when the bond was established directly on 7.1. We have tried “Reset Network Settings”, but the problem still returns."
