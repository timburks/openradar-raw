    description: "Summary:\r\nThe way that TextEdit (and all other applications using Cocoa's default text formatting system and menu commands) handle the Superscript and Subscript commands is incorrect, compared to the Pages application from the iWorks suite, which handles them correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPerform the following steps in TextEdit:\r\n\r\n1. Launch TextEdit, create a new document\r\n2. Type the \"H\" key\r\n3. Select in Format | Font | Baseline | Subscript\r\n4. Type the \"2\" key -- observe it appears below the H character's baseline (but with the same size)\r\n5. Select in Format | Font | Baseline | Subscript (Again)\r\n6. Type the \"2\" key -- observe it appears below the preview 2 character's baseline (with the same size still)\r\n\r\nPerform the following steps in Pages:\r\n\r\n1. Launch Pages, create a new document\r\n2. Type the \"H\" key\r\n3. Select in Format | Font | Baseline | Subscript\r\n4. Type the \"2\" key -- observe it appears below the H character's baseline and with a much smaller font\r\n5. Select in Format | Font | Baseline | Subscript -- notice it now has a checkmark, so it can't be \"selected\" again\r\n6. Type the \"2\" key -- observe it appears on the same baseline (and with the same size) as the original \"H\" character\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe behaviour of the Superscript and Subscript commands should be the same in both TextEdit and Pages and specifically, the menu commands should operate as a toggle -- hit once to enable the super / sub script modes, hit again to turn it off (as it does in Pages).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe behaviour of the Superscript and Subscript commands are not the same in both TextEdit and Pages. Specifically, the menu commands do not operate as a toggle in TextEdit and instead are cumulative with each invocations, which makes no sense as there no such thing as multi-level super and sub script commands."
