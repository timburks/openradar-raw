    description: "Summary:\r\nApps which have no interest in capturing audio still incur energy waste for processing audio.\r\n\r\nIn my usage scenario (see sample) I am connecting the back-facing camera with a capture session and a metadata detector output for scanning barcodes. I have no interest in audio. Yet, in the Energy Diagnostics Instrument the \"Audio Processing\"  bars hover around 20%.\r\n\r\nFrom this I infer that Audio Processing is occurring even though it wouldn't have to. There does not appear any way for a developer to indicate to iOS that audio should be ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the provided sample app in Xcode\r\n2. Profile it with the \"Energy Diagnostics\" Instrument\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Audio Processing (blue) portion of CPU Activity should be near 0%.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio Processing is around 20% on an iPhone 5S.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease give information if this is intended behavior. Would it be a good enhancement to request to be able to instruct AV Foundation to ignore audio for barcode scanning scenarios like this?"
