    description: "Summary:\r\nThe MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter design is functional, but not very practical for anyone who actually still uses their existing computers.  The design could be significantly improved by adding a rubber snap clip so that you can snap the adapter onto the side of the cable for storage.  That way, when you're using your older machines, the adapter doesn't get lost.  Right now, the only way to deal with this involves gluing something to the side of the adapter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Buy a new machine.\r\n2.  Buy the adapter and use it with your new machine.\r\n3.  Plug your old machine into the power supply.\r\n4.  Lose the adapter.\r\n5.  Swear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI expected the adapter to be designed in such a way that you can fasten it permanently to the cable so that it won't get lost.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
