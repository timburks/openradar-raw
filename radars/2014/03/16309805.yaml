    description: "When the user pinches to show home screen via 3-4 finger gesture the animation should track exactly with finger movements. Simultaneously the home screen icons should fly into view as the application image representation fades into the center. The tracking should allow for the user to revert the gesture mid-movement as well\r\n\r\nIn iOS 6.x (see my old bug) this behavior was nearly perfect. Tracking w finger worked 95% through the animation frames available. It would pop the last 5% but otherwise worked great. Only very picky visually examining users would likely ever see that pop though so it was mostly OK.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7.0 this gesture and it's animation tracking w fingers was pretty badly broken. The last aprox 30% of the animation would fail to track at all and the icons flying in from the edges would get \"stuck\"\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7.1 the gesture tracks perfectly w finger to allow the currently running app to fade into the center. However the icons from the home screen do not track onto the screen from the outsides at all during this. They simply are not rendered. After the user releases their fingers w the gesture recognized and only after that suddenly the icons fly in after the fact. In a sense iOS 7.1 update has fixed 50% of what was broken in iOS 7.0 bug and made entirely worse the other 50% of the operation.\r\n\r\nWorst of all though the iOS 7.1 pinch to show home screen gesture has effectively  now been turned into a two stage operation. 1) shrink current app to center 1a) release 2) watch icons settle on home screen. Which means it takes longer time wise than it did before, feels worse disconnected and looks visually as if your gesture is laggard in it's responsiveness.\r\n\r\nIf this is by design (a new design) it appears visually inconsistent with home screen button presses which would be the most likely visual comparison. When home button is pressed on iPhone or iPad regularly icons fly in from edges as home screen settles WHILE the app icon shrinks into itself (or folder). The point is that current app shrink and icon fly in from sides are two things that have always been unified together animation wise with in iOS for it's history until the iOS 7.1 pinch to show home screen gesture which makes them into two stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nI'm a former employee and I wrote a but on this in the past as well. You can look that up under my name Noel Cornell I would expect.\r\n\r\nI hope this comes back assigned quickly and accurately as a duplicate. ;)\r\n\r\nOne thing that personally bothers me is that some folks like this new broken animation or think it's better.\r\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/03/refinements-additions-and-un-breaking-stuff-ios-7-1-reviewed/"
