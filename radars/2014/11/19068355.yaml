    description: "It would be VERY useful to be able to force a window to stay on top of all the other windows, in the OS X UI.\r\n\r\nYou used to be able to do this with 3rd-party software on OS X and you can do it now with 3rd-party software on Windows, and natively on Linux (see screenshot)\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to have stuff like docs on the top window, and still be able to type in windows underneath."
