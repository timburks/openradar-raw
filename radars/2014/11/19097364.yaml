    description: "Summary:\r\nAny OS X computer with iCloud and Find My Mac enabled is forced to allow itself to be remotely wiped by anyone with access to your iCloud account.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn OS X there is no way to disable the Remote Wipe feature without also disabling Find My Mac.\r\n\r\nFind My Mac is a fantastic feature that allows people to find their lost or stolen property.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use this though you are forced to allow anyone with access to your iCloud account to entirely wipe your computer!\r\n\r\nRequiring that enabling Find My Mac also enables remote wipe has NO security benefit.\r\nIf you turn FFM (Find My Mac) off you lose valuable features and the ability to track lost of stolen devices.\r\n\r\nForcing people to choose between being safe from a hacker completely destroying their digital world and being safe from a thief is not a choice OS X users should have to make.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen System Preferences > iCloud and disable remote wipe.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can enable Find My Mac and disable remote wipe.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are given no choice and ability to turn off remote wipe.\r\n\r\nIf you want protection from thief (for desktop computers unlikely) you are forced to give a hacker the ability to (temporarily) destroy your computer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese problems are important as if they occur to you they can completely devastate your digital life.\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/"
