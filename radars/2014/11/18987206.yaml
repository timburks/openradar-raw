    description: "Summary:\r\ndisplay: table-cell; doesn't quite work correctly when resizing the browser window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://jsbin.com/laracu/2 in Safari.\r\n2. Ensure that the window is fairly wide, such that the nav menu displays horizontally. If not, resize the window to be wider and reload the webpage.\r\n2. Resize the window to be narrower (mobile-ish width), until the nav menu starts displaying vertically.\r\n3. Resize the window to be wider, until the nav menu stops displaying vertically.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav menu should return to its original, expected appearance (i.e. one row of evenly spaced items), \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe nav menu displays as two rows, the first having 4 items and the second having two items (screenshot C).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari version 8.0 (10600.1.25)\r\nOS X Yosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso filed as https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138167\r\nPossibly related to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113839 and/or https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53166\r\nOriginal Bootstrap bug: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9774\r\nChrome and Firefox render the nav menu correctly in these circumstances. Chrome used to also exhibit this same bug, but has since fixed it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'table-cell.png' was successfully uploaded."
