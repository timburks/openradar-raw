    description: "Summary:\r\nThe field nodes returned by the electricField, magneticField and customFieldWithEvaluationBlock: don't do anything. In particular, the evaluation block for the custom field is never called, even when there is a node with a compatible fieldBitMask within the field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Sprite Kit project.\r\n2. In the scene's didMoveToView method, create a node with a physics body and add it to the scene.\r\n3. In the scene's didMoveToView method, create a custom field node with an evaluation block that prints a statement to the log and then returns a constant vector. Add the field to the scene.\r\n4. Run the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMany repeated log statements that indicate that the block has been called, and the node moving according to the vector returned by the block.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing."
