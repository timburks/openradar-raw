    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UIAutomation script in Instruments to automate an extension, the script doesn't run. The status always stays on 'Script is stopped'.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Instruments and select a keyboard extension hosted by the application of your choice that requires text input\r\n2. Select the 'Automation' template\r\n3. Write a custom script or use the ui-auto-monkey script (https://github.com/jonathanpenn/ui-auto-monkey)\r\n4. Hit the record button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script should, as on every usual application, be executed. The extension should be automated according to the script.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe script isn't run. The extension isn't automated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nInstruments: Version 6.1 (56160)\r\nXcode: Version 6.1 (6A1052d)\r\niOS: 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm doing this on Yosemite 10.10 but I'm assuming that this is reproducible on any version\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
