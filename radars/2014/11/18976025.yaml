    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider the following XML:\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\" ?>\r\n<!-- comment1 -->\r\n<!DOCTYPE xxx SYSTEM \"XXX\" [\r\n\t<!-- comment2 -->\r\n\t<!ENTITY blah SYSTEM \"BLAH\" NDATA note>\r\n\t<!NOTATION note PUBLIC \"my notation\">\r\n\t<!ELEMENT xxx (#PCDATA)>\r\n]>\r\n<xxx>some text</xxx>\r\n\r\nNSXMLParser does not have a means of indicating it has entered the DOCTYPE stanza, which means that I can't tell whether comment2 is part of the DOCTYPE or part of the XML body.\r\n\r\nMy app parses and reformats XML documents, so this information is crucial.\r\n\r\nI thought that I could perhaps use NSXMLDocument instead (even though I lose all the benefits of the streaming parser), however, it has a different problem which means I can't get back the notations (see bug report 18975903) so that isn't a meaningful workaround.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project and view the console output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be some indicator that the DOCTYPE has been entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe foundComment method is called, but with no context to indicate we are inside (or outside) the DOCTYPE\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A389)"
