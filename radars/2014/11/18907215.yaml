    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile troubleshooting an iOS issue I hit Reset Network Settings.  This apparently removes all the wireless networks from the keychain as a part of its magic.  Unfortunately, the Keychain was synced to iCloud and my computers to that so ALL my wireless networks across ALL my computers were deleted as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected iOS' reset to be local-only.  I expected it to pull down the passwords from iCloud again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt pushed the deletions TO iCloud, instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n[redacted]@mac.com (iOS 8.1, OS X 10.10)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suppose if one were to turn off Keychain sync before this and then on afterwards it would have the desired effect.  Perhaps that can be emulated behind the scenes?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 8.1, OS X 10.10."
