    description: "Frequently I'll want to work on a number of files that are not located in the same group/folder in the Project navigator. It would be nice if I could tag these files and filter files by tags.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are few ways to work around the lack of tagging.\r\n\r\n 1. Show only recent files. The number of recent files shown is usually too large. Also, editing a file will add it to recents, which can result most of the files being files you don't actually care about.\r\n 2. Show files with a source-control status. This works pretty well, until you commit and lose all your files.\r\n 3. Show files with matching name. This works very well if all the files have similar names and doesn't work at all if they don't."
