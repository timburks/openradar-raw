    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using a shortcut to my home directory in my dock which is displayed as folder and it's content as a list. Since I've updated my system to the latest OSX Version (10.10 / Yosemite) the last element in the list is shown multiple times (first twice, then three times, ... and so on).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag & Drop your Home folder to the dock\r\n2. Configure it to Display as \"Folder\" and View content as \"List\"\r\n3. Sometimes the last element will be shown multiple times (very often but it takes some time for the bug to occur).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder should be only shown once like in the real filesystem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folder is shown multiple times.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10 (14A389)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm having this issue on two different machines.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2014-11-09 at 22.18.39.png' was successfully uploaded."
