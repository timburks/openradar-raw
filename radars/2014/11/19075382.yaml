    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm attempting to test Notifications for a WatchKit app. I have setup my project as described in the documentation.\r\n \r\nWhen running a Notifications scheme for a Watch App, I get the following message in the simulator's watch interface:\r\n\r\nUnhandled Category\r\nNotification category \"(null)\" not found. Define this category or a default category in your storyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nShort version: Try running the “Notifications - Notifications Watch App” scheme in the attached demo project. (https://www.dropbox.com/s/oo4rdc7sihitdt4/Notifications.zip?dl=0)\r\n\r\nLong version:\r\nIn my storyboard, I have interfaces for 2 notification types, each with static and dynamic versions. I have given them the Notification Category names of category1 and category2. Then in my PushNotificationPayload.json file, I have specified the payload's category as category1. Running the scheme for WatchKit notifications does not display any UI, and instead claims that the category (null) was not found.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Notification UI that corresponds to the category supplied in the JSON file is displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhat is displayed instead is:\r\n\r\nUnhandled Category\r\nNotification category \"(null)\" not found. Define this category or a default category in your storyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n(Side Note: the documentation mentions the test file as being named \"RemoteNotificationPayload.json\", while Xcode 6.2 (6C86e) creates one called \"PushNotificationPayload.json\" when creating a Watch App target from the provided template.)"
