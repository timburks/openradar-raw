    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a sample project that demonstrates that an NSButton set to either the NSMomentaryChangeButton or NSSwitchButton button type does not behave correctly on OS X 10.10, or at least, does not behave the same as on OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf you open the attached project samples in OS X 10.9 / 10.10, as per the project archive file names, you will see that the behavior of the 3rd button in each row is different in 10.10 vs. the same button running on 10.9.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, on the first row, the 3rd button (set to NSMomentaryChangeButton) never shows the alternate text or image. It just goes blank when clicked on.\r\n\r\nOn the second row, the 3rd button (set to NSSwitchButton) does show the alternate text and image, but only when the mouse button is released. While the button is depressed, the button also goes blank, which it does not do when running on OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlthough the buttons' appearances are different in 10.9 vs. 10.10, I expect the behaviour of the different button types to remain consistent on both systems.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe behaviour of the different button types do not remain consistent on both systems.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1 (6A1052d) / OS X 10.10.1 (14B25) / OS X 10..5 (13F34)"
