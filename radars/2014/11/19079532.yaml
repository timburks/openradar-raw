    description: "Summary:\r\nPresenting UIImagePickerController in a popover changes the status bar and also doesn't reset it.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s an animated gif of the issue: http://cl.ly/image/393x3M2B1V1u\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the example, watch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA popover should never modify the status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popover messes with the status bar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks as expected in iOS 7. The example needs to be modified to use UIPopoverController, but the behavior on iOS 8 is the same broken one.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample is in Swift for extra fun :)"
