    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Safari's remote Web Inspector is connected to a UIWebView on an iOS device, it causes the UIWebView to retain memory when the web view repeatedly requests the same resource. Eventually, the available memory is exhausted and the application crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page in a UIWebView which repeatedly requests an image (image/jpeg) resource. The image may be uncacheable (Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate; Pragma: no-cache; Expires: 0).\r\n2. Attach Instruments to the application with an Allocations instrument. \r\n3. Attach Safari's remote Inspector to the UIWebView.\r\n4. Wait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMemory usage remains flat over time. No crash is observed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 2, memory usage is flat. After step 3, it begins to increase in a sawtooth pattern. Eventually, several low memory warnings are issued then the application crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2; Safari 6.0.5; Instruments 5.0 (51166). Also reproducible in iOS Simulator 7.0 (463.9.4).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClosing the Safari web inspector window releases the extra memory.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUIWebView must be configured to allow the remote debugger (developer extras)."
