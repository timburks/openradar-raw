    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running on multihead systems, it is really disturbing to have the menu bar appear above fullscreen applications when switching the focus to another application.\r\n\r\nE.g. when running a (YouTube HTML5) video in fullscreen in Google Chrome, clicking an Adium or Finder window on another screen shows the menu bar above Chrome, too. This disturbs the video viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is not consistent with CMD+Tab usage, switching to some application (like Adium), the menu bar does not appear most of the time, switching to Finder, it appears every time.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the menu bar should never appear above fullscreened applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a YouTube video full screen in Google Chrome on one display\r\n2. Open a Finder window on another display\r\n3. Switch between them with CMD+Tab\r\n4. Switch between them with clicking\r\n5. Observe the Menu Bar popping up above the video\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the menu bar to never show above the fullscreened video content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, the menu bar of the application I switched to gets drawn on top of the video, sometimes it doesn't.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nThis might be related to bugs 19089360 and 19089371"
