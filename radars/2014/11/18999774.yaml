        Summary:
        In the code template for a UICollectionViewController (both Swift and Objective-C), cell classes are automatically registered (within the viewDidLoad). If you use a storyboard (the default way), this results in the CollectionViewCells not being displayed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. create a new Cocoa Touch Class, based on UICollectionViewController
        2. hook the new class up to a Collection View Controller on your storyboard
        3. make sure numberOfSectionsInCollectionView and numberOfItemsInSection are not 0
        4. run

        Expected Results:
        the default code should work, in a default situation.

        Actual Results:
        collectionViewCell(s) will not get displayed, despite numberOfSectionsInCollectionView and numberOfItemsInSection not being 0

        Regression:
        -

        Notes:
        It would be better to change the template code of the UICollectionViewController, so that this line is commented out by default, or if thereâ€™s a comment line above. (The former would be better, I think)
