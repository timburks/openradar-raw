    description: "Summary:\r\nWorking on an application for a client, we observed issues getting location points. The general goal is to use SLC to track how much kilometres a user do in order to offer vouchers in client application (1km = 1point). Also the tracking is not supposing affect too much the battery usage.\r\n\r\nTo analyse the problem, we have recreated a sample application logging only the locations reported using Significant Location Changes (SLC) - see 2014_11_04_DebugLocation__S2M_Landsberger_S42_Landsberger_S2M.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install sample app and grant location permissions\r\n2. Driving in a city (i.e. Berlin, Germany, see attached data) where cell towers coverage is intense\r\n3. Analyse logged data (locations reported, compare with actual run).\r\n\r\n- 2 Devices (SIM card with data plan)\r\n/ same Urban track around Berlin\r\n- Around 40 Km\r\n- One device Standalone in background (Device 541, device locked, no power supply...)\r\n- One device Standalone killed within the app switcher before starting the test run (Device 497, device locked, no power supply...) \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expected to get more and close location points (500m interval as documentation states) to determine the number of kilometres done.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA map of presenting real drive done (GoogleEarth.kmz)\r\nEach device folder contains the following data:\r\n/ The app from the device (.xcappdata)\r\n/ The log from the app (.log)\r\n/ The console log (console_log)\r\n/ An info summary (\"Info.txt\")\r\n\r\nOnly a hand full of locations have been logged on all devices. Even on the one which has been killed before test run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.x, see test data for accurate version\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
