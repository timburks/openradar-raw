        Summary:
        We have a web-based chat app that plays sounds in response to certain test commands. Tested locally, this feature works in Safari 8.0. Using the deployed version (served via Amazon Cloudfront) the sounds do not play.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Load an HTML page with <audio autoplay> tags in it.
        2. Listen to the sound play.

        Expected Results:
        The sound plays.

        Actual Results:
        The sound does not play.

        Regression:
        This appears to work normally in Chrome stable and dev. It works in Safari when the sound file is loaded locally; it does not play when the sound is loaded from the server.

        Notes:
        The sound file is attached, but it can also one remotely accessed from https://chat.vokalinteractive.com/build/sounds/open_chest.mp3.
