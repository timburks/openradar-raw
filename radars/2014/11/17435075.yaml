    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous iOS versions, changing the preferredContentSize of a view controller that is the topViewController of a UINavigationController, which in turn is in a UIPopoverController, would cause the popover controller to resize. Similarly pushing a new view controller onto the UINavigationController stack, would cause the UINavigationController to resize, if it's content size was not large enough. This no longer happens with iOS 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an run the attached PopoverContentSizeTest project. \r\nRun the example on iOS 7 and iOS 8 and compare the different popover sizing behaviors by pressing the various UIBarButton items. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS 8 behavior should match more closely that of iOS 7. Ideally, popping the navigation controller would also shrink the popover, which does not occur automatically on neither OS version. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe popover controller does not resize on iOS 8. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8, beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
