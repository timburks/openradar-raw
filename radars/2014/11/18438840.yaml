    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running on the iPhone 6 Plus simulator (@3x mode), a UIIMageView positioned on a 0.5point coordinate and a layer border draws the assigned image outside of the border. Both the border and image appear sharp, they are just positioned on different pixels.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the example project and run it on the iPhone 6 Plus simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth the image and border would be aligned on the same pixel. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alignment differs (the image is positioned 1px outside of the border). \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0, Xcode 6.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPossible workarounds are to enable clipping on the image view or to position it on pixel boundaries (not always possible). \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus simulator"
