    description: "1. Run an offending app. (included are screenshots of iTunes and uTorrent).\r\n2. Observe label mis-alignment\r\n\r\nLabels should be aligned to text fields and search fields.\r\n\r\nLabels are shifted downwards by about half their line-height.\r\n\r\n10.10.1 (14B25), although this happened on 10.10 as well.\r\n\r\n I upgraded from Mavericks and did not do a fresh install. I do not have any modified system fonts."
