    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder specific circumstances Safari may show a white, empty page when it receives a 304 Not modified response from the Server in response to a If-None-Match header sent by Safari with a matching Etag.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load some page that supports (Etag, not tested with Last Modified) caching\r\n2. Press reload quickly in sequence, move some times back/forwards\r\n\r\n(These are just the fastest steps to reproduce this issue sometimes, it can happen under other circumstances too)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari should always show the expected page\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari under described circumstances shows an empty (white) page without any content, even reload some times not fixing this.\r\nThis seems to be caused by a interrupted request, where Safari still stores the Page into Cache, causing invalid Cache data.\r\nWhen loading data from the cached page this fails and the User gets an empty page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 8.0 (10600.1.25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13\", End 2013)\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10 (14A389)"
