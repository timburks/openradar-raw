    description: "Summary:\r\nHi, I'd like to be able to flip the default behavior of the green button in OS X Yosemite so that instead of defaulting to full screen and having to option-click to get the old \"fill screen\" behavior from pre-Yosemite OS's, you could have it default to \"fill screen\" and need to option-click to get to full screen. \r\n\r\nFor now I'm using the \"double click the title bar\" workaround, but this is\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click green button, have app go to full screen. \r\n2. Swear\r\n3. Click green button again to exit full screen. \r\n4. Option-click green button to get the current window to fill the screen. \r\n5. Look for option to swap this behavior, do not find it. \r\n6. Have a sad. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome kind of user-settable option to flip this behavior back. \r\n\r\nEven a com.defaults.apple something somewhere I can set with terminal would be lovely, but preferably a checkbox in System Preferences would be ideal.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(see steps to repro)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the engineer who makes this happen contacts me, I will personally bake them chocolate chip cookies and ship them to Cupertino. I am dead serious. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAnything running Yosemite."
