    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a custom background image of a search bar field is set, the position of the text field is set incorrectly when the search bar is tapped. It is only incorrect in the selected state: it is fine when unselected again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the background image of the search bar's field with:\r\n[searchBar setSearchFieldBackgroundImage:backgroundImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];\r\n\r\nRun the app and tap the search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text position doesn't change when the search bar is tapped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text position changes, such that it seems to set the text position to zero."
