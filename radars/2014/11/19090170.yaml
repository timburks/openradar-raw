        Summary:
        On Xcode 6.1 and 6.2, when a target has the option Launch due to a background fetch event checked, Xcode launches the simulator and brings the app to the foreground, as if the option is ignored.
        Additionally the  - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application performFetchWithCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler method is not invoked.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Run the attached project

        Expected Results:
        1. Xcode should launch the app in the background of the simulator

        Actual Results:
        1. Xcode launches the app normally, ignoring the target option

        Regression:
        The issue can be reproduced every time on Xcode 6.1, Xcode 6.2.
        The feature works ok on Xcode 5.
        All of this is on Yosemite.
