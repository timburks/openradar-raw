    description: "For custom subclasses, @property[ies] defined as IBInspectable are correctly shown in IB, but even after setting a default value from both within initWithFrame and initWithCoder, the default value is not reflected in IB.\r\n\r\nAttached[1] is a screenshot of the values as shown in IB, and sample subclass to demonstrate the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Xcode\r\n2) Make a new subclass of NSView\r\n3) Add subview in IB/XIB file, set it's class to the new subclass\r\n3) In the subclass .h, add @properties that are have IBInspectable\r\n4) Confirm the property is displayed in Xcode's Attributes Inspector\r\n5) In the .m, re-implement the initWithCoder and initWithFrame methods, and set the value of  your @properties, as to give them a default value\r\n6) In the XIB, none of the default values are shown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce you've setup the default value for your properties from initWithCoder or initWithFrame, their value should be displayed as default in Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor example, a color displays as a white rectangle with a red crossed line, no matter what you set as a default. Numbers display a spinner/number control with no default entry.\r\n\r\n[1] http://dew.dangelov.com/external/rdar-19044397-screenshot.png\r\n     http://dew.dangelov.com/external/rdar-19044397-samplecode.tar.gz"
