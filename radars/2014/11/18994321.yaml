        Summary:
        Trying to compile some Swift code that uses the Argo framework (which defines generic operators for transferring JSON data into model objects) takes forever (didn’t wait for the compiler to finish, but after about 15 minutes it still wasn’t finished compiling that single file with ~50 lines of source code)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - unpack and open the enclosed „Bongle“ workspace
        - try to build

        Expected Results:
        Since the source files are not too large, I’d expect the Bongle project to build within a few seconds.

        Actual Results:
        The source file „BongtvChannel.swift“ takes forever to compile. I haven’t been able to wait whether it completes at all, but at least after about 15 minutes is still wasn’t done.

        Regression:
        When commenting out the chained operators in the decode() function, everything is back to normal performance, so it must be related to that operator chaining.
