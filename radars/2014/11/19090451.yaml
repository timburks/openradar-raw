        Summary:
        Kernel panics and system lockups concerning GPU switching

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Graphics intensive web sites seem to trigger this behaviour, also graphics intensive apps like photoshop. Try a site like www.gilt.com in Safari or another browser.

        Expected Results:
        No lock ups.

        Actual Results:
        Either a popup indicating that there was a graphics error, or a system lockup requiring reboot.

        Regression:
        Unchecking graphics switching seems to solve the issue.

        Notes:
        No issues in Mavericks. This has cropped up with Yosemite.
