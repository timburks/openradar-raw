    description: "Summary:\r\nMoving a UIViewController instance from the main window to a different window by setting it as the rootViewController breaks rotation behavior on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression that first occurred in iOS 8.1. iOS 8.0.x and iOS 7.x are not affected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the attached example project and perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run on iPhone with iOS 8.1\r\n2. Tap the \"New Controller\" button while in portrait mode\r\n3. Notice that the blue view is now in fullscreen\r\n4. Rotate the device to landscape\r\n5. Notice that the rotation works properly\r\n6. Rotate back to landscape\r\n7. Dismiss by tapping the blue view\r\n8. Tap the \"Re-use Controller\" button while in portrait mode\r\n9. Notice that the blue view is now in fullscreen\r\n10. Rotate to landscape\r\n11. Notice that the landscape view is not properly sized\r\n12. Restart the app before trying again to restore the initial state\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blue view is properly sized to occupy the entire UIWindow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blue view is improperly sized.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll hardware\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Fullscreen.zip' was successfully uploaded.
