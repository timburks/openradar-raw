    description: "Summary:\r\nNo matter how the statusbar is configured within an app (hidden through info.plist, hidden through [UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarHidden = YES, preferStatusBarHidden returning YES), the UIImagePickerController will show it with no mercy. Also, if the current presented viewcontroller is part of a UINavigationViewController-stack, the view gets pushed 20pt down.\r\nThe devs who implemented UIImagePickerController really have a fetish on the statusbar, don't they?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached project, start it on an iPad(-Simulator) and tap the 'Image'-button.\r\nThe statusbar is now visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe statusbar should not be visible, the frame of the view should not change\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe statusbar is visible, the frame of the view changed by the height of the statusbar"
