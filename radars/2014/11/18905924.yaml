    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a Swift project (attached) that causes the SourceKitService crash window to flash so often, it's almost unbearable to write code. While SourceKit crashes are fairly common in all Swift projects, here they happen an order of magnitude more often.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open and look at some files (especially token_reader and main)\r\n2. Start editing or typing new code\r\n3. etc…\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThings work perfectly fine or at least, the SourceKit crash happens occasionally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSourceKit crashes _very_ often and makes the crash alert flash 20 times in a row.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 / Xcode 6.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've had a hard time reducing the test case — the crashes are not as deterministic as compile-time crashes, and I suspect there's more than one source of the problem — so I'm attaching the whole project.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://github.com/radex/HackPlatform/tree/ea650174f37b271d66781de707622b36989458c7/JackParser"
