In the stock calendar app, create a event that recurs daily with a end date.\r\n2.  go ahead and remove each of the recurring date (except the first recurrence) by removing only that instance\r\n3.  finally when you remove the first occurrence of the seres, you'll get a crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDelete the event gracefully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nboth stock calendar app crash on device and on simulator.\r\n\r\nIn simulator, it prints out this error which might be helpful:\r\n*** Assertion failure in -[EKEvent _deleteThisOccurrence], /SourceCache/Calendar_Sim/Calendar-1374.0.4/EKEvent.m:2188"
