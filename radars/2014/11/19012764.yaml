    description: "Summary:\r\nIf my Mac has multiple users logged in (using fast user switching), and the current user has \"Do Not Disturb\" enabled, spoken alerts for other accounts still play.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in to Account A.\r\n2. Create a calendar alert for Account A.\r\n3. Under the \"Dictation & Speech\" Systems Preference, enable \"Announce when alerts are displayed\". This will cause speech-to-text to read a popup alert when it is displayed.\r\n4. Use Fast User Switching to switch to Account B.\r\n5. Connect an external HDMI display.\r\n6. Enable \"Do Not Disturb\" for Account B. Make sure that the expiration date of the DND extends past the calendar alert set in Step 2.\r\n7. Wait until calendar alert (Step 2) fires.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI have \"Do Not Disturb\" enabled. I expect to hear no announcements of any sort.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlerts for Account A are spoken over HDMI while logged in to Account B. This means that confidential information from Account A is leaked to anyone listening to Account B's public presentation--which leads to great amusement for the students listening to the talk.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLaptop with HDMI display attached, and fast user switching enabled.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
