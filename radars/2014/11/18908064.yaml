    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you display an ABPersonViewController to display an address book contact, the tap edit to go to the editing screen, there are two toolbar buttons present on the navigation bar - a \"Cancel\" button on the left and a \"Done\" button on the right. On first edit, the \"Cancel\" button is enabled but does nothing and the \"Done\" button is also enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached project.\r\n2. Tap the \"edit contacts\" button in the centre of the screen.\r\n3. Grant access to the address book (this seems to take a long time to call the completion block - either wait, or stop and relaunch the app and repeat)\r\n4. In the ABPersonViewController tap the edit button on the right of the navigation bar.\r\n5. In the edit view which has appeared, tap the \"Cancel\" button on the left of the navigation toolbar as many times as you like.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping the cancel button should return to the ABPersonViewController view, and the \"Done\" button should not be enabled unless you have actually made changes to the contact.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping the cancel button has no effect (unless you have already tapped the \"Done\" button then returned to the edit mode again).\r\nThe \"Done\" button is enabled even if you have not made any changes (unless you have already tapped the \"Done\" button then returned to the edit mode again).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.112B411\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn iOS 7.1 this functions as expected - i.e. the bug seems to be a regression in iOS 8 or 8.1.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S 32GB, Simulator iPhone 5S, iPhone 6"
