    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a call is made to crypto.webkitSubtle.generateKey, any memory allocated in the page's lifetime will not be released on unload. This can be most easily demonstrated by allocating a large ArrayBuffer and repeatedly refreshing the page.\r\n\r\nIf the same ArrayBuffer is allocated but generateKey is *not* called, the memory is correctly released when the page is refreshed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Activity Monitor\r\n2. Switch to Memory tab\r\n3. Search for \"Safari\" to reduce list\r\n4. Start a new Safari session and open sample page (code below)\r\n5. Refresh page repeatedly. Memory usage will grow by ~128mb (as allocated by sample test page) per refresh.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMemory allocated by page is not leaked on page refresh. This is the case if the call to generateKey is skipped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMemory usage grows unbounded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 7.1 (9537.85.10.17.1), OS X 10.9.5, Mid 2010 iMac with 12GB RAM\r\nSafari 8.0 (10600.1.25), OS X 10.10.1, Late 2010 MacBook Air with 4GB RAM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAbove configurations are the only ones tested; No configurations have been tested and not exhibited this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 7.1 (9537.85.10.17.1), OS X 10.9.5, Mid 2010 iMac with 12GB RAM\r\nSafari 8.0 (10600.1.25), OS X 10.10.1, Late 2010 MacBook Air with 4GB RAM\r\n\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n\tvar leak = new ArrayBuffer(128*1024*1024);\r\n\tvar rsa = {\r\n\t\tmodulusLength: 1024,\r\n\t\tpublicExponent: new Uint8Array(1,0,1,0),\r\n\t\tname: \"RSA-OAEP\",\r\n\t\thash: { name: \"SHA-256\" }\r\n\t};\r\n\twindow.crypto.webkitSubtle.generateKey(rsa, true, ['encrypt', 'decrypt']);"
