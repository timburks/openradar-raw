    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing a table view with allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing enabled and the reorder control disabled, the Edit Control on the left side slides out while ending editing mode animated. During this slide out phase, the original selection is restored. However, this also sets the selection in edit mode and thus checks the selected row in the Edit Control (see attached video) although this should not happen. This behavior does not occur when the Reorder Control is shown, since the Edit Control on the left is hidden before sliding out.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is observable in the Mail.app when editing the table view displaying emails and then ending the editing mode. The attached video displays the behavior in one of our own apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.app\r\n2. Select a mailbox\r\n3. Tap “Edit”\r\n4. Ensure that a row is selected\r\n5. Notice that the Edit Control on the left slides in\r\n6. Tap “Done”\r\n7. Notice that the selection is set for a split-second when the Edit Controls slide out\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selection should not be set in editing mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe selection is visible for a split-second when sliding out\r\n\r\nMovie: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y3ydrthsx698nrj/Sample.mov?dl=0"
