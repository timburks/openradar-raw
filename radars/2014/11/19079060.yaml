    description: "Summary:\r\nBy using the New File wizard in Xcode 6.1, I created a mapping model to migrate from previous version of a Core Data data model. Both the previous and the new version contain several abstract entities. These have child entities that inherit from them.\r\n\r\nThe mapping model created by the wizard does not create mappings for the abstract entities -- contrary to expectations. After the migration, migrated objects contain null values for properties in their respective abstract entities.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a versioned data model with entities that inherit attributes from other entities.\r\n2. Run the program and let it create a persistent data store based on this first version of the mapping model.\r\n3. Create a new version of the data model.\r\n4. Try creating a mapping model between these two versions using the New File wizard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNewly created mapping model contains mapping definitions for inherited attributes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll mapping definitions for inherited attributes are omitted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1 (6A1052d), OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 (14B25)"
