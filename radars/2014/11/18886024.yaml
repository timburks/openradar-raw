    description: "We have an app with several GLKViews showing OpenGL content. \r\nScrolling through a table of these views is fine in iOS 7 but in iOS 8.1 the screen is occasionally filled entirely with blue! It even obliterates the status bar. (Of course we call it the blue screen of death :)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen in iOS 7, and though we don't have an iOS 8.0 device to test on, nobody here remembers seeing it until iOS 8.1. So we believe this is an iOS 8.1 regression.\r\n\r\nThe simulator doesn't show the issue.\r\n\r\nScroll down in the table to row 30 or so, then start scrolling up slowly. You'll see the screen flash blue intermittently. Once it happens you'll see it scrolling up or down. You can scroll very slowly and get to an exact pixel where the screen fills suddenly with blue. Taking a screenshot results in a screenshot not of blue, but of what is expected instead.\r\n\r\nThe attached app is a simple UITableView with each cell holding a GLKView.\r\n\r\nI made a video demoing reproduction on an iPhone 6+ : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76YaByZ4nM"
