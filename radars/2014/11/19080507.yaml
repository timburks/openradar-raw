    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Mac OS X 10.7, Security.framework's SecKeychainSearchCreateFromAttributes API was deprecated:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis function is deprecated in Mac OS X 10.7 and later; to find keychain items which match specified attributes, please use the SecItemCopyMatching API (see SecItem.h).\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, SecItemCopyMatching doesn't allow you to search other keychains. There's a `kSecUseKeychain` key which theoretically could work for this, but it seems to only support adding items to other keychains: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\t @constant kSecUseKeychain Specifies a dictionary key whose value is a\r\n\t keychain reference. You use this key to specify a value of type\r\n\t SecKeychainRef to which SecItemAdd will add the provided item(s).`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd also like to point out that Security-57031.1.35 continues to use this deprecated API, even in 10.10 Yosemite: http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-57031.1.35/SecurityTool/keychain_find.c"
