    description: "It appears that in Safari on iOS (8.x including 8.1.1) that when a request is made for a web page, the image resources are being mixed up and thus being placed in the incorrect positions. Some research online claims that this is to do with HTTP Pipeline issues.\r\n\r\nI'm contacting as an IT manager for a site which has been affected by the problem, but many have experienced the problem on a number of high-profile sites. I was disappointed to upgrade to 8.1.1 to only discover that the bug is still yet to be resolved. The problem doesn't always occur and clearing the cache and data in safari doesn't resolve the issue. Restarting the device doesn't resolve the issue either. Problem was non-existent in iOS7.\r\n\r\nThis problem doesn't exist on the Google Chrome app or on windows desktops. I've not checked if its a problem on Mac (don't have access to one).\r\n\r\nAlot of details (including sites and blog posts) about this bug can be found on the following user discussion:\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6574663\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open Safari app on iOS 8.x\r\n2. Go to a web page where HTTP pipe-lining causes issue (ie: www.ephotozine.com)\r\n3. Images will appear to load in the incorrect positions but with the correct file names.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCorrect images expected to be loaded in the correct positions with the correct file names.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImages will appear to load in the incorrect positions but with the correct file names.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x (including 8.1.1), latest iOS Safari app.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome users has found disabling a configuration in the web servers performance which deals with HTTP pipe-lining cures the problem. However, this isn't a solution as it would reduce the performance of the said web server. Safari really needs to handle the responses correctly."
