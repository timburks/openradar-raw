    description: "Summary:\r\nAdding an SCNPhysicsBody to an SCNNode when the node is already attached to the rootNode of a scene seems to work as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, setting the collisionBitMask and/or categoryBitMask either has no effect, or behaves unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nSetting the collisionBitMask works fine if the SCNPhysicsBody was added to the node before the node was added to the scene.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project - reproduction steps are included in the comments in ViewController.swift\r\n\r\n1. Create a pair SCNNodes with SCNBox geometry and stack them vertically in a scene\r\n2. Add them to the scene.rootNode\r\n3. Add a static physics body to the lower one and a dynamic physics body to the upper one\r\n4. set the collisionBitMask of both physics bodies to 0\r\n5. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dynamic box should fall through the static box because their collisionBitMasks indicate that they should not collide with anything, including each other\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe boxes collide with each other\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS SDK 8.1, Xcode 6.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 and iOS simulator"
