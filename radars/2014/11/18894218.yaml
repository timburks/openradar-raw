    description: "Summary:\r\nI have presented a popover from within a view controller that is inside a UINavigationController. If I allow the user to press the back button while the popover is visible then it remains on the screen. To fix this I added code to dismiss the popover in viewWillDisappear. Unfortunately, if I do this then once the back transition animation is complete the app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached application.\r\n2. Press the button to navigate to the second screen.\r\n3. Press the button to show the popover.\r\n4. Without dismissing the popover press the back button in the top-left to return to the first screen. The app will crash after this transition is complete.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe popover should disappear, and the app should not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
