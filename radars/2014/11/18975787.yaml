    description: "Summary:\r\nA device with the audio streaming over AirPlay plays the \"Play Sound\" \"ping\" sound through airplay speakers rather than device speaker. This makes the feature useless for tracking down a device lost in your house if you set it down while streaming music to an AirPlay speaker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set device to use an AirPlay speaker (likely a bluetooth speaker will exhibit the same bug)\r\n2. Log into Find My iPhone\r\n3. Select device and click \"Play Sound\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"ping\" noise should play through the device's internal speaker so I can track it down by following the noise.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"ping\" noise plays through the airplay speakers so I have no way of tracking down the phone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nm____n@gmail.com\r\n8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDevice audio should be connected to an AirPlay speaker\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
