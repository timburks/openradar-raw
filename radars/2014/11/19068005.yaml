        Summary:
        Xcode crashes a *lot* when debugging Swift programs. Any time I stop at or select certain stack frames I get crashes like the one I’ve attached.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Clone & checkout the repo/branch in this pull request: https://github.com/robrix/Traversal/pull/20
        2. In case I have pushed more commits later, ensure that you’re on 43ed04c068d04baed5f16f28d053864f13626b94
        3. Open Traversal.xcworkspace
        4. Select the Traversal framework target
        5. Set a breakpoint on ReducerOf.swift, line 34 (“return reduce(initial, c)”)
        6. Run the unit tests
        7. When the debugger pauses, select frame 8 (“Traversal.reduce <A : Traversal.ReducibleType, B>(A, B, (B, A.Element) -> Traversal.Either<B, B>) -> B”)


        Expected Results:
        I expected Xcode to jump to frame 8 and allow me to interact with the variables present.


        Actual Results:
        Xcode crashed.


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        This characterizes most of my interactions with Swift programs in Xcode’s debugger. Further radars to follow as appropriate.
