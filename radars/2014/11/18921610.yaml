    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the docs for [UICollectionView performBatchUpdates:completion:], the order in which deletions and insertions are resolved is explained in a contradictory fashion:\r\n\r\n\"Deletes are processed before inserts in batch operations. This means the indexes for the insertions are processed relative to the indexes of the state before the batch operation, and the indexes for the deletions are processed relative to the indexes of the state after all the insertions in the batch operation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UICollectionView_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UICollectionView/performBatchUpdates:completion:\r\n\r\nIf Deletes are in fact performed before Inserts, I would expect the second sentence to read:\r\n\r\n... indexes for the DELETIONS are processed relative to the indexes of the state before the batch operation, and the indexes for the INSERTIONS are processed relative to the indexes of the state after all the insertions in the batch operation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo improve this documentation even further, I would suggest explicitly stating the order of all 4 change types (insertions, moves, reloads, and deletes). For example, it is not obvious whether the indexes for reloads are processed relative to the original state before the batch operation, the state subsequent to the insertions, deletions, or both.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UICollectionView_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UICollectionView/performBatchUpdates:completion:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
