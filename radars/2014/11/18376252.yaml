    description: "In Yosemite since DP8 (regression from all previous versions), Popup Buttons that are Recessed & Borderless display the text in white when hovered.  But without the background (as properly not changed because borderless is off), the white text is unreadable (indeed, in my window, which has a white background, the button simply disappears when you hover over it).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project.\r\nCreate a popup button\r\nChange it to Recessed\r\nChange it to Borderless\r\nRun - hover over button, button disappears (well, nearly disappears because the default window color is a light gray and the text is white).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Borderless mode, the text should not change color (or the change should be more subtle, to black or a lighter but still dark grey).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince DP8, the button simply disappears when you hover over it, a terrible regression."
