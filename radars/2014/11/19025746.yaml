    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen initializing a UIActivityViewController with a single UIImage as the activityItem, the \"Assign to Contact\" action appears in the sharing options, but if the user selects it, they aren't able to do any assigning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project.\r\n1. Build & Run AssignContactBug project in the simulator (that has Contacts in it).\r\n2. Upon app start, a UIActivityViewController should be presented.\r\n3. Select the \"Assign to Contact\" button in the bottom row.\r\n4. The contact picker is presented.\r\n5. Select a contact from the list of contacts to assign the image to.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJust as with the iOS Photos app, a view controller should be navigated to, showing the image to assign. With \"Cancel\" and \"Choose\" buttons.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is shown the details for the contact they selected, with no way to assign the image to the selected contact.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnother developer i seeing the same issue: https://devforums.apple.com/post!reply.jspa?thread=253344\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB AT&T using Wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AssignContactBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
