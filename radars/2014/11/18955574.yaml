    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing a Swift framework, when importing the -Swift.h bridging header file in the framework umbrella header file:\r\n\r\n• If I change from building for a simulator to device or vice versa, the umbrella header file will throw an error that the -Swift.h bridging header file is not found.\r\n\r\n• If I clean the build folder, the -Swift.h bridging header file is never found. \r\n\r\nAfter cleaning the build folder, I must remove the -Swift.h bridging header file import in the framework umbrella header file, then build and add the import back for Xcode to resume building with the -Swift.h bridging header import file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new framework project and choose Swift as the language\r\n2. In the umbrella header file of the new project, add an import for the -Swift.h bridging header file\r\n3. Hit build. Xcode builds successfully.\r\n4. Change the active scheme to target a simulator (if it was targeting a device), or a device (if it was targeting a simulator).\r\n5. Hit build. Xcode build will fail. The error will be *-Swift.h file not found.\r\n6. Change the active scheme back to how it was in step 3.\r\n7. Hit build and Xcode builds successfully.\r\n8. Now clean the build folder (Product > press alt > Clean Build Folder).\r\n9. Try to build the project for both a simulator and a device. Xcode will never build successfully. \r\n10. In the framework umbrella header file, comment out or remove the import of the -Swift.h bridging header file.\r\n11. Hit Build. Xcode builds successfully.\r\n12. Undo step 11 (add back the import)\r\n13. Build. Xcode builds successfully.\r\n14. Redo step 4....\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe -Swift.h bridging header file is generated automatically and dynamically by Xcode. I expect this file to be built optimally and always be available when I build my project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode doesn't seem to generate the -Swift.h bridging header file for different architectures even when changing from simulator target to device. Additionally if the build folder is cleaned or removed, Xcode doesn't seem to realise that the -Swift.h bridging header file needs to be regenerated until the next time the project is built successfully (which means that in a normal use case it won't ever build successfully because the umbrella header file is importing the -Swift.h bridging header file).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1052d)"
