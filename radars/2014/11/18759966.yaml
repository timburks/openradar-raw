    description: "Summary:\r\nIt looks like Apple stopped releasing source (mostly just headers) to libm (the math standard C library) around Mac OS 10.7.5. The most recent release is 2026 at http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libm/Libm-2026/. Can the releases resume?\r\n\r\nThis should include math.h, complex.h, and similar headers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look for a recent libm in any opensource release since 10.7.4\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind libm\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDon't find libm\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0, Mac OS 10.9.5 (but not really relevant)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere seem to be several projects that \"drop off\" over time like this did. Even if there's a good reason not to release it, it would be wonderful to get some sort of explanation somewhere of why the source will stop being released, so we can at least know it was a conscious choice and that we shouldn't rely on it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
