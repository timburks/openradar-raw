    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Swift if I annotate a class named Something with @objc(DJPSomething), I cannot use this name in objective-c. Objective-C only sees Something, not DJPSomething. The bridging header project-Swift.h has \r\n\r\nSWIFT_CLASS(\"DJPSomething\")\r\n@interface Something : UIView\r\n// deleted boilerplate.\r\n@end\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a swift class\r\n2. Annotate the class with @objc() and use a name you would like to use in Objective-C instead of your Swift class name.\r\n3. In Objecitve-C use your swift class\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Objective-C I expect to be able to use my class by using the name declared in the @objc() annotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can only ever use the actual Swift class name in Objective-C\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1052d)"
