    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen allowing the user to select a square part of an image the returned cropped image is shifted substantially showing a different region than selected by the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Present a UIImagePickerController\r\n- allow cropping\r\n- Select a picture from the photo albums which has details which allow you to verify the selected cropping square\r\n- Take a screenshot before you proceed to show the masked area\r\n- inspect the output of UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe area on the edited image should match the selected area from the image picker\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe area on the edited image is lower than the previously selected area\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am going to attach two images, one shows the cropping view, the other the resulting edited image. As you can see the bottom right red button was outside the cropping region on the screenshot, but is visible in the resulting edited image.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S"
