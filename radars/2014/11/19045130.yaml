    description: "Summary:\nWhen adding a framework which you wish to have the same product name as the app, by default you will get duplicate bundle identifiers. When launching on the simulator, Xcode will show an error that says “An error was encountered while running (Domain = LaunchServicesError, Code = 0)”. It would be better if it could through an error at compilation time notifying the developer that there are two bundle identifiers that are the same. \n\nI have created a project that exhibits this issue at https://github.com/danielctull-tests/Duplicate-Bundle-Identifier-Issue\n\nA blog post that might give further information about why I want to do this is at http://danieltull.co.uk/blog/2014/11/20/an-error-was-encountered-while-running"
