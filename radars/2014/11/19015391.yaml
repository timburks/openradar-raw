    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you run the app I've attached, on a device, in guided access mode, it will crash every 20 seconds over and over. After about 5-10 crashes, it will not re-open, but hang and put the OS in an unusable state. It's not frozen, but it's like it's in guided access but without being in the app. The only way to recover the usability of the device is to force shut it down.\r\n\r\nWhile we are doing everything we can to prevent crashes from happening in the first place, it'd be nice to have this work reliably so that if it ever does crash, the app will always, always, always relaunch immediately.\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced with iOS 8.1. In iOS 8 and before, the app crashing in guided access mode NEVER fails to relaunch, and we've left this demo app running like this for days on iOS 7 and it always relaunches.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached demo application and build it onto a device. Then open the app, put it in guided access mode and after 5-10 crashes the app will not re-open but put iOS in an unusable state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the app crashes in guided access mode, it should ALWAYS relaunch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the app crashes in guided access mode, it relaunches 5-10 times and then doesn't, leaving iOS in an unusable state only recoverable by force killing the device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes it will crash and a pin code input will appear letting you enter the code to exit guided access mode, thus the app does not relaunch and you're not stuck in the unusable state where the app doesn't relaunch but guided access is still on. This behavior may be intended, so if this happens to you on a device running iOS 8.1+, keep running the app until it crashes without the pin code input and the OS in an unusable state so that you can at least see what the problem I'm describing. Thank you.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nGuided access mode enabled."
