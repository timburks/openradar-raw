        5. Lock the iPhone
        5. Receive iMessage from a favorite contact

        Expected Results:
        A notification from the received iMessage

        Notes:
        I’m not sure if this is by design, since it used to work this way in iOS 7. If DND works as intended, please regard this report as a feature request
