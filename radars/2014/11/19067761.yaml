    description: "Summary:\r\nDismissing a popover can also lead to dismissing it's parent controller if the user double-taps to dismiss. This is a regression from iOS 7 where it works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached example, then read the instructions in the alert and double-tap into the yellow area do see the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould only ever dismiss the popover it controls, not the parent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDismisses the parent as well.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works under iOS 7 and is a regression in iOS 8. The example isn’t built to be run under 7, but with changing this to a UIPopoverController it shows the same bug, but works fine on 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample also shows UIKit pseudocode where you see that someone forgot checking [controller dismissing] in the code path where the delegate isn’t implemented - that’s whys simply implementing the delegate actually fixes the issue."
