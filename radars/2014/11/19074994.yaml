    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a managed object model contains many-to-many relationships and a persistent store has non-nil values for these relationships, the relationships are zeroed out after a call to \r\nmigratePersistentStore:toURL:options:withType:error:\r\n\r\n\"Zeroed out\" meaning simply that calling valueForKey: with the relationship name returns an empty set where the set was not empty before making this call.\r\n\r\nThis bug is new in Yosemite.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project which uses Core Data where the managed object model contains at least one many-to-many relationship.\r\n2. Create a persistent store file using this model and populate it such that the many-to-many relationships are not empty.\r\n3. Call \r\nmigratePersistentStore:toURL:options:withType:error: to migrate the persistent store to a new location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMany to many relationships would be preserved, along with all other data in the persistent store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMany-to-many relationships are empty after the migrate call.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA sample project is attached. The model contains trivial \"Item\" and \"Tag\" entities which have a many-to-many relationship. The code creates five instances of each and links all Items to all Tags. It then migrates the store to a new location and fetches all instances of both entities. After the migrate, no Items are related to any Tags.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNew on Yosemite.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Many2ManyTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
