        Summary:
        Swift requires that `Self` occur only in protocols or as the return type of a class function. Further, only final classes may implement protocols using Self outside of parameters/returns. However, it fails to check whether occurrences of types matched to `Self` in the protocol’s declaration are nested within the return type, e.g. in a tuple, leading to spurious errors.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Compile this:
        protocol P {
        	func f() -> (Self, Int)
        }

        class C: P {
        	func f() -> (C, Int) {
        		return (self, 0)
        	}
        }



        Expected Results:
        I expected it to compile; we’re using C in the return type which (as far as I can see) should be valid.


        Actual Results:
        Error:
        ./non-final.swift:8:7: error: protocol 'P' requirement 'f()' cannot be satisfied by a non-final class ('C') because it uses 'Self' in a non-parameter, non-result type position


        Regression:
        This error does not occur if the function returns Self in both the protocol and the class (a la ObjC’s instancetype I take it).
        This error does not occur if the class is final (obviously).
        A similar error occurs if you change the method’s return type to (Self, Int):

        ./non-final.swift:8:15: error: 'Self' is only available in a protocol or as the result of a class method; did you mean 'C'?
                func f() -> (Self, Int) {

        This seems like it should be fine too.
