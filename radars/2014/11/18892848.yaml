    description: "My app is tracking runningApplications.  It has ended up with an old NSRunningApplication object for the Finder, and a new one (frontApplication).  Both objects match with \"isEqual\", but one returns isTerminated true and one returns isTerminated false.\r\n\r\n(lldb) po 0x61800010c600\r\n<NSRunningApplication: 0x61800010c600 (com.apple.finder - 201)>\r\n\r\n(lldb) po 0x61000010a830\r\n<NSRunningApplication: 0x61000010a830 (com.apple.finder - 201)>\r\n\r\n(lldb) print (bool)[0x61800010c600 isTerminated]\r\n(bool) $34 = true\r\n(lldb) print (bool)[0x61000010a830 isTerminated]\r\n(bool) $35 = false\r\n(lldb) print (bool)[0x61800010c600 isEqual:0x61000010a830]\r\n(bool) $36 = true\r\n\r\nNote that the low pid number for the Finder indicates the Finder has never relaunched since system boot time, so there is no reason the earlier NSRunningApplication object should be returning isTerminated as true.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the NSRunningApplications returned from frontmostApplication are very fragile.  The ones from runningApplications appear more robust, although even then they include cocoa applications that are still running that have isTermianted as true and processIdentifier as -1."
