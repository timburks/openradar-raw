    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode, if your Apple ID is a member of two development programs for the same company--one for the App Store, one for Enterprise deployments--then the pop-up for selecting which account does not indicate which is which.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using the same Apple ID, join a company's developer programs for both App Store and Enterprise distribution.\r\n2. In Xcode, add that Apple ID under Accounts in the Preferences dialog.\r\n3. Create a new iOS app project.\r\n4. In General under the project settings, click on the \"Team\" selector.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list of teams will differentiate between Enterprise and App Store accounts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe name of the company is repeated twice, with no differentiation (see attached screenshot)."
