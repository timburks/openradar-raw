    description: "Summary:\r\nPutting a UITextView in a xib, loading it with long text, and presenting it such that its view is smaller than it was in the xib results in a vertical offset of the text view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Run it, and observe that the text view’s text starts at line 12, because the lines before that are scrolled off the top.\r\n3. To see my workaround, open ModalViewController.m and go to line 39. Change the NO to a YES and re-run. Observe that the text view’s text starts at line 0, which is expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSetting up a text view and setting its text, as in the “async = NO” case in the sample project, starts the text view scrolled to an offset of (0,0) unless otherwise specified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text view starts out scrolled down a bit, unless the dispatch_async workaround is applied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis occurs only if the view controller returns a size from -preferredContentSize that is smaller than the size specified in the xib, which is common for flexible UIs and/or xibs that are set to “Inferred” size.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSample project: http://cl.ly/Yhvv"
