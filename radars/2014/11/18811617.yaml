    description: "Summary:\r\nThe project attach is a sample project to reproduce what we see in our production project.\r\nWhen doing clean build (build and derived data folder deleted) from the command line, about 50% of the time it will return an error similar too:\r\n\r\n/* com.apple.ibtool.errors */\r\n/Users/dogfish2/Desktop/test2/Base.lproj/7.xib: error: The file “ca.lproj” couldn’t be saved in the folder “test2.app” because a file with the same name already exists.\r\n    Failure Reason: A file with the name “ca.lproj” already exists.\r\n    Recovery Suggestion: To save the file, either provide a different name, or move aside or delete the existing file, and try again.\r\n    Underlying Errors:\r\n        Description: The operation couldn’t be completed. File exists\r\n        Failure Reason: File exists\r\n\r\nIf i use xcodebuild -IDEBuildOperationMaxNumberOfConcurrentCompileTasks=1 then the error never happens\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- in the terminal change to the directory containing the project\r\n- type xcodebuild\r\n\r\nIf error has not happened, delete build folder and derived data folder and repeat above step a few times (this reproduce best on a slow machine, i'm using a mac mini late 2012 with 16GB of RAM, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7,  running yosemite and xcode6.1)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error, build succeed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nerror is returned for one of the XIB files\r\n\r\n/* com.apple.ibtool.errors */\r\n/Users/dogfish2/Desktop/test2/Base.lproj/7.xib: error: The file “ca.lproj” couldn’t be saved in the folder “test2.app” because a file with the same name already exists.\r\n    Failure Reason: A file with the name “ca.lproj” already exists.\r\n    Recovery Suggestion: To save the file, either provide a different name, or move aside or delete the existing file, and try again.\r\n    Underlying Errors:\r\n        Description: The operation couldn’t be completed.
