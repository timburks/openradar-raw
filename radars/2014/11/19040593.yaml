        Summary:
        You can mark a WKInterfaceController property as @IBInspectable and set its value in the storyboard, and neither IB nor the Swift compiler complains. However, the property is not actually set when you run the app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new watch app.
        2. Add an @IBInspectable property to it.
        3. Select the corresponding scene in the Storyboard.
        4. Set the property, build, and run.

        Expected Results:
        Either there is no UI to set the property, or building produces a warning or error, or this actually works.

        Actual Results:
        The value in the nib file is ignored.

        Notes:
        I only tested with Swift, but I suspect Objective-C has the same issue.

        I would love it if WatchKit actually supported IBInspectable; it would permit a small amount of the dynamism that’s missing because we cannot create NSObjects in WatchKit storyboards. However, if that isn’t practical, the feature should at least be disabled in some way to avoid misleading developers.
