    description: "If you animate a splitview pane closed with implicit animations, you get a fade out effect on the collapsing pane.\r\n\r\nThat looks weird a lot of the time. It oughta just be a wipe, where the splitter covers the view progressively.\r\n\r\nSee attached test project. This also affects GitHub for Mac's production app, https://github.com/mdiep/NSSplitViewTest/pull/1"
