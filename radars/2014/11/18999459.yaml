    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I create a constraint in IB, using \"constrain to margins”, this doesn’t seem to be changeable or even visible after creation of the constraint. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. go to storyboard\r\n2. place or select object, i.e. a label\r\n3. add one or more constraints using the ‘pin’ button / tie fighter button, make sure checkbox “constrain to margins” is set \r\n4. vier or edit your constraint(s) with the size inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I edit the constraint, I’d love to be able to view whether this is “constrain to margins” or not, and even better, to be able to change that without recreating the constraint. Since I don’t use “constrain to margins” very often, I would also like a setting in the preferences, where I can make sure this checkbox is off by default - saves me a lot of time recreating, after doing it wrong accidentally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can’t see if constraint refers to margin or to the actual top/bottom/etc of the superview\r\nI also can’t change that, so I need to delete and recreate the constraint if want to change this setting\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn this version of Xcode this always occurs when creating a constraint in IB\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
