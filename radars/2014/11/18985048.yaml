An admin account can also enable itself using this process, by being both the authorizing admin account and the account being enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nPre-requisites:\r\n\r\nA copy of the fdesetup binary from a Mac running 10.8.x\r\n\r\n1. Copy the 10.8 fdesetup binary to a Mac running Yosemite.\r\n2. Set up a new user account (with admin privileges) and make sure it is not enabled for FileVault 2. \r\n\r\nNote: For this example, I'm using \"new_admin_username_here\" when referring to the new user account with admin privileges\r\n\r\n3. Log in to the new user account\r\n4. Open Terminal and run the following command with root privileges:\r\n\r\nsudo /path/to/10_8_fdesetup add -usertoadd new_admin_username_here\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\n1. You should be prompted for the username of the primary user. Put in new_admin_username_here\r\n2. You should next be prompted for the password of the primary user. Put in new_admin_username_here's password here.\r\n3. You should next be prompted for the password of the user you want to add. Put in new_admin_username_here's password here.\r\n\r\nAfter providing the password in step three, I should receive an authentication error since the user is not enabled for FileVault 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. You should be prompted for the username of the primary user. Put in new_admin_username_here\r\n2. You should next be prompted for the password of the primary user. Put in new_admin_username_here's password here.\r\n3. You should next be prompted for the password of the user you want to add. Put in new_admin_username_here's password here.\r\n\r\nAfter providing the password in step three, the \"new_admin_username_here\" account is enabled for FileVault 2.\r\n\r\nOS X Version/Build:\r\n\r\nOS X 10.10.0, build 14A389\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nI put up a blog post with my findings here:\r\n\r\nhttp://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/using-os-x-10-8s-fdesetup-tool-and-non-enabled-admin-accounts-to-enable-users-for-filevault-2-on-mavericks-and-yosemite/"
