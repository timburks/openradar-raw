    description: "Summary: When scrolling with momentum is turned on, using the keyboard to control scrolling does not cancel out the momentum and the view keeps scrolling until the momentum is exhausted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a long document (Safari works).\r\n2. Scroll to the top.\r\n3. Flick down with a Magic Mouse or touchpad.\r\n4. QUICKLY press Home (or fn-Left).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Document scrolls Home and stops.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Document scrolls Home and then scrolls down until momentum is exhausted.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUnsure if this is expected or not on your end, but it was surprising to me, and kind of got in my way."
