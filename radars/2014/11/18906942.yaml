    description: "https://github.com/EffectiveProgramming/LBOutlineViewDemo\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTo reload a row in an NSTableView, the API provides reloadDataForRowIndexes:columnIndexes: . This works just fine but when I use this method on an NSOutlineView, I found that while, for the most part it works, I couldn't reload GROUP or SECTION rows this way (since they have no columns, etc).\r\n\r\nSo that led me to try the reloadItem: family of methods specific to NSOutlineView. Unfortunately, I cannot get them to work for the specific item I want to reload.\r\n\r\nThe supplied project demonstrates this problem - the rows reload correctly using the reloadDataForRow approach but do not reload at all when using the reloadItem approach.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis projects demonstrates a problem I'm having reloading items in the NSOutlineView.\r\n\r\nTo test the app -\r\n\r\n1. Open and Run the app in Xcode\r\n\r\n2. The app should open up - it is a simple, full screen NSOutlineView\r\n\r\n3.  Alternate tapping on the different rows.\r\n\r\n4. Every time a different row is tapped, the displayed value should increment.\r\n\r\n5. Visit LBOutlineViewModel and note the reloadSelectedIssue method. In that method are two ways of reloading items. The 'working' method uses reloadDataForRowIndexes:columnIndexes: - but I can't seem to get [_outlineView reloadItem:_selectedItem reloadChildren:YES] to work.\r\n\r\n6. Comment the 'reloadData' lines out and uncomment either of the 'reloadItem' lines to test the item approach and note that neither of them work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSOutlineView's reloadItem family of method calls should reload rows immediately, just like the NSTableView's reloadDataForRow family of calls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSOutlineView's reloadItem does nothing. There is no visible change in behavior.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LBOutlineViewDemo-master.zip' was successfully uploaded."
