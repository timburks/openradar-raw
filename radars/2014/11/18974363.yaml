        Summary:
        Current API in OS X 10.10 doesn’t provide any notification that a popover was detached. There’s also no public way to query an NSPopover if it is displayed in an attached or detached way. Before that, I believe that “will close” notification fired for detached popover but not with the new API.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add NSPopover to an application. Break your head trying to find a way to differentiate attached and detached popovers.

        Expected Results:
        A notification to signal that a Popover was detached. In the worst case an property that gives the same information. It should be available in _flags ivar, based on the header file.

        Actual Results:
        No public API.

        Currently, the best way that I found to see if a popover is attached is the following code. Yes, a horrible, behaviour-defined hack:
        - (BOOL)isPopoverAttached:(NSPopover *)popover
        {
            return [[popover.contentViewController.view.window standardWindowButton:NSWindowCloseButton] superview] == nil;
        }
