    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Capabilities tab for my application target, Xcode displays the following error:\r\n    Add the \"In App Purchase\" entitlement to your App ID\r\nUnderneath, it shows a \"Fix Issue\" button.\r\n\r\nThis error is incorrect: I have already added an IAP entitlement to my App ID. I think Xcode is confused because all of my code signing is set up at the project level. This allows me to share this setup across my other targets. See the attached \"Code Signing (Good)\" image.\r\n\r\nIf I click the \"Fix Issue\" button anyways, Xcode destroys my setup. See the attached \"Code Signing (Bad)\" image.\r\n\r\nIf I replicate my code signing setup so that the values are set at the application level rather than the project level, the error goes away.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a project with code signing values set at the project level, rather than at the application level.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrently using Xcode 5.1.1 and 10.10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens in Xcode 5 and Xcode 6."
