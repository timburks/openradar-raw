        Summary:
        It is not possible to dismiss a controller and present another within the same runloop. This seems like an arbitrary restriction which is especially problematic with the transition to UIViewController-based alert views.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the attached example, click on the button inside the popover, then check the log.

        Expected Results:
        Should show an alert view displaying “Will never be displayed”. But doesn’t happen.

        Actual Results:
        Shows another alert after some time explaining the bug.

        Regression:
        This worked with UIAlertView.

        Notes:
        Using a dispatch_async on the main thread would fix the issue, but this is code smell.
