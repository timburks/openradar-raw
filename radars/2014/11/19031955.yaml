        Summary:
        When using a custom UIBarButtonItem (or hiding the UINavigationBar altogether), the interactive pop gesture recognizer does not work anymore. This can be fixed by setting the gesture recognizers delegate property to nil, but this seems somewhat hacky and relative unsafe for the future.

        Expected Results:
        I expect the gesture recognizer to work unless specifically disabled through its enabled property.

        Actual Results:
        The gesture recognizer does not work.
