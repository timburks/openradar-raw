    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see attached sample project / screenshot for an example PDF that is borked. The colors render correctly (a nice blue-ish green) when opening in preview and showing in Interface builder. When running in iOS 8.1, they are basically [UIColor greenColor], even when I specifically set the image to always render original in the asset catalog.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open sample project\r\n2. Build and run\r\n3. Scratch head. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInterface builder and the application should display the same, appropriate color. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(See attached screenshot [OR: https://twitter.com/designatednerd/status/530763628602228738/photo/1] - storyboard on the left, sim on the right. Same results on device. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is the first time I've seen this with PDF rendering, all my other PDFs are rendering correctly. Please let me know if I need to have my designer change any output settings (afaik she hasn't changed them at all from the stuff that is working). \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nanything running 8.1, device or sim\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PDFWAT.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2014-11-07 at 10.46.16 AM.png' were successfully uploaded. [OR: Let me know if you want to take a look at the sample project]"
