    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7 and prior there were various ways to hide the buttons on a navigationBar in a ABPeoplePickerNavigationController. None of these seem to work any more in iOS 8.0.2 (have not tested with 8.1).\r\n\r\nI wanted to have the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController contained within a UIView of another controller, and therefore didn't need an additional Cancel button. I ended up refactoring the UI to dispay the picker in a modal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Instantiate and display a ABPeoplePickerNavigationController\r\n2. Attempt to hide buttons in the navigationBar. \r\n\ta) One way is to set your controller to be a UINavigationControllerDelegate, in `func navigationController(nav: UINavigationController, willShowViewController viewController:UIViewController, animated:Bool)` you used to be able to set the UIBarButtonItems to nil or a view with a frame of CGRectZero.\r\n\tb) I believe there is a private api called `setAllowsCancel(_: bool)`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIBarButtonItems are removed (or hidden)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIBarButtonItems are visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere is a sample project: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/392461/AddressBookUIBug.zip"
