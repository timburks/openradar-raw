    description: "Summary:\r\nUIAlertController in ActionSheet configuration changes size, if we present another alert view on top that has a text field.\r\nInstead of further explanation, just watch this animated gif: http://cl.ly/image/0x1r0d3w2M3q\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached example, observe weird behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Action Sheet has no reason to change itâ€™s size and should keep the frame it had prior to showing the alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAction Sheet is drunk and resizes :)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks if we use UIActionSheet and UIAlertView on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUIAlertController is a great change. Having to think about controllers is annoying and the present/dismissal logic could be more forgiving, but overall the API design of UIAlertController is great, love the actions+blocks."
