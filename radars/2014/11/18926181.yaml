    description: "Summary:\r\nI have deployed an iOS app to my enterprise app store, which is a web application.  Users can install the app by visiting a web page in the app store and then tapping an Install button.\r\n\r\nWhen the user taps the Install button on an iPhone with iOS 7, the installer app (Safari in this case) disappears, revealing the downloading app icon on the Springboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the user taps the Install button on an iPhone/iPad with iOS 8, the download begins, but the installer app does not disappear.  As a result, the end user has no idea that a download occurred and they continue tapping the Install button in frustration, thinking that the install was never started.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a web page with an Install link in the format: \r\n\"itms-services://?action=download&amp;url=https://link_to_ipa\"\r\n\r\n2. Open the web page in Safari on an iPhone or iPad running iOS 8 or 8.1.\r\n\r\n3. Tap the Install link.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari disappears, revealing the Springboard, where an animation shows our app icon is installing.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari never disappears, and although our enterprise app is downloaded to Springboard, the user doesn't know it because they see only the Safari page.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that this problem was previously filed as bug #18170557."
