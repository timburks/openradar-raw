    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that dsymutil and related tools are not available on opensource.apple.com. I see an email on darwin-dev from 2007 that says they weren't currently public, but given that they don't (from my limited viewpoint) seem to contain anything proprietary, I'm wondering if the lack of an open source release is just an oversight. Is there a plan to get those tools out any time soon? Having source for them would be very helpful to me and many others.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) go to opensource.apple.com\r\n2) look for dsymutil in any of the packages\r\n3) look sad when you don't find it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI find dsymutil source\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't find dsymutil source\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
