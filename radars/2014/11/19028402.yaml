        Summary:
        Currently, there's no "obvious" way of running both the iOS app and the watchkit app at the same time in the simulator.
        There's the workaround described in the release notes (18559453) using attach to process. While this works, it is cumbersome. And option in the scheme to run both targets would be great.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Create an iOS app
        * Add a WatchKit target
        * Run -> runs iOS app
        * Change scheme to watch app
        * Run -> kills the iOS app and runs the Watch app

        Expected Results:
        An extra scheme or other option to run both at the same time.

        Actual Results:
        Only one app executes at the same time.
