    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are many different ways of assigning contents to a material property in Scene Kit. They all render fine. When it comes to exporting the scene you need to write the images to disk if you used anything but the NSImage object.\r\n\r\nIf only the image name is assigned as the content, it doesn't get linked when exporting. The image is successfully written to disk and the URL is returned in the export delegates method, but the exported COLLADA file doesn't display it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup a small scene (see sample project)\r\nAssign just the image name to the contents of a material\r\nExport the scene\r\nWrite the image to disk and return its URL in the export delegate method\r\n\r\nNo warnings are printed in the console (in some other cases there are (for issues where the image can't be linked))\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe exported scene references the image, just as it would have if the NSImage, full path, or full URL had been assigned.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is written to the right location but the exported scene doesn't display it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1 (6A1052d)\r\nOS X Version 10.10 (14A388a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
