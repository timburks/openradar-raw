    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 8, when presenting a UIActivityViewController with several item providers (with different types: text, URL, UIImage), the sheet does not show Twitter and Facebook. The same code worked on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create 3 item providers: one with raw text, one with HTML text, one with a file URL (to a file handled by my app, not a common file type), one with a UIImage\r\n2. Display a UIActivityViewController with these providers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIActivityViewController should show the Twitter and Facebook icons, the providers provide short text and an image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail, Messages, Copy and third party apps are shown. Mail shows the text and image provided. But Twitter and Facebook are not shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
