        I’m running a MapKit app in the iOS simulator. The simulator system language is English.
        In the Xcode scheme I specify “Application Language“ as German and “Application Region“ as Deutschland / Germany.

        The UI of the app is correctly localized in German. But the labels in MKMapView (such as country and city names) are still in English (the simulator system language).

        It would have been great to use Xcode scheme localization to automatically create localized screen shots.

        However this bug defeats the whole purpose of using scheme localization.


        Note:
        IIRC the bug existed since the introduction of Xcode scheme localization.
