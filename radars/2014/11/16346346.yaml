    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile playing a live streamed video within a WebView, the application occasionally freezes (beachball) forever and must be killed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached sample application (VideoPlaybackDeadlock.zip).\r\n2. Wait ~10-60 minutes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe live video stream (NASA TV) should play indefinitely, reloading every 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a period of time, typically 10-60 minutes, the application will deadlock and hang. I have attached thread dumps / stacktraces showing the process state during two separate reproductions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nReproduced on 27-inch Mid 2011 iMac running OS X 10.8, and a Mac Mini.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt only appears to occur while streaming video. We have other setups where we load videos off the network or file system, where the video is buffered all at once, and this does not occur in those situations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that packet loss seems to have an effect. It may be my imagination, but using Network Link Conditioner (Wifi Lossy, with packets dropped increased to 2% down / 2% up) seems to aggravate it."
