    description: "With iOS8 we can directly jump into the APPs settings which now includes all privacy settings - this is a tremendous improvement. But the user still needs to manually switch/open the APP itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen any APP with a settings bundle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation bar should contain an icon for the originating APP. Touch this icon to open the APP immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to open/return/switch to the originating APP from its settings pane.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S, iOS 8.1.1., 32gb"
