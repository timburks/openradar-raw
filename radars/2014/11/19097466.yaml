    description: "When Messages is in the background and the window is clicked to raise it to the foreground, the next click moves the window to the point of click, as if the window were dragged from the point of clicking to raise to the next point clicked.\r\n\r\n1. Launch Messages.\r\n2. Switch to any other app.\r\n3. Click into Messages anywhere it's possible to drag the window (titlebar or header). The Messages app raises to the foreground (as expected).\r\n4. Click anywhere else on the screen. The Messages window jumps to the new position clicked (not expected).\r\n\r\nThe second click would not move the window.\r\n\r\nThe second click moves the window discontinuously to the place clicked.\r\n\r\nRunning 10.10.1 on a retina Macbook Pro 15\", Messages 8.0 build 4725. This also happened in 10.10.0"
