    description: "Summary:\r\nI have some apps installed via the Mac App Store from both Japan, and the US. When updates are available for apps from both countries' stores, the experience is terrible: I'm forced to login using a particular Apple ID, and end up only getting bounced between the JP/US stores as the app forces me to change stores upon authentication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have multiple apps needing updates, from the JP/US stores.\r\n2. Click \"Update All.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. AppStore.app should ask me to authenticate both accounts.\r\n2. AppStore.app should then update all apps, across both stores. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. As I authenticate to one country's store, I'm forced to the \"Featured\" tab of that country's store.\r\n2. When I click back to the Updates tab, clicking Update All again sends me back to step one, but for the other store.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.1 14B17\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe authentication prompt provided by App Store.app does not allow me to specify the correct Apple ID for the currently-logged-in store. It forces one of them, with no indication as to why it selected that particular one. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013), no accessories attached."
