    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen typing a message in Mail (Yosemite version, never had that problem in Mavericks), leaving smart quotes on, any word that contains an apostrophe, which is converted to a single closing quote, makes the cursor jump to the character that follows the single quote when ending the word and typing a space.\r\n\r\ni.e. if I type O'Malley, the cursor goes between the \"M\" and the \"a\" when typing the space after the word.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new message in Mail\r\n2. Enable \"Smart Quotes\" in Edit -> Substitutions if not already enabled.\r\n3. Type one or two words with an apostrophe and no space between them, i.e. O'Malley\r\n4. Type a space after the word\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor should stay in place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor jumps back to the character after the apostrophe. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 8.1 (1993)\r\nOS X Yosemite Version 10.10.1 (14B25)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Air 2011, 1,7 GHz Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM"
