    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://18989188\n\nThe automatic update capability in OS X 10.10 will automatically install beta releases â€” my development machine is currently on 10.10.1 (14B23).\r\n\r\nAfter this automatic update, the development machine will no longer be able to submit builds to iTunes Connect. The error displayed is \"This bundle is invalid. Apple is not currently accepting applications build with this version of the OS.\"\r\n\r\nThe only official solution is to reinstall the release version of OS X. This is EXTREMELY disruptive to a developer's productivity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on automatic software updates in Yosemite\r\n2. Wait for a beta release of OS X to become available.\r\n3. Try to submit an app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be accepted since it's built with the latest release of OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe error \"This bundle is invalid. Apple is not currently accepting applications build with this version of the OS\" is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn reality, developers work around this problem by editing Plist values. Either in the app itself (Info.plist) or the system (SystemVersion.plist)\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24045057/this-bundle-is-invalid-apple-is-not-currently-accepting-applications-built-with/24045471#24045471\r\n\r\nThis check isn't stopping developers from submitting apps on the current beta OS."
