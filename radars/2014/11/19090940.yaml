    description: "Summary:\r\nNSHost is on iOS, but is private API and so unusable by AppStore apps.\r\n\r\nThe same functionality can be achieved, but less conveniently by using CFHostRef (which is public).\r\n\r\nNSHost's availability marks it as \"Available in OS X v10.0 and later.\" indicating it is a very stable API which has been in the last 10 versions of OS X.\r\n\r\nForcing iOS developers to use the C API doesn't block access to private functionality it simply introduces differences between the platforms that negatively effect developers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to use NSHost in an iOS app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt works just like on OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt works just like on OS X.\r\nExcept the compiler complains it is not available (even though it is). Because of the lack of it being marked as a public API it is unavailable for use by iOS apps."
