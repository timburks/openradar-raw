    description: "Summary:\r\nI have several developer program memberships. When I upload an app which is correctly signed by my babbage consulting account (I can upload it with Application Loader).\r\n\r\nwhen I upload with Xcode I get an error referring to a completely different developer account. The account mentioned is both the oldest account I'm a member of and the first alphabetically so I suspect Xcode is just choosing the first account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an app on my babbage account, upload the archive from Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything works.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode screws up and selects the wrong account\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1 (6A1052d)"
