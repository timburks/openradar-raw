        Summary:
        The jblocksom.dae file in the attached project crashes the SceneKit loader

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new iOS app using the Game template, SceneKit, Obj-C
        Add the jblocksom.dae file to the assets of the project
        Note that you can view the DAE file in Xcode, and marvel at the handsome figure on display
        Replace the ship.dae part of the string in the call to +SCNScene sceneNamed: with scnassets/jblocksom.dae
        Run the app
        It crashes in sceneNamed

        Expected Results:
        It should not crash
        My head should be visible in the app

        Actual Results:
        It crashes

        Regression:
        Does not crash with ship.dae
        Does not crash with walk.de
        Does not crash with a file that is not there

        Notes:
        The dae file in question started as an .obj and was converted to .dae using Blender
        There are two versions, one has a light and cube and camera. Both crash
        My guess is degenerate triangles
