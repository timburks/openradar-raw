    description: "Consider two apps accessing the same file on an iCloud Drive container:\r\n\r\n- App A and B are presenting the same file with NSFilePresenter\r\n- App A is suspended\r\n- App B is in foreground and tries to perform a coordinated access on the shared file:\r\n\r\n    1. File Coordination tries to ask app A to save all unsaved changes via -savePresentedItemChangesWithCompletionHandler: \r\n    2. Unfortunately app A is suspended, so its presentation handler is not called until app A is put to foreground again\r\n    3. As a consequence, app B hangs on file coordination until the user switches back to app A.\r\n\r\nThis completely breaks shared file access on iCloud Drive for iOS.\r\n\r\nAs soon, as two apps access the same file using UIDocumentPickerModeOpen and file presentation, apps tend to hang."
