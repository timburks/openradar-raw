    description: A new feature that should be considered to be added to the WatchKit framework is developer use of the Taptic Engine on the Apple Watch. This would open up numerous opportunities for us developers, some which were suggested by Apple itself, e.g. the Maps app "tapping" your wrist a certain number of times to signify the direction one should walk. Of course, there is no way to test it yet, until the watch comes out, but hopefully in a new release of iOS 8.
