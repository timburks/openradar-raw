    description: "As a long-time proponent of Linux and modularity of interface, using Xcode has been quite a trying experience. It was brought to my attention recently that if I had an idea for an improvement to Xcode's interface, I could file a bug report, so here I am.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 6.1.1 (6A2006), and probably previous versions as well, in Interface Builder for Storyboards (and likely NIBs / .xib files as well), I have a great need and want to be able to move around by clicking on the white space and using the arrow keys. However, I cannot currently do this, which is very frustrating because there seems to be absolutely no reason for this whatsoever. The arrow keys, when Interface Builder is in this state, do absolutely nothing, so they could easily be mapped to moving around the view of the Storyboard or NIB file.\r\n\r\nI am, in addition to being left-handed, the owner of a right-hand with a form of palsy and deformity that leaves me with only my thumb for performing tasks on the keyboard with. I cannot mouse at all with my right hand, so I have to do everything that I can in order to optimize my usage of my programming and design interfaces.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other issues that I have with Xcode and Interface Builder, which I will submit in separate bug reports, but this one is a big concern for me. I am growing to learn how to use Interface Builder and properly design layouts using Autolayout, but in order for me to be able to fully maximize my own potential using this software, I need certain things changed about them that are currently either extremely difficult or impossible to achieve on my own in any reasonable amount of time. \r\n\r\nI am enjoying using Apple's software and hardware and have been a fan since I first received an iPod Nano 2nd Gen. when I was 16 years old. I am 28 now, and to see Apple perform this enhancement would add a tremendous amount of faith in the company for myself. I would love to see Apple helping to cater to the needs of developers with disabilities, as I am told that Apple is, as the co-worker who recommended I file this bug report said, \"big into accessibility\".\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and God Speed!"
