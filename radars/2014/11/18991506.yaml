    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I create a bot, I should be able to choose which source control branch to use for building and testing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a bot in Xcode 6.1\r\n2. Observe that there's no place to choose which source control branch to use\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect to be able to choose which git branch to use for the bot to build and test.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no option to choose the source control branch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI realize that I can check out a branch, then create the bot with that branch checked out and that will cause the bot to build from that branch. However, it's not clear that this is what's happening, and I'd like to be able to choose the branch.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
