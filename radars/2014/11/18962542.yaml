    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you assign an image to a subclass of a UIImageView in a xib or storyboard, and your class depends on the renderingMode being set to \"Always Template\" from an xcasset catalog, it will not be correct when using it in IB, but it will at run time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project. Notice the following:\r\na) There is an image in images.xcassets.\r\nb) The image's \"Render As\" mode is set to \"Always Template\".\r\nc) There is a class, TestImageView, which subclasses UIImageView. It is a simplified example of a class I made for a project. Its purpose is to set its own tint color to some custom color at run time.\r\n\r\n2. Open Main.storyboard. Notice that the image, which says \"I SHOULD BE ORANGE\", is black.\r\n3. Run the app and observe that the text is orange on the device or simulator.\r\n4. Open TestImageView.m and uncomment the lines 24â€“26 (the #if TARGET_INTERFACE_BUILDER section).\r\n5. Refresh the views in IB (they don't seem to update automatically when you uncomment those lines; another bug?).\r\n6. You will see that the image now correctly renders in orange.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen an image's rendering mode is specified as Always Template in an asset catalog, that information should be available at design time to code running inside an IB_DESIGNABLE class.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image appears to be getting reset to the default rendering mode in IB, but the rendering mode is correct at run time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1052c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in IB, not in simulator or on device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsample project: http://cl.ly/YV6C"
