    description: "As a long-time proponent of Linux and modularity of interface, using Xcode has been quite a trying experience. It was brought to my attention recently that if I had an idea for an improvement to Xcode's interface, I could file a bug report, so here I am.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 6.1.1 (6A2006), and probably previous versions as well, in Interface Builder for Storyboards (and likely NIBs / .xib files as well), when right-clicking on the white space surrounding objects, I have some very limited options for zooming: \r\n\r\n- Zoom to 100%\r\n- Zoom to 50%\r\n- Zoom to 25%\r\n- Zoom to 12.5%\r\n- Zoom In\r\n- Zoom Out\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to zoom to arbitrary levels, for example, 33%, 75%, 200%, or whatever I want. Below 12.5% is likely not functionally imperative, but I should be able to zoom out as far as I want to, or as in as far as I want to, and not be limited to 4 zoom levels.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable to force this upon developers and designers, as there is no reason that I should not be able to customize my zoom level. \r\n\r\nHow this gets implemented can happen on many levels, but the existing pre-set options are reasonable. However, an option might be added, called \"Zoom to...\", that, when clicked, brings up a dialog box that allows the user to enter an arbitrary zoom level. \r\n\r\nIn this scenario, clicking either \"Zoom In\" or \"Zoom Out\" would return you to the nearest 'default' zoom level. So, for instance, if you were zoomed in at 33%, and clicked \"Zoom Out\", you would go to 25%. In another situation, if you were zoomed in at 200% and did the same thing, you would go to 100%. However, at 10%, \"Zoom Out\" would do nothing / be disabled.\r\n\r\nOn the flipside, if you were to click \"Zoom In\" at 33%, you would be set to 50%. Similarly, \"Zoom In\" would be disabled past 100%, but you could still zoom in or out to arbitrary levels using \"Zoom to...\".\r\n\r\nAnother possible control mechanism for this feature is, when you are clicked on nothing (i.e. click on the white space surrounding Storyboard objects), you could zoom in and out by holding command and scrolling the scroll wheel of your mouse. Currently, holding command and scrolling does the exact same thing as if you were not holding command. \r\n\r\nI think these would be extremely beneficial enhancements to Interface Builder's control scheme.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other issues that I have with Xcode and Interface Builder, which I will submit in separate bug reports, but this one is a big concern for me. I am growing to learn how to use Interface Builder and properly design layouts using Autolayout, but in order for me to be able to fully maximize my own potential using this software, I need certain things changed about them that are currently either extremely difficult or impossible to achieve on my own in any reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nI am enjoying using Apple's software and hardware and have been a fan since I first received an iPod Nano 2nd Gen. when I was 16 years old. I am 28 now, and to see Apple perform this enhancement would add a tremendous amount of faith in the company for myself. I would love to see Apple helping to cater to the needs of developers with disabilities, as I am told that Apple is, as the co-worker who recommended I file this bug report said, \"big into accessibility\".\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and God Speed!"
