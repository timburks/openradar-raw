    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm testing fdesetup's new ability to set up a deferred enablement and have the user prompted at the login window. It does not appear to be working in 10.10 DP 8, though it did work in earlier Developer Previews\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install 10.10 DP 7\r\n2. Upgrade to 10.10 DP8\r\n3. Create new local user\r\n4. Log in as that new local user\r\n5. While logged in as the new local user, set up deferred enablement using the following command:\r\n\r\nsudo fdesetup enable -keychain -defer /recover.plist -forceatlogin 0 -dontaskatlogout\r\n\r\n6. Restart\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter the restart, I should be able to log in as that new local user then be forced to enabled FileVault 2 encryption.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the restart, I am able to log in as that new local user but FileVault 2 encryption is not initiated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 14A361c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRunning the following command will prompt at logout for the new local user's password then initiate FileVault 2 encryption:\r\n\r\nsudo fdesetup enable -keychain -defer /recover.plist -forceatlogin 0\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis behavior was observed on a 2014 13 inch MacBook Pro with a 256 GB SSD and 8 GBs of RAM. Similar behavior was observed in a VMware Fusion Pro 7 VM running 10.10 14A361c."
