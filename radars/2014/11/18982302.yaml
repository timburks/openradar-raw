        Summary:
        An inbox rule that has a criteria of “Message Content” contains [expression], where the expression is a long expression over about 62 (?) characters, messages that are plain text but otherwise have the proper content will fail.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a Rule with the following conditions:
         Name: Whatever
         if [any] of the following conditions are met:
        	Criteria
         [Message content]  [contains] “Some very long text that is something that I want to search for in a message.”
        	Actions
         [Mark as Flagged] [blue] (or any other action that allows you to test if the rule was performed)

        From another account (where you can determine that the message is sent as plain text [i.e. FastMail]) send a plain text message to the first account with the following line in the content:

        “Some very long text that is something that I want to search for in a message.”

        In both cases the text should be without the quotes.

        Expected Results:
        The incoming message should have the action applied to it (in my example the flag should be set to blue).

        Actual Results:
        The rule action is not executed

        Regression:
        I have reproduced this on both Mail 7.3 and 8.0. I have even been able to reproduce this as long as the compared text spans the location where plain text encoding breaks the original message
