    description: "Summary:\r\nFoundation supports plurals via a .stringsdict (plurals strings dictionary file) for iOS 7+ and Mac OS applications.  However, plurals are missing from the resulting XLIFF document created by Xcode 6's \"Export for Localization\" feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6\r\n2. Clone or download this demo project on GitHub https://github.com/foo4u/iOS-Localizing-Plurals-Demo\r\n3. From the Xcode 6 menu choose Editor -> Export for Localization\r\n4. Open exported en.xliff file, note that the plurals from Localizable.stringsdict were excluded from the export as translation units\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlurals are represented in the XLIFF file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough the XLIFF contains a reference to the Geese/en.lproj/Localizable.stringsdict file, there are no translation units generated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.1 (6A1052d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlthough the current XLIFF specification lacks a clear definition of how to represent plurals, a solution must be devised.  The current implementation for Xcode 6's export for localization does not allow translators to handle plural localization."
