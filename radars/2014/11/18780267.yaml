    description: "Summary:\r\nAuto-generating an NSManagedObject subclass in Swift does a pretty good job.\r\nHowever, if you try to use the objects as-is (like in a simple fetch), it will cause an exception because it cannot find the entity with the name.\r\n\r\nThis is always fixed by putting @objc(MyClass) above the class delcaration, such as:\r\n\r\n@objc(BlogPost)\r\nclass BlogPost: NSManagedObject {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these could be generated automatically, and I wouldn't be surprised with a crash every time I change my data model :)"
