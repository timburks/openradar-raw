    description: "Let's assume that the iPhone app in question includes the ability to playback audio and also integrates with the MediaPlayer framework to display the title/artwork/playback position of the currently playing audio, and also includes support for the responder-chain-based controls to advance playback, pause, go back, etc.\n \nI think the Apple Watch should include some type of integration with the Media Player framework to essentially \"do the right thing\" when the iPhone associated with the Watch is playing audio. What I would expect to happen in this case is that the watch would show playback controls based on MPNowPlayingInfoCenter to the user, and that control events triggered through the watch would get passed back to the phone's responder chain so that the phone could take control action based on that input.\n \nAlternatively, if this won't be the case by default, there should be some supported integration with the Media Player framework for developers wishing to build Apple Watch apps that involve playback of audio. I'm assuming the desire will not be for each developer to implement their own set of audio controls on the small interface, which is why I am assuming that some sort of MediaPlayer framework integration will be achievable.\n \nI see this as an enhancement request. Audio based apps are surely going to be a key part of the Apple Watch and I think there are some great ways Apple could leverage Media Player to make that a much better experience for users and developers."
