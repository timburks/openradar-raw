    description: "Summary:\nPages 5.2.2 and earlier could have tables that started in the middle of a page, then flowed across multiple pages. In Pages 5.5 on Mavericks, mutipage tables break the page immediately before the table, creating a large empty space in the document. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCreate a new document with the Invoice template. Add 12 rows to the invoice’s table.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe table continues to the bottom of the first page, then the last few rows appear at the top of the second page.\n\nActual Results:\nThe entire table jumps to the second page, leaving the invoice’s header on a mostly blank first page.\n\nRegression:\nThis functionality was possible on Pages ’09 through Pages 5.2.2. This breaks existing documents (for example invoices) that were laid out with multipage tables.\n\nNotes:\nAs far as I can find, there is no alternative way to do this."
