    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a device has a passcode set the user to unlock the device with the passcode before iOS will connect to any wifi networks (even known networks). This is a major issue for managed devices as there is no way to clear the passcode via MDM without a network connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set passcode on device\r\n2. Turn device off\r\n3. Turn device on\r\n4. Observe lack of wifi\r\n5. Unlock device with wifi and observe wifi connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevice should connect to know wifi network when restarted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice require passcode unlock to connect to wifi\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0, iOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a major headache for managed distributions like schools because there is currently no way to disable passcodes from being enabled on devices.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 16GB WiFi, iPad Air 32GB WiFi, iPhone 6 16GB AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
