    description: "Summary:\r\nEven though the attached switch statement covers every logical possibility for the switch statement, Xcode complains that the switch statement is not exhaustive and should contain a default case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a struct in Swift with two or more boolean values.\r\n2. Create an instance of the struct, initialized with values.\r\n3. Create a tuple of two of the boolean values in the struct.\r\n4. Switch on the tuple with (true, true), (true, false), (false, true), and (false, false) covered.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause all four possible truth states are covered, the compiler will not complain about a missing default statement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“Switch must be exhaustive, consider adding a default clause.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 from the Mac App Store"
