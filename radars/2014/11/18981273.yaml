    description: "Summary:\nI’ve subclassed AVPlayerViewController for a tech demo and I’m trying to get the right position to add overlays. I figured that using the `readyForDisplay` property would be the best bet, so I set about using a Swift observer:\n\n    override var readyForDisplay: Bool {\n        didSet {\n            \n        }\n    }\n\nThis generates an error - saying it can’t be observed because it can’t change. Then what good is this property? Should I poll the thing like an animal???\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nGiven\n\nExpected Results:\nAbility to observe read-only properties so that I can do cool stuff afterwards\n\nActual Results:\nGiven\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nI’ll now scour the docs and probably end up using some kind of notification subscription … like an animal."
