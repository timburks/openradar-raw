    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a barcode scanning scenario with a running AVCapture session: if you adjust the metadata rectOfInterest the preview video goes blank and the main thread is blocked for a noticeable delay.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a barcode scanner app with a preview layer\r\n2. hook up the metadata objects detector and delegate\r\n3. on interface rotation, adjust the rect of interest\r\n4. run the app in portrait, rotate to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no noticeable visual effect of changing the rect of interest\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The preview video goes blank\r\n- The main thread is blocked\r\n- After this noticeable delay the interface rotates\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy workaround is to not change the rect of interest, but instead check if reported metadata objects' bounds are within my scan target view area.\r\n\r\nThis is quite suboptimal since changing the rect of interest (in particular for 1D barcodes) would be very beneficial for the scanning performance due to scan lines being used. The smaller the area, the more compact they can be.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
