    description: "Summary:\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\n\nExpected Results:\nOpen the attached project. Itâ€™ll explain things in more detail and show off the issue.\nThe second UIAlertController in style UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet never shows up, only the dimming view does. The log is all over constraint issues.\n\nActual Results:\nNo sheet is showing up, but instead we have this in the log:\n2014-11-09 21:56:22.948 UIAlertViewConstraintIssue[45380:3380118] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.\n\tProbably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints) \n(\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fe3d0480eb0 H:[UIView:0x7fe3d0446b30(304)]>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fe3d0472270 _UIAlertControllerView:0x7fe3d04909a0'Constraint Issue'.width >= UIView:0x7fe3d0446b30.width>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fe3d0476cf0 _UIAlertControllerView:0x7fe3d04909a0'Constraint Issue'.width == UIView:0x7fe3d0491b30.width>\",\n    \"<NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint:0x7fe3d049a880 h=--& v=--& H:[UIView:0x7fe3d0491b30(0)]>\"\n)\n\nWill attempt to recover by breaking constraint \n<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fe3d0480eb0 H:[UIView:0x7fe3d0446b30(304)]>\n\n\nSee the full log at https://gist.github.com/steipete/34de862cd5c71740201d\n\n\nRegression:\nSince this API is new, this never worked.\n\nNotes:\nManually checking if the rect is too large and calculating the center point is a workaround, but this should be fixed in the framework."
