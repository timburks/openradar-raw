    description: "Summary:\r\nMerely accessing the presentationController changes program flow and breaks rotation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen sample, press “show modal”. Observe that it is presented in portrait, even though we have preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation overridden to UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft.\r\n\r\nChange the program and comment out the single [navController presentationController];, run again and observe that everything’s working as expected now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccessing a getter should not have side effects. preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation should always be honored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccessing a getter has side effects, calls  -[UIViewController _setTemporaryPresentationController:], and later on runs through different code paths in -[UIViewController _presentViewController:withAnimationController:completion:] (which doesn’t re-set the modalPresentationStyle) and then ultimately doesn’t query the preferred rotation in _preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentationInWindow:fromInterfaceOrientation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis API didn’t exist in iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTracking down this bug was quite a lot of fun :)"
