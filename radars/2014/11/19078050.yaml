    description: "Summary:\r\nIn swift, when you define a property, you can assign a value directly to it, making the compiler recognising the type and sets it for you. However, if you want to do things like \"willSet\" or \"didSet\" it'll fail, and you'll be forced to create an explicit type.\r\n\r\nclass SomeClass {\r\n    // a will be recognised as a computed property, but it's not. It will therefore require you to assign an explicit type.\r\n    var a = \"hello, world\" {\r\n        didSet {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // b won't fail, since it's explicit type is String\r\n    var b: String = \"hello, world\" {\r\n        didSet {\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis is wrong, since none of them above are computed properties.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the above code in a playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth a and b will succeed to be a property of a String\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth a and b will be computed properties and a will fail since it doesn't have an explicit type."
