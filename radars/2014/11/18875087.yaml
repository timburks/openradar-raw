    description: "It would be great to have a category in HealthKit around Personal Care metrics - for example: Shaving Frequency.\r\n\r\nPrimary use case for my application is shaving metrics - people don't know how often they shave and so often run out of razors. Being able to record these metrics would ensure they always have a sharp razor handy and reduce cuts to legs & faces. \r\n\r\nI could imagine that other personal care events - such as how often you brush your teeth or floss - might be relevant to medical practitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnder 'Health Data', a category called 'Personal Care'\r\nUnder 'Personal Care', items such as the following - Floss, Shave (Legs), Shave (Face), Shave (Other) etc\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are currently no HealthKit-related Personal Care categories. The Quantified Self movement would be appreciative :)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
