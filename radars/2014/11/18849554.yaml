    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a file whose name is the bell character, attempting to drag-and-drop that file will fail, and then all subsequent attempts to drag-and-drop other files will fail until Finder is forcibly relaunched from the Force Quit window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a file with the bell character as its name:\r\n$ printf \"\\a\" | xargs touch\r\n2. Open your working directory in the Finder, and the file you just created will show up.\r\n3. Observe that dragging and dropping other files works fine.\r\n4. Attempt to drag-and-drop the \"\\a\" file (shows up as a nameless generic file).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should still be able to drag and drop other files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are unable to drag-and-drop any files."
