        Summary:
        When a pop-up button’s menu items are laid out differently in the menu than in the button, the second-last frame of the selection animation—drawn within the button—is of their menu state, before jumping to the state shown in the button. This ends up looking glitchy.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached project.
        2. Build & run.
        3. Click the pop-up button.
        4. Select one of the items in its menu.
        5. Watch carefully!

        (You may want to do the shift key slows animations trick, there’s an env var for that as I recall.)


        Expected Results:
        I expected the menu to animate closed and for the pop-up button itself never to show the layout of the menu item as shown in the menu.


        Actual Results:
        Instead, the menu animates closed leaving—for just a moment—the pop-up button showing the icon & title laid out approximately as they are in the menu. Then it jumps to the final (correct) button layout—small icon & text positioned correctly


        Regression:
        - Don’t recall this happening on Mavs but haven’t specifically tested.
        - Doesn’t happen if you use a view to draw the menu items (but then you have to use a view to draw the menu items).
        - Doesn’t make a difference whether you use Swift or Storyboards or neither, this is a reduction of an instance in an Objective-C/xib app.


        Notes:
        Sample project attached.

        Note that the specific factors contributing to the different layout are:
        - the size of the icon (32x32 or whatever, which is larger than what will be displayed by the menu item)
        - the indentation level (1 for the selectable items)
