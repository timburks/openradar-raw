    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen retrieving a UTF16View for a Swift String, using the methods from Sliceable to access the UTF16View always returns the same UTF16View, without any truncation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a Swift project\r\n2. Declare a String\r\n3. Attempt to use the String's .utf16 property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing \"prefix(string.utf16, n)\" returns a UTF16View that is truncated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn identical UTF16View is returned from any function that relies on Sliceable."
