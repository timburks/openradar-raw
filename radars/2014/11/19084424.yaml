        If I understand the devforums thread https://devforums.apple.com/thread/255073?tstart=0 and the answers of Apple fellows correctly, location access isn't possible from extensions, including WatchKit extensions.

        This is unfortunate as it doesn't allow a whole class of useful apps such as navigation apps, POI finders, checkin and GPS tracking apps.

        I’d expect that a WatchKit extension has the same permissions as the main app and can access Core Location while it’s running.
