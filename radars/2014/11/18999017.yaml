        Summary:
        In the email one receives after remotely playing a sound on an device trough „find my iphone“ the displayed time is wrong. It appears, that the time is displayed in PST timezone, but no timezone is mentioned.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use iCloud.com to find an device and play a sound on that device. The devices plays the sound and you’ll receive an email stating, that the device has played an sound on {Date} at {Time}. The given time is in PST. This happenes in the german localized version of the email. With a german iPhone 6 and an german iCloud Account. I have no chance to check other localizations.

        Expected Results:
        At a bare minimum the email should include the information with timezone the time is interpreted in. It can always happen, that the device and the person requesting the sound (and therefore receiving the email) are in different timezones.
        It would be preferable the display the time in the timezone the device is in. One could argue the timezone of the receiver is an option, too. But you can never guess in which timezone an email is read. The timezone of the device can be determined accurately, because the location of the device is known.

        Actual Results:
        The email mentions a time, but no reference of how to interpret the time in regard of the timezone.

        Regression:
        The scenario ist reproducible in the german localization of icloud.
        I have no idea when it was introduced.
