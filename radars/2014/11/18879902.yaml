    description: Patient Reported Outcome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-reported_outcome) data is a vital when performing diagnoses, and is information that is not covered in normal vitals collection (heart rate, blood pressure, etc).  This information is usually collected during office visits - not at the time of the actual event (e.g., a Migraine attack) - and does not usually have any contextual information (e.g. food consumed that day) that can help the care provider determine possible triggers.  The ability to enter PRO data directly into HealthKit, along with the normal supporting data, can help care providers identify triggers and trend data during applicable events
