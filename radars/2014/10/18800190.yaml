    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling -[PHAsset requestContentEditingInputWithOptions:completionHandler:] on a video PHAsset will return a PHContentEditingInput with a populated 'avAsset' of type AVURLAsset. Attempting to read from the underlying URL of the AVURLAsset will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ko0yv8kzcpmvtir/Sandbox%20Bug.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\n1) Open the sample project and run it. It will crash.\r\n2) Toggle the 'useRequestAVAssetAPI' to YES. This demonstrates a workaround whereby holding on to the AVAsset returned from -[PHImageManager requestAVAssetForVideo:options:resultHandler:] enables the application to read from the PHContentEditingInput's underlying AVAsset URL. The sample application will no longer crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReading from the PHContentEditingInput's underlying AVURLAsset URL should be allowed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn application must utilize the workaround provided in order to read from the underlying URL.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 64 GB, AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Sandbox Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
