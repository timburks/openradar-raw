    description: "Summary:\r\nDeveloped iOS app in Swift to be distributed via Enterprise developer program distribution method.\r\n\r\nApp works fine when running development build. Distribution build works fine on iOS 7 devices, but when run on iOS 8, crash with this log:\r\n\r\nIncident Identifier: DDA55483-CB29-4812-AB9B-B0C3DA0CC47B\r\nCrashReporter Key:   0e84171feee4b5049eacf41d699b71979cd66260\r\nHardware Model:      iPhone7,2\r\nProcess:             MYAPP [289]\r\nPath:                /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/F38EF58A-1FEB-4AF1-9479-DD2D5C35F630/MYAPP.app/MYAPP\r\nIdentifier:          com.example.myapp\r\nVersion:             20141013.1 (1.0)\r\nCode Type:           ARM-64 (Native)\r\nParent Process:      launchd [1]\r\n\r\nDate/Time:           2014-10-13 11:22:54.272 -0400\r\nLaunch Time:         2014-10-13 11:22:54.266 -0400\r\nOS Version:          iOS 8.0.2 (12A405)\r\nReport Version:      105\r\n\r\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\r\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000001, 0x00000001200d5088\r\nTriggered by Thread:  0\r\n\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\n  Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib\r\n  Referenced from: /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/F38EF58A-1FEB-4AF1-9479-DD2D5C35F630/MYAPP.app/MYAPP\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.

Still crashes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nProblem seen on iPhone 6 and on iPad Air running iOS 8.\r\n\r\nProblem does not occur on iPod touch running iOS 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MYAPP.zip' and 'crashlog.txt' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nUpdate 2014-10-13 15:15\r\n\r\nI was able to \"fix\" this problem by creating a new Distribution certificate and then creating new provisioning profiles with that certificate. So it appears to be related to code signing.\r\n\r\nWhile I no longer have a problem, I don't consider this to be a good resolution. I had to revoke an existing distribution certificate before the portal would allow me to create a new one. If we could create an unlimited number of certificates, then this would just be an annoyance, but being forced to revoke certificates for apps that are already in the field is not a good workaround.\r\n\r\nI hope Apple can provide a fix or workaround that does not require revocation of existing certificates, or provide an explanation that convinces us that this problem won't recur."
