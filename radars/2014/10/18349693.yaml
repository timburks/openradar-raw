    description: "Summary:\r\nThe attached UITableView and static cell silently break their IB layout constraints.\r\n\r\nThe constraints are not ambiguous yet the layout engine moves the label \"hello\" off the right hand side of the screen.\r\n\r\nThe layout engine also fails to calculate a good width for the \"This is too much text ...\" label. In reality, it should be able to calculate a maximum width, setup `preferredMaxLayoutWidth` and then have the cell layout with all text over two lines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRu the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCells should have two text fields, one should be two lines. All text should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly see one text field, its truncated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6A1030\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.1ÃŸ2 iOS8 simulator.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'celllayout.zip' was successfully uploaded."
