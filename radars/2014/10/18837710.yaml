    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Calendar on OS X 10.10, when attempting to print a weekly or monthly calendar, the value for 'Start week on' from the application preferences is incremented by 1 (e.g. a calendar week starting on Monday will print starting on Tuesday).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Note the 'Start week on' setting from Calendar > Preferences > General\r\n2. Note that the display on-screen works correctly, reflecting the selected 'Start week on' setting.\r\n3. Choose File > Print\r\n4a. Zoom in and inspect the print preview to see which day the week starts on.\r\n4b. Print the calendar and inspect which day the week starts on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor both 4a. and 4b., it is expected that the printout should match the on-screen display in terms of which day of week to start on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor both 4a. and 4b., the calendar previews and prints out with a start day one greater than the day selected in the preferences.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10\r\nCalendar 8.0 (2026)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a workaround, this can be overcome by temporarily changing the week start day to be one lower than desired; this will counteract the addition of a day and result in a printout of the correct information. Obviously not ideal.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens consistently on my install of OS X 10.10. Additionally a web search turned up a similar result from another user running the same version of the application (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6637741)"
