    description: "Summary:\r\nSome users are seeing a problem with their iCloud account on devices running iOS 8.1b2 (12B407).  \r\n\r\nIt appears after running for some amount of time, calls to iCloud become non-responsive. Specifically, [NSFileManager ubiquityIdentityToken] fails to return.\r\n\r\nApps calling [NSFileManager ubiquityIdentityToken] crash because the system terminates them for hanging the main thread.\r\n\r\nIf the user signs out of iCloud and signs back in, the issue goes away â€“ at least for some amount of time, then usually returns.\r\n\r\nI am aware of 6 users who have reported this problem and it has happen to me on my own iPad Air.  It seems to not be a device-linked problem, however.  Users reporting the issue continue to have use iCloud successfully on other devices, and reports have from different devices (iPads, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 at least).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to have iCloud Account exhibit this problem are not known.  Once an account exhibits this problem, launch an app that calls [NSFileManager ubiquityIdentityToken] to determine if iCloud is available.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n[NSFileManager ubiquityIdentityToken] should quickly return a token on nil.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n[NSFileManager ubiquityIdentityToken] does not return, and the iOS system will terminate the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1b2 [12B407]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
