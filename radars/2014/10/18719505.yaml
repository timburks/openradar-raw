    description: "Summary:\r\nI change system settings to Polish, but my app is still running in english. Bug started with Xcode 6.1 and iOS Simulator 8.1. App running on device works without problems, so it's iOS Simulator bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Prepare multi language app (e.g. English and Polish)\r\n2. Set English as developer language in project.\r\n3. Set iOS Simulator to Polish\r\n4. Run the app - it will be in english instead of polish.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should run in polish.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp is in english.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1, iOS Simulator 8.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
