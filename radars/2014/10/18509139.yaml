    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter six months since this change, myself and other users still find it hard to discern the state of the iOS light keyboard's shift key by observation. This is because the \"on\" state is not distinct - it blends in with the neighbouring letter keys which are also white.\r\n\r\nThis issue is particularly frustrating because the shift key can toggle unexpectely during the process of writing something, for example after typing \"U.S.A. \" or when starting to type in a form field you weren't expecting to capitalize your input.\r\n\r\nThe dark mode keyboard does not have this issue since the shift key is distinct from the other keys.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app such as Notes that has the light keyboard.\r\n2. Attempt to type \"jury is my username, and Michael Jurewitz is my given name. I am from the U.S.A. and live in California.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUse the visual feedback of the shift key selection state to manage the shift key as you write the text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind that the forced toggling of the shift key is unnecessarily challenging due to the unclear communication of shift key state."
