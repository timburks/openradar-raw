        Summary:
        The NSString method “-dataUsingEncoding:allowLossyConversion:” throws and exception on 10.10.0 when called on a valid string.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new “Command Line Tool”
        2. Replace the code with the attached main.m file
        3. Build & Run

        Expected Results:
        The test code should run without any output.

        Actual Results:
        The test code runs with output like this (always the same):
        Exception for character: ‘°’…

        Regression:
        Works without exceptions on Mac OS X 10.9.5 (13F34).

        Notes:
        Both NSString and NSMutableString are affected.
        It works fine, when the method is called on codePointString (see test code).
        So there needs to be a prefix to trigger this.
