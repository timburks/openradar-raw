    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Testflight integration makes us add the users as Team Members to allow them to instal internal testing apps. That'd be fine, only if an Apple ID could have multiple iTunes Connect accounts linked.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that is not possible, so, we need the Internal Testers to be able to hold multiple iTunes Account links, or the Testflight iOS 8 app, to be able to have more than one Apple ID linked.\r\n\r\nThat's the only thing preventing us using the new Testflight platform.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to add an user as a Team member.\r\nThe user has another iTunes Connect account linked.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can add the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't add the user as it has other iTunes Connect account. Even if the other membership is expired.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
