    description: If I bring up the emoji/character selection menu in a text field by pressing ctrl-cmd-space and type "lambda", the only result is the Æ› (latin small letter lambda with stroke (U+019B)), rather than any variant of the greek letter lambda.  This is because the unicode spec misspells "lambda" as "lamda", but I still should be able to search for the character by its proper spelling.
