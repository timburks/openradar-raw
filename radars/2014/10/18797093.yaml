    description: "Summary:\r\nI have created an NSURLProtocol subclass so that I can dynamically add headers to my NSURLRequests. This is particularly useful when loading streaming content via URL with MPMoviePlayerController. We add custom headers to access the streaming content, and since MPMoviePlayerController does not allow an init with NSURLRequest (only NSURL) the headers are added by the NSURLProtocol subclass. In previous version of iOS (7.x) this worked seamlessly. In iOS 8, the NSURLProtocol's `canInitWithRequest` method is never hit when the MPMoviePlayerController begins playback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register a custom NSURLProtocol subclass, eg customScheme:\r\n2. Build a URL that conforms to that subclass, e.g. customScheme://example.com/variant.m3u8\r\n3. Pass that URL into an MPMoviePlayerController via initWithContentURL\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSURLProtocol subclass's canInitWithRequest method should hit, as well as its startLoading and stopLoading methods\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis method is not hit when a url is loaded via the MPMoviePlayerController. It is hit, however, from other http requests in the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tested this on iOS 7.x devices, and the NSURLProtocol is behaving as expected with MPMoviePlayerControllers\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, WiFi"
