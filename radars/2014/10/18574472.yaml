    description: "[This issue appears to have been resolved somewhere along the road from Xcode 6.0.1 to Xcode 7.2.1, as the latter version behaves correctly, naming the application as expected.]\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen exporting a Developer ID-signed copy of my Mac application from an archive build, Xcode 6 offers to name the exported application with the name of the scheme used to build the archive, rather than the product name (as in previous versions of Xcode).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode workspace containing an OS X application project named \"MacClient\", which in turn contains an application target named \"Simplify Printing TX\". The target's product name is also \"Simplify Printing TX\". The workspace contains a scheme corresponding to this product that is named \"Mac Client\" (with a space).\r\n2. Select the scheme (\"Mac Client\") and choose Product > Archive.\r\n3. From the Organizer window, select the resulting archive (\"Mac Client\") and click Export.\r\n4. Choose \"Export a Developer ID-signed Application\".\r\n5. Select a Development Team in the following sheet.\r\n6. Wait as the archive is prepared for export.\r\n7. When the summary sheet is presented, click Export to present a save sheet for naming the exported application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe default name for the application is the product name specified in the application target's build settings (in this case, \"Simplify Printing TX\").\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe default name for the application is the scheme name used to build the application (in this case, \"Mac Client\").\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\nOS X version 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis problem is observed to occur with Xcode version 6.0.1. It was not observed to occur with Xcode 5.1.1 or earlier versions."
