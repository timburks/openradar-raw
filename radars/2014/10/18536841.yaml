    description: "Summary:\r\nApps built using Xcode 6 with asset catalogue for app icons erroneously use the @3x Spotlight icon from the asset catalogue in place of the @2x app icon on retina iPhones using iOS 7 or 8. This only occurs if the deployment target for the app is iOS 5.1.1 or below, and removing the @3x Spotlight icon or changing the deployment target to iOS >=6.0 restores the correct icon.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs on Retina (@2x) iPhone devices on iOS 7 and 8 when using an asset catalogue for the app icon (see IconsCatalogue.png) and building for OS versions prior to iOS 6.0. The problem also occurs on the Simulator.\r\n\r\nIn order to build for iOS 5.1, the project must be built for armv7s architecture, but the problem occurs based on selected deployment target and seems unconnected to selected architectures.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project (AppIcons.zip) and build for iPhone with Retina display (Simulator or device).\r\n2. Observe the colour of the app icon of the built app.\r\n3. Change the project's deployment target to iOS 6.0 and re-run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blue icon from the asset catalogue should be the main app icon, regardless of the deployment target for the project (see BlueIcon.png).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe green Spotlight @3x icon is used as the main app icon when the deployment target is set to 5.1 (see GreenIcon.png).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0.1 (6A317) running on Mac OS X 10.9.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem can be worked around by removing the @3x Spotlight icon from the asset catalogue."
