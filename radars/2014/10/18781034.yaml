    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen user allow access to Photo Library in the application, then press home button, go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Photos and change \"Allow Changes\" to \"Don't Allow Changes\", then go back to the application and check that ALAssetsLibrary.authorizationStatus() is equal to ALAuthorizationStatusRestricted. It should be, but is not, so I can't react to this action with changes in UI. Change is reflecter after application is restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run application on device, not in simulator.\r\n2. Open UIImagePickerController within it.\r\n3. System dialog about access permissions is showed, tap on \"Allow access\" button.\r\n4. Press home button.\r\n5. Open Settings > General > Restrictions > Photos.\r\n6. Change \"Allow access\" to \"Don't allow access\".\r\n7. Double press Home button and  go back to our application.\r\n8. Check that ALAssetsLibrary.authorizationStatus() is not equal to ALAuthorizationStatusRestricted, but it should be.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nALAssetsLibrary.authorizationStatus() should immediately reflect system settings, when user change it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nALAssetsLibrary.authorizationStatus() still holds its previous value."
