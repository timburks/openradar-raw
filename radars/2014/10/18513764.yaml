    description: "Attachment: https://jeffvautin.com/wp-content/uploads/openradar/radarInteractivePopGestureRecognizer.zip\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe UITableViewController BOOL property clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear *usually* does what it is supposed to - clearing the selection when -(void)viewWillAppear is called. If the UITableViewController is embedded in a UINavigationController, this BOOL behaves appropriately when using the Back navigation button, and when using the interactivePopGestureRecognizer at slow speeds.\r\n\r\nWhen the interactivePopGestureRecognizer is used to return to the UITableViewController, and the user applies the gesture very quickly, the cell selection is *not* cleared. In the attached demo video, you can see this happen at 0:20 and 0:28.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Xcode 6.0.1, create a new iPhone-only Master-Detail Application project.\r\n2. Run the application in the simulator or on a device (confirmed on iPhone 5 + 6).\r\n3. Add one or more objects to the Master View.\r\n4. Touch a cell to push the Detail View onto the stack.\r\n5. Swipe left to right *very* quickly to pop the detail view off the stack.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see the detail view pop off the stack, revealing the Master View. In the Master View, the cell that had been selected should have its selection animated away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen Master View is revealed, the selection is not cleared.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 (12A405), Xcode 6.0.1 Simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 T-Mobile 64GB, iPhone 5 AT&T 32GB, Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'radarInteractivePopGestureRecognizer_demo.mov' and 'radarInteractivePopGestureRecognizer.zip' were successfully uploaded."
