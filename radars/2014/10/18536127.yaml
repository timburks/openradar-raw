    description: "Floating and all spaces is easily done with\r\n\r\n[self.panel setLevel:kCGUtilityWindowLevel];\r\n[self.panel setCollectionBehavior:NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces];\r\n\r\nbut there is no way to then specify a flag to hide them in full screen mode.  There is also no notification to indicate a screen is going in or out of full screen mode, and no way to detect if a screen is or is not in full screen mode.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a flag or collection behaviour on panels to exclude them from full screen mode screens.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a system wide notification to indicate that a screen is entering or existing full screen mode.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a NSScreen property that would indicate if the screen was in full screen mode or not.  Ideally this property would be observable."
