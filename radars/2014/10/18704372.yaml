    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, the Network Link Conditioner limits the bandwidth of the entire system. Of course it is useful, but it would be even more useful if it could be limited to traffic from a certain application.\r\n\r\nIn particular -- the iOS Simulator.\r\nA physical device has a Network Link Conditioner setting, and so it would be super handy if the Simulator could have one too.\r\n\r\nI understand that the device is probably just reusing the one from OS X, limiting the entire system, and that the Simulator is basically just an OS X app. Thats why it would be even better if we could generalize it to work on only specified apps."
