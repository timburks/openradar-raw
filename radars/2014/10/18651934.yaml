    description: "I often get the following error message when trying to define live render a view in IB:\r\n\r\nerror: IB Designables: Failed to render instance of MyView: Rendering the view took longer than 200 ms. Your drawing code may suffer from slow performance.\r\n\r\nThis happened to me when I had the wrong module name set in the .xib - got the wrong error message about it.\r\nAnd now it's happening again and I'm pretty hopeless about it because I don't know what the real error is. It's clearly not the slowness of the rendering as I confirmed the drawRect code is never invoked.\r\n\r\nSearching in the devforums lead me to understand this is a common issue masking various kinds of runtime errors:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/1052529#1052529"
