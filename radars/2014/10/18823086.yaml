    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding collection view cells to a collection view in storyboard only the size of the cell's contentView changes to the specified item size. Size of the collection view cell itself stays standard 50 x 50\r\nAs a side effect, having auto layout inside of the cell crashes when cell is just created due to unsatisfiable constraints.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to easy if you open storyboard as source code and look for an appropriate line in XML\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see the test project http://cl.ly/0V0d21453b3E for details. Running in debug mode shows auto layout crashes in the console.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCell size should be set to the same value as collection view's \"Item size\" and should be equal to cell's contentSize\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCell size stays standard 50x50 and is being changed only after collection view layout gets a turn to update it."
