    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen viewing a header file, all methods that take at least one parameter, and have attributes are missing from the jump–bar symbol pop–up that is triggered by ctrl-6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open <UIKit/UIViewController.h>\r\n2. Open the symbol pop–up by clicking the right–most breadcrumb, or hitting the ctrl-6 hot key.\r\n3. Narrow down the list by typing unwind.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe list is filtered down to all methods including the word “unwind”, such as (but not limited to) `-viewControllerForUnwindSegueAction:`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe list is completely empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
