        Summary:
        Although CONNECTION_SessionTask is a private class, instances of this class are passed in to NSURLProtocol’s classed method “canInitWithTask:”

        This may lead to crashes if the protocol then tries to use methods not implemented in this private class or observe any property.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Run attached project in iOS simulator

        Expected Results:
        - Not to crash

        Actual Results:
        - See it crash!

        Regression:
        NO, this is new to iOS 8.
