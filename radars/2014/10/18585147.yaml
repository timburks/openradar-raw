    description: "Duplicate of rdar://18584788 filed by another developer. When I generate an app-specific password and copy/paste it, it includes a trailing newline. Because of the invisible trailing newline, copy/pasting that generated app-specific password into a third-party app can result in authentication failure (incorrect password) when the app attempts to use the pasted password (which includes the newline) to authenticate with iCloud. Third-party app makers such as Fantastical (the app I first experienced this bug with) will be updating their apps to strip the newline, but the newline shouldn't be included on the Apple-generated app-specific password in the first place. Because the newline is invisible, it is a difficult problem for non-technical users to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nRelevant URL: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/security"
