    description: "Summary:\r\nThere seems to be an issue in the CoreBluetooth framework that us causing all readRSSI() requests to never trigger the new iOS 8 delegate peripheral(peripheral: CBPeripheral!, didReadRSSI RSSI: NSNumber!, error: NSError!)\r\n\r\nThis issue only occurs once the application has successfully connected to this device once. Upon disconnection and reconnection the application never receives this callback again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. connect to BLE device.\r\n2. attempt to read the RSSI value with the method readRSSI()\r\n3. disconnect from BLE device.\r\n4. reconnect to BLE device.\r\n5. attempt to read the RSSI value with the method readRSSI()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results is to recieve the delegate callback  peripheral(peripheral: CBPeripheral!, didReadRSSI RSSI: NSNumber!, error: NSError!) with either an updated RSSI value or an error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual results: the initial connection reads the RSSI value correctly, but ALL subsequent connections made are not capable of reading the RSSI value utilizing the same paths to request.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6+ running iOS 8.0.2 (12A405), iPhone 5s running 8.0.0 (12A365), iPhone 4s running iOS 7.1.2 (11D257). \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe BLE device I am using is my companies standard chip on an EM board, and has been tested to confirm no issue with the BLE device. This problem is 100% reproducible for myself, the iPhone 4s running 7.1.2 receives its iOS 7 delegate callback 100% of the time, but the issue persists between both the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6+\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ running iOS 8.0.2 (12A405), iPhone 5s running 8.0.0 (12A365), iPhone 4s running iOS 7.1.2 (11D257)."
