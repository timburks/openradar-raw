    description: "Summary:\r\nOur company has developed an app that requires iOS >= 8 as it uses several new features including action notifications. The app needs to detect the presence of specific iBeacons in any running state (foreground/background/not running). The app is properly configured for this usage. (CLBeaconRegion properties notifyOnEntry, notifyOnExit and notifyEntryStateOnDisplay are set to true. \"Location Updates\" as a background mode is enabled so that I can receive delegate events when the application is even killed.)\r\n \r\nIt has been working perfectly for the last 3 weeks on iOS 8.0/8.02, but after I installed the 8.1 OTA update on my iPhone 6+ today it will only receive the didEnterRegion notification when running in the foreground. If it's in the background, not running, or the device is locked then no region notifications are received.\r\n \r\nAlthough I had been using the 8.0 betas before the official release I haven't used any of the 8.1 betas.\r\n\r\nYour AirLocate sample app (properly updated for the iOS 8 location privacy changes) exhibits the same behavior on iOS 8.1. I suggest using it to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe following requires 2 iPhones:\r\n\r\n1. Update AirLocate sample app to be iOS 8+ compliant.\r\n2. On both iPhones install the AirLocate app & ensure that bluetooth turned on.\r\n3. Run the on both phones app & give permission for notifications & location access.\r\n4. On the first iPhone tap Monitoring, then make sure the Notify Entry & Enabled sliders, are on, then tap Save.\r\n5. Put the app into the background by pressing the home button \r\n6. On the second iPhone tap Configuration, then the Enabled slider, then Save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone which is monitoring for entry notifications should present a notification to the user that it has seen the iBeacon being broadcast from the second iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification is presented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome additional info:\r\n \r\nOur app is written in Swift and was built with Xcode v6.0.1.\r\n \r\nSince the bug manifested itself after the 8.1 update I've installed Xcode 6.1, updated the code to match the recent Swift changes (lots of new ! and fewer ?).\r\n \r\nRunning the newly rebuilt app in the debugger confirms that didEnterRegion & didExitRegion are only being called when the app is in the foreground with the device unlocked.\r\n \r\nI've scanned the 8.1 release notes as well as the dev library and couldn't find any changes between 8 & 8.1 regarding background monitoring of iBeacon regions. Have I overlooked something or can we look forward to iOS 8.1.1 fixing this?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 128GB, au/kddi"
