    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user accepts an internal TestFlight invitation and they are logged in with a different Apple ID than their iTunes Connect account (see rdar://18529672), they will be able to install the application once, but will not be able to download updates because the account is not authorized for the build.  Also the user cannot run TestFlight on another device to download the initial version of the app for the same reason.\r\n\r\nInstead, the user must be logged in to their iTunes Connect Apple ID to have access to their internal builds.  This causes problems because iTunes Connect accounts are not typically used for App Store purchases and other functionality.  Also developers may be associated with multiple teams and have multiple iTunes Connect accounts as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open TestFlight, verify that Apple ID being used is different than the Apple ID used in iTunes Connect.\r\n2. Accept an invitation to test an app on the device in TestFlight.\r\n3. Install application.\r\n4. Update application to new version in TestFlight.\r\n5. Attempt to install updated version on the device in TestFlight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpdated application is installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication is not installed because the Apple ID does not have permission to access this build.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a workaround, the user can be removed from access to the app and then re-invited to download it. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
