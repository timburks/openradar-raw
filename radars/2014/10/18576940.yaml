    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLSession’s private method “setupBackgroundSession” hangs, causing the thread to become unusable.\r\nWhen the session is created on app launch, the app gets killed by the watchdog. Causing the app to become unusable.\r\n\r\nDue to the workaround we’ve found, we believe that this is caused by a corruption of the internal persistance of the background session. This seems to only affect the corrupted background session associated with an identifier as other apps using background session keep working as they should.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nFor users: Uninstall the app, reboot the phone and install again.\r\nFor devs: When this crash happens, change the backgroundIdentifier for that install.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI am unaware of any way to reproduce this, but I’ve attached a relevant stack trace.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn NSURLSession instance\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app getting killed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 (12A405)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone7,2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Seahorse.crash' was successfully uploaded."
