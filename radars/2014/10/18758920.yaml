    description: "Summary:\r\nCurly apostrophes such as ’ appear in the TestFlight iOS app as question marks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS app and upload a build to iTunes Connect.\r\n2. Submit the app for TestFlight testing.\r\n3. In the TestFlight description field, type some text that includes a curly apostrophe.\r\n4. Invite testers to test the build.\r\n5. Testers open the TestFlight app to download your new build.\r\n6. Testers tap the app in the app (this is getting confusing) to see the description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe description is as I typed it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe curly apostrophe has been converted to a question mark (“?”).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe curly apostrophes show up correctly in the App Store. They’re just wrong in the TestFlight app.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’m guessing it’s not just curly apostrophes. I would bet that curly quotes, characters with diacritical markings, unicode characters, and Emoji are all affected.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/YC8P"
