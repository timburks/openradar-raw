    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Yosemite, OS X briefly wakes from sleep every two hours even if the \"Wake for Network access\" preference is disabled in system settings. This can be an annoying issue for example if the Mac is located in a bed room and loudly spins up its fans and hard disk every two hours at night.\r\nWhile it is clear that OS X does need to wake up in order to maintain Bonjour Sleep Proxy functionality, the user should have a chance to disable this feature. This hasn't been an issue before version 10.10 of OS X.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A389)"
