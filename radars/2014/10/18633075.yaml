    description: "Summary:\r\n+[PHAsset fetchAssetsWithMediaType:options:] return duplicate assets that the developer has no way to de-duplicate, because those duplicated assets don't have the same localIdentifier. Still, their images are identical.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave iCloud sync your photo roll. Take photos. Invoke +[PHAsset fetchAssetsWithMediaType:options:].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe result contains unique assets.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result contains duplicated assets.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0.1 (6A317), iOS 8.0.2 (12A405).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like iterating moments and assets in moments does not give any duplicate. But of course, since the +[PHAsset fetchAssetsInAssetCollection:options:] is called several times, one per moment, one must now sort \"by hand\" all those assets. If only +[PHAsset fetchAssetsWithMediaType:options:] had not returned any duplicate, one could have simply used the sortDescriptor of the fetchOptions.\r\n\r\nPlease fix +[PHAsset fetchAssetsWithMediaType:options:], so that it does not return duplicate, or provide another option that filters out those duplicate assets.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe issue has happened on an iPhone 6+."
