    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m writing an initializer for an enum which uses a couple of nonrecursive functions internal to it, and which the compiler apparently does broken codegen for, resulting in a failed compile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Check out this branch (also attached):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/robrix/Traversal/pull/5\r\n\r\n2. Build it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to build, or if my code is broken to tell me that.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not build, apparently due to broken codegen:\r\n\r\nStored value type does not match pointer operand type!\r\n  store %SQ.17* %5, %SQ** %45, align 8, !dbg !422\r\n %SQ*LLVM ERROR: Broken function found, compilation aborted!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 GM seed 2 on Yosemite 14A379a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe error isn’t shown in Xcode at all, even if I copy the entire transcript using the contextual menu item. xcodebuild logged it tho.\r\n\r\nWrapping the reduction in a closure and calling that in the second parameter of the Cons also fails: https://github.com/robrix/Traversal/commit/a7a5539c902a1d01c630799f83fdaa4abe70f1c9\r\n\r\nPerforming the reduction eagerly and passing that in as the second parameter of the Cons succeeds: https://github.com/robrix/Traversal/commit/51fbec9e4f4a4bfdf8d83dcb19c1f739f8822643 (Note however that this form is incorrect; I’m using Stream because I need evaluation to be lazy.)"
