    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease refer to the attached project where the issue can easily be reproduced. In the test target, there is a file 'SwiftCrashAnyObjectTests.swift'. When line 20 of that file is un-commented, SourceKitService crashes. One of the crash logs is also attached to this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 6 (I'm using 6.0.1)\r\n2. Extract the attached zip file to a convenient location\r\n2. Open the project in the extracted zip file in Xcode\r\n3. In Xcode, open the file SwiftCrashAnyObjectTests.swift\r\n4. Verify that syntax highlighting works normally and no crash occurs\r\n5. Still in Xcode, remove the two forward slashes at the beginning of line 20 of that file\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should keep working normally, and syntax highlighting should keep working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode reports that SourceKitService has crashed and generates a crash log file (see attached example). Syntax highlighting doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\nXcode 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs on my machine.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SwiftCrashAnyObject.zip' and 'SourceKitService_2014-10-09-102604_StelmaBook.crash' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nNote for openradar: The file that is referred to, contains the following code:\r\n\r\nclass SwiftCrashAnyObjectTests: XCTestCase {\r\n    \r\n    var a:AnyObject?\r\n    var b:AnyObject!\r\n    \r\n    func testB()\r\n    {\r\n        println(a![\"test\"])\r\n//        println(b[\"test\"]) //<-- this line\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}"
