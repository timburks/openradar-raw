    description: "Summary:\r\nVoiceOver always assumes that a number followed with \"m\" is a value in meters and reads it as such by saying \"{number} meter(s)\". This is particularly problematic for apps that have fuzzy/relative dates (e.g., \"1m ago\").\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced in English and Spanish, and potentially any other language in which \"m\" is used as a shorthand for meters.\r\n\r\nVoiceOver should identify these cases as dates. Alternatively, there should be a way to opt out of this behavior or annotate the text (perhaps with a NSAttributedString attribute?) so that VoiceOver does not interpret \"m\" as \"meters\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet the device language to English\r\nCreate a sample app that has a label with text \"1m ago\".\r\nOpen the app.\r\nTurn VoiceOver on.\r\nSelect the label.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver says \"One em ago\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver says \"One meter ago\"."
