    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a small javascript which triggers some events via the webkit.messageHandlers property and the WKWebView which is listening to this events.\r\nOn the simulator everything is ok, but on the device I received no events expect if I add the webview as subview of another one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a small html page with a javascript which trigger an event\r\n2. Create a WKWebViewConfiguration and add an handler for the event\r\n3. Create the WKWebView and wait for the event\r\n(See gist: https://gist.github.com/YannickL/4a3a11073d3cedf7e7ec)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would received the event triggered by my script\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is nothing on the device (everything is ok on the simulator) expect if I put the webview as subview\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would use the WKWebView to be able to work with websocket so I don't need to add the webview as subview. I just need to use the webkit engine.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini Retina"
