    description: "Summary:\r\nWith bigger iPhones, especially with bigger than bigger iPhones, apps still fill the Home screen from the top. Beginning in the top left corner newly installed or moved apps appear until they reach the bottom right corner of the screen.\r\n\r\nNot every Home screen is filled to the max which often leaves a complete row or even more than one row empty. These empty rows currently appear at the bottom of the Home screen, which makes it unnecessarily difficult to reach the apps at the top. Especially in one hand use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEasy to see, if not every Home screen is completely filled with apps.\r\n\r\nBut if every Home screen is filled:\r\n1. Go to your last Home screen (the one one the far right)\r\n2. Put your iPhone into \"wiggle mode\" by tapping and holding a single app\r\n3. Drag that app to the right of the screen until it switches over to an empty screen, that appeared right\r\n4. Do so with as many apps as you like, but donâ€™t fill the new screen completely\r\n(5. End \"wiggle mode\" by tapping the Home button)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf iOS would fill Home screens from the bottom most apps would be reachable without having to use Reachability or any workaround.\r\nThat metaphor would additionally correspond to experiences in the real world, where due to gravity boxes, bottles, etc. fill from the bottom.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead blank rows at the bottom make it harder to reach apps on the top.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEvery iOS ever built (including iOS 8.0.2)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nEvery iOS device ever built (including iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus)"
