    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you do a Save for Web in Photoshop (the latest CC version), you are first taken to the Save for Web screen.  In my case this screen is set to 2 Up, where you see the preview images.  The window itself is taking up most of my display.\r\n\r\nOn this screen, if you hover over either of the preview windows, your cursor is a hand by default (assuming the hand tool is chosen on the left).  \r\n \r\nWhat seems to happen is, when I click save, the OS X save box appears OVER these windows.  There are places in the OS X save dialog that seem to have the hand tool appear (almost like the cursor is reacting to the Save for Web window below the OS X save dialog).\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with selecting text in the save as dialog.\r\n \r\nIf I move the OS X save dialog so it isn't on top of the Save for Web window, I don't get the issue.\r\n\r\nThere is clearly an interaction between Photoshop and Yosemite in the Apple OS X save dialog.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In Photoshop with an image window select Save for Web\r\n2) On the Save for Web screen, make sure the window is large\r\n3) Make sure the Save for Web cursor is the hand tool\r\n4) Click the Save button to launch the OS save dialog so that it is over the Save for Web window\r\n5) If you slowly move the cursor in certain areas of the save dialog, the arrow cursor changes to the hand cursor\r\n6) If you drag the save dialog from being on top of the Save for Web window, you don't get the cursor change\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpecting to not have the cursor change\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor changes to the hand cursor\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A389)"
