        Summary:
        swdist.apple.com https implementation highly insecure

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Check the https implementation of swdist.apple.com
        https://dev.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=swdist.apple.com&s=8.247.94.174
        and
        https://dev.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=swdist.apple.com&s=8.247.74.174

        Expected Results:
        Should be excellently implemented with proper protocols and ciphers.

        Actual Results:
        The supported ciphers are:
        TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 (0x4)	128
        TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0x5)	128
        TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 (0x3)   WEAK	40
        TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA (0x9)   WEAK	56
        TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA (0x8)   WEAK	40
        TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (0xa)	112
        TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA (0x9)   WEAK	56
        TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 (0x3)   WEAK	40
        TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA (0x8)   WEAK

        Among those is not a single secure cipher. No AES in GCM mode (which wouldn't even be supported by OS Yosemite or iOS 8 anyway.)

        No forward secrecy, no support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, no HSTS, no OCSP staplingâ€¦


        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        I don't care if Apple does check updates by signatures themselves as well. Wouldn't be the first time that signature checks were broken in OS X and iOS as well as suspected private key leaks in lieu of upcoming need for GateKeeper v2 signatures.
