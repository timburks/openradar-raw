    description: "Summary:\r\nActivating SMS-relay makes Messages app crash on Yosemite GM candidate 2 & 3 (14A388a & 14A386a). \r\nWhen you flip the switch on the iPhone 6+ (iOS 8.1 beta 2 12B407) to activate SMS-relay on the MPB late 2011 15'' (Yosemite GM candidate 2 and 3 14A388a & 14A386a), Messages crashes whilst trying to generate a security code. \r\n\r\nThis happens both while the Messages is open (immediate crash) and when it is closed (Messages app starts up, doesn't show a security code, flipping the switch for sms-relay off and on on the iPhone makes it crash).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTwo options to choose from:\r\nEither way make sure that the required conditions for sms-relay are met (i.e. same Apple ID, same WiFi network, close proximity to each other).\r\n\r\n1.1: Make sure the Messages app on Yosemite is open\r\n1.2: Open the settings app on the iPhone\r\n1.3: Go to the Messages settings \r\n1.4: Go to Sms-relay(?, in Dutch it is called 'Sms doorsturen')\r\n1.5: Flip the switch behind 'MacBook Pro (Mac)\r\n\r\n2.1: Make sure the Messages app on Yosemite is closed\r\n2.2: Open the settings app on the iPhone\r\n2.3: Go to the Messages settings \r\n2.4: Go to Sms-relay(?, in Dutch it is called 'Sms doorsturen')\r\n2.5: Flip the switch behind 'MacBook Pro (Mac)\r\n2.6: The Messages app on Yosemite opens, but doesn't do anything other than showing your conversations\r\n2.7: Press cancel on the iPhone at the 'Insert security code pop-up'\r\n2.8: Flip the switch behind 'Macbook Pro (Mac) off\r\n2.9: Flip the switch behind 'Macbook Pro (Mac) back on\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1: A pop-up on the iPhone to enter the security code\r\n2: A pop-up in the Messages app and/or a notification from Yosemite with the security code\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1: A pop-up on the iPhone to enter the security code\r\n2: Messages app on Yosemite crashes followed by the crashreport window\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX Yosemite GM candidate 3.0 build 14A388a (although the issue is also present in candidate 2.0 build 14A386a)in conjunction with iOS 8.1 beta 2 build 12B407\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDoing the same, but choosing the iPad mini retina (A1490) iOS 8.1 beta 2 build 12B407 at steps 1.5 and 2.5 works without any issues. My guess is that the problem lies in Yosemite, hence the bug report under OSX. \r\n\r\nSee the attached zipfile with crash reports from both Yosemite GM candidate 3.0 (14A388a) and 2.0 (14A386a). The three most recent ones are 12A388a, the rest are from 14A386a.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ (A1524) with iOS 8.1 beta 2 build 12B407MBP 15'' late 2011 with OSX Yosemite GM candidate 3.0 build 14A388a (although the issue is also present in candidate 2.0 build 14A386a)"
