    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling insertRowsAtIndexPaths on a tableview causes other cells in the tableview to layout - worse, the layout engine gets the layout wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the attached project, clicking on a cell cause new cells to be added in a section under the cell tapped. When those cells are added, cells in other sections layout and without adding or removing constraints) those cells generate layout warnings:\r\n\r\n\tProbably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. Try this: (1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; (2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. (Note: If you're seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you don't understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints) \r\n(\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7ffa92c4a880 V:[UILabel:0x7ffa92c4a6d0'Some other text'(21)]>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7ffa92c4b0e0 UILabel:0x7ffa92c48b60'TapMe and see what happen...'.top == UITableViewCellContentView:0x7ffa92c49940.topMargin + 6>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7ffa92c4b1d0 UILabel:0x7ffa92c4a6d0'Some other text'.bottom == UITableViewCellContentView:0x7ffa92c49940.bottomMargin>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7ffa92c4b220 V:[UILabel:0x7ffa92c48b60'TapMe and see what happen...']-(12)-[UILabel:0x7ffa92c4a6d0'Some other text']>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7ffa92f3fda0 'UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height' V:[UITableViewCellContentView:0x7ffa92c49940(43.5)]>\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ncall insertRowsAtIndexPaths in a section with a moderately complex auto layout cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncells are added, things look OK.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks awful. The console barfs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6A1030\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\na workaround would be nice :-)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 6.1B2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AutoLayout.zip' was successfully uploaded."
