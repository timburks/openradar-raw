Screenshot attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on Dark Mode and Increase Contrast.\r\n2. Search for something in Spotlight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dark, high-contrast Spotlight window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA dark, low-contrast Spotlight window that's hard to read. Screenshot attached. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 Yosemite 14A389\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nToggling Dark Mode/Increase Contrast does not resolve the situation. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac Mini, OS X Yosemite 14A389, English/Japanese localisations"
