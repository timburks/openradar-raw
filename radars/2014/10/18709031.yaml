        Summary:
        When reviewing “Purchases” in App Store, it always tells me I have “6 apps to accept.”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch App Store.
        2. Click on Purchases tab.
        3. Message is displayed that I have “6 apps to accept.” Listed are: GarageBand, iMovie, iPhoto, Keynote, Pages, Numbers.
        4. Click the “Accept” button.
        5. Enter Apple ID password as requested.

        Expected Results:
        The apps are “accepted” and the message to accept them goes away.

        Actual Results:
        Message is displayed saying, “These apps have already been accepted. These apps were already assigned to your Apple ID and are available in your Purchases list.” The message to accept the apps does not go away.

        Regression:
        Not sure; I don’t recall having to accept these apps since installing Mavericks.

        Notes:
        Screenshots attached.
