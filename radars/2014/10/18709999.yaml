    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently I cannot add a custom card image in apple pay. When i have two of the same types of cards a card image helps me determine the difference. I currently have two of the same cards and their physical forms have custom card images through wells fargo, however apple pay does not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add two of the same cards\r\n2. Notice there is no way to tell them apart besides the last 4 digits\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Add two of the same cards\r\n2. Allow me to name them or choose a different card image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Add two of the same cards\r\n2. Notice there is no way to tell them apart besides the last 4 digits\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB Att\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
