        Summary:
        I’m not 100% sure how the problem starts, but I believe it generally starts after waking from deep sleep. Mail is not able to sync with IMAP servers, despite the fact that the network is active and other network applications work. When this happens, networkd is always taking up ~100% CPU in Activity Monitor. Force quitting networkd causes Mail to immediately sync mail.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Wake computer from sleep.
        2. Check mail—Mail is unable to sync with IMAP servers. (Not tested with POP or Exchange)
        3. Open Activity Monitor.
        4. Force quit networkd
        5. Mail now syncs.

        Expected Results:
        Mail would download at step #2.

        Actual Results:
        Mail does not download until networkd is force quit.

        Regression:
        Did not experience this problem on 10.9.
