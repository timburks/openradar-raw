    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a dual-display setup with one Retina display, and second non-Retina display, when focus is switched between displays   (click on desktop/window of inactive display), a lot of StatusItems on the Retina screen momentarily change to their non-Retina variants.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a @1x display to a Retina Mac/display.\r\n2. Click on inactive display to change focus \r\n3. Watch closely the icons on @2x screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll icons simultaneusly and immediately turn to transparent/light-gray, without any bizarre side effects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMany icons flash and change to their @1x variant on a @2x display for a moment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the change is not immediate, a lot of weird movement sometimes happens, and in dark mode the icons on both displays flash white background (there's a separate ticket for this: rdar://18811556 )\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A389) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe screen capture also shows a different problem: rdar://18811556\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'icons-flash.mov' was successfully uploaded."
