    description: "Summary:\r\nIf there are multiple reminders on the lock screen, and I mark one of them as completed, all of the reminders disappear from the lock screen. This is bad, because I can no longer snooze the others.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wake phone from sleep.\r\n2. Make sure there are multiple reminder notifications on screen.\r\n3. Swipe left to reveal \"Snooze\" and \"Mark as completed\".\r\n4. Choose \"Mark as completed\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification for the reminder I swiped on should disappear and the reminder should be marked as completed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification for the reminder I swiped on disappears, and the reminder is marked as completed, but all of the other notifications disappear as well, and there's no way to get them back.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is new with iOS 8.1. I never saw this behavior with 8.0.2."
