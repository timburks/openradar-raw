    description: When dismissing a stack of multiple modal views with animation, the top view controller is dismissed without animation, and then the intermediate view controller is shown and animates it's dismissal with it's transition style.  Instead, the transition style of the top view controller should be used to animate directly to the root view controller without showing intermediate views.  This is a regression from iOS 7.
