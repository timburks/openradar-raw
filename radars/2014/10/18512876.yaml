    description: "Summary:\r\nThe character reference parsing in CFPropertyList.c is flawed. It manually decodes the &#ddd; string and accumulates the ddd value into the num variable which is declared as uint16_t. Because it’s stored as a 16 bits variables it can’t handle code points in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project (Decode XML plist).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDecoding the XML plist always results in decoding the ONCOMING AUTOMOBILE character: \U0001F698 (U+1F698)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDecoding the XML plist with NSPropertyListSerialization (which uses CFPropertyList internally) decodes the character reference &#128664; as  (U+F698) instead of \U0001F698 (U+1F698). We notice that U+F698 is just U+1F698 truncated to 16 bits.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0.1 (6A317) / OS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also attached a patch for CFPropertyList.c which solves this issue. Feel free to apply it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CFPropertyList.patch', 'Decode XML plist.zip', 'emoji_escaped.xml' and 'emoji.xml' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nNote for Open Radar users:\r\nDecode XML plist is basically this code snippet: https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/issues/196#issuecomment-57397249\r\nCFPropertyList.patch is available at https://gist.github.com/0xced/1bfd70558212f15c54ae"
