    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a QLPreviewController in a Navigation Controller, the display is clear as it presents the QL content, if the navigation controller itself was presented.\r\n\r\nSee the attached sample project and video.\r\n\r\nImagine that the first VC is some form of login/authentication controller.  Upon successful authentication the Navigation controller is presented modally allow the user to access the applications content.  Clicking on the button, initiates a QLPreviewController - however as it animates on screen the incoming content is clear.  Once the animation has completed, the preview content pops and suddenly displays.\r\n\r\nIf you set the root view controller in the storyboard to be the navigation controller directly the QLPreviewController displays as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project.\r\nRun\r\nClick Login button\r\nClick Present QL from this VC\r\nNotice incorrect rendering\r\nOpen main.storyboard - make the NavigationController the root VC\r\nRe-run. Notice QLPreviewController animates into place correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQLPreviewController animates onto the screen correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQLPreviewController content is not rendered until animation completes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Simulator Version 8.1 (550.3)"
