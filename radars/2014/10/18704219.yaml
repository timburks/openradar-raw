    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the “Verify Your Identity” screen, the label “Phone number ending in XX” is missing a space, so it reads “Phone number ending inXX”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a computer running the last version of 10.9 Mavericks.\r\n2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication on iCloud, and make sure you have a phone number added as a trusted device.\r\n3. Upgrade to Yosemite through the App Store.\r\n4. Go through the setup screens after the install has finished.\r\n5. Get to the “Verify Your Identity” screen that asks you to provide a second authentication factor for your iCloud account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label related to a phone number reads “Phone number ending in XX” (where XX is two numeric digits; in my case, 73)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label reads “Phone number ending in73”. Notice the space missing between “in” and “73”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have seen this label with the correct spacing elsewhere in Mavericks, and I believe in Yosemite as well. Not sure about this screen in particular, because I did not have 2FA enabled when I updated to Mavericks.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/Y7J9"
