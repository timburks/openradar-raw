        Summary:
        Safari 8.0 vulnerable to POODLE SSLv3 vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See CVE-2014-3566

        Expected Results:
        Apple should have turned OFF SSLv3 for Safari with OS X Yosemite.

        Actual Results:
        Apple did not mitigate CVE-2014-3566 by turning OFF SSLv3.

        Regression:
        OS X users are left vulnerable by Apple again for who-knows-how-long.

        Notes:
        Other browsers and operating systems give users a possibility to protect themselves from damage by being able to turn off SSLv3 in their operating systems and browsers. OS X does not offer ANY option to configure transport security and leaves users vulnerable.
