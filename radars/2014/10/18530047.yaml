    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a breakpoint with a Log Message action and enter in your message and dismiss the breakpoint popover, any changes you make to the message upon subsequent edits are reverted back to the original message as soon as the popover is dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn order to change messages, you have to delete the action and create a new Log Message action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project.\r\n2. Set a breakpoint.\r\n3. Add a \"Log Message\" action to the breakpoint.\r\n4. Enter \"Hello\" as the message.\r\n5. Hit Return to dismiss the popover (or click away)\r\n6. Right click on the breakpoint, choose \"Edit Breakpoint...\"\r\n7. Change the message text to \"Hola\"\r\n8. Hit Return to dismiss the popover\r\n9. Run the app and see what message shows up in the Console\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Hola\" should be printed to the Console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Hello\" is printed instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1 (6A1042b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
