    description: "Summary:\r\nNeither I, nor any of my coworkers, can codesign using Xcode 6.1. This is going on day 2 of not being able to make a build and is very, very frustrating.\r\n\r\nWe haven't changed anything with certificates in months. There is absolutely no way we caused this problem in 6.1.\r\n\r\n*Note* I can codesign the app on the command line to create an .ipa so the problem is with Xcode itself. This is not developer error or some configuration issue with the developer center.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup your machine to have a distribution certificate and provisioning profile.\r\n2. Archive an app.\r\n3. Attempt to Export an Ad Hoc build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to create an .ipa with the distribution credentials I've had and used on this machine for __months__.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get the error shown in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1052d) / OS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOne coworker saw this on 6.0.1, but I didn't get the issue until 6.1 GM3."
