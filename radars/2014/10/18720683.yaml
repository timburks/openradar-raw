        Summary:
        iCloud Photo Library (Beta) hangs on "Uploading xxxx items”. When I try to turn iCloud Photo Library off then on to attempt to resolve this issue, iOS tells me “This iPhone was not able to download 1 full-resolution item. If you continue, the low-resolution versions of these photos and videos will be removed.”. If I tap e”Remove from iPhone”, I see, “1 video will be removed from this iPhone. This video will remain in iCloud Photo Library”. I have not confirmed a second time, as I don’t wan to lose this data.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Turn on iCloud Photo Library. Check status in Settings or in Photos app

        Expected Results:
        iCloud Photo Library eventually uploads all files.

        Actual Results:
        iCloud Photo Library hangs on upload, never completes.

        Regression:
