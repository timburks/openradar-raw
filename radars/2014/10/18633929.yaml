    description: "Summary:\r\nAdding third party libraries by dragging them into the  \"link against libraries\" build phase works, but if you close your project and open it again, Xcode will complain that the library is missing. \r\n\r\nNote that the library will still appear in the list, and if you re-arrange the list by dragging the \"missing\" library, the app will link successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project (untested with OS X apps.)\r\n2. Add a third party static library, like libFlurry.a\r\n3. Close the project (or completely quit Xcode - either should produce the same bug.)\r\n4. Re-open the project.\r\n5. Run the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should compile, link, and run as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode will complain about missing libraries. Re-arranging the list \"fixes\" the problem. \r\n\r\nAlso, the path to the library shows up, mangled, in the Library Search Paths.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A313) on OS X 10.9.5 Build 13F34\r\nXcode 6.0 (6A313) on OS X 10.10 Build 12A388a\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Library Search Paths will become mangled, and each space splits off into a new search path entry. For example this:\r\n\r\n/Users/Moshe/code/ios/My App/My App/Some Library/\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n/Users/Moshe/code/ios/My\r\nApp/My\r\nApp/Some\r\nLibrary/\r\n\r\nWhere each newline in this list is a new entry.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
