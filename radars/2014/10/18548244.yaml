        Summary:
        I’m implementing a nonrecursive left fold as a protocol (ReducibleType) and a helper type ReducibleOf for reducing SequenceType. It crashes at runtime in what I believe is a language bug (since there’s no message logged indicating that it’s an error in my code).


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go get this repo & branch: https://github.com/robrix/Traversal/pull/1
        2. Run the tests.


        Expected Results:
        I expected the tests to complete, possibly even to succeed.


        Actual Results:
        Instead, the tests hit an EXC_BAD_ACCESS. Even better, trying to `bt` in the debugger crashes Xcode. (I submitted the crash log with the details from the crash reporter window.)


        Regression:
        N/A


        Notes:
        Crash log from `xcodebuild … test` to follow.
