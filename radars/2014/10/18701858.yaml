    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the current Xcode Developer path (from xcode-select -p) does not have a lipo in its xctoolchain, then attempts to run 'lipo' will hang, rather than printing an error (or finding an appropriate lipo to run).\r\n\r\nThis goes about as badly with 'strings', too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Copy an old Xcode (i.e., Xcode 4.6.3) into /Applications.\r\n2) xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-4.6.3.app/Contents/Developer/\r\n3) Run /usr/bin/lipo --version.\r\n4) xcrun and lipo hang, using 100% CPU.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn error message should be produced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxcrun and lipo spin and hang until killed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 GM; Xcode in question is 4.6.3, but this in principle could happen at any time if you fail to upgrade Xcode after upgrading your OS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens when there is a mismatch between the selected Xcode and the system existing command line utilities."
