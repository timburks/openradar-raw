    description: "Summary:\r\nSimple dictionaries can be compared without writing boilerplate-code, which is nice. But as soon as dictionaries have dictionaries / arrays as values, they are no longer comparable, which is bad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis code-snippet outlines the problem:\r\n\r\nvar r: Bool\r\nvar dict = [1 : 2]\r\n// this works, as expected\r\nr = dict == dict\r\n\r\nvar dictionaryInDictionary = [1 : [2 : 3]]\r\n// this should work, but the compiler says error: '[Int : Dictionary<Int, Int>]' is not convertible to 'MirrorDisposition'\r\nr = dictionaryInDictionary == dictionaryInDictionary\r\n\r\nvar arrayInDictionary = [1: [2]]\r\n// this should work, but the compiler says error: '[Int : Array<Int>]' is not convertible to 'MirrorDisposition'\r\nr = arrayInDictionary == arrayInDictionary"
