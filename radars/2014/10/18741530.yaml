    description: "After activating Full Keyboard Access in SysPref, one used to be able to choose buttons in dialog with the tab key and activate them using space.\r\n\r\nIn 10.10 this only works in some apps. In most 3rd party apps, neither the tab navigation nor the space confirmation works. The buttons don't have the blue outline highlight they used to have.\r\n\r\n1. Open an app such as Photoshop, Ableton Live, etc.\r\n2. Cmd+S\r\n3. Try to tab through the dialog: it doesn't work"
