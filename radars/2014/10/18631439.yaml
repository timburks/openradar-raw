        Summary:

        vImage functions do not allow working with (chunky) bi-planar image buffers. Yet, this is the default format for chroma components in AVFoundation APIs. Could you please consider adding such APIs in a future SDK?

        Bi-planar buffers cannot be processed with standard functions generally:

        vImageAffineWarp_ARGB8888
        vImageAffineWarp_Planar8
