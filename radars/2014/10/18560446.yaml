    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the previous keyboard is a custom keyboard from a keyboard extension, setting the inputView of a UITextField/UITextView to the view of a UIViewController will have the custom keyboard prevent the custom inputView from appearing. UIView hierarchy analysis shows that the view is resized to a negative y origin and 0 width.\r\n\r\nHowever, just using a regular view that wasn't created in the loadView method of the UIViewController will not cause issues. You will however lose view events.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Run \"TheInputView\" Project.\r\n1. Tap the text field at the bottom of the screen to expand and show the keyboard.\r\n2. Switch to a custom keyboard.\r\n3. Tap the \"UIView\" button; You should successfully switch to an Orange view where the custom keyboard previously should be. This is correct.\r\n4. Tap the \"View Controller's view\" button; Purple view appears momentarily before the custom keyboard takes over. This is wrong.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe purple view should appear where the custom keyboard previously was and remain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPurple view appears momentarily before the custom keyboard takes over.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis works correctly in anything prior to iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iPhones\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TheInputView.zip' was successfully uploaded."
