    description: "Summary:\r\nAs new tools and technologies (Auto Layout, adaptivity, etc.) continue to encourage the development of universal apps, it becomes more and more difficult to run an app and test a change across a wide spectrum of available devices quickly. One key limitation is the inability of the iOS Simulator app bundled with Xcode to display more than one simulator at a time.\r\n\r\nPlease make it possible to have Xcode spawn multiple iOS Simulator copies (perhaps multiple windows in the same app?), then provide the ability for developers to run an app concurrently in those different simulators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Develop a universal app\r\n2. Make a change that may affect behavior on iPad and iPhone differently\r\n3. Attempt to quickly test that change\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI am able to launch an iPad and iPhone simulator simultaneously from Xcode and view the same app side-by-side in each.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI must launch the app in an iPad simulator, test the app, stop it, change the target device to an iPhone simulator, run the app again, and test it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1042b) / OS X 10.10 (14A379a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkarounds exist on StackOverflow involving multiple user accounts; however, this introduces at least as much overhead as simply switching simulators between runs, and does not constitute a native solution.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
