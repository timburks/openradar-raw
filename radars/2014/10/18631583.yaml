        Summary:
        Some vImage function accept the kvImageHighQualityResampling option, which allows higher quality resampling.
        From header file inspection, it appears that this flag determines whether Lanczos-3 (no flag) or Lanczos-5 (flag) is used.

        Having additional resampling options, namely, NEAREST and LINEAR, would be a great feature when higher processing speed is needed. It seems to be possible by defining our own resampling kernel with existing vImage API, but it would certainly make more sense to have these as standard options throughout the vImage API, instead of having to use low-level APIs.
