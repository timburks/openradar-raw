    description: "Summary:\r\nThis loophole is currently being abused by App Store spammers and legitimate uses of iOS 8 as a keyword is being prevented by the App Review team.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search \"iOS 8\" or \"iOS 8 [keyword]\" on the App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll apps built against the iOS 8 SDK should be included in the results and fall back to sorting according to other search terms.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly apps that managed to sneak through app review with iOS 8 in their keywords or title are shown. Many of which aren't even optimized for iOS 8."
