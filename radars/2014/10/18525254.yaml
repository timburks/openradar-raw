        Summary:
        After rebooting my MacBook Pro (typically from Boot Camp), Yosemite forgets that I had my MacBook Pro’s built-in display set to the highest scaled mode, dropping back to the native res.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Restart Yosemite on my MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt Display connected, typically from Boot Camp.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to use the resolution I had selected (1920x1200@2).


        Actual Results:
        Instead it reverts to native res. (1440x900@2).


        Regression:
        Mavericks didn’t do this.
