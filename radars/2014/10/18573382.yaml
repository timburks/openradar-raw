        Summary:
        Charge {symbol,image} to callers is super useful, but it can be a bit annoying to use because you have to apply the charges individually for each run. It would be great if they would be remembered between runs, or even saved to use across different documents. Ideally Iâ€™d be able to enable/disable groups of them at a time for this.
