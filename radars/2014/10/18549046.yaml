    description: "Summary:\r\nCarPlay requires you to unlock the phone when you plug it in for use. While I see how this is for security purposes, it makes it cumbersome versus my phones regular Siri Eyes Free bluetooth connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug locked phone into Pioneer NEX\r\n2. Notice CarPlay does not start right away.\r\n3. Notice iPhone is asking for unlock code or Touch ID.\r\n4. Unlock phone.\r\n5. CarPlay starts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither when you plug the phone, CarPlay does not require you to unlock your phone or the NEX could start CarPlay, but ask for the phones passcode that could be entered using the deck interface.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou must unlock your phone to use CarPlay.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB ATT & NEX 8000 in a 2011 Subaru WRX\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
