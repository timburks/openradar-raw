    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm getting an error from the compiler i can only describe by an example. I'm receiving an array of the type [AnyObject] from a Foundation-method but i know that it only contains strings, and i want to filter these strings by two criteria. The following example outlines that code:\r\n\r\nlet objects : [AnyObject] = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\r\nlet allFiles = (objects as [String]).filter { $0.pathExtension == \"strings\" && $0.rangeOfString(\"findme\") == false }\r\n\r\nNow I'm getting the error \"'AnyObject' is not identical to 'String'\", pointing at the [String]-cast. But when i remove the second criteria within the filter-closure, i don't get that error and it works as expected:\r\n\r\nlet objects : [AnyObject] = [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\r\nlet allFiles = (objects as [String]).filter { $0.pathExtension == \"strings\" }\r\n\r\nSo, the content of the closure impacts the compilation of the cast? I don't know if it is more related to the closure or the cast, in any case, this is an odd behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 / 6A1052d\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
