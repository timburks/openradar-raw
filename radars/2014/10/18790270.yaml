    description: "Summary:\r\nXIB files cannot refer to images, or they won't re-open in the thing that used to be Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a XIB file.\r\n2. Create a UIButton.\r\n3. Set an image on the button. Note that the button does not show the image preview, as it did in any previous edition of IB back to NeXT days.\r\n4. Save the XIB.\r\n5. Open the XIB, get the error message: The document \"Button.xib\" could not be opened. The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.InterfaceBuilder error -1.) Check the console log for additional information.\r\nConsole says:\r\nXcode[4083]: Exception raised while unarchiving document objects - -[NSTaggedPointerString getCharacters:range:]: Range {0, 10} out of bounds; string length 6\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. XIB should re-open.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEditing the XIB in BBEdit, removed all image= attributes and the <resources> section. XIB now opens in Xcode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1\r\nYosemite\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nStandard."
