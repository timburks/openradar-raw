    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using PhotoKit's [PHChange changeDetailsForFetchResult:] on a PHFetchRequest that is ordered by descending creationDate, deletedIndexes and changedIndexes overlap.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project (Example app using Photos framework)\r\n2. Select the \"All Photos\" row.\r\n3. Delete a photo or video from the device.\r\n4. Notice the crash. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PHFetchResultChangeDetails' changedIndexes do not overlap the deletedIndexes, preventing exceptions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe PHFetchResultChangeDetails' changedIndexes overlap the deletedIndexes, throwing an exception: 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'attempt to delete and reload the same index path (<NSIndexPath: 0xc000000000000016> {length = 2, path = 0 - 0})\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample app is Apple's \"Example app using Photos framework\"\r\n\r\nThe only change is that the creationDate sort order has been changed from ascending to descending.\r\n https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/UsingPhotosFramework/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014575\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ AT&T"
