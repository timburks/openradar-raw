        Summary:
        While spiking my way forward through a feature I wanted to temporarily have an empty sequence. I initially thought of SequenceOf { EmptyGenerator() } (annotated for element type appropriately), but it turns out that EmptyGenerator doesnâ€™t have a public initializer.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to build this:

        let x = EmptyGenerator()


        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
