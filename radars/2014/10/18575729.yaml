    description: "This is a duplicate of http://openradar.appspot.com/18477706\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCalling window.close() in a page in mobile safari does nothing on iOS >=8.0. Previously it would cause the page to close. This causes serious usability issues in many web applications, e.g. Facebook login or Stripe checkout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new html file (test.html) viewable from an iOS device running iOS 8\r\n2. Set HTML data for the file:\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n\t<button onclick=\"window.open('./test-close.html'); return false;\">Open B</button>\r\n</body>\r\n3. Create a second new html file (test-close.html) viewable from an iOS device running iOS 8\r\n4. Set HTML data for the file:\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n\t<button onclick=\"window.close();\">Close</button>\r\n</body>\r\n3. Open test.html in Safari\r\n4. Click the \"Open\" button\r\n5. Second window opens with a \"Close\" button\r\n6. Click the \"Close\" button\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce this and this has been reported elsewhere, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25804730/window-close-doesnt-work-on-ios-8-gm-seed\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in other iOS browsers besides Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second window should close\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second window does not close\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nStackOverflow link:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25804730/window-close-doesnt-work-on-ios-8-gm-seed"
