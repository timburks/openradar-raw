    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a contact in your phone book that has more than a handful of phone numbers the contacts app hangs for a long time before it (mostly) recovered and is usable again. \r\n\r\nThe bug started with iOS 8, there was no problem in 6 and 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a contact in your phone book (via source code) (source attached)\r\n2. Add like 100 phone numbers to it (via source code)\r\n3. open the contacts app\r\n4. open the contact\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContacts app should be usable and display the phone numbers added\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContacts hangs for like a minute\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 to 8.1 Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem exists on all kinds of different iPhones and different version of iOS 8.\r\n\r\nThe same contact (synced between devices) that doesn't open on an iPhone 6 opens seamlessly on an iPhone 4S which is running iOS 6 or 7.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 4 up to 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ViewController.m' was successfully uploaded."
