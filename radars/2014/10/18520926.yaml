    description: "Like many (most) programmers, my intention with my Xcode project is to make all paths within it relative, either directly or indirectly, or relative to the project, workspace, symbolic roots or build directory. Something not tying it directly to my system.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Xcode will — without warning me — make some new file I drop into the project or workspace ABSOLUTE_PATH.\r\n\r\nI have no good steps to reproduce this happening by accident. I can tell you that even as I was typing this up, I found that my workspace was using an absolute path to reference one of the projects contained within.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is an entirely synthetic way to create this problem. Xcode will occasionally do it on its own, but I have no reproduction steps for that.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iOS project using Single View application template.\r\n2. ViewController.h and adjust it to \"Absolute To Path.\"\r\n3. Build.\r\n4. Copy the entire project (including all files) to another machine, with a different user name. Build again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 3, there should be a warning that the project includes absolute paths.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have no indication anything is wrong until step 5. At this point, you have to make guesses about the computer the project was created on, even though you may not have access to it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThat entries in an Xcode workspace or project can be added as absolute paths is a long-standing defect. However, even if this was corrected first, existing workspaces and projects could still have unexpected absolute paths. I think the consequence is more important to address here.\r\n\r\nThere really is no good reason to have an absolute path now that Xcode has \"Source Trees.\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
