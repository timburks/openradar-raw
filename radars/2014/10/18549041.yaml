While I like the text up front and center I also would like to see the album artwork in a better way. I was able to get it showing a bit by increasing the brightness in my NEX settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to carplay\r\n2. Play music\r\n3. See artwork\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Go to carplay\r\n2. Play music\r\n3. Artwork clearly visible in some way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlbum artwork is way too dim.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can also get good feedback here: http://avic411.com/index.php?/topic/39569-nex-8000-reported-bugs-from-106/\r\n\r\nAnd http://avic411.com/index.php?/forum/63-nex/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB ATT & Pioneer NEX 8000 in a 2011 Subaru WRX\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
