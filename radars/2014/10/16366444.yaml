    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you add UTC as a \"location\" in the Apple Clock app for iPad, the label for that timezone is displayed off the coast of Angola Africa. The weather associated with UTC (shown under that label) appears to be the weather for Greenwich, UK â€“ which is in a different hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIf the UTC label is associated with a weather report, it should be a weather report which is correct for the location where the UTC label appears on the world map.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the Clock app on an iPad with iOS 7.1.\r\n2. Tap the World Clock icon at the bottom of the screen.\r\n3. Tap in an empty space in the list of cities shown at the top of the screen (these should have a red + sign in a circle).\r\n4. In the search field that appears next, type UTC.\r\n5. Select UTC from the list below the search field.\r\n6. On the world map, you should now see a label for UTC in the center of the map (off the West Coast of Africa)\r\n7. If the weather is displayed under that UTC label, you will be able to verify that it is the weather for Greenwich, UK and not Angola, Africa.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. I did not expect weather to be displayed for UTC - it is a timezone, not a location.\r\n2. When I saw that UTC did have a weather report, I expected that weather report to be accurate for the location on the map where the label appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe weather report shown in the Clock app for UTC is not accurate for the location on the world map where that label is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 4 16GB VZW"
