    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm a French user (AZERTY keyboard), always using my OS X in English.\r\nI had to repair my SSD using the recovery partition, and as Yosemite automatically activates FileVault, I had to unlock my SSD first.\r\nHowever, there's an issue with the keyboard input language. I changed to French, but the recovery system automatically re-changes it to US once the FileVault password is being asked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use a Mac running Yosemite + FileVault activated\r\n2. Boot on the Recovery Partition\r\n3. Set the language of the recovery system to English\r\n4. Change keyboard input language to French\r\n5. Open the Disk Utility\r\n6. Unlock your hard drive\r\n7. The password window changed the keyboard input language back to US. Changing it to French again won't affect the layout\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanging keyboard input language should work everywhere?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanging keyboard input language does not affect FileVault's password window"
