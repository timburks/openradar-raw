    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to download/purchase a non-sharable app already purchased by a family member, family sharing only notifies that you can't download the app, but doesn't offer a way to purchase it again with your own account (whether or not with the familycreditcard).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up the App Store on your iDevice (in this case iPhone 5s or 6+)\r\n2. Search for a non-sharable app (e.g. the tumblr app) which is already purchased by a other family member\r\n3. Press the 'download from cloud button'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to purchase the app with the Apple ID currently in use\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA alert is shown that the app is purchased with an other Apple ID and that it is not available to download because it may have been refunded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2. (12A405)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only two workarounds I have found are leaving the familyshare (which is unwise since you might know that you can only join family share twice a year) and logging out of the app store en logging back in again, if you are fast enough the app store doesn't realize the Apple ID is linked to family sharing and you can purchase on your own account. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ (A1524) & iPhone 5s (A1427?)\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate by dev 10-10-2014:\r\nIssue persists in 8.1 beta 2 (12B407)\r\n\r\nStatus change: Dupe of rdar://18436753 (Open)"
