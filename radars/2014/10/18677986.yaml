        Summary:
        When you have an app with a share extension, it shows up in the activity menu. There is the ability to order these, presumably so you can put the most-used extensions nearer the start. However, if you kill the app, the order reverts to what it was previously. Your preference is not saved.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Launch an app that can share (in my case Tweetbot)
        * Tap and hold on a link to show the share menu
        * Reorder the items (in my case I’ve got Instapaper first)
        * Double tap the home button to go to multitasking
        * Kill the app by sliding it to the top
        * Relaunch app
        * Tap and hold on a link to show the share menu

        Expected Results:
        The order of the menu should be the same as after you had reordered the items. Ideally this would be the case across different apps, but *definitely* should be the same for the same app with the same set of extensions.

        Actual Results:
        The ordering of the items hasn’t persisted.
