    description: First, I created a new entry in the Info.plist under they key "Fonts provided by the application," and I copied the two fonts to the project. Then, I created a UILabel in interface builder. I changed the label's "Text" to "Attributed" and changed the font to my specified custom font. In interface builder, the font renders correctly, but does not render correctly in the simulator or on my device. I also checked to ensure that the objects were copied to the Resource Bundle.
