    description: "Summary:\r\nThe issue is reproducible when a child view controller contains a single subview that is pinned to superview in all directions. The subview is then incorrectly resized if the container view in the parent view controller is covered by the navigation bar. \r\n\r\nChanging the constraints for the subview to be vertically centered with fixed height fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nThis issue doesn't happen on iOS 7.1.2 so it seems to be a regression.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe steps were done with a standard 'Single View Application' project with size classes turned off in MainStoryboard and deployment target set to iOS 7.0.\r\n\r\n1. Add an empty UIViewController embedded in an UINavigationController\r\n2. Set UINavigationController's navigation bar to be translucent.\r\n3. Place a container view so that it is partly covered by the navigation bar (i.e. at y = 10).\r\n3a. To see results better set background color of the child view controller's root view to red.\r\n4. Add a single subview in the child view controller. Set background color to green.\r\n5. Add constraints for the subview in all directions with constant = 0 and without using margins.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe subview in the child controller should be of the same size as the container view, i.e. be visible from behind the navigation bar. \r\nIn our case we should see a green tint of the navigation bar.\r\nThis is what happens on iOS 7.1.2\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subview is resized incorrectly as it doesn't get covered by the navigation bar. \r\n\r\nIn our case we see that root view of the child controller becomes visible and the navigation bar is tinted red\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2 [12A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached sample project there are two container views. The left one shows the issue, while the right one has different constraints and works as expected. \r\n\r\nOn iOS 7.1.2 both of these container views appear identical\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5c 32GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ExampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
