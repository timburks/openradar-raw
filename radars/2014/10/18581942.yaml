    description: "Summary:\r\nAn immediate or quick release of a recently instantiated CBCentralManager object causes a EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception in iOS 8 Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstantiate and make nil a CBCentralManager instance in a short time interval.\r\nThe attached class makes these two calls in a sequential way as an easy way to reproduce the crash, but we found the issue in an unit test case which happened to instantiate a CBCentralManager. After the case finished, the CBCentralManager was released causing a crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCBCentralManager should be released without issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS or similar exception before the required delegate method centralManagerDidUpdateState: is called.\r\nNSZombie reports: \r\n*** -[CBCentralManager xpcConnectionIsInvalid:]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x7af7d930\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0.1 6A317\r\nSimulator 8.0 550.1\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe issue is not reproducible neither on iOS 7.1 Simulator nor in real device. It is always reproducible in iOS 8 Simulator (any simulated device) and in unit testing."
