    description: "Summary:\r\nNSUserDefaults are not deleted when an app is deleted from the simulator running iOS 8. NSUserDefaults are deleted when an app is deleted from the simulator running iOS 7.1 as well as from a device regardless which version of iOS is running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create / install an application that stores values in NSUserDefaults and run the application.\r\n2. Delete the application\r\n3. Re-install and launch the app and before storing any values in NSUserDefaults, note that they are already present.\r\n\r\nI've included a sample app that you can use to confirm this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected behavior is for user defaults to be removed upon app deletion as it does in iOS 7 and on the device. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser defaults is not deleted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0.1 (6A317) / OS X 10.9.5 (13F34)"
