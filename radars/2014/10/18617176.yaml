    description: The value returned for the key UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey is not contained in the enum of any public header, which makes it difficult to match the animation curve. There should be constants for both the UIViewAnimationCurve and kCAMediaTimingFunction methods of performing animations.
