    description: "iOS 8.0.2 Mail, under unknown circumstances, fails to read plaintext log files.\r\n\r\n1.  Make sure you’re running iOS 8.0.2.\r\n2.  Receive an email with a log file (in my case, DeployStudio logs directly from our server).\r\n3.  Tap on the attachment to view the log file.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of iOS Mail, the log file’s contents were displayed.\r\n\r\nOn my iPhone 6, running iOS 8.0.2, I’m given a blank screen with the name of the file and its file size in kilobytes.\r\n\r\niPhone 6, Verizon\r\n\r\niOS 8.0.2 (12A405)\r\n\r\nMy manager, who receives the exact same emails from our server, is able to read the same files.  He also has an iPhone 6, running iOS 8.0.2.  I can confirm that these files previously displayed on the same iPhone 6 running iOS 8.0, and displayed on an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.x. until I upgraded.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how to begin troubleshooting this problem.  Please advise.  The files are plaintext, and have the file extension .log."
