        Summary:
        When trying to delete an app via ‘wiggle mode’, the iPhone freezes for about 30 seconds. This is independent of the size of said app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to the home screen
        2. Press and hold on a app icon until ‘wiggle mode’ is activated
        3. Try to delete a random app by pressing the x in the upper right corner of a app icon

        Expected Results:
        Within 5 seconds a pop-up asking if you really want to delete the app

        Actual Results:
        The iPhone freezes for approximately 20-30 seconds before it show the confirmation pop-up. In the meantime the iPhone doesn’t respond to anything, the app icons keep wiggling however

        Regression:
        This issue is independent of the size of the app you are trying to delete. It also does not occur every single time, but still very often (30% of the time at least). Issue is present in iOS 8.1 12B407 on a iPhone 6+ 64 GB A1524.
