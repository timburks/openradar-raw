    description: "Summary: Once a call is under way guided access exhibits several bugs. Triple-click will not engage or disengage it and touch-denial areas are ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Enable guided access on the device.\r\nEnter FaceTime.\r\nStart guided access.\r\nTriple-click.\r\nEnter the passcode. \r\nDraw a touch denial area around the bottom of the screen so it should be impossible to hang up the call with guided access enabled.\r\nResume guided access.\r\nUse the favorites list to initiate a call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: While the call is connecting or connected it should be impossible to press the hang-up button. Pressing the home key three times should open the passcode requirement so guided access can be turned off or options changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Although the greyest-out area appears to indicate the area is disabled, the button to disconnect a call still registers presses. Pressing the home key three times does nothing."
