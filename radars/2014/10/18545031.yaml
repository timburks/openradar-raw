    description: "Summary:\r\nThe blur from system elements, such as toolbars, as well as from UIVisualEffectView, looks different in the iOS simulator than it does on device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Run the app on an iPhone 6 simulator.\r\n3. Run the same app on a real iPhone 6.\r\n4. Look at the way the UIToolbar at the bottom blurs the text behind it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blur looks identical on the simulator and the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blur is different between simulator and device. On the simulator, the text is still quite visible below the toolbar. It is obscured by some kind of gradient overlay, but the edges are sharp.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screenshots of the app running on an iPhone 6 and in an iPhone 6 simulator. Also included an image of what happens when you put one image on top of the other with the \"difference\" blend mode, which highlights the differences between the two. And finally, a boosted version of that same image, so you can really see the areas that are affected. (Ignore the status bar, since it is different between device and simulator).\r\n\r\nA note on why this bug is important to me: I use the iOS simulator in conjunction with https://github.com/jonathanpenn/ui-screen-shooter to take automated screenshots of my app for the app store. With three different screenshots, four device sizes, and five localized languages, that works out to 60 screenshots that I would otherwise have to take by hand. UI screen shooter makes it a cinch, but with the blur looking wrong, I will have to go back to taking at least some screenshots by hand every time something changes, a process that can take at least a couple hours, and has to be repeated every time the UI changes at all.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on iOS simulator.\r\nDoes not occur on iOS devices supporting blur (all iOS 8-supported devices except iPad 2 and 3).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/Xrmz"
