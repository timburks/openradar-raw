    description: "Duplicate of 10039582 (Open/Closed)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nBug ID #: 18443123\r\nBug Title: Spoken navigation instructions overlap podcast audio\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n<GMT24-Sep-2014 18:25:47GMT>\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I use navigation in a Maps app, the spoken turn-by-turn directions are critical. However, I'm also listening to a podcast or audiobook, and when the Maps app speaks, it \"ducks\" (reduces the volume) of the potentially-streaming background sound track. This makes me lose my place in the book or podcast because I wasn't able to hear what was said. Instead, I want an option to have the background audio pause when the Map speaks, and then resume after the Map finishes speaking the directions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Podcast app and start playing a podcast.\r\n2. Run Maps and navigate to a destination.\r\n3. Start driving. When the Maps app speaks, the background audio gets quieter but continues playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should have an option to have the background podcast pause while the Map speaks, and then resume playing afterward, so that I don't miss any of the podcast content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to have the podcast automatically pause and resume. Instead, I miss out on what was said while navigation was speaking."
