    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Network Lost\" is very disruptive of the iOS experience when (because of very poor reception) the popup is displayed very frequently, and the user has a reason to avoid setting their carrier to automatic (possibly in order to avoid roaming fees, when living near a country's border)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be in a place near a country border, where your carrier's signal is weaker than the ones coming from the neighbor country. This frequently happens in Europe.\r\n2. Stand near a window, where reception is good enough.\r\n3. In order to avoid roaming fees when losing your own network, switch your carrier selection to Manual.\r\n4. Optionally, start doing any activity on your iPhone\r\n4. Step away from the window, to where reception is slightly worse and your phone loses its network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text 'No Service' should be displayed in the status bar, and nothing else should happen in order to avoid disrupting the user's activity.\r\nOptionally, a Notification Center banner could be triggered (and configuration for it provided in the Notification Center settings)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn annoying popup saying \"Network Lost\" / 'Your selected cellular network is no longer available. You can choose a different network in Settings.' displayed, with two buttons: \"Dismiss\" and \"Settings\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS version to date (known to be there at least since iPhone OS 2.0 through iOS 7.0.4)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe popup provides a Dismiss and a Settings button. In this use case, the Settings button is never used, since the user DOES NOT want to switch to another carrier. As such, the popup should be made into a banner, or nothing at all. The optimal way to do this would be to add a Notification Center entry for this, so that the user can choose whether they want a popup, a banner or no notification at all.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not occur if carrier selection is set to Automatic (but that's not a solution, see issue description)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
