    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an image resource in a xib has uses a path prefix (for example, 'aFolder/myImage' for an image located at 'MyApp.app/aFolder/myImage.png') the compilation of the xib will fail and the project will be unable to finish the build. When the error occurs, Xcode reports a '-1' error and 'ibtoold' reports a NSRangeException thrown by -[NSTaggedPointerString getCharacters:range:] in the console.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  1. Create a new  single view controller project with a xib. \r\n  2. Add an image resource to the project so that, when compiled, the final path will be along the lines of MyProject.app/<a-resource-folder>/<image-name>\r\n  3. Add a UIImageView to the initial XIB which has its image resource path set to '<a-resource-folder>/<image-name>'\r\n  4. Build the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project will successfully build and properly present the image at runtime.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compilation of the XIB fails due to a '-1' error and the build fails. In addition, the 'ibtoold' process reports a NSRangeException thrown by -[NSTaggedPointerString getCharacters:range:] in the console.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1052d)\r\nMac OS X Yosemite (14A389)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving the path from all references to the image in the XIB using a text editor allows the XIB to be opened (and compiled) by Xcode but the image will not be displayed at runtime."
