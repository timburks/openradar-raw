    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently in my opinion the CarPlay maps view is unusable. If you look at the maps view in the NEX 8000 it allows you to just sit on it in a 3D view to see the streets around you. The Apple Version does not have this functionality and the screen is so whitewashed it is impossible to make out the streets on the map.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to just click maps and get a view using Apple's Map Data (Because it is more up to date) like the Pioneer NEX 3D Map view.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer NEX 3D Maps also allow pinch and zoom and this is notable lacking from the CarPlay version and is something I tried and that did not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Click Maps.\r\n3. Notice how the map does not start in 3D and orient itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Click Maps\r\n3. Map zooms in a 3D view (Like Navigation Mode) and just follows you as you drive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Click Maps.\r\n3. Notice how the map does not start in 3D and orient itself.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB ATT & Pioneer NEX 8000 in a 2011 Subaru WRX\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
