    description: |-
        When using “Open Quickly” to open a system header to refer to it, it opens as Objective-C unless you are currently viewing a Swift source file.

        When viewing one of these dynamically generated “swift headers”, however, a second “Open Quickly” opens that header as Objective-C.

        Please change Xcode to also treat generated Swift headers as Swift files and show any subsequently opened headers as Swift as well.
