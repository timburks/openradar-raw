    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an iOS 8 app is launched by instruments UIAutomation (XCode 6) calls to NSLog in the iOS app with sufficiently long strings do not return. More specifically I have seen this occur from a background thread while attempting to log a string of length circa 15,000 characters. Note that the log message makes it to the console, but the call to NSLog blocks forever. Additionally, other threads that call NSLog after this occurs will print the message to the console then hang, regardless of string length.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nwrite a test app that logs a string of length 15,000 characters.\r\nLaunch via Instruments UIAutomation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProper behavior would be the thread continuing on it's merry way after calling NSLog\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThread that called NSLog will hang, attaching a debugger will show the thread's callstack in the innards of NSLog. The string that was passed to NSLog does, however, get printed to the Console"
