    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"More\" item displayed in a UITabBar when there are more than 5 items is positioned incorrectly on the iPhone 6 Plus when displayed in landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create a new project in Xcode and choose iOS \"Tabbed Application\"\r\n2.  Make the app iPhone only, and ensure both landscape orientations are turned on in the target settings.\r\n3.  In the storyboard, duplicate the \"First\" view controller until there are 6 view controllers.\r\n4.  Connect all of the view controllers to the UITabBarController by Ctrl+Dragging from the center of the UITabBarController to each new view controller and selecting the \"view controllers\" option of the connection menu.\r\n5.  Run the app on an iPhone 6 Plus or 6 Plus simulator.\r\n6.  Rotate the device or simulator into landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll 5 tab bar items should be evenly separated along the tab bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"More\" item has a large gap to its left, leaving it further off to the right than it should be.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus (or 6 Plus simulator)"
