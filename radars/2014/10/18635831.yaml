    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone 6+ makes a slightly audible click about 30 seconds after audio stops when using Apple Earpods. The sound seems to be due to the audio circuitry powering down. The sound is barely audible, but is definitely present and consistent and annoying. This noise cannot be heard unless headphones are being used. Sometimes two clicks are heard one immediate after the other.\r\n\r\nThis also seems to happen when unpausing audio, but it is far less noticeable since it is occurring just as other sounds are about to play. If you unpause the audio before the first sound is heard, then there will not be a similar sound before the sound starts playing again, which seems to be due to the audio circuitry not having powered down yet. \r\n\r\nIt seems like this issue could be partly mitigated by delaying the power down of the audio circuit for a few minutes so that it would occur less often and be less noticeable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play some audio.\r\n2. Pause the audio, or wait for it to end.\r\n3. About 30 seconds later a slightly audible click is heard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Play some audio.\r\n2. Pause the audio, or wait for it to end.\r\n3. No audible noises of the audio circuit powering down.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\na slightly audible click about 30 seconds after audio stops when using Earpods.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6+ with iOS 8.0.2 and Apple EarPods.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ with Apple EarPods, listening to audio."
