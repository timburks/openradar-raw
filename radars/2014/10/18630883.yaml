    description: "Summary:\r\nThe reorder controls are not removed when a cell is reused. This becomes visible to the user when having cells that do not include reorder controls at the beginning of a table view. Initially, these reorder controls hare not shown. When scrolling down and up the table view (so that existing cells are reused), the cells at the top include reorder controls. This may lead to crashes if the the cells cannot be reordered.\r\n\r\nAttached a sample project that exhibits the behavior."
