    description: "Summary:\r\nCalls to asl_next() result in a fully reproducible SIGTRAP crash in apps that are (1) built with Xcode 6 AND (2) running on iOS 7. \r\n\r\nThose same apps running on iOS 8 will _not_ crash; likewise, those same apps built with Xcode 5 and running on iOS 7 will _not_ crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build the attached repo project with Xcode 6\r\n2. Run it on an iOS device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen running on iOS 7, app will not crash and log lines may be written to console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen running on iOS 7, app *will* crash in dyld.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2 (11D257)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe repro code is in ViewController.m::reproduceASLBug.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood it looks like we're dying in `dyld_stub_binder`. This seems pretty arcane, as does the fact that things work with iOS 8 or with iOS 7+Xcode 5.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 5th Generation 16GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'asltest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
