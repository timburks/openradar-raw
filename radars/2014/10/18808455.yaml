    description: |-
        The shared scheme files contained in a subproject are modified by Xcode each time a workspace containing that project is used (see screenshot).

        The whole point of having workspace referencing different subprojects simply makes no sense if those subprojects need to keep a reference to the "parent" workspace, in which case it means they can't be part of multiple workspaces.

        Those schemes are committed because they are the "reference" schemes that we share with the team (each dev can make his own based on that one). Having it change each time a different .xcworkspace is open is really cumbersome.

        Could you consider making subprojects completely unaware of their containing workspace? This would fit better the workspace approach, and avoid unnecessary commits.
