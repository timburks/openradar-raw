    description: "Summary:\nIâ€™ve only observed the behavior in Messages. When I click to focus the window, it changes to appear focused, but I cannot type into the window. When I click again, it instead moves Messages to the location that I have clicked. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Make sure Messages is not focused.\n2. Click on Messages.\n3. Click somewhere else.\n\nExpected Results:\nMessages should focus when I click. Subsequent clicks should not move the window.\n\nActual Results:\nMessages does not fully focus when I click. Subsequent clicks frequently move the window to the click location.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nI found someone else mentioning a very similar sounding issue on Twitter: https://twitter.com/frozendevil/status/521905256213397504"
