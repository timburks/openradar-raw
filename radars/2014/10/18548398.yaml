        Summary:
        I’m frequently stymied by the byte limits when trying to post a good bug report or feature request. Or to paste in a stack trace—if I do that in a comment it gets truncated. 3000b or whatever is unreasonably small.

        I avoid attaching files wherever possible because it’s a pain in the ass to make a file, log in, wait for the slow web UI to load, attach a file, comment meaningfully, and hit upload when I could have just pasted it into the original report filed with QuickRadar.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to paste a reasonable backtrace into a comment field in the public bugreporter.apple.com web UI. Equivalently, try to post a reasonably thorough bug report in the first place.


        Expected Results:
        I expected it to paste the whole thing and accept the whole thing and for me to not have to worry about trivialities like how many bytes my bug report/backtrace is.


        Actual Results:
        I have to edit the thing down, and for comments, double-check whether they got truncated.


        Regression:
        N/A
