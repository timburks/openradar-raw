    description: "Summary:\r\nWriting a struct / class like\r\n\r\nstruct A: Equatable {\r\n  var x: Int\r\n  var y: String\r\n}\r\n\r\nrequires now to implement the ==-operator to conform to equatable. This is boilerplate-code that could be avoided. It would be way more convenient and also improve the readability if there would be something like\r\ndefault ==\r\nso that the struct/class in the end looks like\r\n\r\nstruct A: Equatable {\r\n  var x: Int\r\n  var y: String\r\n\r\n  default ==\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis would combine the convenience of implicit compiler-generated operators like in C++ and the error-prevention of unwanted implicit auto-magic-functions by having the programmer to specify it explicitly."
