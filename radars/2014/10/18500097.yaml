    description: "Summary:\r\nWhilst you have a home screen app open, if you lock/unlock the page, various events stop firing, and any open web sql database connections become unusable.\r\n\r\nThe following events seem to cease firing entirely:\r\n\r\n* deviceorientation\r\n* touchstart\r\n* touchmove\r\n* touchend\r\n* devicemotion\r\n\r\nthis list is not exhaustive - there may be more.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as noted above, active Web SQL connections become unusable. Any active WebDatabase object appears as before (which makes this almost impossible to detect), but any \"transaction\" or \"readTransaction\" methods stop firing. There doesn't seem to be any way to recover from this position (including re-running window.openDatabase).\r\n\r\nThe absence of the PageView API from homescreen apps make this problem impossible to detect at runtime - as the app has absolutely no way of knowing that an unlock event has occurred.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a web page with a web sql database to the home screen\r\n2. Launch the app from the home screen\r\n3. Lock the screen\r\n4. Unlock the screen\r\n5. Attempt to run a query from the database\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe query should work, and return some results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens - the database.transaction method doesn't run, and there is no error."
