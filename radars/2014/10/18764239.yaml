        Summary:
        Enabling source control in Xcode 6.1 causes high idle resource use.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode
        2. “Enable Source Control” checked in preferences
        3. Open any combination or all of the test projects under git source control

        Expected Results:
        No CPU use and no increase in RAM use after projects are fully open.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode idle in background with six projects open:
        with “Enable Source Control” unchecked at launch
        CPU: 0.0 %, RAM: 500 MB

        with “Enable Source Control” unchecked at launch, then enabled
        CPU: 90.0 %, RAM: continuously increasing (25 MB/s)

        with “Enable Source Control” unchecked at launch, then enabled and disabled again
        CPU: 90.0 %, RAM: continuously increasing (10 MB/s)

        with “Enable Source Control” checked at launch
        CPU: 90.0 %, RAM: continuously increasing

        Regression:
        This was working fine in Xcode 5.1.1

        Notes:
        Six test projects. All under git source control:
