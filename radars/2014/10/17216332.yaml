    description: "Summary:\r\nThe 3D graphics driver API, which is within GPUSupport.framework, is undocumented. This makes it impossible for those who want to write accelerated 3D drivers to do so. This is necessary for proper operation and reasonable performance in virtualization software such as VirtualBox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo headers or documentation is provided for GPUSupport.framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome information is provided."
