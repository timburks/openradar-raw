    description: "We have noticed an issue with Safari and the Apple Push Notification Service for Websites after upgrading to Yosemite.\r\n\r\nPrior to upgrading to Yosemite Push notifications appear correctly on the Mac OS X Mavericks and are visible in the Notification Center.\r\n\r\nHowever after upgrading to Yosemite we are unable to receive any push notifications. Further there is no indication or alert that informs the user if any errors occurred.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this issue, we are asking users to \"reset\" their notification permissions for that website. i.e.:- Deny push notification from Safari Preferences and then Allow them again.\r\n\r\nThis toggling of the allow/deny switch is however a temporary fix. Our users are unlikely to notice this problem on their own. The only indication is a lack of notifications.\r\n\r\nPlease advice. Thanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On OS X Mavericks, Visit 9to5mac.com\r\n2. You will be prompted for permissions to receive push notifications. Click Allow.\r\n3. You will soon start seeing notifications when new posts are made on 9to5mac in notification center.\r\n4. Upgrade to OS X Yosemite.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotifications should be received by 9to5mac users who subscribed while they were on Mavericks, even after they upgrade to Yosemite.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotifications are no longer received, even after new posts on 9to5mac.com\r\n\r\nA Temporary Workaround is to Deny & Allow Notifications for 9to5mac.com from Safari Preferences."
