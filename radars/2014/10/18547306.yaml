    description: "Summary:\r\nThe launchd.plist key EnableGlobbing is no longer supported, but the launchd.plist man page does not reflect it, additionally there is LAUNCH_JOBKEY_ENABLEGLOBBING defined in the XPC API. The main nuisance is that I cannot refer to userâ€™s home directory in ProgramArguments, e.g. launch a tool located there. Hardcoding the home directory path is an inferior solution as the path can change any time.\r\n\r\nOne reasonable solution would be to provide automatic tilde expansion in ProgramArguments (possibly triggered by EnableTildeExpansion key).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a valid launchd.plist file/LaunchAgent that contains EnableGlobbing = YES and ProgramArguments containing one string \"~/some/path/to/a/tool/in/users/home/directory\"\r\n2. load it (e.g. using the command launchctl load file-from-step-1.plist)\r\n3. observe if tool is launched and console output\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs par the launchd.plist man page the tool should launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTool does not launch. Console output:\r\n\r\nThe EnableGlobbing key is no longer respected. Please remove it.\r\nService could not initialize  (...): 0x2\r\n\r\nwhere 0x2 is presumably the ENOENT errno (File or directory does not exist)."
