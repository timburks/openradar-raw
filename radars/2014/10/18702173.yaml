    description: "Summary:\nWhen you change the time of an alarm, whilst multiple alarms are activated, the earliest alarm gets disabled.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Make sure you have a bunch of alarms set, but disabled (i.e. in the situation in which I’ve discovered this issue, there were 10 alarms in the alarm list)\n2. Lock the iPhone\n3. Swipe the control center up\n4. Press the timer icon\n5. Switch to the alarms\n6. Activate a bunch of alarms subsequent of each other (i.e. 6 alarms)\n7. Change the time of one of the active alarms, in any case not the first one (i.e. in the testcase the time between alarms was 15 minutes, starting from 08.30 ending with 09.45)\n\nExpected Results:\nNothing much really, just that all the active alarms are active and the alarm which have been changed should have the new timesaving \n\nActual Results:\nThe alarm which have been changed, had the new time setting and the first (e.g. the earliest one) alarm was deactivated. In this particular example the alarm of 08.30.\n\nRegression:\nThis issue occurs on iOS 8.1 beta 2 build 12B407, specifically on a iPhone 5s 16GB A1457. I’ve tried to reproduce it on a 6+ (build A1524), but on that device this issue isn’t reproducible where as on the 5s it is always reproducible."
