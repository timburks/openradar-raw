    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Zoom Accessibility feature (ctrl-two finger swipe) with a multiple monitor arrangement, the performance is awful, far worse than Mavericks. In some cases the response is 1FPS or less.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Arrange multiple monitors. The monitor type may or may not matter, not enough testing yet.\r\n2. Turn on scroll zooming: System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom > Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom\r\n3. Zoom in on something.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnder Mavericks the performance of this was 30fps or better. It felt like 60fps, honestly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe display zooms choppily and slowly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy monitor configuration, from left to right:\r\n\r\n- Apple Thunderbolt Display \r\n- Apple Retina Macbook Pro \r\n- Apple Cinema Display 30\"\r\n\r\nUpdated to the public release of Yosemite last night."
