    description: "APPLE DEV RELATION 07-Oct-2014 04:14 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following:\r\n\r\nYou can add the 'objc' attribute to any method or property to explicitly expose that member to the Objective-C runtime. This can be used no matter what the accessibility is.\r\n\r\nPlease update your bug report to let us know if this is still an issue for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL RPOBLEM:\r\n\r\nUsing Swift, you can't assign a custom action to a private target, unless making this action \"internal\" or \"public\" which causes, of course, a warning in Xcode because we're \"declaring an internal (or public) instance method for a private class\"\r\n\r\nThe problem is: not doing so causes the code to crash on run\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create a private UIView subclass\r\n2. Add a gesture recognizer to it with target: self, selector \"youChoose:\"\r\n3. Implement your selector\r\n4. Run the app and trigger the gesture's action -> Crash"
