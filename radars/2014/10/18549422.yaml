    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of 17086087 (which is closed due to late response on my side). Issue is still persistent on 8.0.2. (12A405). Copy paste:\r\n\r\niOS 'thinks' the volume is continually pressed when there are Apple headphones (standard) connected, music is played, the phone is locked and when you press the volume up and volume down button shortly after each other (within 1-2 seconds). You can press volume down as much as you like, or you can even change the volume with the slider on the control panel but iOS will change the volume to max every time. Only a hard reset can resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect Apple's standard headphones\r\n2. Open up Apple's standard music app (or any music app that is able  to play on the background)\r\n3. Play a song\r\n4. Lock the phone with the sleep button, MAKE SURE SCREEN IS OFF\r\n5. Slide with your finger (e.g. your thumb) over the volume buttons from top to bottom (i.e. from volume up to volume down), make sure you push both buttons down when sliding over them. (this seems like an unusual action, but is very common when you slide your iPhone into a protective sleeve)\r\n(bonus: 6. Disconnect the headphones, the problem persists)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing, or at most that the volume fluctuates for a second\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS keeps thinking you are holding volume up button and maximizes the volume and persists in maximizing the volume even if you press the volume down button, adjust the volume by software (e.g. the volume slider in control center), press the volume up to 'unlock' the button or disconnect the headphones\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2. (12A405) down to at least iOS 7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nJust to be clear, this happens with multiple (and even brand new) Apple headphones\r\n\r\nFor stackshot see original bugreport: 17086087\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 16 GB GSM (A1457 NE43DN/A)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations09-Oct-2014 08:51 AM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow \"Duplicate of XXXXXXXX\" section of the bug reporter user interface. This section appears near the top of the right column's bug detail view just under the bug number, title, state, product and rank.\r\n\r\nDupe of rdar://18315833 (Closed)"
