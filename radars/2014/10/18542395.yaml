    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to the 10.10 AppKit release notes, NSMatrix is \"informally deprecated\" and developers are encouraged to instead create individual NSButton instances which AppKit will recognize and treat as a group. However, creating a radio group using the built-in Object Library in Xcode still creates an NSMatrix instance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new .xib file in Xcode\r\n2. Open the \"Object Library\" pane in the lower right corner of the Xcode window\r\n3. Find the object named \"Radio Group\" and drag it into the window in your .xib\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo NSButton instances should be created next to each other, as recommended by the AppKit documentation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn NSMatrix instance is still created instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1/6A1042b on OS X 10.10/14A379a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRadio buttons can still be configured manually using the inspector, but the default behavior provided by Interface Builder should match the recommendations in the docs."
