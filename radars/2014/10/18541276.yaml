    description: "Summary:\r\nAs suggested in this post (http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/08/10/app-store-curation-an-open-letter-to-tim-cook/) by Jean-Louis Gass√©e, the App Store would benefit from more human curation. While the apps that are featured in the App Store are actually hand selected by the App Store editorial team, it's not always apparent that this curation is done by humans.\r\n\r\nThe new Explore section on the App Store has incredible potential and could become one of the primary places for iOS app discovery. That being the case, it would be great to see a more human touch applied to this section. I'd love to see:\r\n\r\n1. Short editorials about interesting apps written by the App Store team, other Apple employees, trusted industry writers, famous people, and/or regular users.\r\n2. Curated lists of apps used for specific tasks, for specific vocations, by famous people, by regular users, etc. including pictures of the people curating the list, short personal descriptions of the list and specific apps.\r\n3. Short videos discussing various apps and demonstrating real-world usage. Like the \"You're more powerful than you think\" series, except on a much smaller scale and done more frequently. (app previews are great, but are very limited and obviously marketing. Editorial videos would likely be well received by users)\r\n4. App \"shoot-outs\". Curated lists of apps that do similar things, but hi-lighting the differences among them and what each one does particularly well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit the Explore tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind all sorts of interesting content related to great apps on the App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind painstakingly curated lists of great apps that look like lists that may have been automatically generated by algorithms."
