    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen interacting with a navigation controller on the iOS 8.1 64 bit runtime, UINavigationController does not throw an assertion failure when popping to a view controller which is not in the navigation stack.  The assertion failure does occur in the 32bit variant of the same runtime version\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a navigation controller with more than one controller on the navigation stack\r\n2. call -popToViewController:animated: with a viewController not in the navigation stack\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nexpected an assertion failure to occur\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nassertion failure only occurs on 32 bit iOS 8.1 runtime, with message:\r\n\r\n'Tried to pop to a view controller that doesn't exist.'\r\n\r\nOn 64 bit iOS 8.1 runtime no assertion failure occurs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1 (6A1052c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nProblem occurs on iOS 8.1 64 bit simulator"
