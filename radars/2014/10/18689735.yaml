        Summary:
        NSURLBookmarkCreationWithSecurityScope constant is required for UIDocumentPickerController users to keep bookmarks to shared files. However the NSURL constant for this is not publicly available.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to create security scoped bookmark URL as advised by documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/CreatinganOutstandingUserExperience/CreatinganOutstandingUserExperience.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451-CH3-SW3

        Expected Results:
        Everything goes as documentation advises.

        Actual Results:
        NSURLBookmarkCreationWithSecurityScope is declared as not available on iOS.

        Regression:
        Passing in the raw value (1 << 11) works, but this is ugly.
