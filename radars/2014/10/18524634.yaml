        Summary:
        When running an App on iPhone 6 or 6 plus (device and simulator), a scaled App shows the status bar with a black colour, even though the status bar style is set to UIStatusBarStyleLightContent

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create an Xcode project in Xcode 5.x.
        2. Create a xib or storyboard with a dark background as the initial view.
        3. Set the status bar to a white colour by setting the ‘Status bar style’ key in the plist to ‘UIStatusBarStyleLightContent’ and ‘View controller-based status bar appearance’ to NO.
        4. Open the App in Xcode 6.0.1 (6A317).
        5. Run the App in the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6+ simulator.
        6. Observe the black status bar.

        Expected Results:
        The status bar should be white, as per iOS 7.x

        Actual Results:
        The status bar is black.

        Regression:
        On iOS 8, the status bar can be set to white by setting ‘View controller-based status bar appearance’ to YES and setting the status bar on a navigation bar to black translucent.
