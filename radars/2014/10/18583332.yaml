    description: "Summary:\r\nUsers of our web app who have installed it to their home screens began reporting the app \"crashing\" after iOS 8 was released. Further investigation revealed that the \"crash\" was actually the app becoming unresponsive. We were able to distill the problem down to a failure with setTimeout where any asynchronous operations (we have many of them, we are using AngularJS) would fail. See http://jsfiddle.net/24b2eLyn/1/.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In an iOS 8 device (physical or simulated, any device works), open Safari and navigate to http://jsfiddle.net/24b2eLyn/1/\r\n2. Add to Home Screen\r\n3. Access the installed web app\r\n4. Notice that messages are showing up every 3 seconds\r\n5. Lock and unlock the device\r\n6. The messages stop appearing\r\n\r\nThe same reproduction steps in iOS 7.1 does not have the same bug - the messages continue to appear. Furthermore, running the fiddle in Safari in iOS 8 also does not exhibit the bug. It appears to be confined strictly to standalone installed web applications in iOS 8.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsetTimeout timers should resume after unlock, and the passed function should be called. App functionality depending on setTimeout should continue working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsetTimeout timers appear to be \"blown away\", and further setTimeout calls are not respected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iOS device running iOS 8 (physical or simulated with xcode)"
