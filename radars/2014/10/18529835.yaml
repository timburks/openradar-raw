    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a lot of breakpoints, and in Xcode 6.1 the way breakpoints are colored/dimmed in the Breakpoint Navigator is extremely confusing. I've attached 4 screenshots to illustrate this--\r\n\r\n1.png: opArray() line 350 is selected in the navigator. This breakpoint is *active*, but is dimmed to almost the same color as opStringWithNewline() below it, which is *inactive*.\r\n\r\n2.png: Selection is changed to opStringWithNewline(), showing that opArray() was active.\r\n\r\n3.png: The opStringWithNewline() breakpoint has now been *activated* by clicking on the breakpoint icon in the navigator. Note the very subtle change in color.\r\n\r\n4.png: The breakpoint for opStringWithNewline() was inactivated by clicking on the breakpoint icon directly in the editor (also shown). Note that the icon in the editor is correctly dimmed, but the icon in the Breakpoint Navigator is now darker than the inactivated breakpoints around it, because the Breakpoint Navigator no longer has focus.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to tell what is and isn't active, and under certain cases, like the ones in 1.png and 4.png, the state of the breakpoint is counter intuitive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project.\r\n2. Add breakpoints.\r\n3. Turn some off and some on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe difference between active and inactive breakpoints should be extremely clear and obvious.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.1 (6A1042b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'1.png', '2.png', '3.png' and '4.png' were successfully uploaded."
