    description: "Summary:\r\nYou are able to mistakenly edit an Apple framework header file, which will then cause a ton of cryptic build issues. This seems like a regression and I believe these files used to be locked for editing before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any Apple provided .h file\r\n2. Delete some text, or if you'd like, write a poem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should not be able to edit the Apple provided .h files\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am able to edit the Apple provided .h files which will then cause many cryptic build errors.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1\r\nOS X 10.10"
