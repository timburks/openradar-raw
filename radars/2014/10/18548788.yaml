    description: "Summary:\r\nI use Dvorak, my wife uses QWERTY. We make it work somehow, but our relationship is tested if I switch the OS X login screen to use Dvorak. Instead, it'd be nice if, when clicking an account name, that account's last-used keymap/layout/IME is selected so that we can type our passwords in the layout that we're familiar with.\r\n\r\nI imagine this would also be useful to people using regionally-distinct keymaps on keyboards from differing regions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have two accounts, one that uses Dvorak and one that uses QWERTY.\r\n2. At the login screen, click the account of the Dvorak user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe password field should use the Dvorak layout. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe password field uses QWERTY layout, even though that account does not use QWERTY at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nConfirmed to still be missing on Yosemite GM Preview 1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know the keymap/IME can be changed at the login screen. I'm asking for this to be automatic, per-account. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny version of OS X."
