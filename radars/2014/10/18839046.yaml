    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://18838737\n\nSummary:\r\nCustom Keyboards in iOS 8(& 8.1) cannot play a click sound unless they request and are then granted \"Full Access\".  This restriction does not seem to be consistent with the general goals of the restricted access policy.  It makes a lot of sense to sandbox away the networking and data access abilities, however, the ability to play a sound when tapped doesn't appear to have any privacy concerns.  It does, however, provide a valuable assistance to users, especially those with visual impairments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a project with a custom keyboard in it (without requesting Full Access)\r\n2) Implement the UIInputViewAudioFeedback protocol\r\n3) Implement the enableInputClicksWhenVisible delegate\r\n4) Attempt to play a sound using [UIDevice playInputClick]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA sound is played.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo sound is played and no feedback that one should have occurred is given."
