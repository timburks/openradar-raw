    description: "Summary:\n[1] The current Mac mini model (Oct. 2014) has soldered RAM \n[2] and the quad core option has gone.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n[1] Open the enclosure and take a look at the Logic Board to change the RAM modules.\n[2] Open system profiler and take a look to find the quad core CPU.\n\nExpected Results:\n[1] Two (or more) DIMM-slots that makes it possible to change the RAM by any needs.\n[2] Processor Name: 3.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i7  (or similar)\n\nActual Results:\n[1] Everyone will be left out in the cold. No one can change the RAM.\n[2] Processor Name: 2.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (max)\n\nRegression:\nThe actual processor model in particular is a real problem for all Indie software developers to maintain their projects using Xcode server by having an open eye to the hardware expenses. Purchasing a Mac Pro is no option because it is sold at around 3-4 times to price of a maxed-out Mac mini.\n\nNotes:\nPlease take a look at a more detailed explanation made by @iljawascoding at http://ilquest.com/2014/10/20/why-the-2014-mac-minis-are-a-disappointment-for-developers/"
