    description: "A user will often be presented with an UIActivityViewController but not know exactly what data they will be acting on when they choose an activity or a share extension. A perfect example is that long-pressing on a link, but not knowing exactly what URL they're about to share or copy is.\r\n\r\nIn Tumblr.app, we add a URL preview (screenshot attached) above our activity controllers, but this solution is A) non-standard, something that every developer would need to implement themselves, and B) fragile, likely to be broken in a future iOS release.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a standardized way to do this that all apps could benefit from.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDisplay a UIActivityViewController with an NSURL instance in the activity items array.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see a preview of the URL. \r\n\r\nThis could either be an API that allows developers to provide a custom preview view, or something that the OS does automatically for known data types like NSURL, NSString, UIImage, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo preview is shown to the user."
