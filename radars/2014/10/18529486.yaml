    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the addition of TestFlight in iOS 8, only users in iTunes Connect with either Admin or Technical roles may be testers of internal apps.  This is very insecure in that it means opening up access to iTunes Connect for users that don't need access to that functionality.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, it would be very useful to have a new role in iTunes Connect called Tester that would only have access to internal builds via the TestFlight app on iOS.  They would not have any of the other abilities in iTunes Connect that they do not need access to.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this is that a lot of smaller developers would like to have the ability to send out a test builds frequently during development, which the internal testing option allows.  But they don't want to hand over the keys to their iTunes Connect account at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to this is to either continue using Ad-Hoc builds, which gives none of the benefits of TestFlight or to use beta testing, which involves an App Store approval process before a build is made available to the testers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
