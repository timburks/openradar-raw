        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Check for supported TLS protocol versions and cipher suites on swscan.apple.com

        Expected Results:
        Apple's software scan service should offer the best transport security with TLS 1.2 to protect user's software updates.

        Actual Results:
        TLS 1.0 available only.
        RC4 cipher in use which should not be used at ALL anymore.
        3DES cipher offered which should not be used at ALL anymore.

        No forward secrecy provided by DHE or ECDHE handshake but only plain RSA available.

        Regression:
        SSLv3 has been turned off which is good and mitigates the POODLE attack!
