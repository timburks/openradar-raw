        Summary:
        iTunes doesn’t show wifi connected iPhone 6+ to synchronize

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi-network
        2. Make sure the sync trough WiFi checkbox is marked

        Expected Results:
        iPhone 6+ should me in the upper left corner to select

        Actual Results:
        No iPhone icon to click on

        Regression:
        MBP 15” late 2011 with OS X 10.10 Yosemite build 14A389 & iTunes 12.0.1 (12.0.1.26) in conjunction with iPhone 6 plus 64 GB A1524 iOS 8.1 12B411

        Notes:
        In the iPhone settings under General>WiFi synchronization the button to synch is available but it keeps searching for the MBP. Time Capsule in DHCP mode is used as network router.
