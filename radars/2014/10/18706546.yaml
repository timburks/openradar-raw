    description: "Summary:\r\nTuples that consist of items of the same types should be comparable with == and != by default, like\r\n(1, \"a\") == (1, \"a\")\r\nshould not bring up a compiler-error but instead return true at runtime. \r\nHowever, tuples with different types should still throw a compiler-error, like\r\n(1, 2) == (1, \"2\")\r\nshould not compile."
