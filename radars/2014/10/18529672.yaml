    description: "Summary:\r\nThe TestFlight app on iOS 8 only allows the Apple ID it is using to be the one that is selected in Settings->iTunes & App Store.  This causes a problem for users who use a different Apple ID with iTunes Connect than they do for the App Store or even their developer account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch TestFlight app\r\n2. Tap on Apple ID button at bottom of the screen.\r\n3. Attempt to change Apple ID by tapping field at the top of the screen or hitting the Edit button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA login screen would allow you to change to a different Apple ID for TestFlight purposes only.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no UI for changing Apple IDs within the TestFlight app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTestFlight 1.0.0 (50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
