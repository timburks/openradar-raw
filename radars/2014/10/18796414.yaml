    description: "At the moment, IB doesn't really allow to attach and interactively edit extra views to a view controller scene in a OS X storyboard.\r\n\r\nVery often it's useful to have auxiliary views that might be added to VC's main view's tree. (But outside of the view during design.) At the moment it's not possible to add \"orphan\" views (outside of any VC) to a storyboard. It's possible to add a view (or any other object) to a scene, but it's not possible to view and edit it other than by selecting subviews in the sidebar"
