    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen zoomed in to a Calendar print preview window, scrolling vertically uses the type of scrolling selected in Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom > Scroll direction, however scrolling horizontally uses the inverse of this setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Note the setting of 'System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom > Scroll direction'\r\n2. In Calendar, select File > Print\r\n3. A window appears entitled 'Print', which has a preview window on the right with a zoom slider beneath it.\r\n4. Zoom in sufficiently so that scrolling is required to see parts of the image not on screen.\r\n5. Scroll vertically, noting the scrolling direction.\r\n6. Scroll horizontally, noting the scrolling direction.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. Scrolling follows the System Preferences setting for 'natural' or 'classic' scrolling.\r\n6. Scrolling should follow the System Preferences setting for 'natural' or 'classic' scrolling.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. Scrolling does indeed follow the System Preferences setting for 'natural' or 'classic' scrolling. Changing this preference is reflected in the Calendar preview window immediately.\r\n6. Scrolling direction is opposite to the System Preferences setting for 'natural' or 'classic' scrolling. Changing this preference is reflected in the Calendar preview window immediately; however, it is still opposite to the expected direction.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10\r\nCalendar 8.0 (2026)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClicking and dragging to pan in this window works as expected. Trackpad gestures for zooming in or out do not function at all.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAs my computer only has an Apple Trackpad, I have only been able to test this input device (Model no. A1339)."
