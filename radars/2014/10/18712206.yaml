        Summary:
        When Xcode is in full screen mode, clicking the run button causes Xcode to close the currently selected window. Running using cmd-R works as expected.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an iOS project.
        2. Put Xcode in full screen mode.
        3. Click run button.

        Expected Results:
        The app runs on a simulator, as selected by the target picker.

        Actual Results:
        The Xcode window closes.

        Regression:
        6.0.3/10.9.5 worked perfectly as expected.

        Notes:
        I’ve only seen this occurring on Yosemite/6.1, but I didn’t test with Xcode 6.0.x.
