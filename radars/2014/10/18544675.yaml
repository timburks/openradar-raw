    description: "Summary:\r\nI created a UILabel in an IB storyboard, selected \"Attributed text\", and clicked the \"…\" button to edit the text attributes. Although [the documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSParagraphStyle_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSParagraphStyle/tailIndent) says that the value can be negative, IB will not let the value be set less than 0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag a UILabel onto a view in a storyboard.\r\n2. In its Attributes Inspector, select \"Attributed\" from the \"Text\" drop down menu.\r\n3. Click the \"…\" button and enter \"-5\" in the \"Tail\" field\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the -5 to stick.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value resets to 0.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was able to work around this issue by editing the storyboard file directly. Now the -5 appears in the \"Tail\" field, but I'm afraid of what will happen if I ever inadvertently edit it."
