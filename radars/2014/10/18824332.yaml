    description: "Summary:\r\nThe public Force Feedback API, which is implemented by ForceFeedback.framework, hardcodes the /System/Library/Extensions path for force feedback plugins, rather than using the path of the kext that contains the plugin. This is a major issue because kexts must now be installed in /Library/Extensions.\r\n\r\nA cursory overview using grep and strings indicates that it is highly other frameworks also hardcode /System/Library/Extensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a force-feedback compatible joystick driver that goes in /Library/Extensions.\r\n2. Expect force feedback to work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect force feedback to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nForce feedback does not operate.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 14A389\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tested using the open-source 360Controller driver at https://github.com/d235j/360Controller/tree/yosCodeSign. I have attached a build signed by one of the project collaborators. This does require an Xbox 360 controller to test; the installed preference pane should trigger force feedback when the left and right triggers are pressed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac OS 10.10, when the kext is installed into /Library/Extensions.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Install360Controller0.14beta2.pkg' was successfully uploaded."
