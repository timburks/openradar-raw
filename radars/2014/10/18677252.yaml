        Summary:
        There is currently no API to call 3rd party photos extensions for editing an image or photos, like the photos app does it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        An API to call 3rd party photo editing apps using the extensions menu. As in Photos.app â€” see attached screenshot.

        Actual Results:
        No such API.

        Regression:
        -

        Notes:
        This API would ideally take an NSImage or NSData object and return just that as well.
