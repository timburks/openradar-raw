    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen leaving Safari whilst using it in horizontal orientation and then switching back to Safari using the app switcher, Safari ignores the horizontal orientation and requires you to flip the phone to vertical orientation and back, before it responds to the orientation in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a random webpage using Safari in horizontal orientation\r\n2. Switch to an app which doesn’t support horizontal orientation (either via the home screen or a push notification)\r\n3. Keep your phone in horizontal orientation whilst double pressing the home button\r\n4. Choose Safari from the app switcher (note that the app switcher shows in horizontal orientation) \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari opens in horizontal orientation with the page scrolled at the place where I left it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari opens in vertical orientation (with the page unloaded so it has to reload the page). You need to hold the phone vertical and flip it back to horizontal before Safari changes to the horizontal orientation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProblem occurs on the iPhone 5s 16 GB A1257 & the iPhone 5 16 GB A1429. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProblem doesn’t doesn’t occur on the iPhone 6+ A1524. Also the problem didn’t occur on iOS 7"
