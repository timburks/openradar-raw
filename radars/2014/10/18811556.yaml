    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a dual-display setup, when focus is switched between displays (click on desktop/window of inactive display), a lot of StatusItems flash white on both displays.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen only in dark mode\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect two displays to a Mac\r\n2. Turn on dark menu bar\r\n3. Click on inactive display to change focus\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMany icons flash with white background.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 (14A389) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nit's plausible (I have not tested that) that this issue only occurs when one display is HiDPI, and another is 1x.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'icons-flash.mov' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video attached also shows another problem, with icons on Retina screen changing to their non-Retina variants momentarily: rdar://18811632"
