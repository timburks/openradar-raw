    description: Just like there is an “Embed in Matrix” menu option in IB, it would be nice if there was an “Embed in StackView” to place all the selected views in an NSStackView (and delete any existing now-irrelevant constraints) and the NSStackView would have bounds matching the outer bounding box of all selected views.
