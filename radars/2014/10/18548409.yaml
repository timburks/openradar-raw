        Summary:
        When I run a Swift script which triggers a compiler crash, the interpreter barfs binary garbage all over the console.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Put this in a script and run it:

        #!/usr/bin/env xcrun swift
        public struct ReducibleOf<T> {
        	public init<S : SequenceType where S.Generator.Element == T>(_ sequence: S) {}
        	public func reduceLeft<Result>(recur: (ReducibleOf, Result, (Result, T) -> Result) -> Result) -> (ReducibleOf, Result, (Result, T) -> Result) -> Result {
        		return { _, x, _ in x }
        	}
        }
        func testReduction() {
        	let sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        	let reducible = ReducibleOf(sequence)
        	var result = 0
        	var take: (ReducibleOf<Int>, Int, (Int, Int) -> Int) -> Int = { reducible, initial, combine in
        		result = initial
        		return initial
        	}
        	var x = reducible.reduceLeft(take)(reducible, 0 as Int, { into, each in each })
        }

        Note that it MUST NOT have a newline at the end of the file to trigger this issue. I.e. the last byte in the file should be the closing }.


        Expected Results:
        I certainly didn’t expect it to spew garbage everywhere.


        Actual Results:
        It spewed garbage… everywhere.


        Regression:
        - doesn’t do it with other scripts whether I have a trailing newline or not
        - doesn’t do it with this script if there’s a trailing newline
        - doesn’t do it if I redirect output to a file—the file just ends up being empty
        - wtf


        Notes:
        Kind of a cool party trick I guess.
