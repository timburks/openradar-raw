        Please add a “title” property to UIActivityViewController. When the property is set (with an NSString), the presented view controller will display the title at the top, above the AirDrop option.

        Justification:
        Since iOS 8, many apps (such as TweetBot) use long-press on a URL to present a share sheet. Prior to iOS 8, the same apps often used a custom dialog here, which displayed the full non-shortened URL, as well as providing access to share options. Thus, many users (including myself) used long press on a URL or link to allow us to view the full URL, possibly with a view of deciding whether to visit that page or not.

        Ever since UIActivityViewController became more useful, apps have been using it instead, and we’ve lost the ability to preview the full URL on long press. Adding a title field would allow these apps to set the sheet’s title to be the text of the URL, thus bringing back the missing feature.

        A title property would have other uses besides displaying URLs, of course — this is just an example of a use case.
