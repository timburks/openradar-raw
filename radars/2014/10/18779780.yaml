    description: "Summary:\r\nNSUserNotification provides some API to add \"action buttons\", or additional actions to the notification (other than dismissing or clicking on it) — hasActionButton, actionButtonTitle, otherButtonTitle, and, new in Yosemite, additionalActions. These are great except for the fact that they only work if the user explicitly changes the app's notifications type to Alert in System Preferences. They don't work with \"banners\".\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the above, the new `hasReplyButton` property work beautifully with plain old notifications — the \"Reply\" button simply appears when the user mouses over the notification. It would be great if custom action buttons worked the same way — appeared on mouse over in \"banners\" mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an NSUserNotification object, set hasActionButton to YES, and add some extra actions using actionButtonTitle, otherButtonTitle, and/or additionalActions.\r\n2. Deliver it to NSUserNotificationCenter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nButtons appear even if app's notifications are banners, not alerts; perhaps only when the mouse rolls over (like with the Reply button)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the message appears :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10; Xcode 6.1"
