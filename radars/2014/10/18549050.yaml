    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently CarPlay does not allow me to proofread my messages, or view a new message. While I see how this could be legal issues, why can we scroll through our music or phone contacts, but not messages? This was one of the reasons I wanted CarPlay, so that I could send messages using Siri, like Siri Eyes Free, but be able to proofread or see messages. The seeing part of messages goes into being able to see pictures that were sent via text (i see how videos could be a distraction).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Send A Message through Siri Dication.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Start CarPlay \r\n2. Dictate Message\r\n3. Display Message\r\n4. Send Message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Start CarPlay \r\n2. Dictate Message\r\n4. Send Message\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB ATT & Pioneer NEX 8000 in 2011 Subaru WRX\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
