    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the user has saved a apple-mobile-web-app-capable to the user’s homescreen in iOS-8.0.2 (unable to test 7 or 8.0.0), the web app will be unable to perform any AJAX requests using XMLHttpRequest after the user locks and unlocks the device while the app is running in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write/find an apple-mobile-web-app-capable webapp that has AJAX capabilities. For example, http://cdn.ohnopub.net/cdn/binki/apple/ios/8/ios8.0.2-webapp-fullscreen-noajax/\r\n2. Open in Mobile Safari.\r\n3. Choose the “Add to Home Screen” option from Mobile Safari’s chrome and follow the instructions to “Add” the page to the home screen.\r\n4. Launch the webapp from the home screen and observe that it is capable of performing AJAX requests. (In the linked example, observe that generating a click event against “The Button” results in “sending…,1,2,3,4,200: OK”).\r\n5. Lock the device using its hold button. Ensure that the webapp is still in the foreground immediately prior to locking the device.\r\n6. Unlock the device.\r\n7. Attempt to perform an operation requiring AJAX and observe that the iOS status bar displays network activity for a short moment but the webapp gets no response. (In the linked example, generate a click event against “The Button” and observe that the request never makes it beyond “sending…”).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe webapp will remain able to get back data/feedback from AJAX requests after the user has unlocked the screen while the webapp is in the foreground.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe webapp sends the request to the server causing entries to be added to apache2’s access_log file. However, the webapp never gets any data/feedback back. The webapp can only assume that the user agent (the iOS fullscreen webapp runner app thingy) has not even sent the request yet.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS-8.0.2 [12A405]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHmm, sorry, my JavaScript does not seem to be compatible with iOS6, but I am quite sure that this problem did not exist back then. I suspect it did not exist in iOS7 either but I cannot test that.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2 and iPod 5 on WiFi (MC769LL/A and MGG82LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 18042389 (Open)\r\nrdar://18042389"
