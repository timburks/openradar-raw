    description: "Summary:\r\nBy default, without any image in the cell, UITableViewCell looks broken - there's an odd 10 or 15 point inset on the separator line. My QA people kick it back to me, because they rightly note that it looks broken. These properties should default to 0 and the line should span the width of the cell. You can choose to change it if an icon is applied, but I'll opt to override this anyway, as that's never the desired behavior.\r\nThe additional property in iOS 8 that I must override just to get these to the correct default look has increased effort and frustration for me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an instance of UITableView and populate cells with text, no images.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line should span the width of the cell by default. I shouldn't have to override two properties for the table AND each cell that I create.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's an inset for each cell separator, which looks ugly and broken.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad"
