    description: With iOS 6, using the volume buttons to adjust the volume with the headphones plugged in was contextual - i.e. with the Music app it would adjust the headphone volume, on the Home screen it would adjust the ringer - this behaviour is intuitive. With iOS 8 - this same action always adjusts the headphone volume regardless, even if you are on the Home screen and not the music app. It should be contextual - if music is playing in the background then adjust headphones, otherwise the ringer.
