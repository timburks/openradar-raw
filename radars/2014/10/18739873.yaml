        Summary:
        Now that Yosemite has SMS handoff with iOS 8.1, you can “Message” any number. That may be iMessage, or that may be SMS. The context-menu that comes up when a data detector sees a phone number should doesn’t have an option to do that though. It should have a new option for “Message (403) 478-2924”. When you select that, it would open it up in Messages and then do it’s normal check to see if that number shows up as proud blue, or shameful shameful green.
