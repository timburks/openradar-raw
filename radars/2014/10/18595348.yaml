    description: "Summary\r\nOur company has applications which are downloaded through a website using Enterprise Distribution.\r\n\r\nA large number of users have upgraded from iOS7 to iOS8. As a result, they are experiencing an issue where they are unable to redownload several applications that had previously existed on the device.\r\n\r\nWe note that: \r\n-\tInstalling application new on iOS 7 is successful\r\n-\tRunning the app from Xcode under iOS 8 works properly \r\n-\tUsers are able to download the application on iOS8 only when a previous installation of the application did not exist. \r\n\r\nUpon analyzing the logs on the devices with the problem, we have noticed the following \"<Warning>: LoadExternalDownloadManifestOperation: Ignore manifest download, already have bundleID\" Our tests point to iOS having a cached list of previously installed applications based on bundleIDs which makes iOS believe that the app is already installed.\r\n\r\nThe only 'work-around' that we have found is to publish that same application with a different BundleID as iOS will detect them as new applications, however, this process is extremely cumbersome as it requires thousands of existing users to uninstall the legacy applications (whether functional or not) and reinstall the new applications (under a new BundleID).\r\n\r\nThis same issue has been reported on many forums, some of these are as follow:\r\nhttp://support.hockeyapp.net/discussions/problems/26683-not-able-to-download-apps-ios8-beta-5-autoupdate-manually-etc\r\nhttp://www.codenameone.com/blog/ios-8-installs-customizing-the-pull-to-refresh\r\nhttp://idictate.us/questions/25772664/enterprise-app-update-distribution-on-ios-8\r\nhttps://buildozer.io/ios8\r\n\r\nWe would like for Apple to provide a fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1) Download Enterprise Distribution Apps \r\n2) Delete Enterprise Distribution Apps\r\n3) Update Device to iOS 8 (OTA)\r\n4) Download Enterprise Distribution Apps\r\n5) Attempt to re-download apps\r\n6) Apps will not download/install - Only applications which were not previously downloaded/installed in iOS7 will install properly.\r\n\r\nAnother way to re-produce issue is:\r\n\r\n1) Download Enterprise Distribution Apps\r\n2) Update Device to iOS 8 (OTA)\r\n3) Delete Enterprise Distribution Apps\r\n4) Attempt to re-download apps\r\n5) Apps will not download/install - Only applications which were not previously downloaded/installed in iOS7 will install properly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nEnterprise Distribution Applications which were previously installed in iOS7 are able to be downloaded/installed successfully after iOS8 upgrade.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nApplication installation fails and logs show \"<Warning>: LoadExternalDownloadManifestOperation: Ignore manifest download, already have bundleID\""
