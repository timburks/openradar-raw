    description: "Summary:\r\nMost first-party apps do not allow for portrait upside-down usage on iPhone 6 Plus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings.app. Rotate device in portrait upside-down. Note how the app rotates to the orientation.\r\n2. Open Maps.app (or any from the list below). Rotate device in portrait upside-down. Note how the app does not rotate as it should.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll default apps should behave in a consistent way on iPhone 6 Plus. Right now, most donâ€™t.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost apps don't rotate to match the new orientation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApps exhibiting the bad behaviour include, but are probably not limited to: Maps, Notes, Photos, Clock, Safari, Weather, App Store, TestFlight, Phone, Messages, AirPort, Remote, Reminders, Contacts, Photos, Stocks, Compass, Passbook, Music, iTunes Store, Numbers, Videos, Calculator, Find My Friends, Pages, iTunes U, Apple Store, iTunes Connect, Health, Podcasts, iMovie.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus (MGAH2ZD/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
