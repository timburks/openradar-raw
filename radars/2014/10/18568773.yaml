    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Yosemite, a change has been made so that, when replying to a message, the date/source intro above the quoted text is quoted. It should not be, because that information was not written by the person to whom you're replying.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a message in Mail.\r\n2. Hit Cmd-r to reply\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new message should be formatted like so:\r\n\r\nOn Oct 6, 2014, at 10:10 AM, Barrack Obama <potus@whitehouse.gov> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Fridge didn’t break, just couldn’t get out of defrost mode for a long time since the door was ajar and it ran overtime trying to keep it cool (don’t want to see the electric bill).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new message has also quoted the leading Date/recipient text:\r\n\r\n> On Oct 6, 2014, at 10:10 AM, Barrack Obama <potus@whitehouse.gov> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Fridge didn’t break, just couldn’t get out of defrost mode for a long time since the door was ajar and it ran overtime trying to keep it cool (don’t want to see the electric bill).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.10 14A379A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMail on iOS has had this issue for a while, too. I'm guessing the change was to bring them into line, but it's semantically incorrect to make it appear that the date/recipient line was written by the recipient."
