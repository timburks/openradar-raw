    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you add a custom inputAccessoryView to the UIViewController, somehow the inputAccessoryView (or a subobject) holds a strong reference to the UIViewController that originated the call. This causes a retain cycle and the View Controller never gets released.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UINavigation based app\r\n2. Create a UIViewController on the second level of the stack.\r\n3. Assign a custom inputAccessoryView to the UIViewController\r\n> - (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder\r\n>{\r\n>    return YES;\r\n>}\r\n>\r\n>- (UIView *)inputAccessoryView\r\n>{\r\n>    return self.accessoryView;\r\n>}\r\n4. Run the app and navigate to that screen\r\n5. Navigate back, to pop the view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIViewController should get popped and dealloc after that.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not what happens. - dealloc is never called, and UIViewController remains in Memory.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, or Simulator 8.0\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
