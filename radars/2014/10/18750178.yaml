    description: "Summary:\r\nI've implemented a widget extension which is working with CoreData. Since any extension cannot access to host app sandbox i've placed my Persistent Store in AppGroup folder. After this both widget and host app correctly worked with data but later I've found that I lost all data after backing up and restoring all data from device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. setup your entitlements to work with app groups.\r\n2. add your core data persistent store to the app group folder.\r\n3. save some data to the persistent store, make sure that it saved on disk\r\n4. backup all your data via iTunes or iCloud standard backup.\r\n5. restore the backup created on step 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe data saved in app group folder would be restored\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe data saved in app group folder lost\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, iOS 8.0"
