    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring the iOS 8 beta, iCloud worked great in the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the iOS Simulator\r\n2. Go to Settings\r\n3. Tap on iCloud\r\n4. Enter a valid Apple ID and tap Sign In\r\n5.Agree to the Terms and Conditions\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be logged into iCloud at this point.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert is displayed:\r\n\r\n\"Device Not Supported: Your Apple ID is valid, but this iPhone is not qualified for iCloud.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, attempts to use CloudKit return a CKError:\r\n\r\n<CKError 0x7f84cb300eb0: \"Not Authenticated\" (9/1002); \"This request requires an authenticated account\"; Retry after 3.0 seconds>\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 (6A1042b) & OS X 10.10 (14A379a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis makes it impossible to test iCloud in the simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\nMy account has two factor authentication (2FA) turned on.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\nIt's possible to create a second Apple ID without 2FA turned on. But this creates a new problem: unwanted changes to data on your development Mac.\r\n\r\nWith iOS Simulator, changes to data caused by using the second Apple ID can be confined within the simulated environment.\r\n\r\nBut to test the Mac side of a cross-platform app, there is no way to confine the changes. You have to go into System Preferences on the Mac where you're running Xcode and setup the second Apple ID in the iCloud preference panel. At this point, all your contacts, calendars, photos, reminders, etc. either get removed or merged to a state where they're no longer useful.\r\n\r\nEssentially, your development machine can no longer contain any personal information. Most developers aren't lucky enough to have a separate machine for development, so there's a very real impact on productivity here."
