    description: "Summary:\r\nChoosing \"Cancel\" from the \"No Signing Identify Found\" pop up in Xcode does not actually cancel but seems to proceed as though you hit \"Fix Issue\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to build an iOS app for device without the proper signing identity\r\n2. Choose \"Cancel\" from the \"No Signing identity found\" pop up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build/automatic development signing identity should be cancelled\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode proceeds to fetch teams from the developer portal as if you hit \"Fix Issue\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1, OS X 10.9.5"
