    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever a new tag is added to a file the Finder consistently becomes unresponsive for a minute or longer. It always recovers and even when force quitting Finder the tag does get applied to the file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the tagging interface using by clicking the Finder's tagging icon.\r\n2. Type a new word (one that is not already a tag) in the popover that appears.\r\n3. Press enter or click outside the popover.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected behaviour would be of the file getting tagged and the Finder being responsive and useable immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe finder becomes unresponsive and displays the spinning beachball for minutes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 (13A603) to 10.10 (14A388a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe bug does happen on a completely fresh installation of Mavericks on either of my internal drives (tried both separately and also joined in their usual Fusion Drive configuration).\r\nThe bug does NOT occur when booting a fresh Mavericks installation on an external USB drive. \r\nMac Pro.spx - configuration file has been successfully uploaded"
