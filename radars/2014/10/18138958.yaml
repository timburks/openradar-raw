    description: "Summary:\r\nContrary to their claimed behavior (of nesting cleanly), in some situations Swift block comment markers can fail to successfully comment out code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a Swift playground, copy the following code:\r\n\r\nprintln(\"The basic operators are +-*/%\");\r\n\r\n2. Modify it so that it reads:\r\n\r\n/*\r\nprintln(\"The basic operators are +-*/%\");\r\n*/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter 2., the code is commented out without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode reports three errors:\r\n- \"Expected expression after unary operator\" on line 2\r\n- \"Unterminated string literal\" on line 2\r\n- \"Unexpected end of block comment\" on line 3\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0 (6A280e) (aka Xcode6 beta6)\r\nMac OS X 10.9.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen fixing this bug, make sure there is no regression for this code:\r\n\r\n/* I'd like to thank my family for introducing me to computers at an early age \":-) */\r\n\r\nwhich is currently processed as a comment without error. Good luck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, surprisingly, a workaround: adding a clever line before allows to create this:\r\n\r\n// /*\r\nprintln(\"The basic operators are +-*/%\");\r\n\r\nwhich can cleanly be commented out:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n// /*\r\nprintln(\"The basic operators are +-*/%\");\r\n*/\r\n\r\nHowever, it is hardly an elegant methodâ€¦\r\n\r\nC/C++/Objective-C has a similar issue, but it does not claim to always be able to comment out code using block comment markers, and has preprocessor directives (#if 0/#endif) to perform the job in that case; I do not know of such an alternative method in Swift.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
