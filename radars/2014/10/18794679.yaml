    description: "Summary:\r\nMobileSafari got a very useful feature — request desktop site — this year. It's great when a mobile version sucks, or when we get a phone-optimized website on an iPad.\r\n\r\nBut because a lot of websites don't have the mobile→desktop redirect mechanism when accessing from desktop, and because a lot of people share links (say, on Twitter) from their phones, this same feature would also be useful on the Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Share on Twitter some mobile site from a mobile device\r\n2. Open it on the Mac\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the site is smart, it redirects itself to desktop version. And if not, Safari provides a \"Request desktop site\" buttons somewhere.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnope.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nosx 10.10"
