    description: "Summary:\r\nEverytime I pull my iPhone 6+ out of my pocket, it is covered in dust, sometime so much that looks quite bad with the screen turned off and inhibits the quality of the screen when the screen is turned on. I have never experienced this with any other iOS or touchscreen device I have owned, and I have owned a lot of them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put iPhone6+ in pocket.\r\n2. Remove from pocket.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Put iPhone6+ in pocket.\r\n2. Remove from pocket.\r\n3. Use device without needing to remove dust.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Put iPhone6+ in pocket.\r\n2. Remove from pocket.\r\n3. Locate a microfiber cloth or use a shirt or pant leg to remove the dust.\r\n4. Repeat.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, iOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOverall this is a minor, but very persistent annoyance. I also worry that needing to wipe off the screen on a continual basis will cause small scratches over time on the front glass."
