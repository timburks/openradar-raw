    description: "COREVIDEO_SUPPORTS_METAL is defined only as #if TARGET_OS_IPHONE\r\n\r\n(which is not enough, since armv7/s devices do not support Metal).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  The build target is a real device and not the Simulator.\r\n\r\n2.  The linker flags include the “-ObjC” flag (this one is set by default in CocoaPods).\r\n\r\n3.  The code was compiled with SDK 8.0, and used by an app compiled for an earlier SDK (using XCode < 6.0).\r\n\r\nAll information about this is in:\r\nhttp://www.appsee.com/blog/dev/xcode-new-link-frameworks-automatically-fix-framework-not-found-metal-for-architecture-armv7\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/66\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2457\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nworking app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nld: framework not found Metal for architecture armv7"
