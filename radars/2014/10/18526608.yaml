    description: "When the user has enabled \"dark mode\" from System Preferences, most menu bar icons adapt to the new appearance by e.g. drawing as white instead of black in the menu bar.\r\n\r\nAppKit handles this appropriately for NSStatusItem-based menu items, but not for NSMenuItems.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this problem can be witnessed on a standard Yosemite install by observing the the Script menu for iTunes is not drawn correctly in dark mode:\r\n\r\n1. Arrange for one or more scripts to be present in ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts\r\n2. Open iTunes and see the script menu item is dark on dark.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching a sample project that illustrates the failure of a menu bar menu item to render its image appropriately in dark mode, in contrast to the NSStatusItem rendering the very same image as expected."
