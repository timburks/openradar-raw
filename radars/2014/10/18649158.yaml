    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing, we build and run constantly, and some of the settings that are set during first run are part of the tests, which prior to Xcode 6, one could just remove the app from the simulator (similar to how a user deletes an app from their device) and the app's data would be removed along with it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that now in Xcode 6, doing the above, does not remove an app's data, and when we constantly have to reset the simulator it's an extra step that resets other settings a user might not want to reset (like social account logins).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a single view application iOS application\r\n2. In the xib or storyboard for the view controller, create a simple button that when pressed, updates a value in the NSUserDefault standardUserDefaults dictionary, and then displays the value in a label that is visible in the said view controller's view.\r\n3. When you relaunch the app, the label should automatically display the value from the user dictionary.\r\n4. stop running the app, delete the app from simulator via long-press flow\r\n5. build and run the application again\r\n6. see value is displayed in label without having pressed the button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label value should be empty (or display \"(null)\" depending on how you coded it).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. see value is displayed in label without having pressed the button\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 6.0.1 (6A317)\r\nOS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
