    description: "Summary:\r\nThe contents of the clipboard sometimes do not persist when switching between applications. This appears to be a particular problem when the clipboard contents originate from Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select text in application A, e.g. Safari (from address bar, or page contents)\r\n2. Copy text\r\n3. Optionally, confirm that copy has taken place by overpasting the original text with the contents of the clipboard. This will always show that the text has been successfully copied.\r\n4. Switch to another application B.\r\n5. Select paste to enter contents of clipboard into application B\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text selected and copied into the clipboard in application A should be pasted into application B\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften, when pasting the clipboard contents into application B a previously-copied clipboard entry will be produced - not the text selected and copied from application A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.1 12B410\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen this occurs, it can usually be replicated repeatedly by iterating over the steps to reproduce. Force-quitting the applications does not appear to resolve the problem consistently.\r\n\r\nThis issue has persisted since at least iOS 8.0 beta 2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini gen 1 MD528B/A"
