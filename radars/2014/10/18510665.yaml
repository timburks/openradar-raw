    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen launching an app that displays a window that happens to hide the title and has a toolbar and has an autosave name, it will keep growing on the Y axis every time you launch the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Mac project\r\n2. In AppDelegate.m, set self.window.titleVisibility = NSWindowTitleHidden; in awakeFromNib\r\n3. Open MainMenu.XIB\r\n4. Set an autosave name for the window\r\n5. Drag a toolbar in the window\r\n6. Run the app and close it right away.\r\n7. Re-open the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window should be the same size as it was when the app was terminated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window has grown in the Y axis the same size as the title bar would be if it was visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10 GM Candidate 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nRun GrowingWindow project to see behaviour: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nfgrvcfiuphamq/GrowingWindow.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
