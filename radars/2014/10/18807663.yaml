    description: "Summary:\r\nMy goal is to notify user when special record is updated. Perhaps I'm interested in record with attributes firstName == John and lastName == Dow. For this I build CKSubscription with NSPredicate * sPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"firstName == %@ && lastName == %@\", @\"John\", @\"Dow\"];. After the subscription successfully saved in my database, I test it updating attribute \"age\" of record for John Dow. I never get notification though. But when I build and save my subscription with non-compound predicate like [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"firstName == %@\", @\"John\"]; or [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"lastName == %@\", @\"Dow\"]; then the notifications works fine to me. Since there is no proper documentation about the restrictions of Subscription's predicates, I have no idea what is wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create and save record on cloud with attributes age:int, firstName:string, lastName:string with values 20, John, Dow respectively.\r\n2. Create and save subscription with predicate [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"firstName == %@ && lastName == %@\", @\"John\", @\"Dow\"]; to get notified when John Dow's age is changed.\r\n3. Change John Dow's age (either in a Dashboard or from your app).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter age changed and record is saved the notification must be received.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification received.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5"
