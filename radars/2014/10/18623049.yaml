        Summary:
        When Apple TV is switched ON for a long time (3h+) for just receiving AirPlay streams the GUI will be broken after an undefined interval by showing NO video anymore OR the video is overlayed by all menus.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - switch Apple TV ON
        - stream what ever audio you want to it
        - take a look after 2/3+h by starting a video from the iTunes Store, Netflix, YouTube etc.

        Expected Results:
        - streaming audio should stop
        - video should start
        - all menus are invisible

        Actual Results:
        - streaming audio will stop
        case [1]: video starts, but without any pictures, just audio is available
        case [2]: video starts, everything is up (video & audio), but all Apple TV menus are overlayed

        Regression:
        I guess this happens since I updated to version 7.0
