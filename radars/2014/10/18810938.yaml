        Go to the Apps section then to Updates. Check for updates. Click on any available app to be updated.

        Expected Results:
        Version information and release notes should be displayed.

        Actual Results:
        Release notes are absent for all apps.

        Regression:
        This did work in iTunes 11.x

        iTunes 12 is an incredible step towards making iTunes even more unusable than it already way. Please completely cancel this crap once and for all.
