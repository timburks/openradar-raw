    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating a Swift object that inherits from NSObject and implements NSCoding can cause crashes when accessing properties on that object after it has been encoded\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n_Only occurs on device, not simulator_\r\n\r\n1. Create Swift class that inherits from NSObject, NSCoding\r\n2. Add Dictionary property [Int:Int]\r\n3. Implement NSCoding protocols, including the dictionary\r\n4. Use NSKeyedArchiver to write the object out\r\n5. Using the same instance, try to modify the contents of the dictionary property\r\n\r\nFull code for reproduction has been included in attached ZIP and is also posted here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/MichaelMcGuire/5fdc7aef84b35699dba4\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGet an EXC_BAD_ACCESS\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6.1 GM (6A1042b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on an iPhone 5s running iOS 8.0.2.  Does not occur in the simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'crashReproduction.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations10-Feb-2015 01:51 PM\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in the latest Xcode 6.3 beta, including iOS 8.3 SDK with Swift 1.2.\r\n\r\nPlease test with this release.  If you still have issues, please include any relevant logs or information that could help us investigate.\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-release version of the complete Xcode developer toolset for Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
