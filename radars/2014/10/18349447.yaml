    description: "Summary:\r\nAdd an SVG document using <object> or an <iframe> into HTML document. The SVG is not visible in the iOS8 UIWebView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Zip with Xcode projects to demonstrate are attached\r\n2: Take an iPhone with iOS7.1\r\n3: Compile and run UIWebviewSVGTest from the attached zip\r\n4: You will see a blue square in the app\r\n5: Switch to an iPhone with iOS8, build 12A365.\r\n6: Compile and run UIWebviewSVGTest\r\n7: There is no blue square on the screen. The screen is white.\r\n8: Now compile and run the WKWebview example \r\n9: The app will show a blue square\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBlue squares in all builds\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn SVG root element with height 0 when using the UIWebviewSVGTest on iOS8.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 12A365\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have tried multiple workarounds, like forcing some heights after page load, to get the engine to reflow and remeasure. This worked sometimes, but after a page reload, the script seized functioning (lay outing cache  interfering ??).\r\n\r\nIt's like the child document is not signaling the embedding element of it's sizing events correctly and then the layout gets cached. As can be seen the webkit web view does it correctly, and so does Safari iOS8.\r\n\r\nFor us internally, this is issue: https://jira.service2media.com/browse/AMBZNL-336\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 hardware and simulator."
