    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use the AVQueuePlayer to play a series of streamed m3u8 files in our app. Up until iOS 8.1 everything worked fine. Upon the release of 8.1 we had many users reporting the audio would stop after the initial track played and it would not skip to the next track. The user would have to stop and restart the audio to get the next track to play.\r\n\r\nIn testing we confirm the same situation. We use the [AVQueuePlayer advanceToNextItem] method to move to the next item, OR we simply rely on AVQueuePlayer's default functionality which automatically moves to the next item when a track completes. In neither case our audio is progressing now with iOS 8.1. I can confirm in the simulator as well.\r\n\r\nThe only case where it seems to still work is if we make the advanceToNextItem call within a few seconds of queuing the AVPlayerItem entities. However, if we wait just 3 to 5 seconds it no longer works.\r\n\r\nI surmised that perhaps the AVPlayerItems were somehow being deallocated but when I validate this when making the advanceToNextItem call the item we're advancing to is still there and the currentItem on the AVQueuePlayer updates to the next item without issue. Yet, in spite of all this it does not play.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the attached test app\r\n2. Let the first audio file play for 5 to 10 seconds\r\n3. Attempt to advance using the button shown\r\n4. Note that the audio player claims to have advanced but no audio is played and the playback position does not move per the notification I have set up to watch it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould expect the audio to advance and continue to play\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe audio player claims to have advanced but no audio is played and the playback position does not move per the notification I have set up to watch it\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 (12B411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch latest gen running iOS 8.1, Simulator running iOS 8.1"
