        When calling a Swift method, one writes it as:

        userNotificationCenter( foo, didDeliverNotification: bar)

        However, the declaration is

        optional func userNotificationCenter(center: NSUserNotificationCenter, didDeliverNotification notification: NSUserNotification)

        Note how the colon is in a different spot, kind of overloaded. It would be easier to remember this syntax if it was closer to the actual call syntax. I recommend just adding an additional colon after the label. The comma can be used to detect the end of a parameter in the case of the first parameter, to detect that it’s not a label here.

        Alternately, one could always have the additional comma, and permit ObjC-style “empty” parameters:

        optional func userNotificationCenter( : center: NSUserNotificationCenter, didDeliverNotification: notification: NSUserNotification)

        This would make it much more obvious what is a label, and what is a parameter name followed by a colon and a type.
