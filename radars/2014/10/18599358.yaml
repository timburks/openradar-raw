    description: in iOS8, when popping from a view controller WITHOUT a status bar to a view controller WITH a status bar, the navigation bar items after the pop are incorrect. those navigation bar items are instead the ones from the view controller before the one you just popped to, yet the view controller itself is correct. for example, lets say you have view controllers 1, 2, and 3, and you push them in that order. view controller 3 does not have a status bar, but view controller 2 does. when you pop view controller 3 off the stack, it will show view controller 1's navigation items (including title), yet the view controller 2's view is the one that is visible.
