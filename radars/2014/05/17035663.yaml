    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been rendering a UIWindow into an image. For that task, I build up a graphics context, configure its translation and rotation and call renderInContext. Sample code attached.\r\n\r\nThe generated image looks fine, but the shadow is wrongly rendered whenever the device is in landscape.\r\n\r\nIn the attached image, you notice that the white box in the top image (rendered image presented in Photoshop) has a top right shadow, whereas the simulator shows the shadow pointing to the right bottom (this is how it should be). The shadow offset of the layer is set to (2, 2). \r\n\r\nWhen I leave out the translation and rotation of the context, then the resulting shadow orientation is rendered correctly (but the remaining content is clipped).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project.\r\n2. Inspect the generated png\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRendered image looks like in the simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe shadow of the white box is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DropShadowSample.zip' and 'screenshot.png' were successfully uploaded."
