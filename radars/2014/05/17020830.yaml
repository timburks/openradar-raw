    description: "Summary:\r\nI recently ran into a very serious crasher-level failure with the sips tool after installing one of your Digital Camera Raw updates (rdar://17020383).\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, I would just download the update package and try reinstalling it to see if the 10.9.2 update somehow stomped on something.  Unfortunately, that attempt was stymied by an improperly configured package from Apple.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that my system has been dutifully installing Digital Camera RAW updates, and I've been using them with sips, I cannot install the manually downloaded Camera RAW package because it requires specific versions of iPhoto and Aperture, whereas my server has neither iPhoto nor Aperture installed.\r\n\r\nThis package should *not* have that dependency.  It might be okay to refuse to install the update if older versions that might break are installed, but it definitely should not refuse to install the update if *no* version is installed, as is the case here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Configure a computer without iPhoto or Aperture.\r\n2.  Try to manually install the latest Digital Camera Raw updater package.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to install.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt flipped me the bird.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
