    description: "Summary:\nWhen using the iOS Accessibility inspector and a field has a length longer than the panel is wide, the label wraps but does not push down the content below, causing it to become unreadable.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCreate a UIView subclass with an accessibilityLabel that is longer than ~30 characters, and then any hint/trait etc, the last section of the long line will be unreadable, as will any that are underneath.\n\nExpected Results:\nIt should push down the lower elements to avoid overlap. \n\nActual Results:\nThe fields overlapped\n\nRegression:\nAll iOS Simulator versions AFAIK\n\nNotes:"
