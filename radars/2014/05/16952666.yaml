    description: "On the root UIViewController, I'm using the AVPlayerLayer and a AVPlayer to load a file off the web to play a video. On the UI, the red \"reply\" button will push a new UIViewController onto the UINavigationController's stack to open the front-facing video camera (which uses the AVCaptureSession/AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer/AVCaptureMovieFileOutput/AVAssetExportSession) to create a video reply. After the recording, we push another UIViewController that uses the MPMoviePlayerController to play the video response, and then pops all the way back to the root UIViewController. Then back on the root VC, the AVPlayerLayer is vertically compressed.\r\n\r\nWhat fixes the issue is either a) going to the Home screen and re-entering the app or b) calling [AVPlayer replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem: nil] and then [AVPlayer replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem: originalPlayerItem] on viewWillDisappear viewDidAppear respectively.\r\n\r\nAttached are screenshots of what it should look like and what happens after multiple pushes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe AVPlayerLayer should fill its view and respect the aspect ratio of the video (look at the expected.PNG file)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe AVPlayerLayer is vertically compressed (look at the actual.PNG file)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1"
