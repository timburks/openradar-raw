    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI recently added a new machine running Mavericks to my Time Capsule.  To support it, I also had to add a new external disk.\r\n\r\nI have previously been using this Time Capsule with a mix of 10.8 and 10.9 machines, along with several USB 2.0 ioSafe drives attached through a GearHead USB hub.  The only difference now is that my new drive is their updated USB 3.0 version (an ioSafe Solo G3 3TB drive).\r\n\r\nAfter I added the new drive, my first backup went just fine.  But the very next day, the automatic backups failed, and I couldn't connect to the Time Capsule from any of my laptops.\r\n\r\nI rebooted the TC, and the manual backup almost immediately failed again.  I rebooted it a *second* time, and a manual backup worked.  Then the very next day, it was wedged again, and I couldn't connect to it.  Upon digging through the logs using an old copy of Airport Utility that actually lets me *SEE* the logs [redacted swearing], I saw that it refused to mount the volume because of some minor filesystem corruption.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the corruption (incorrect and/or nonexistent folder counts), the disk worked again... for one day.  Then, its AFP stack froze again, and I had to reboot the Time Capsule *again*.\r\n\r\nWhen it is wedged, the network routing works fine, but if I try to connect to *any* AFP share (not just the drive in question), it just sits there trying to connect.  I usually can't even get as far as a list of volumes.  My suspicion is that the new USB 3.0 version of this drive is tickling a bug in the Time Capsule's USB stack, and wedging something deep in the kernel.\r\n\r\nEither that or there's some sort of pervasive filesystem corruption going on somewhere.  Either way, there's something seriously bad going on, and I can't find any viable workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Connect an ioSafe G3 through a GearHead USB 2.0 hub.\r\n2.  Configure backups.\r\n3.  Wait a day or so for an automatic backup to fail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCurrent-generation (tower) Time Capsule.\r\n\r\nAttached drives:\r\n\r\nA.  One of 2 TB ioSafe external disk (reports as Hitachi HDS722020ALA330 A20N)\r\nB.  Two of 2 TB ioSafe external disk (reports as ST2000DL 003-9VT166)\r\nC.  One of 3 TB ioSafe Solo G3 external disk (reports as ioSafe G3 MX6O)\r\n\r\nAttached through (IIRC) a GearHead USB 2.0 hub, with an external power supply.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW, this is with Time Capsule firmware 7.7.3."
