    description: |-
        In the "Preview" pane of the print dialog, there are two options: Scale (custom percentage), and Scale to fit, the latter of which has Print entire image and Fill entire paper.

        I think there should be an additional option, "Print at 100%". I know it can be accomplished by choosing Scale and typing 100% in the box, but it's such a common case that I think it deserves its own radio button.
