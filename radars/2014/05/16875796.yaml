    description: "Description:\r\n--\r\nWhen you configure a UITextView as textView.editable = NO, you do not receive a UIKeyboardWillShowNotification when long tapping the textView for copy & pasting. But if you also set a inputAccessoryView on the readonly textView, the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification is fired whenever you long tap the textView.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n--\r\nI have created a sample project to reproduce this behaviour. You just need to long tap the UITextView. The sample code is available here: https://github.com/plu/TextViewKeyboardTest\r\n\r\nYou can also exchange the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification with UIKeyboardDidShowNotification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n--\r\nI'd expect the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification not to fire if the keyboard will not show up at all. Especially I do not expect the UIKeyboardDidShowNotification to fire if there's not keyboard visible at all."
