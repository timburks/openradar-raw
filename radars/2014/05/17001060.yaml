    description: "We, developers, have in iOS 7 the possibility to embed custom fonts in our apps. Doing so only requires the `.ttf` files to be copied in the app bundle and their names to be added in the `-Info.plist` file, under the `UIAppFonts` key. The system should then automatically load them and they should be available for use through the `UIFont` API. To my knowledge, no limit in the number of custom fonts that an app can embed is documented.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that when an app embeds too many of those it becomes highly unstable and crashes eventually (a crash report from the attached test app `FontOverflow` is attached to this issue).\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, not all custom fonts are loaded by the system, which then tries to use the fallback font `LastResort`. Unfortunately the latter is not yet included in iOS 7, producing a lot of error logs:\r\n\r\n> 2014-05-22 10:34:41.703 FontOverflow[4457:60b] Critical failure: the LastResort font is unavailable.\r\n\r\nThen, after a few seconds the app crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nA simple test app `FontOverflow` is attached so you can easily reproduce the bug. It embeds around 100 custom fonts and displays a mere UILabel view; every .1 second a new random string, text font and text color are applied to the label.\r\n\r\n1. Open the project in Xcode\r\n2. Run on a device (iPhone)\r\n3. The app crashes after a few seconds\r\n\r\nA crash report is also attached to this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should display random fonts, strings and colours without crashing.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe refresh frequency is lower than it should be â€“ because some fonts are missing.\r\n\r\nThe app crashes after a few seconds."
