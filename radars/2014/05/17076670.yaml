    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the JavaScriptCore framework and a deployment target below iOS 7 gets your app rejected during App Store validation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Link the JavaScriptCore framework to your app\r\n2. Set your appâ€™s deployment target to iOS 6.0 (or anything else below 7.0)\r\n3. Submit your app to the App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour app passes validation since it doesn't violate any rule regarding non-public APIs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYour app is rejected with this error during App Store validation:\r\n\"The app links to non-public libraries in Payload/MyApp.app/MyApp: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/JavaScriptCore\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe JavaScriptCore framework forces linking to PrivateFrameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework when targeting iOS below version 7. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23514579/javascriptcore-framework-availability-on-ios/23514580#23514580 for a detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nGreg Parker (engineer at Apple) said about this issue on Twitter (http://twitter.com/gparker/status/471722157295140864):\r\n\"Either the store policy should be changed to allow it or the SDK should be changed to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nThe JavaScriptCore C API has been stable for a long time so linking to a version of the JavaScriptCore framework which is inside PrivateFrameworks is not an issue.\r\n\r\nPlease update the App Store policy to accept apps linking to PrivateFrameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNot applicable"
