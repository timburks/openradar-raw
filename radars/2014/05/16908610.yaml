    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, any time I open a XIB on a new version of OS X, the underlying XML is modified and the systemVersion attribute of the <document> node, as well as other attributes within the document are updated regardless of whether other changes are made to the XIB. \r\n\r\nThis interferes with version control and makes merging changes to XIBs more difficult than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a XIB document on a new OS X release\r\n2. Note that the <document> node's systemVersion attribute has been updated, as well as other nodes such as the <plugin> nodes within <dependencies>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I make a change and save it, I expect those values to change. \r\n\r\nIf I do not make any changes to the XIB, I expect these values to remain as they are on disk.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe values are updated regardless of whether I change anything."
