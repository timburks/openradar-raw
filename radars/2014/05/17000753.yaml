    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an iOS-user gets invited to some events of a series he is not generally invited to, these single events are not synchronised to the iOS devices by ActiveSync from Exchange.  This does especially happen to occurrences which the user accepts outside the iOS device e.g. within Outlook.\r\nThe Outlook calendar does handle the affected events correctly, though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a series event (e.g. a monthly recurring event on every 10th of each month) where the iOS user in no participant. \r\n2. Now modify single occurrences of the series by inviting the iOS-user as a additional guest.\r\n3. The iOS-user should now accept the invitations via Outlook.\r\n\r\nThe events don't show up on the iOS devices reliably. The issue gets worse, if the ActiveSync account does use fetch instead of push for synchronization.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll events should by fully synchronous on iOS devices and Exchange/Outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome accepted occurences never show up on the iOS devices of the user. Even if you enfoce a full re-syhcronization, these events keep missing on iOS."
