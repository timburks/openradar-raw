    description: "Summary:\r\nArticle HT1379 http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379 says clearly 'OS X does not store network settings in NVRAM / PRAM. If you are troubleshooting a network issue, resetting it will not help.'\r\n\r\nStarting with OS X 10.7 Wi-Fi passwords seem to be stored in NVRAM and can be removed accordingly by resetting NVRAM. Users who follow HT1379 will be lead in the wrong direction. The documentation should be adjusted to clarfify the relationship between NVRAM and storage of Wi-Fi passwords.\r\n\r\nThe real problem occurs when Wi-Fi passwords change an the WAP. When waking a Mac from sleep it won't automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi. Only resetting NVRAM will solve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) On OS X 10.7 or above configure Wi-Fi access and store the password in keychain\r\n2) boot the first time into 'Recovery HD' and find yourself connected with this Wi-Fi\r\n3) reset NVRAM\r\n4) try again step 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nResetting NVRAM won't change anything\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nResetting NVRAM will erase the Wi-Fi password and solve Wi-Fi-reconnection problems after wakeup from sleep\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHT1379 About NVRAM and PRAM\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is outlined here in detail https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4100904"
