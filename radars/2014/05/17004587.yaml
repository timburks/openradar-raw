    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://16998102\n\nIt appears it is impossible to replicate nested versions of the \"page sheet\" native modal style using custom transitioning; upon dismissal of the nested view controller, the first modal is set by the system to frame origin (0, 0) and there is no recourse to fix this until -animateTransition: is reached at least one runloop tick later, after the screen has already been updated.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Present a view controller modally using a custom animation, such that the result is similar to a sheet.\n2. Present a second view controller modally from that first modal view controller.\n3. Dismiss the second view controller. \n4. Note the first modal view is now in the wrong place.\n\nExpected Results: The SDK does not reset the origin of a view of a presenting view controller that is itself modal while dismissing a presented modal view controller. Actual Results: The SDK resets the origin of a view of a presenting view controller that is itself modal while dismissing a presented modal view controller. Notes: DTS indicates that they don't have a workaround other than to fix the position of the view controller's view in -animateTransition:, which is indicated above as not being a workable fix.\n\nActual Results: The SDK resets the origin of a view of a presenting view controller that is itself modal while dismissing a presented modal view controller."
