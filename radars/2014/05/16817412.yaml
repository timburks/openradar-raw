    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you click an anchor link to a documentation page (only when the link is not on a documentation page), the resulting page scroll is in the wrong position, so the section title is occluded by the Apple developer library page header bars.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Generate a documentation anchor link as described in rdar://16817062. An example link would be https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIBezierPath/addQuadCurveToPoint:controlPoint:\r\n2. Click this link.\r\n3. The page will load, but it will be scrolled to the top instead of to the section referenced by the # anchor in the URL.\r\n4. Type Command-L to select the address bar in most browsers.\r\n5. Press Return to load the page again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page scrolls such that the thing that is visible at the top of the page is the title of the method or property being documented. In the example provided, it would be the <h3>addQuadCurveToPoint:controlPoint:</h3>.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page scrolls too far. Presumably, the <h3> is at the very top of the window, but because the Apple developer docs have about 190 px of top bars that overlap the content, the first part of the actual documentation that is visible is the <h5>parameters</h5>. The method name, abstract, and method declaration are all hidden behind the top header bars of the page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nUIBezierPath Class Reference\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIBezierPath/addQuadCurveToPoint:controlPoint:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis bug is not specific to the documentation page I have used as a sample. It happens with all pages, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nIt happens only when clicking a link from an external page. If you go to https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIBezierPath_class/Reference/Reference.html, scroll to the Tasks section, and click the link to addQuadCurveToPoint:controlPoint:, it scrolls to the right location, with the title, abstract, and method declaration visible.\r\n\r\nSafari 7.0.3 (9537.75.14)\r\nChrome 34.0.1847.131\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/VMnE"
