        The documentation for the `region` parameter says:

        “The region whose state you want to know. This object must be an instance of one of the standard region subclasses provided by Map Kit. You cannot use this method to determine the state of custom regions you define yourself.”

        It it not clear to me (or some others I’ve talked to) what a “standard region subclass” is.  At first glance I thought this meant it excluded CLBeaconRegion.  Some clarification on this (or a concrete list of the supported types) would be a welcome addition.
