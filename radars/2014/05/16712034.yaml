    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have noticed that if the user tries to restore purchases on a device that does not have an Apple ID signed in to it, iOS present the same \"Use Existing Apple ID\" and \"Create Apple ID\" options that you see in the App Store. This is potential confusing for users, and needless as the user would obviously have an Apple ID already if they are trying to restore purchases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure iOS device is signed out of iTunes & App Store in settings\r\n2. Open a Newsstand app\r\n3. Try to restore purchases\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn alert view should pop up with username and password fields for the user to enter their Apple ID\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn option to sign in with and existing Apple ID and to create an Apple ID should appear in an alert view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAt least iOS 6 and up\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on all iOS devices"
