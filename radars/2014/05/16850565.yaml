    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 7, if a table has tallish rows, the search bar is out of view, and the last row that makes the table scroll is deleted, the area for the search bar comes into view, but the search bar itself is missing. It's a little hard to explain so I've attached a videoâ€”it's very easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with a UITableViewController. The attached sample app uses the \"Master-Detail Application\" template.\r\n2. Add a search bar to the template.\r\n3. Make the row heights taller. anywhere from 60 to 100 points seems to work fine for me. I'm guessing it just needs to be taller than the search bar.\r\n4. Run the app.\r\n5. Add enough cells to the table so that it starts to scroll.\r\n6. Make sure the search bar is off the screen. Either the first table cell or the last one should be partially, but not entirely visible.\r\n7. Delete a row.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe area containing the search bar should either not come into view, or it should come into view and the search bar should be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe table scrolls is a kind of awkward way, so that the last table cell is at the very bottom of the screen. That means the search bar area is now partially on screen, but the search bar itself is not drawn. If the attached sample app, I've made the table background blue to better illustrate this: you can see blue where the search bar should be."
