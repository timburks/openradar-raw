    description: "Summary:\nXcodeâ€™s image and asset views have a light background which hides white or light images.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Import a .png that is white to an asset catalog. \n2. Look at the image set.\n\nExpected Results:\nI should see either:\nA - the white image, on a darker background (perhaps auto-detected by Xcode), or\nB - the option to change the asset catalog background. This could be in the asset catalog or in Xcode preferences. It needs to be available also when I select a single image or resource in the file navigator.\n\nActual Results:\nI see just a white background and nothing. The only indication that there is even an image loaded is the lack of dotted lines.\n\nRegression:\nThis has been a problem since at least Xcode 4, and probably earlier.\n\nNotes:\nScreenshot: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s197/sh/117dafa8-c35d-484b-bc85-9356da8abb79/bf1ee580065e1a8e869bceb07252e358"
