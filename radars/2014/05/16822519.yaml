    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIButton's enabled property is programmatically changed while also its titleLabel is changed, then during a touch on the button the titleLabel will change back to what it was in the disabled state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached app.\r\n2. Wait for the button in the center to become enabled and read \"Enabled\"\r\n3. Long tap the button. Note that the button's titleLabel changed to \"Disabled\" and the button is still enabled. Also note that the change happened before the touch was lifted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button's titleLabel should still show \"Enabled\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button's titleLabel shows \"Disabled\". It changed during the touch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1, 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ButtonTouchBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.
