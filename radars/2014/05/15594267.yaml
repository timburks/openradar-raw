    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://15585565\r\n\r\nWhen the UINavigationBar back button item title \"Latest\" is animated during a push transition, it \"jitters\" by one pixel as it comes to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Create a blank iOS project with a storyboard (storyboard not required to recreate bug, but faster to reproduce)\r\n\r\n2. Add a navigation controller with a table view controller as root\r\n\r\n3. Set the title of the table view controller to \"Latest\"\r\n\r\n4. Add a static cell to the UITableView with a push segue to a new view controller\r\n\r\n5. Run the project, click on the static cell, and the jitter is visible during the final frames of the animation in the back button item.\r\n\r\n6. Using the iOS simulator, turn on slow animations and it is also visible there."
