        Summary:
        The method +[NSParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] returns an NSParagraphStyle. It should return instancetype instead for consistence.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add this code to a new project: NSMutableParagraphStyle *paragraphStyle = [NSMutableParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle];

        Expected Results:
        - to get an NSMutableParagraphStyle instance initialized with the default paragraph style.
        - be able to change values to my liking

        Actual Results:
        - you get a compiler warning about incompatible pointer types
        - an NSParagraphStyle is returned
        - trying to assign a value to a property produces an exception

        Notes:
        This should work consistently with other classes where you have an immutable version and a mutable version being a subclass of it. e.g. NSArray and NSMutableArray. There you can use [NSArray array] and [NSMutableArray array] and get the correct class.
