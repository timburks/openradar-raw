    description: "Summary:\r\nSending a push notification with the \"content-available\" tag is supposed to wake up the app in the background and call \"application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler\". It works well on iOS 7.0.6, but not on iOS 7.1.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty iOS application project. Launching it should display a plain white view.\r\n2. Ask for push permissions when the app starts, and print the push token in the console.\r\n3. In the target settings (Capabilities -> Background Modes) enable \"Remote notifications\".\r\n4. In AppDelegate, implement \"application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler\". Make it change the window's background color to red and NSLog(\"Application did receive remote notification\").\r\n5. Run the app from Xcode (Product -> Run).\r\n6. Close the app from Xcode (Product -> Stop).\r\n7. Double press the Home button: the multitasking screenshot of the app shows a plain white view.\r\n8. With a program such as nomad-cli (http://nomad-cli.com/), send a push notification to your device with the \"content-available\" tag (option -n with nomad-cli): the push notification should appear on the Home screen.\r\n9. Double press the Home button and check the color of the multitasking screenshot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the app was launched in the background and \"application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler\" was called, the multitasking screenshot should be red. Moreover, the console logs in the Xcode Organizer should display \"Application did receive remote notification\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 7.0.6, the multitasking screenshot is indeed red. Moreover, the console logs in the Xcode Organizer display the following logs:\r\n\r\nMay 30 16:50:14 iPad kernel[0] <Debug>: launchd[266] Container: /private/var/mobile/Applications/47E7DA84-E83A-4B43-B550-7D203921BD49 (sandbox)\r\nMay 30 16:50:14 iPad Test[266] <Warning>: Application did receive remote notification\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn iOS 7.1.1, the multitasking screenshot stays white, and the console logs in the Xcode Organizer don't display anything.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5: iOS 7.1.1 [11D201]. iPad 2: iOS 7.0.6 [11B651].\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 32GB AT&T, using WiFi. iPad 2 16GB, using WiFi."
