    description: "Summary:\r\nOthers have hit a roadblock with the same issue that I am having on my MacBookPro11,2: VGA at 1600x1200 fails with certain displays. In my case, a Dell UltraSharp 1600x1200 display. I cannot use DVI as DVI is required by another device connected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a MacBookPro11,2 to various UXGA monitors that previously worked over VGA on earlier MacBook DisplayPort systems.\r\n2. Attempt to set the resolution to 1600x1200.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay System Preferences should show 1600x1200.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem Preferences only displays odd resolutions such as 1344x1008.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2/13C64\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCannot isolate if this is a hardware bug, video BIOS issue, or an Intel GT3 graphics driver issue. Filed as OS X bug but this may in fact be a bug with Iris and Iris Pro Mac hardware/firmware.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro11,2 using both Apple's mini-DP to VGA adapter and third party adapters. Confirmed affected displays work fine over VGA on Mavericks with pre-Iris MacBook models using the same cables and adapters."
