    description: "Summary:\r\nThe vast majority of the bug reports that anybody files through this system are likely to be known issues. These bug reports should get closed with their status set to 'DUPLICATE' - which they do. However, when a bug is closed as a duplicate, there is no easy way for any of the reporters who filed a duplicate to find out the status of the original bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Find a bug\r\n2) File it on bugreport.apple.com\r\n3) Wait a few hours\r\n4) Watch it get closed as a duplicate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the bug gets closed as a duplicate, I expect to be able to find out things like \"Is the original bug fixed yet?\" easily, without having to email anyone and wait for them to personally inform me.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe process is so frustrating that I'm considering not reporting any more bugs to Apple ever again."
