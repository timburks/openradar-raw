    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://14221477\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new Bot, I should be able to add pre/post build actions and run my own scripts. The kinds of scripts I'm talking about are loading CocoaPods (which changes the contents of a workspace, so as a pre-build action is fragile), generating test output in a machine-friendly format, and uploading the created .ipa to a distribution service like HockeyApp or TestFlight to name just a few. The current workflow my team uses to create apps relies heavily on Jenkins CI and we'd like to switch to Xcode Server in the future.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to do something before/after a build without pre/post build actions set in the scheme. You can't.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to add build steps to a Bot, and decide what order they occur in. I should not have to use schemes to achieve this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScripts need to be added to pre/post build actions in the scheme.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSchemes are great, but they really aren't made for the kind of things that need to be done when running CI and CD (Continuous Deployment).\r\n\r\nI’m using scheme actions as a workaround, but the big limitation they have is that if something fails in that pre-action, it won’t fail the bot run."
