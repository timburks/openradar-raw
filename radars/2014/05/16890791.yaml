    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a universal binary version of an app (armv7, armv7s, arm64) running on a 64-bit device (iPhone 5s), where only a cellular connection (LTE) is available and the user has specified Settings > Cellular > Use Cellular Data For to be off for the app; network requests will still succeed, no alert is presented to the user, and reachability API results indicate that the network/WAN are reachable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iPhone 5s.\r\n2. Launch Xcode.\r\n3. Open a project which makes network requests (e.g., NSURLSession) at startup.\r\n4. Select Project, Build Settings. Make sure \"Architectures\" and \"Valid Architectures\" are set to include armv7, armv7s, arm64. Set \"Build Active Architecture Only\" to Yes for Debug configuration, No for Release configuration. \r\n5. Edit Scheme, set Build Configuration for Run to Debug.\r\n6. Run the app on the device.\r\n7. Quit the app.\r\n8. On device: Settings > Cellular >Use Cellular Data For: - find the app in the list, turn the switch to off.\r\n9. Disable WiFi on the device.\r\n10. Run the app again. Should receive an alert that cellular data is turned off for the app.\r\n11. Quit the app.\r\n12. Edit Scheme, set Build Configuration for Run to Release.\r\n13. Build and run the app on the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNetwork requests should not succeed and the \"cellular data is turned off\" alert should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNetwork requests succeed, no alert is presented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.1.1 (11D201)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor testing, I used the Reachability sample project from Apple and added code to -[APLViewController viewDidLoad] to use an NSURLSession to request data from the URL \"http://www.apple.com/\".\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s (Model A1453, A1533), 16 GB"
