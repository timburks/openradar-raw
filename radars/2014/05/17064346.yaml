    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a test app on the iOS simulator as well as on an iPhone 5S the CLLocationManager doesn't seem to fire didExitRegion callbacks in an expected way. Regardless of the radius of the circular region being monitored, the callback won't happen until a threshold of around 5000 meters is hit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached app\r\n2. Start region tracking by selecting Debug -> Location -> Freeway Drive in the iOS simulator\r\n3. Monitor the app. The large # indicates the distance from the center of the watched region.\r\n4. After about 190 seconds and 5300 meters didExitRegion will finally fire.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe didExitRegion callback should fire shortly after the device has left the region being monitored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe didExitRegion callback only happens after the distance from the region is much larger than the configured threshold.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator; iPhone 5s"
