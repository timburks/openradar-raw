        Summary:
        I have a station that I set up yesterday. It played four songs, but now refuses to play anything.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select the station.
        2. Press “Play”.
        3. Wait for buffering.

        Expected Results:
        The station begins playing songs according to the station’s configuration.

        Actual Results:
        Nothing plays.

        Regression:
        I only have access to iTunes 11.1.5 at this time.

        Notes:
        I have yet to stumble on any workaround. Here is a the link copied form the sharing button in iTunes:
