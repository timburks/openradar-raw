        If you register to be notified if you are inside or outside of a CLCircularRegion this is difficult to test because the simulator does presently not support updating region state by setting the simulated location.

        I propose to also have CLLocationManager send the locationManager:didDetermineState:forRegion: on simulator consistently when simulating various locations through the simulator Debug - Location menu.

        This would be extremely helpful for developers to test region monitor functionality. At present the only way to really test their implementation is to choose a small radius around the developerâ€™s office and then walk outside of this radius with a physical device.

        By the same token, you cannot unit-test region-monitoring code in an automated fashion.
