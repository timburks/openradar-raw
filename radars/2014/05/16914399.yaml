    description: "Summary:\r\nFor developers who use screenshots frequently and prefer not to clutter their desktops, it would be very helpful to be able to change the location that screenshots created via File > Save Screen Shot in the iOS Simulator are saved from the desktop to an arbitrary folder in the filesystem.\r\n\r\nThis is possible to achieve with standard Mac OS X screenshots using a defaults write command, but not so with the iOS Simulator to my knowledge. Please provide and/or publicize a property list key that can be used for this purpose, or better yet provide a setting for this in Xcode's preferences window.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAs far as I know, there is no way to achieve this as of iOS Simulator Version 7.1 (463.9.41)."
