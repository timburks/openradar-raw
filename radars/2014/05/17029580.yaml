    description: "Summary:\r\ntaskIdentifiers on an NSURLSessionDataTask should be unique per NSURLSession, as the documentation states. The attached projects demonstrates an issue where tasks that are created concurrently can end up with the same taskIdentifier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Dispatch 100 data tasks on the default priority queue.\r\n2. Monitor the taskIdentifiers returned by the task.\r\n3. Observe that they are occasionally the same â€” likely, since the queue is concurrent, this is when two tasks end up getting created on different threads around the same time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTask Identifiers should be unique per NSURLSession, as the documentation states.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTask Identifiers are not always unique. The popular AFNetworking framework depends on this uniqueness, and can end up calling incorrect completionHandlers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached an example project which recreates the issue reliably.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRecreates easiest on the simulator, but I have done it on the device too.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'taskIdentifierNope.zip' was successfully uploaded."
