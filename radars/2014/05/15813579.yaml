    description: "Steve Harris\r\n14-Jan-2014 01:17 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an NSTextView is showing the find bar with incremental searching enabled so that the content view is dimmed, removing that view from the window results in a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a text view to a window that uses the find bar with incremental search enabled\r\n2. Manually find some text in that view so that the content is dimmed\r\n3. Remove that view from the window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view is removed without the app crashing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1/13B42\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a test project to recreate it. There is a workaround that isn't entirely satisfactory, which is to manually hide the find bar before removing the text view from the window. Look at the -switchView: action in the app delegate. It's not entirely satisfactory in that the overlay remains on screen even after the underlying text view has been removed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI did not receive any reports of this issue before OS X 10.9.1, but I cannot be sure it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Find Overlay Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
