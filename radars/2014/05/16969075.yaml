    description: "Summary:\r\nNetwork Link Conditioner is a useful tool for keeping my server from completely killing my Internet connection due to buffer bloat.  There's only one problem: When I enable it, connections to my server from my internal network slow to a crawl, because they're impacted by the same limits as outbound traffic.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely useful for NLC to provide a few more configuration options.  Ideally, it would have a table like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nInterface     Enabled    Ignore Local Traffic\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nen0                  [X]                  [X]\r\nen1                  [ ]                  [ ]\r\n\r\nWhere you could enable or disable conditioning on a per-interface basis, and also disable conditioning for local traffic (traffic to the same subnet as the interface in question).  This relatively small change would make this tool immeasurably more useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHardware IO Tools for Xcode October 2013\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
