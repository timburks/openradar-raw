        Summary:
        If you remove a region from being monitored by CLLocationManager and immediately try to re-add a new one to monitoring it will fail with error code 5.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Launch an app that is already monitoring for a CLCircularRegion
        - Remove this region from monitoring with stopMonitoringForRegion:
        - Add a new region to be monitored immediately followed by a requestStateForRegion:

        Expected Results:
        - The new region should be added to the monitored regions
        - requesting a state update right after adding it should just work
        - the state update should return with state inside or outside once that has been determined by CoreLocation.

        Actual Results:
        - The monitoring fails calling the monitoringDidFailForRegion:withError: passing error code 5
        - didDetermineState:forRegion: is never called

        Notes:
        As a workaround you can execute the state update request at least 1/10th sec later. Then the expected results occur.
