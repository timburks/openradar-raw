    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the Avenir Next font supplied with iOS as the custom font for a UISegmentedControl via -setTitleTextAttributes:forState:, the alignment of the title text is off center.\r\n\r\nThis should not be the case for a font that ships with the device, it is not reasonable to have to maintain a list of kludges to apply on a per font basis, not when the font in question was supplied by Apple :)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see the attached sample project that demonstrates this issue.\r\n\r\nIt occurs when using UISegmentedControl -setTitleTextAttributes:forState: to change the custom font used by the control to Avenir Next.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the title text to be vertically centered within the UISegmentedControl.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe title text is not vertically centered within the UISegmentedControl, and requires fudging to align.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1/11D167\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to use  -setContentPositionAdjustment:forSegmentType:barMetrics: as a kludge for Avenir Next."
