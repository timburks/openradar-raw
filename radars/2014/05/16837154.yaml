    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the update is issued to the app, its cart on the App Store shows \"No Ratings\" until at least 5 new ratings are submitted. So, even when the app is old and has many ratings it seems like it doesn't have any.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe average from all ratings should be shown before 5 new ratings are submitted for the new version."
