    description: "Summary:\r\nDownload a .icns file with Safari. Its preview in the Dock will (sometimes) have a weird double preview effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the Dock to appear on the bottom of the screen, disable auto-hiding, and set the Downloads folder to sort by Date Added and display as Stack.\r\n2. Click this link to download the .icns file of the QuickTime Player icon, which I uploaded directly from the app bundle: http://cl.ly/VNmy/download/QuickTimePlayerX.icns\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preview in the Dock will show the newly downloaded icon, and visible behind the icon will be whatever else was in the Downloads folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe preview in the Dock shows the QuickTime Player icon, but behind it there is clearly visible a copy of the same icon, slightly smaller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.2 (13C1021)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have reproduced this on multiple computers running 10.9.2. Running Killall Dock seems to fix the problem, but if I delete the icon and re-download it, sometimes the effect is back.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreen recording: http://cl.ly/VNcB"
