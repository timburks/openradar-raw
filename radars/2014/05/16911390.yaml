    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a solid black area is displayed on the screen, there are often artifacts that appear in the area. The artifacts are streaks of pale (white?) color, that appear and disappear in a fraction of a second. They only appear when the background color is black; they do not appear (or at least, I haven't noticed them) when the background is any other color.\r\n\r\nThe artifacts appear in a variety of applications :\r\n- When viewing video from the Netflix web site, in the black bands above and below the image.\r\n- In a Safari web page with a black background\r\n- In a Parallels Desktop VM running Windows with a black Desktop color.\r\n- In iPhoto, when it's displaying an image with a large black area.\r\n- In Capture, when it's displaying a screen grab with a large black area.\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to create a screen grab of an affected area of the screen, the artifacts do not appear in the captured image, although I can see them on the screen! This is the reason I've entered this as a hardware problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a configuration like mine (see below)\r\n2. Use the computer normally, including letting it go to sleep and wake up again.\r\n\r\nSorry I can't be more specific!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe artifacts should never appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe artifacts appear... sometimes!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n- Mac Pro : A1481\r\n- 30\" Cinema Display : A1083\r\n- OS X 10.9.2\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have only observed this behaviour on a single computer, a new Mac Pro connected to a circa 2006 30\" Apple Cinema Display (see hardware details below).\r\n\r\nThe artifacts do not always appear. However, they appear very often. I see them once a day at the very least. Once they appear in one application, they appear in all applications that happen to display a large black area.\r\n\r\nHardware setup :\r\n- Late 2013 Mac Pro 16 GB RAM, D500, 1 TB storage\r\n- Apple 30\" Cinema Display (~2006)\r\n- Mini Display Port to Dual-link DVI adapter between display and computer\r\n- Apple wireless keyboard (KY54000VAPMHC)\r\n- Apple magic trackpad"
