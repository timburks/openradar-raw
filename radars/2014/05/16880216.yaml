    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Mavericks, the low battery warning for bluetooth keyboards went from being mostly ignorable to being the biggest pain in the ass that I've seen outside a Windows box.  Please, please, tone down the frequency of these alerts by at least an entire order of magnitude, if not two.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Connect an Apple Bluetooth keyboard to a machine.\r\n2.  Watch an Amazon Prime video or YouTube video.\r\n3.  Note that the notification appears as soon as you leave full-screen mode... almost every time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to me notified no more than once per day until the batteries become \"critically low\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I expected to be able to disable keyboard and trackpad battery notifications in the Notifications System Preferences pane.  However, there appears to be no mechanism for disabling any notifications that come from the operating system itself (as opposed to an app).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
