    description: "When using the custom navigation transition animations intro'd in iOS 7 (UIViewControllerContextTransitioning, et al) and transitioning from a view controller which doesn't hide its nav bar to a view controller that does hide its nav bar, it seems impossible to hide the nav bar on the 2nd view controller before showing it. The result is that momentarily a black bar is visible where the nav bar would be and then the whole view shifts up.\r\n\r\nI've tried hiding the nav bar as early as possible, as early as the outgoing view's viewWillDisappear method.\r\n\r\nI'm specifically seeing this on pop. I haven't tried it on push."
