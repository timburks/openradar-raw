    description: "Summary:\r\nWe've set up a custom URL scheme for an app (pugpigreader://) we get inconsistent behaviour when these links are opened in mobile Safari. We've replicated it with other custom URL schemes, such as sms://.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a brand new tab, hit return, and it works\r\n2. Return to same tab, paste in again and retry\r\n3. Modal dialogue 'Open this page in \"[APP NAME\"]?' appears\r\n4. Tap open, dialogue dismisses but no action\r\n5. Remain in same tab and paste URL again, hit return and app successfully launches\r\n6. Cycles repeats until device is restarted\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should open every time URL entered in safari\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIntermittent results - see steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0 (11A465)"
