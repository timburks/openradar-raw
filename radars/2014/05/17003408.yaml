        Summary:
        If you have an app emit an iBeacon as well as ranging might fail with CLError code 16.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Emit a beacon in an app via CBPeripheral
        - Range it via CLLocationManager

        Expected Results:
        - locationManager:didRangeBeacons:inRegion: should show this beacon

        Actual Results:
        - sometimes it works
        - sometimes you get locationManager:rangingBeaconsDidFailForRegion:withError: with code 16 “unavailable”.

        Regression:
        I had this happen just now on an iPad Air and iPhone 5S, both running iOS 7.1.1. When I rebooted both the error no longer occurred.

        Notes:
        In my testing I used separate apps on same device. i.e. start emitter app, then launch ranging app via Xcode. I am aware that beacon emitting is paused with the emitter app in background after a few seconds. Still ranging should not fail but return an empty array.

        Supposedly earlier rdar://16761196 and rdar://15693657 describe the same issue.
