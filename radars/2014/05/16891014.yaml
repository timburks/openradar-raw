    description: "Summary:\nThe only way to get code snippets to auto-complete inside class interface extensions (in .m files) is to set completion scope to \"all\". If I set completion scope to \"Class Interface Methods\" then the code snippet does not autocomplete inside @interface declarations unless they are in a .h file.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Add a code snippet. Perhaps for \"@property (nonatomic) <#var#>;\"\n (I often do this by dragging from actual code into snippet library, then modifying as needed.)\n2. Set Platform -> All and Language -> Objective-C.\n3. Give a completion shortcut (\"ppp\" or something unique)\n4. Select completion scope of \"Class Interface Methods\". \n5. Click 'Done'.\n6. Go to .m file and add a @interface section (like \"@interface BNRRegionDrawingTool ()\n\n@end\"\n7. In the middle, start typing your shortcut. \n8. Note that autocomplete does NOT show the snippet. \n9. Try all other completion scopes for your snippet. Note that the only one that works is \"all\". \n\nExpected Results:\nClass Interface Method snippets should autocomplete inside any @interface section, including inside .m files. \n\nActual Results:\nThe code snippet does not autocomplete."
