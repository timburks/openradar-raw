    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIInputView documentation states that the view's background is similar in appearance to the keyboard *only* when it is attached to a responder as an input view or an input accessory view. The caveat to this is that when the responder to which the view is attached resigns first responder, the input view looses its background while it is still installed in the input view hierarchy, resulting in an inconsistent view state. I have attached a sample project that demonstrates the issue by turning the keyboard animation speed way down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass or instance of UIInputView and install it in a responder\r\n2. Present the keyboard programmatically or via user input\r\n3. Dismiss the keyboard by calling `resignFirstResponder` on the view that is capturing keyboard input\r\n4. The attached input view will lose its background as soon as the keyboard begins to order out and will remain blank through the keyboard dismiss animation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input view should retain its background until the keyboard or input view is completely offscreen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe input view loses its background the moment the keyboard begins to order out and remains blank through the remainder of the keyboard dismiss animation.\r\n\r\nSample project can be found here: http://cl.ly/VQdJ"
