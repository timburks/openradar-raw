        Summary:
        Most developers like to organize their project into Groups in Xcode to keep things organized.  By default this doesn’t create matching folders on disk, so if you want to accomplish this you have to first create the folder, then change the path of the group.

        I think having an organized filesystem is equally as important and I can’t think of any downsides to why this wouldn’t be the default behavior.

        I think an option to have a group automatically create a folder as the default would be tops :)
