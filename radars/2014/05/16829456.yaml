    description: "In our app we are checking if a device has M7 capabilities via a check of the form ([CMStepCounter isStepCountingAvailable] && [CMMotionActivityManager isActivityAvailable]). If that returns FALSE then we show a different experience to the user. We have reports from some users of iPhone 5S devices that they are getting into that alternative experience which will only happen if one of those two conditions is FALSE. We've verified the model starts with iPhone6 from the model string as retrieved with sysctlbyname for the \"hw.machine\" name.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that either [CMStepCounter isStepCountingAvailable] or [CMMotionActivityManager isActivityAvailable] is returning FALSE on an iPhone 5S (rarely) which leads to a confusing user experience.\r\n\r\nIs it expected behavior that these could sometimes return FALSE on a device with an M7 chip? It does not appear to be documented as such."
