    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you look at the source code for the IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 kext on opensource.apple.com at this URL:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/IOUSBFamily/IOUSBFamily-630.4.5/AppleUSBXHCI/Classes/\r\n\r\nYou will notice that many of the files are truncated to zero bytes.  Worse, those same files in the actual tarball are ALSO zero bytes.\r\n\r\nAnd the USB family that corresponds with 10.9 appears to be missing in its entirety.  Was this built on a machine with a dying hard drive?\r\n\r\nPlease correct this problem ASAP.  I'm trying to debug a USB video device problem in 10.9, and this is actively blocking me from tracing my way through the code to figure out what is happening."
