    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Finder's Get Info window, the \"Change All\" button in Finder's Get Info dialog behavior is seriously broken if you have multiple versions of a single app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install two versions of any app, e.g. Finale 2012 and 2014.\r\n2.  Choose a file for that app and open a Get Info window for it in Finder.\r\n3.  Choose the older version of the app, then choose \"Change All\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the older .mus file format to always open in Finale 2012 from then on, and for the newer, non-backwards-compatible .musx files to continue opening in Finale 2014.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get the dialog asking me if I really want to update the launch services database to open a different app when I double-click one of those files.  I tell it to continue.  Then, the \"Open With\" pop-up changes back to Finale 2014.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
