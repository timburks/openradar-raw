    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the UIDocumenationInteractionController to display a .txt file in app that has been written to disk, non-english text in file is garbled. (Tested in Cyrillic and Japanese).\r\n\r\nIf however, you first use Mail.app to open a text file (any text file) then move to third party application and open the same UIDocumentationInteractionController, the same text, same file now displays properly.\r\n\r\nSample Project: https://github.com/AdamEsgie/DocInteractionBug\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAssuming the app I'm working on is titled \"myApp\"\r\n\r\n1. Delete myApp from iPad\r\n2. Turn Off iPad\r\n3. Turn iPad On\r\n4. Use Xcode to build and launch myApp on device\r\n5. Display .txt file with cyrillic characters with UIDocumenationInteractionController (text should appear garbled)\r\n6. Open Mail.app\r\n7. Open any .txt file that contains international characters - (the two I tested were Japanese and Cyrillic)\r\n8. .txt file displays properly in Mail.app\r\n9. Move back to myApp and open the same file with the UIDocumenationInteractionController - .txt file text now displays properly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIDocumenationInteractionController should always display .txt files encoded using utf8 properly even if they are in cyrillic, japanese, ect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIDocumenationInteractionController displays garbled text for .txt files with international characters"
