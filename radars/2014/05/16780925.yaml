        Summary:
        This is a duplicate of rdar://16780801

        When testing on the iOS Simulator, to scroll a view you need to simulate a touch-drag by clicking on the trackpad and dragging. The trackpad has native support for two-finger drag to scroll. Why not use this in the simulator? It would make testing both easier and more RSI-friendly. Additionally things like pinch-zoom and other multi-finger gestures could be simulated very well using the trackpad.
