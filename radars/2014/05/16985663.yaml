        Summary:
        When creating NSManagedObject subclasses based on the contents of a data model, the user is given the choose to use scalar properties instead of object properties. That’s great, but Xcode should really remember the user’s previous choice. Currently, this workflow is pretty error-prone since it’s easy to forget to click that checkbox when re-creating a model class.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create an Xcode project using core data.
        - Create an entity in the data model
        - Create a numeric property on the data model
        - Choose “Editor -> Create NSManagedObject subclass…” from the menu
        - Go through all the steps to save the class files, and turn on the "scalar properties for primitive data types" checkbox when you see it.
        - So far so good. now, choose “Editor -> Create NSManagedObject subclass…” from the menu again.
        - Go through all the steps to save the class files again. When you get to the "scalar properties for primitive data types" checkbox, look at what you see.

        Expected Results:
        Ideally, the checkbox should be enabled, since I enabled it previously.

        Actual Results:
        Instead, the checkbox is disabled, as if I had never clicked it.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
