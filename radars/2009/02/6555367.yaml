    description: "Currently, there is no way for a Developer to respond to App Reviews on the iTunes App Store. They have no way to correct misinformation or contact a user who is having technical issues. In the worst cases, this can lead to competitors spreading misinformation and pointing to their own products. An example of this can be seen from this blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2009/02/03/fighting-sockpuppet-reviews-on-the-app-store/\r\n\r\nAlso, rdar://problem/6069285"
