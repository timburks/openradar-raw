    description: "28-Feb-2009 11:09 AM Hwee Boon Yar:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUIImage +imageNamed: treats the image filename as case-insensitive (@\"cardback.png\" will find cardBack.png) in the Simulator (all versions) but the device is case-sensitive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Load a UIImageView with a UIImage using an image file in the project with the correct capitalization.\r\n2. Run in Simulator\r\n3. Run in device\r\n4. Change the string to the wrong capitalization.\r\n5. Run in Simulator\r\n6. Run in device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n2 and 3 should show the image. 5 and 6 should not display the image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n2 and 3 shows the image. 5 shows the image too (wrong). 6 does not display the image (right).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSimulator is wrong (case-insensitive). Device provides the correct (and stricter) behavoir.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached sample project. See comments in ImageFileNamesNotCaseSensitiveInSimulatorViewController.m (need to change cert to run in device, obviously)\r\n\r\n\r\n'ImageFileNamesNotCaseSensitiveInSimulator.zip' was successfully uploaded"
