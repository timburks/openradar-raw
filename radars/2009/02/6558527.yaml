    description: "In iTunes' thermometer-style iPod/iPhone storage allocation gauge, the colors used for Audio (blue) and Video (purple) are difficult to distinguish for users with red-green colorblindness (deuteranopia/deuteranomaly). Their luminosities are very similar, and the hue differs only in the red/green mix.  \r\n\r\nThe attached image shows a screenshot from iTunes (top half) compared with an approximation of what I see (bottom half, created by applying the blue color to the violet area and adjusting luminosity slightly). That is: in the attached image, the top half and bottom half look nearly the same to me (on a color-calibrated MacBook LCD panel at 2.2 gamma).\r\n\r\nThe problem may be solved by using colors that vary the blue channel as well (that is, a more \"pink\" purple) or by dramatically changing the luminosity either of the blue or violet (allowing even a colorblind user to distinguish the different bars by lightness).\r\n\r\nAttachment: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/37207/colorblind-itunes.png"
