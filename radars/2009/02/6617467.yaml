    description: "Summary: \r\nSafari 4's Top Sites window has a \"Search History\" field. If you have multiple tabs open, and have that field focused, and press Command-W, Safari will try and close the whole window, and not just the top tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open multiple tabs in Safari 4\r\n2) Open the Top Sites view\r\n3) Click the \"Search History\" field\r\n4) Press Command-W\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tab I had highlighted with Top Sites visible would be closed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari presented a sheet asking if I wanted to close all the tabs on the window. Clicking cancel does not close anything. Clicking OK closes the window and all the tabs on it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone"
