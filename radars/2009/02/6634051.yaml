    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UISlider thumb hit testing seems badly broken. On the device it is extremely hard to \"hit\" the thumb, especially when it is located towards the right-hand of the track.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UISlider and run the test application on the device. Move the thumb to the right-hand side of the track. Attempt to move the thumb again: it is almost impossible unless you aim for a region about 20px to the left of the thumb."
