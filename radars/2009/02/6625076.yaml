    description: "Summary: \r\nWhile the new URL autocompletion in Safari 4 is a great improvement (thanks!), it would be nice to be able to match the middle of page URLs and titles. For example, many forums have URLs of the form \"forum.domain.com\". Including the forum subdomain in the completion list for domain would make it less likely for people to have to remember the exact url.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Visit adiumx.com\r\n2) Visit forum.adiumx.com\r\n3) Type adium in the url bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth adiumx.com and forum.adiumx.com appear in the completion list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly adiumx.com appears in the completion list"
