    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting my external monitor to the MiniDisplay adaptor on my Macbook Pro (MacBookPro5,1, 15\", Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz) sometimes the system freezes, requiring a power-cycle. Besides the inconvenience of having to reboot, there's loss of any unsaved documents. Not that I don't appreciate the thrill of plugging the external monitor and waiting to see if the machine will crash, mind you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlug in an external monitor to the MiniDisplay port (I'm using Apple's MiniDisplay<->DVI adaptor).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMore screen real-estate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem crash, rebooting annoyance, loss of documents, hurt productivity, disruption of work flow, increased blood-pressure.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt happens randomly. This started a few weeks ago, unfortunately I can't remember what changed/what I installed around then.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I wanted to reboot several times a day and lose work, I'd get a Windows machine."
