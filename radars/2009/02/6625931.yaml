    description: "SUMMARY\r\nSafari has always had the option to hide its 'toolbar' but that option has never worked properly: The 'toolbar' will eventually reappear persistently.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCE\r\nOpen a Safari Window and view some site in there\r\nHide its toolbar\r\nHit Command-L\r\n=> The address field reappears and gains focus\r\nDo not interact with the address field but click a link in the page content\r\n\r\nEXPECTED \r\nSafari navigating to the clicked page and the 'toolbar' disappearing again.\r\n\r\nACTUAL\r\nSafari navigating to the clicked page and the 'toolbar' remaining visible indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis behaviour can be observed in a bunch of situations where editing an address is not ended by hitting the Return key. It means that you cannot have Safari in a state where it hides the 'toolbar' over an extended period of time, rendering the feature practically useless."
