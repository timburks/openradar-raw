    description: "24-Feb-2009 08:06 AM Benjamin Reed:\r\nSince the tabs take over the title bar, it is no longer possible to click-to-focus on the title bar when a window is in front of Safari, without accidentally changing tabs as well.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nOpen a bunch of tabs.\r\nOpen another app, which now covers most of Safari.\r\nI want to go back to safari and read what I was in the middle of reading, so I go to click on the title bar.\r\nIt switches me to a different tab; whatever happens to be on that part of the title bar.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to just click to bring the app to the foreground without going all the way down to the dock.\r\n\r\n24-Feb-2009 10:23 AM Benjamin Reed:\r\nOK, according to the word rushing around the net, you can turn this behavior off with a debug setting:\r\n\r\n  defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari4TabBarIsOnTop -bool NO\r\n\r\nThis fixes the weird title-bar behavior.  It should at least be a preference so it's configurable."
