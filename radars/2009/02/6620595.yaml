    description: "Safari 4 doesn't support HTTP File uploads via <input type=\"file\" /> anymore.\r\nYou can check this on any site with a file upload form e.g. http://www.senduit.com\r\n\r\nClicking on the \"Select File\" Submit Button doesn't open any File Dialog at all which would be the expected behaviour."
