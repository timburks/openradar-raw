    description: "Clicking on tabs in Safari 4 often results in small, unintentional window movements.  This happens because each tab must ask act as part of the title bar for the window.  This, any small click-and-move motion results in a small change in window position.  This problem seems especially pronounced on laptops when using the trackpad.\r\n\r\nI know several people who have already given up on using Safari 4 and switched to Firefox due to this single issue.  Though the unintentional window movements are small, they were frustrating enough to cause these people to switch after only a day or two of using Safari 4.  I think this issue makes them feel less in control of their computers.  Note that in all cases, these were \"casual\" Mac users (i.e., not developers or technology enthusiasts) who have used Safari as their primary web browser for years.\r\n\r\nUpdate: closed as a duplicate of 6521332 on 2009-03-11"
