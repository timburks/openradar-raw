    description: "06-Jul-2009 02:38 PM Jason Yeo :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nExpanding $(SDKROOT) will always result in an absolute path to the chosen SDK, even if it is set to a short name.  If originator has a case where this is not happening, please provide a sample project or build log where expansion fails.  But if the originator is just drawing an inference from the release note, that inference is incorrect, and the behavior requested is actually what's implemented.\r\n\r\n$(DEVELOPER_SDK_DIR) is the generic path to the SDKs in the Developer Tools, for the purpose of installing something there; it's not a reference to the SDK in use by the project.  Similarly, if we were to implement $(PLATFORM_SDK_DIR) it would logically be /Developer/Platforms, which is also not what the originator wants.\r\n\r\n16-Feb-2009 09:31 PM Ching-Lan Huang:\r\nAccording to Apple's Xcode 3.1 release note:\r\nThe \"SDK Path” build setting has been renamed “Base SDK.” Its value can be either a path or a name of an SDK. When setting the value in the Build Settings Inspector, you choose an installed SDK from a pop-up menu, rather than entering or navigating to an SDK package in the Developer folder.\r\n\r\nThat means the $(SDKROOT) in your Xcode project will become some short name like \"macosx10.5\", \"iphoneos2.2.1\" or \"iphonesimulator2.2.1\", etc., which doesn't represent the actual directory path of the SDK. \r\n\r\nThough $(DEVELOPER_SDK_DIR) does provide SDK path, it's \"/Developer/SDKs/\", not the iPhone SDK path (/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developers/SDKs) we want to deal with.\r\n\r\nApple should serious consider providing the $(PLATFORM_SDK_DIR) setting property, which point to the SDK path in Platform/ directory."
