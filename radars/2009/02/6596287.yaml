    description: "Summary:\r\nWould like to add new smart groups, consisting of Find in Project results, which would search again when selected. Find Results doesn't save between runs of Xcode, nor update just by selecting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Find in Project regex (FIXME|TODO|XXX):\r\n2) Find Results shows the results of the last search.\r\n3) Change some results.\r\n4) Re-select the Find Result, it does not update, full of stale results.\r\n5) Quit Xcode, restart it.\r\n6) No Find Results listed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) Do a Find in Project, click on a new \"Save as Smart Group\" checkbox.\r\n2) Whenever that smart group is selected (or whenever a file is saved?), re-search and update the results list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1) Have to re-run from scratch every time, and re-search every time I change anything.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile I would use it for task tracking, I expect general-purpose searches are more useful."
