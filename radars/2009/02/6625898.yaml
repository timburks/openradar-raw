    description: "I occasionally mistype things I enter in the address field. It would be handy if Safari's autocompletion also kicked in after correcting such a typo. Currently it does nothing after the Backspace key has been used.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCE\r\nA Do some google searches\r\nB Open a new window\r\nC Empty the address field\r\nD Type 'gog'\r\n=> no completion to google.com\r\nE Hit the backspace key\r\n\r\nEXPECTED \r\nautocompletion kicking in and completing the URL to something google.com (or other relevant URLs and terms beginning with 'go')\r\n\r\nACTUAL\r\nnothing"
