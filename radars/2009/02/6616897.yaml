    description: Safari 4 takes away the progress bar in place of a spinning progress indicator. This is completely useless for seeing how far along a page has loaded or how long it will take. Ideally the old progress indicator in the address bar control would work best, but even a small progress bar in status bar would do. There just needs to be some sort of indication for how much has been loaded
