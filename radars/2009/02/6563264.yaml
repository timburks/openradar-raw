    description: "Summary: \r\nEvery time I login, I have to adjust the size of my Dock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Position the Dock on the right or the left side of the screen.\r\n2. Adjust the Dock size by holding down the option key while dragging the resize handle.\r\n3. Logout and login, or run `killall Dock`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Dock should be the same size as it was before the third step.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Dock is 2 pixels wider.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem in Mac OS X 10.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy dock is on the right, pinned to the end, but the problem occurs regardless of pinning."
