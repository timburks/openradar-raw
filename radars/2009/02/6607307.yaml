    description: "The Finder, as of 10.5, no longer shows all non-local volumes in the sidebar. It shows types AFP/SMB/NFS/WebDav - but custom filesystems, such as those based on MacFUSE - are filtered out.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can can mark their volume as 'local' and Finder will display those volumes in the Devices section of the sidebar. However, Finder and OS X treat local volumes differently than non-local volumes - trying to create .Trashes directories, different IO behavior, etc. This forces developers into an unfortunate tradeoff where they need to misrepresent their volumes so that users can easily find and access it."
