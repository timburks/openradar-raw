    description: "Summary:\r\nIf IPv6 is enabled on the network interface used to contact the domain controller, any attempt to bind to the domain will fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake sure IPv6 is enabled. Attempt to bind to an Active Directory domain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Mac binds successfully to the domain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error occurs and the Mac does not bind successfully.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDisable IPv6 and try the bind again. It will work.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI did a packet trace during a bind attempt when IPv6 was enabled, and it seemed that there was a mix of IPv6 and IPv4 traffic related to the bind request."
