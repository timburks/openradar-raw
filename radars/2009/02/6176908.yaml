    description: "This problem is known to effect:\r\nMac OS X Client 10.5.4\r\nMac OS X Server 10.5.4\r\nMac OS X Client 10.4.11\r\nMac OS X Server 10.4.11\r\n\r\nBut possibly affects more versions. It is also known NOT to effect Windows XP and Windows Vista.\r\n\r\nIn the situation where there is indeed networking, but the DNS records for _kerberos._tcp.ad.company.domain and _ldap.ad.company.domain are missing or get truncated during reply, the Mac OS X computer will hang indefinitely.\r\n\r\nWe recently experienced this problem, it appears to have been caused by a bug in bind where it would not fully switch to TCP to return a query which was too large for UDP (we have many AD servers). A slight reconfiguration of BIND fixed this issue.  On our Macs if you were doing anything besides attempting to join AD(which would fail indicating that the AD could not be found) the mac would lock (not hard lock -- it just wouldn't let you do anything else or reboot-- it required a manual power off).  This would also affect local user logons (apparently local logons still need to contact AD for some reason even though they are higher priority in the auth path?).\r\n\r\nMay I suggest two things:\r\nFirstly: there should be a timeout, as I saw computers still trying to validate credentials with AD several days after they were inputted.\r\nSecondly:no pc's were affected during this problem we experienced because pcs look up ad by blindly poking around in the dark using A records...that wouldn't be a bad backup.\r\nThirdly: it should not break local user or local administrator accounts, this was hell to debug since our Mac OS X server was also hard locked."
