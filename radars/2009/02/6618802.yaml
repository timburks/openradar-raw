    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen a text field in Safari 4 has a zero-length value AND has a non zero-length placeholder value, the first attempt to update the value of such a field (using Javascript) is not rendered in the browser UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an HTML file containing a text field element with a zero-length value, such as <input type=\"text\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Placeholder\" id=\"test\">\r\n2. Use Javascript to update the value of the text field element, such as document.getElementById('test').value = \"Javascript assigned value\";\r\n3. Notice that when the Javascript is run, the text field element still displays it's placeholder, and not the new value assigned using Javascript.\r\n4. Run the Javascript a second time (without reloading the page).\r\n5. Notice that the expected value is shown upon the second execution of the Javascript.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the Javascript is run for the first time, it is expected that the text field element will display the value assigned via Javascript.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the Javascript is run for the first time, the text field element continues to display it's placeholder value, instead of the new actual value assigned via Javascript. Executing the Javascript a second time causes the value changes to be rendered as expected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem only occurs when a text field element's 'placeholder' attribute is set to a non-zero-length string, AND when the same text field element's 'value' attribute is set to a zero-length string.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur in Safari 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have uploaded a demo script to demonstrate the problem at http://pastie.org/399137.txt"
