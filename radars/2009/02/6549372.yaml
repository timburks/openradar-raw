    description: "Summary:\r\n\"Edit in scope\"'s idea of a scope is an entire file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Take an if statement like so:\r\n\r\nif (test) {\r\n\tSomeClass *var = [[SomeClass alloc] init];\r\n\t[var doSomething]\r\n\t[var editSomething:foo];\r\n} else {\r\n\tSomeClass *var = [self getClassSomeOtherWay];\r\n\t[var doSomethingDifferent];\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. Put the cursor over var\r\n3. See how it detects all the vars in both parts of the if statement, even though they are completely different scope\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you select the var in the first part of the if statement it should only select those within that part of the if statement. Same for the else part.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt selects them all, and ones in other methods as well\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is of course assuming you can get \"Edit in Scope\" to work in the first place, seems very temperamental as to when it wants to work sometimes."
