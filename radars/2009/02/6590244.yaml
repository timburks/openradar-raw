    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a mobile Active Directory user changes his password on another computer in the network (say, on the Domain Controller), and then logs in on a Mac client using the updated password, the act of logging in will not automatically unlock the user’s keychain. This appears to be because the password on the keychain is not updated automatically to the mobile user’s new password set in Active Directory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Bind a Mac to the Active Directory domain.\r\n2. Login to the Mac using a mobile user (defined in AD), creating a local user when prompted.\r\n3. Logout.\r\n4. Change the user's password on another computer in the network, e.g., a Domain Controller.\r\n5. Login to the Mac again using the updated password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe act of logging in updates the user's keychain password to the new password. The keychain is automatically unlocked. Actions requiring access to the keychain do not necessitate typing another password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keychain password is not updated to the new password. The keychain is not unlocked. Actions requiring access to the keychain require the user to type in his OLD password.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have not found a set of circumstances in which the problem described above does not happen. Incidentally, we have also observed a problem wherein mobile users are unable to change their passwords when logged in on a Mac, so changing the passwords on another computer in the network is necessary."
