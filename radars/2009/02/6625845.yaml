    description: "The address completion in Safari's address field is improving. Please improve it even further by making it autocomplete bookmark (and history page) titles and everything else you can get your hands on as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n1a) A bookmark for my DSL router points to the URL with its IP address but has a name 'Router'. I want to be able to type 'router' and get that URL from the autocompletion.\r\n\r\n1b) A boomark for my machine's CUPS service points to something like http://localhost:631 and has the name 'CUPS'. I want to be able to type 'cups' and see the boomark in autocompletion.\r\n\r\n2) Typing 'wikipedia' does not autocomplete to recently visited wikipedia pages as their hostnames are something like en.wikipedia.org (I guess Safari shouldn't strictly match from the beginning of the host name, and it should also try to match in page titles).\r\n\r\n3) Typing 'google maps' doesn't show the maps.google.com bookmark even though that would make sense.\r\n\r\n4a)Typing the name of a friend does not autocomplete to the URL of the web page on his address book card, even though those are displayed in Safari's Bookmarks menu.\r\n\r\n4b) In fact, regarding URLs from the address book, even typing the beginning of the URL that is stored in the address book does not autocomplete to the complete URL.\r\n\r\n5) Typing the name or address of a web page that is currently being advertised via Bonjour and displayed in the Bonjour submenu of the Bookmarks menu does not lead to autocompletion of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short: I am lazy when it comes to typing in URLs, Safari knows a whole lot about where I surfed before and which sites I like, so I want Safari to support my laziness and autocomplete prodigously.\r\n\r\nAs you seem to be starting to be more serious about Safari's autocompletion, I hope you can improve things until they're better than Firefox' address field."
