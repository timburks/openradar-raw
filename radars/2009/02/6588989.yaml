    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen viewing the Web Inspector Panel in the Elements pane if a scrollbar is necessary on the right-hand side & Computed Style > Show Inherited is clicked (for choosing or un-choosing) the new scrollbar element does not completely draw over the original resulting in an ugly mess until the window is resized or the scrollbar bubble moved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Webkit and navigate to a webpage.\r\n2. Open Web Inspector (under the Develop menu or ⌥⌘I)\r\n3. Make sure Elements is the selected pane\r\n4. Navigate to a body element in the exposed html below.\r\n5. Resize the Web Inspector Window so a vertical scrollbar is necessary.\r\n6. Select Styles > Comupted Style > Show Inherited checkbox.\r\n7. Marvel at how ugly the scrollbar looks. Half of the old scrollbar button(gem? bubble?) is not redrawn to the new size)\r\n8. Resize the window or move the scrollbar and watch it revert to normal!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the UI to be not ugly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI is ugly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not happen under Safari 3.2.1 (non-webkit nightly) but then the Web Inspector seems to work differently and less capably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 2.png' was successfully uploaded (Screenshot sent to Apple available here: http://skitch.com/strangebirds/br3e8/picture-2)"
