    description: "The iTunes plist should include an exported UTI that wraps the 'itun' OSType so that other applications may handle drags of iTunes songs to their dock icons.  Currently, no other applications that I know of can handle the dragging of a song from iTunes to their dock icon.\r\n\r\nI discovered a temporary workaround that would allow developers to add this functionality, but it's just a stop-gap solution until someone at Apple adds the required UTI to the iTunes Info.plist.\r\n\r\nHere's the workaround:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.supermegaultragroovy.com/blog/2009/02/23/handling-dock-icon-drags-from-itunes\r\n\r\nThe fix in iTunes would be a simple matter of adding a similar UTI entry to the list of UTExportedTypeDeclarations, similar to the one I defined as 'org.liscio.itun'.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix would be to fix the drag out of iTunes to include a standard file drag that would cause Cocoa NSApplication delegates to receive a call to application:openFIles:, just as a drag from the Finder would trigger."
