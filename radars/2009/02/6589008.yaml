    description: "15-Feb-2009 12:39 PM Robert Evans:\r\nXcode seems to lack first class support for the creation of releases; specifically, the creation of dmgs. Although this can be done by creating a custom script, it seems -- at least to this developer -- that such a common activity would have standard conventions and that those conventions would be cooked into Xcode."
