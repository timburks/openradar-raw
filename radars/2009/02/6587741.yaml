    description: "13-Feb-2009 10:01 PM Ethan Zlomke:\r\nSummary: \r\nAfter downloading a file, and before the downloads window closes automatically, if the downloads window is moved, the window draw area remains, colored white, with nothing drawn within it and no activity possible _except_ moving the window. Reopening the downloads window via the menu item redraws over the area and allows the downloads window to be closed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI was unable to reproduce this through a set process but have observed it twice over the last week (Webkit is set to update to the newest nightly build on startup).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window moves and is correctly redrawn, _or_ closes completely and must be reopened via menu command or keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe downloads window draw region remained, shaded white, but was non-interactive except for moving the region via the mouse.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurred in Webkit r40597 and r40813 (I believe) on OS X 10.5.6 with all updates except newest security update. It may have occurred earlier but is hard to reproduce and rarely occurs."
