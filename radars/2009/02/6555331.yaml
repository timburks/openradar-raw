    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe \"Mini Months\" calendar in iCal does not show January 2009 properly at certain times of the year.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. This bug is easier to trigger if your system date is set to February 4, 2009, or another date early in February 2009.\r\n\r\n2. In a guest account (so you have a clean clean configuration), start iCal.\r\n\r\n3. Enlarge the iCal window by clicking the green \"+\" button, so that it fills most of the screen.\r\n\r\n4. Make sure the \"Mini Months\" are visible. By default they are visible, but if not, enable them by choosing View > Show Mini Months from the menu.\r\n\r\n5. By default, Mini Months will show one month, February 2009. Use the splitter bar directly above the Mini Months to expand the calendar so it shows more than one month.\r\n\r\n6. In the Mini Month calendar, click the left-pointing triangle next to the word \"February 2009\". This will allow you to see January 2009 in the calendar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe month of January should be displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe last week of January is not shown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nBy playing with the Mini Months calendar, moving back and forth between months, you can eventually get it to show the full month of January."
