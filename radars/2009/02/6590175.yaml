    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe ranking of applications seems to be inconsistent between 2 consecutive views.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run App Store on iPhone.\r\n2. Go to Social Networking Category, Paid apps\r\n3. Scroll to bottom and Press Twenty Five More...\r\n4. Scroll to bottom and Press Twenty Five More...\r\n5. Scroll to bottom again. The items shown now should be the last ~4 items in top 75 paid apps.\r\n6. Take note of the items.\r\n7. Press Top Free.\r\n8. Press Top Paid again.\r\n9. Repeat step 3 to step 6 again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe items should be the same. While it may be possible for purchases to change the ranking at real time, it is impossible that it should happen repeatedly within a short 1 minute time frame (i.e. you can repeat going into the app store paid apps for social networking items 71-75 will rotate between a few items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe items listed are not the same. In particular I have an App, SimplyTweet, which is currently at rank 72 in Paid Apps for Social Networking. It disappears from the top 100 ranking completely while doing this experiment. Sometimes applications will appear twice (again observed within rank 50-75 or so).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSerious Bug since positioning in App Store means everything to sales."
