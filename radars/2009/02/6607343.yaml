    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] mountedLocalVolumePaths] does not return all local volumes mounted on the system\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nCall [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] mountedLocalVolumePaths] when there is a local volume on the system mounted through MacFUSE. \r\n\r\nExpanDrive is an example of a program, based on MacFUSE, which normally mounts volumes which are marked as local. These volumes are not returned here, but are returned in\r\n\r\nstruct statfs *buf = NULL; \r\ngetmntinfo(&buf, 0); \r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\ngetmntinfo and mountedLocalVolumePaths return the same set of volumes\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a clear bug which needs to be addresses. mountedLocalVolumePaths is a popular function call in cocoa, and does not return non-apple filesystems which are marked as local devices. Of note: if these volumes [eg: MacFUSE volumes] are marked non-local, mountedLocalVolumePaths does return them in the array."
