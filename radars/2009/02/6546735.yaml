    description: "01-Feb-2009 09:33 AM Joachim Bengtsson:\r\nAmong the AudioSession categories described at https://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/AudioSessionCategories/chapter_6_section_1.html , there is none that both allows audio from other apps, *and* has the hardware volume buttons control game sounds at all times (no matter if a sound is currently playing or not).\r\n\r\nThe closest one is kAudioSessionCategory_UserInterfaceSoundEffects, and its description matches my game, but if the user presses the hardware volume buttons when a sound is not currently playing (which is very likely in my game, since my effects are very short), they will adjust the ringer volume, and the game sound volume will be unaffected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a game\r\n2. Have no music playing in the background on the phone\r\n3. Launch the game\r\n4. Press the volume buttons and try to bring it up to maximum\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n5. Ringer volume is unaffected, game volume is at maximum\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n5. Ringer volume is at maximum, game volume is unaffected.\r\n6. Send a bug report to the developer complaining that there is no sound. Get an explanation that you need to press *just* when the game sounds are playing. Throw the phone out the window from frustration in trying to time the presses in exact synchronization with the sounds. Sue the developer for losses.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm using AVFoundation to play my sounds."
