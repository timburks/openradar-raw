    description: After the "back" button, the most frequently used button on my Safari toolbar is the "stop/reload" button.  Or rather, it was until Safari 4 removed this button.  In its place I got a stop/reload icon integrated into the far-right side of the address bar.  This is far less convenient.  It is a smaller target and it is poorly placed, as my mouse cursor is most often hovering around the frequently used back/forward button cluster on the far left.  (I could move back/forward to the far right, but that is a very odd arrangement and would clash with the other web browsers I use.)  Though stop/reload may seem like a minor function, it is heavily used by web developers.  Please bring back the independent stop/reload button as an option in the "Customize Toolbarâ€¦" sheet.
