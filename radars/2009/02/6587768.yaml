    description: "13-Feb-2009 10:41 PM August Joki:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode takes up at least, if not more than 100% of the CPU while downloading new/updated DocSets. It also uses the CPU heavily while installing them, but less than during download.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload a new/updated DocSet.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see the CPU utilization around the same as multiple simultaneous downloads in Safari. (One would assume they'd use some of the same downloading code.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMuch much higher than expected CPU usage."
