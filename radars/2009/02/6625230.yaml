    description: "Summary: \r\nIf an iPhone application has an AudioQueue, activated it (had it start playing), any subsequent MPMoviePlayerController session will not have any sound output (totally mute). Only when all existing AQs are disposed does MPMPC behave normally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AQ, don't have it start playing for the time being\r\n2. Create an MPMPC, play a movie. Video/audio output behaves normally.\r\n3. Now have the AQ start playing, then stop.\r\n4. Create an MPMPC, play a movie, video is fine, but now audio is muted.\r\n5. Only after the AQ is disposed does the MPMPC starts behaving as expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMPMPC should not expect the non-existence or non-activation of other AQs in the system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen there are other created AQs and at least one of them has been activated by playing, MPMPC stops giving out sound.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that AudioQueueReset has no use in/between any of the steps above. Only AudioQueueDispose works. It's interesting because if an AQ is created but is never used, MPMPC works fine. But if sound is ever played with the AQ, MPMPC starts to behave strangely as described above."
