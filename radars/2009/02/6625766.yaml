    description: "I do not want to see or use the large \"Add Bookmark…\" (+) toolbar button (see screenshot[1]), but in Safari 4 it comes attached to the address bar, which I do want to use.  I rarely add bookmarks but I very frequently use the address bar, and always want to see it.  Though the address-bar-with-integrated-bookmark-button makes some sort of logical sense and does save a few pixels, it wastes far more pixels for those who do not want to use it.  It also creates a large target for accidental clicks, each of which triggers a modal sheet which must then be dismissed.  I have already clicked it accidentally a a dozen or so times in the past two days of Safari 4 use.  It's frustrating.  Please bring back the independent \"Add Bookmark\" and \"Address Bar\" fields as an option in the \"Customize Toolbar…\" sheet.\r\n\r\n1. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/118359/radar/do-not-want.png\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2008-03-04: Thus bug has been marked as a duplicate of rdar://6450810"
