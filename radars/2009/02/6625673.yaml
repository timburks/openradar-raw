    description: "When entering a username and password for the first time on a web site in Safari, the \"Would you like to save this password?\" sheet appears (see screenshot[1]).  Further progress is halted until an answer is provided by the user.  This is especially frustrating when the user is not sure if the username and/or password entered is correct.\r\n\r\nThe behavior in Firefox 3 is much nicer: a non-modal panel appears, presenting a similar \"Would you like to save this password?\" type of question, but the form submission and subsequent page load proceeds anyway.  This allows the user to see whether or not the username/password entered actually works, and also doesn't interrupt the progress of users who don't want to deal with that choice immediately (but nevertheless want to be presented with it, rather than turning it off entirely).\r\n\r\n1. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/118359/radar/password-sheet.png"
