Go into the source code for gdb and search for /Set call-po-at-unsafe-times to 1/ replace with:\r\n/'set call-po-at-unsafe-times on'/\r\nwarning  set call-po-at-unsafe-times on to override this check.\r\n\r\n2) update the documentation for gdb at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/developertools/gdb/gdb\r\n to document 'call-po-at-unsafe-times' , probably near the documentation for 'po'.\r\n\r\n3) update the documentation for gdb at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/developertools/gdb/gdb\r\n to add 'call-po-at-unsafe-times' to the index.\r\n\r\n6622149"
