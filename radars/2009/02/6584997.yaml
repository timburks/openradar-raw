    description: "Summary:\r\nIf Garbage Collection is used, NSButtonCells of type check box or radio button used in a table view reload their images during each draw of each row. This seriously effects the responsiveness of such tables, making for instance live resize of the containing window a very sluggish experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart the attached \"TableTest\" program and resize the window repeatedly with the mouse. Youâ€™ll notice the low frame rate immediately.\r\nThe \"File Activity\" instrument reveals that the reason for the problem seems to be a constant reload of the images needed by the button cell.\r\nRebuild TableTest without GC and everything will be smooth and fast.\r\n\r\nRegressions:\r\nThe problem does not show up with the current SnowLeopard preview.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe need a fix or work around for Leopard to be able to convert a large existing product to GC."
