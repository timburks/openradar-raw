    description: "On the following page: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmNibObjects.html\r\n\r\nthe last piece of sample code is a -dealloc method which ends with [super release]. This is of course immensely wrong. The fact that it’s in the conceptual documentation on memory management makes it a lot worse.\r\n\r\n(On a side note, the entire section illustrates an immense failure to define sane semantics for properties in Objective-C 2.0, but it seems it’s now too late to fix that, ever. C’est la vie.)"
