    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode GCC settings are not visible when Simulator SDK is selected, only when Device SDK is selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an iPhone project.\r\n2) Select Simulator SDK.\r\n3) Show Info on project, Build tab, observe no GCC 4.0 settings.\r\n4) Select Device SDK.\r\n5) Observe GCC 4.0 settings are now visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3) Should show GCC 4.0 settings (assuming the same architecture as the Device SDK, if necessary).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3) Doesn't.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAny settings previously set show up as raw User-Defined flags, but this is not particularly usable, as I can no longer memorize the full name of every GCC flag."
