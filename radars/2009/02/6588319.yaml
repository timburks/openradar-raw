    description: "Consider the following code:\r\n\r\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n\r\n@interface Foo: NSObject {\r\n   id bar;\r\n}\r\n@property (readonly) id bar;\r\n@end\r\n\r\n@interface Foo ()\r\n@property (readwrite, retain) id bar;\r\n@end\r\n\r\nint main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {\r\n   return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt generates the following warning for the second @property line:\r\n“warning: property 'bar' attribute in 'Foo' class continuation does not match class 'Foo' property”\r\n\r\nAdding “retain” to the first property declaration squelches the warning.\r\n\r\nWhile there are obviously cases where this is a useful warning, I contend that this is not one of them. As far as I can see attributes retain, copy and assign are not relevant to getters, and should therefore not need to be specified in the public interface.\r\n\r\n[Comments regarding beta iPhone SDKs redacted]"
