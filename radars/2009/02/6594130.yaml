    description: "(Ensure your firewall is set to \"Set access for specific services and applications)\r\nIf a user enabled Remote Management in sharing, the service is automatically \"given access\". This should then allow Admin staff to use ARD on the target machine, end of story. \r\nHowever, if you reboot, the user is asked to Allow/Block access for the process \"ARDAgent.app\" -- if the users closes this window, or clicks Block -- administrators cannot use ARD on their local machine.\r\nEven if the user clicks Allow, the next time they reboot, they have to allow the service again.\r\nThis has been happening on all versions of 10.5 client, including 10.5.6 and ARD 3.2.2"
