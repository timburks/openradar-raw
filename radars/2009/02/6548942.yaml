    description: Starting with QuickTime 7.6, QuickTime Player is denying the ability to use it within the debugger.  As a Perian developer, I, and every other component developer, find debugging QuickTime Player is the most useful application as it provides the ability to stress all parts of QuickTime that we use.  With this change, you have seriously crippled our ability to use Perian within the debugger and by extension, seriously crippled our development efforts.  Please provide a means by which we can continue to use QuickTime Player within the debugger.
