    description: "Summary: \r\nStarting a build process can cause the OS to completely freeze.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo reproducible steps, other than compiling a project in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode will start building and not hang the system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode will hang and the cursor will turn to the beachball. A few seconds after, the next application I switch to (usually Safari) will soon begin to also beachball. Within a few more seconds, the window manager completely locks up, and not even windows can be dragged around. The cursor can still be moved, and still displays the animated beachball. I've waited as much as 10 minutes for the system to right itself, which doesn't happen. The only remedy is a forced reboot via holding down the power button.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this may be a concurrency issue during the \"Checking Dependencies\" stage of the compilation progress, as the xcodeproj i've been using day-to-day has a complex dependency tree.\r\n\r\nXcode component versions:\r\nXcode IDE: 1099.0\r\nXcode Core: 1100.0\r\nToolSupport: 1086.0"
