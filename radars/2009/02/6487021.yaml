    description: "10-Jan-2009 02:05 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThe iPhone Maps application does not show user generated content. A search for \"train\" in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, doesn't show any entries although there are plenty in Google Maps:\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=de&geocode=&q=train&sll=2.990356,101.574097&sspn=0.843416,0.782776&ie=UTF8&ll=3.118748,101.675634&spn=0.105415,0.097847&z=14\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that iPhone doesn't show the entries because they are user generated content. It would be desirable to remove this limitation as it limits the use of the Maps application in Malaysia and perhaps other countries."
