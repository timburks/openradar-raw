    description: "05-Feb-2009 11:11 PM Nikita Zhuk:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using methods defined in <IOBluetooth/objc/NSDictionaryOBEXExtensions.h> header in Cocoa application running with Garbage Collection enabled, I get the following errors printed in console:\r\n\r\n****** leaking object added to OBEX headers dictionary; the passed dictionary needs to use the default value callbacks! ******\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n#import <IOBluetooth/objc/NSDictionaryOBEXExtensions.h>\r\n\r\nint main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {\r\n  NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\r\n\r\n  NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];\r\n  const void *str = \"a-dummy-target-header\";\r\n  [dict addTargetHeader:str length:strlen(str)];\r\n  \r\n  [pool drain];\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- No output\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Output: ****** leaking object added to OBEX headers dictionary; the passed dictionary needs to use the default value callbacks! ******\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- This happens on OS X 10.5.6 with GC turned on. Test application was compiled against 10.5 SDK from the default \"Foundation tool\" template.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have debugged this problem and the reason for this output seems to be the check you're making after the value has been added to the dictionary. You check (based on assembly) that CFGetRetainCount() of the added object is greater than zero after it has been added to the dictionary. If it's not, you output the error message. This is an incorrect check, since Core Foundation collections do not use reference counting under GC, they use strong pointers instead. So the value is added correctly even if its CFGetRetainCount() is zero after addition.\r\n\r\nSource: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/GarbageCollection/Articles/gcCoreFoundation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006687-SW2"
