    description: "When playing QuickTime movies in Safari 4 (loading the .mov file directly by its URL, not viewing it embedded in another page) the movie controls disappear while the movie is playing unless the mouse is hovering over the movie.  (See video[1].)  When the control is not visible, it's impossible to tell how much of the video remains to be played.  All possible workarounds are a nuisance.  Putting the cursor on the video itself obscures some portion of it and is distracting.  Having to carefully place the cursor over the small (~16 pixels high) video control each time a movie is viewed in this way is a bother.\r\n\r\nAn option to \"always show movie controls\" (off by default) would remedy this situation while retaining the clutter-free look for those who prefer it.\r\n\r\n1. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/118359/radar/qt-plugin.mov\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: Marked as a duplicate of rdar://6160546 on 2009-03-18"
