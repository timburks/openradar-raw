    description: "Summary: \r\nThe Safari 4 beta's Full Page Zoom feature is intended to scale up/down all UI elements. This does not work for QuickTime movies.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to http://apple.com/trailers/\r\n2. Select a movie trailer and select one of the streams\r\n3. Once the video begins playing, zoom the page up a few times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe QuickTime video will scale up with the page zoom.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe QuickTime video will not scale up, and will be centered within a blank box, which scales to the proper size for the QuickTime video.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
