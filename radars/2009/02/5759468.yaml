    description: "The guide \"Creating Cross-Platform Applications with Core Foundation and Open Source\" (aka CF-Lite) located at <http://developer.apple.com/opensource/cflite.html> is very outdated.\r\n\r\nFor example, the guide still refers to CF-299 (which was part of Mac OS X v10.2). Many instructions won't work with more recent versions of CoreFoundation (e.g. CF-476 from Mac OS X v10.5), most importantly the given patch. Also, the software doesn't seem to compile with more recent versions of GCC.\r\n\r\nAn update to the guide would be very much appreciated."
