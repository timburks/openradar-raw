    description: "12-Jan-2009 08:25 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nRunning gdb on an application with an emedded framework whose install name contains @loader_path gives a warning at startup:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add an embedded framework to an existing app\r\n2) Run gdb (Build > Build and Debug from Xcode)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ngdb should startup without any warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwarning: Unable to read symbols for \"@loader_path/../Frameworks/MyFramework.framework/Versions/A/MyFramework\" (file not found).\r\nwarning: Unable to read symbols from \"MyFramework\" (not yet mapped into memory).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the embedded framework uses @executable_path or @rpath instead of @loader_path, then there are no warnings.  I have yet to try on Xcode 3.1.2, but gdb is still version 962.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a project that demonstrates this issue.  Just run with Command-Y and look in the console."
