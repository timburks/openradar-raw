    description: "12-Feb-2008 07:10 PM Austin Ziegler:\r\nSummary:\r\nVim supports alternative script interpreters; Leopard's Vim does not have such support compiled in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start vim from the command-line.\r\n2. Type \":version\".\r\n3. Observe the version results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see \"+ruby\" (and other alternative script interpreters) in the version list, which indicates that Ruby language support has been compiled into Vim.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see \"-ruby\", indicating that Vim doesn't support Ruby as an alternative scripting language.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have a collection of Vim configuration files that I use cross-platform that cause errors because of the lack of Ruby support in the Leopard Vim."
