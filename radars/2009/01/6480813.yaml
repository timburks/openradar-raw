    description: "In Instruments, Object Allocations shows Core Data NSManagedObject subclass allocations as GeneralBlock-#### allocations, while every other kind of class allocation I'm aware of actually is referred to by name.  This makes debugging memory issues that much harder.  What's more, there are cases where the class can't even be reverse-engineered from the stack trace (e.g. with entity inheritance, where any subentity could be instantiated), so not only is it awkward and annoying in the common case, it's sometimes impossible.\r\n\r\n<Included an explicit example referencing another radar>"
