    description: "11-Jan-2009 08:25 AM Michael Ash:\r\nIt would be useful to enhance the @encode directive in ObjC to take multiple values:\r\n\r\n@encode(int, char)\r\n\r\nThis would simply concatenate the strings together in the same way that ObjC runtime method signatures are done.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to allow @encode to take an expression:\r\n\r\n@encode(1+2)\r\n@encode(someObjPointerVariable)\r\n\r\nThis would simply produce the same result as using @encode on the type of the value in question. In this case, it would produce the same as @encode(int) and @encode(id).\r\n\r\nAnd then of course it would be useful to allow both enhancements to be combined:\r\n\r\n@encode(1+2, someObjPointerValue, \"hello\", @selector(myMethod:))\r\n\r\nWhich would produce a type string containing the types of all the values given.\r\n\r\nWhat's the purpose of this? To allow writing a vararg macro which can take arbitrary types and properly extract them all:\r\n\r\n#define LIST_TO_NSARRAY(...) ListToNSArray(@encode(__VA_ARGS__), __VA_ARGS__)\r\n\r\nThe ListToNSArray function would build an NSArray from its arguments, placing objects in the array directly and converting the primitives using NSValue or similar wrappers. The contents of the @encode string would allow it to safely extract the arguments being passed from the va_list, which otherwise wouldn't be possible. The ability to pass arbitrary expressions to such a macro and have it deal with them correctly would be useful in constructing all sorts of helpers, and as far as I know nothing similar can be constructed using the facilities currently present in the language."
