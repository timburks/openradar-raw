    description: "In a nutshell: \r\nThe ability to have some sort of syntax for tagging methods and functions in your code, and a UI in Xcode that lets you get a filtered list of methods in your project matching the tag(s) in a search field.\r\n\r\nIn depth:\r\nOne of the hardest bits of coding is finding the relevant bits of code. As you generally work on areas of your application you only care about certain methods and functions in your project at a time, and the rest might as well not be there. There exists ways of grouping similar methods together already, either by Objective-C categories or by using #pragma mark to group them in the method browser menu.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these aren't very flexible. A method may be related to various areas of your application, but these methods only allow you to associate it with one. Tags are becoming the standard way to add custom metadata to items of data allowing for custom organisation when coupled with filtering, which makes them an ideal choice for organising methods/functions.\r\n\r\nUsing a syntax like:\r\n\r\n#pragma tag tag1, tag2, tag3\r\n- (void)myMethod {\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nwould allow a programmer to tag their methods, be it by the area of the app they are relevant to, the people who have worked on the method or anything else.\r\n\r\nXcode could then provide a means of showing a filtered list of methods in a file or project relating to a certain tag. This way programmers can have a list of methods that they care about at the moment and can ignore those they don't (a nice addition could be to automatically code fold all irrelevant methods). As someone who works on multiple projects it would also serve as a great tool to reacquaint myself with the code for a project."
