    description: "Summary: \r\nThe loginwindow allows you to set the AdminHostInfo to a specific value. This value should always be applied when the loginwindow is displayed. Certain conditions can cause this value to revert to the default (i.e computer name)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a client set with managed preferences to display anything other than the default of the computer name. Also set a loginwindow message.\r\nLogin as a managed user and log out.\r\nThe managed preferences for the loginwindow will be set. Both the AdminHostInfo and the custom window message. \r\nHave the ability for admins to disable managed preferences set. \r\nLogin as an admin hold option and disabled managed preferences for that user.\r\nLog out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll loginwindow preferences should still be applied.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll preferences except for AdminHostInfo are still applied. AdminHostInfo reverts to the computer name. \r\nIf you log back in as a managed user then back out the AdminHostInfo will be set correctly. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone."
