    description: "29-Apr-2008 08:43 AM Dave Dribin:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nIn the PubSub framework, the only way expire entries in a feed is to use PSFeedSettings.expirationInterval.  This is time based, so entries are persisted for a time period (the default is two weeks, I believe).  This has a couple of down sides.  For frequently updated feeds (such as CNN's feeds), this means there are a *lot* of entries after two weeks.  And for seldom updated feeds, this means that there may be no entries in the feed after two weeks.\r\n\r\nAn alternative way to expire feeds is to expire them as the drop off the end of the actual XML.  Thus PSFeed.entries will always match the entries in the XML.  This puts the expiration time in the hands of the content creator, who knows how often they update their site.  FWIW, NetNews Wire has \"Keep news items until they disappear from the feed\" as default.\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nThe current work around I am using is to do my own persistence (with Core Data) and periodic refreshing using -PSFeed initWithURL:.  Temporary feed entries always match what is in the XML."
