    description: "29-Apr-2008 09:26 AM Dave Dribin:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nHitting the \"RSS\" button in the location bar of Safari does not show all entries in the feed if I am also subscribed to the feed in Mail.ap or presumably any other application subscribed using the PubSub framework.\r\n\r\nSafari only shows the number of items in the feed that are within the default two-week time period of PSFeedSettings.expirationInterval.  While I may expect this behavior if I subscribed to the feed in Safari, just hitting the \"RSS\" button should show the entries in the actual XML feed.  i.e. it should use a temporary feed like -PSFeed initWithURL:\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Subscribe to a feed that does not update very often in Mail.app.  I'm using my blog, which updates only a few times a month.\r\n\r\n2. Wait a day.  You have to let the PubSubAgent run, so waiting a day will accomplish this.\r\n\r\n3. Open the feed URL in Safari (I do this by navigating to my blog and hitting the \"RSS\" button in the Location bar)\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nI would expect Safari to show all entries in the feed. Instead it only shows 1 or 2, because there are only 1 or 2 postings within the expirationInterval (two weeks).\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nIf no other application is subscribed to the feed using PubSub, then Safari will show all the entries.  This is because the first time you pull a feed from PubSub, it doesn't expire them right away.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nI'm on 10.5.2/9C7010."
