    description: "Summary: \r\nTextEdit's Print AppleScript command can end up in an infinite loop.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Script Editor and enter the following script:\r\n\r\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\r\n\tset licensePath to \"/Developer/Documentation/Python/PyObjC/tutorial/tutorial.txt\"\r\n\t\r\n\tprint {POSIX file licensePath}\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should always the txt document a single time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it runs correctly, mostly only if I just press Run once after opening it in ScriptEditor. But most  often it either provides the following error:\r\n\r\nAppleScript Error \r\n«script» doesn't understand the savePrinter message.\r\n\r\nor otherwise, it goes into a vicious loop sending out multiple faxs within seconds. I have to Force Quit TextEdit to stop the loop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis doesn't occur 100% of the time and I haven't been able to notice a pattern, save for the infinite loop never occurs twice in a row.  \r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
