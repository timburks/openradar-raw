    description: "NSDocumentController has a method named:\r\n\r\n- (id)openDocumentWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)fileName display:(BOOL)flag\r\n\r\nThe documentation states \"Invoked with a display argument of YES instead of NO when a Print Documents Apple event is handled.\"\r\n\r\nBut this method is deprecated and the docs state:\r\n\r\n\"Use openDocumentWithContentsOfURL:display:error: instead\"\r\n\r\nFrom the naming of the two APIs, I image the only differences are:\r\n - adding the NSError\r\n - changing from path to url\r\n\r\nthe docs for that method make no mention of printing.  Upon testing, I have found that whether my app receives an 'odoc' or 'pdoc' event the 'display' parameter is YES in either case.  In fact, I have not been able to find any situation where I get NO.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very very hard to know what kind of event I have received."
