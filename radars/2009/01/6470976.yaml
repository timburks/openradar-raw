    description: "iPhone OS 2.2 (and several versions prior) support an optional feature that allows you to double-tap the Home button to jump to Phone Favorites or iPod, rather than taking you back to the Home screen.\r\n\r\nI use this feature frequently, but I wish it worked like a boomerang, such that after double-tapping Home to go to Phone or iPod, you could do it again to go back to where you were.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I have the preference set to take me to Phone Favorites on double-tap, and I'm currently using Mail. I could double-tap Home to jump to Phone Favorites. I make a phone call. Then, what I want is to be able to double-tap Home again to take me back to Mail.\r\n\r\nI find that almost every time I use the double-tap feature, when I'm done, I want to go back to the app I was using before."
