    description: "24-Jun-2008 04:20 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nIn Mail.app, sometimes the table headers (namely Message Status) become unresizable.  Usually this happens in conjunction with rdar://problem/6032224 (\"Mail.app header widths revert to different size\").  What happens is the Message Status header resizes itself to be the default width, without the unread number.  And then I am unable resize it *back* to show the unread number.  It pretty much stays in this state for some time.  At some point in the future, I am able to resize it again.  Quitting and starting Mail.app does not solve the problem.  Time seems to be the only solution.  This seems to affect all table headers, not just Message Status once it's in the unresizable state.  This happens probably once a week for me.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere's no specific action I can pinpoint that causes the problem, unfortunately.  All I can say is that it happens after Mail.app is running for some time.  I also cannot pinpoint the action that causes the header to become resizable again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Message Status header should always be resizable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Message Status header becomes unresizable after some time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt's occurred in all versions of Mail.app in 10.5.  I don't recall this issue in 10.4 Mail.app.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLet me know if there's something in the logs that could indicate an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Jun-2008 01:19 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nI do have threaded messages viewing enabled.  I'll take a screen shot before and after.  I generally don't resize the main window.  The screen shots will let us know if the window changes size.  It's working properly, at the moment.  Attached is a screen shot with the blue dot and unread numbers available.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mail - before.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n07-Jul-2008 12:18 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nI will try that when it happens again.  Of course, now that I've filed the bug, it hasn't happened again. :/\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 07:57 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nIt just happened again.  I'm attaching an \"after\" screenshot, just so you can see how it reverts to the old width.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mail - after.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 08:07 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nYes, turning threaded message viewing off and back on again allows me to resize.  I'm attaching a screen cast of this, and you can see how I do not get the resize arrows at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mail-resize.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 08:10 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nI'm also attaching my preferences before and after toggling threaded messages.  In the \"before\" state, the column is not resizable, as shown in the screen cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Prefs Before and After.zip' was successfully uploaded"
