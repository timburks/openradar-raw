    description: Only the Agent user of the iPhone Portal can create and assign Distribution & Adhoc profiles in the iPhone Developer Program Portal.  Sometimes the Agent is not the person doing the actual builds or may not have the knowledge required, or the time, to constantly be creating and altering Distribution Profiles for AdHoc building and testing.  This ability should be able to be delegated to someone else, like an Admin level user perhaps.
