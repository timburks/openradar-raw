    description: "Carbon has an API TransitionWindow() which \"shows, hides, moves, or resizes a window with appropriate animation and sound.\"  This API is no longer available in 64 bit.\r\n\r\nCocoa has no such API, and I would like to see one.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to use the genie effect to make a window appear from/close into a toolbar button.  MS Word does this, probably using TransitionWindow.  See attached video.\r\n\r\nIt seems I'm not alone in wanting this, someone wrote a Cocoa class that uses TransitionWindow, though it is buggy:\r\n<http://mattballdesign.com/code/NSWindow+MBGenieEffect.zip>\r\n\r\nI know about Core Animation, I also know about NSWindow's setFrame:display:animate:, but it doesn't provide any animation choice, like genie effect. I haven't gotten any of these to work as desired, partly because of 5955819."
