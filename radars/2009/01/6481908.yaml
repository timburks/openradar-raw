    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the CD Info.cidb file in a user's Preferences folder is blank (exists, but has no content), the system is unable to mount audio CDs. A crash report is generated for cddafs.util. Deleting CD Info.cidb causes it to be recreated properly the next time an audio CD is inserted and the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In terminal:\r\n$ rm Library/Preferences/CD\\ Info.cidb\r\n$ touch Library/Preferences/CD\\ Info.cidb\r\n2. Insert an audio CD and observe that it does not mount\r\n3. In the Finder or Terminal, delete CD Info.cidb\r\n4. Eject and reinsert the disc.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe CD mounts successfully both times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen a blank CD Info.cidb exists, the CD does not mount. In some cases a \"disk unreadable\" dialog appears (ignore/eject).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested in Leopard (10.5.6) and Tiger (10.4.11), the problem exists in both.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found this on a machine in the wild. Though a blank CD Info.cidb is unlikely, it can certainly happen.\r\nAttached are a crash report for cddafs.util and a syslog clipping from a failed mount."
