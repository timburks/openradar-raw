    description: "In the document settings section of the inspector panel in Pages '08, on the \"Document\" tab, there is a 'facing pages' checkbox. It only partially works.\r\n\r\nSTR:\r\n- Open a multi-page document where facing pages have been turned off (right from the start)\r\n   note how there's only one page horizontally. Page 1 at the top, 2 right below it, 3 below 2, etc.\r\n- Go in the Inspector and turn on 'Facing Pages'.\r\n   Note how the labels on the margins change from \"left\" and \"right\" to \"inner\" and \"outer\" and the display changes to have no page in upper left, 1st page to its right, second page below at the left, 3rd page to right of 2nd, 4th page below 2nd, 5th page below 3rd etc.\r\n- Turn 'facing pages' off again.\r\n   Note how the labels change back to \"left\" and \"right\" from \"inner\" and \"outer\", but the pages are still displayed next to each other.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nPages still display next to each other, though 'facing pages' is off.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nPages should be in one vertical strip again, like they were before I started twiddling the checkbox.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this. I can't find a way to get my document to display properly anymore after having tried out facing pages and decided it wasn't a good choice for the document in question. Thanks."
