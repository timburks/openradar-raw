    description: The collection behaviour of a window is a very important element of setting up an NSWindow in 10.5 and later, so it would be nice to be able to set it's value in a pop up in IB's inspector rather than having to resort to code. This is more a visibility problem than anything, as it is something you can easily forget to set correctly before shipping, but having the setting in the IB inspector would make it more visible when constructing your UI.
