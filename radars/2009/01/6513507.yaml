    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 3.1 does not support SVN 1.5. Projects checked out from a SVN 1.5 server using svn 1.5 CLI tool are not compatible with Xcode's built-in SVN support.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nXcode's built-in SVN support does not work with modern (e.g. SVN 1.5) checkouts\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nI expect Xcode to be updated to work with modern checkouts or to allow setting a custom SVN executable, as in Xcode 2.\r\n\r\nThis bug may be related to rdar://problem/6084401"
