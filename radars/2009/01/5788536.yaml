Start MobileSafari and navigate to for example the special event of March 6th Keynote.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Simulator loads and plays the movie.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Simulator hangs and MobileSafari has a cpu utilization about 100% (on Activity Monitor).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSystems with Final Cut Studio installed or probably QuickTime components. It works fine with Perian and Flip4Mac."
