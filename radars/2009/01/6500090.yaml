    description: "Summary: \r\nAfter a developer certificate expires, a copy of it remains on the Create/Edit \"Provisioning Profile\" screens in the form of a check box to check for your chosen profile.  These expired certificates do not show under the \"Certificates\" section to be removed/deleted.  This leads to confusion to what certificates are assigned to the profile because it just shows duplicate names.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAfter an iPhone Development Certificate expires visit a Create or Edit \"Provisioning Profile\" screens\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to either be able to remove the certificate from the \"Certificates\" section or not see expired Certificates section on the Create/Edit \"Provisioning Profile\" screens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOld duplicate certificates are shown on the Create/Edit \"Provisioning Profile\" screens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBefore a certificate expires, it can be seen and removed via the \"Certificates\" section"
