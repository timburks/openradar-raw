    description: "Summary: \r\nAn Active Directory Plug-in configuration that has the \"Allow authentication from any domain in the forest\" option disabled and an authentication path set directly to a specific domain and not \"/Active Directory/All Domains\" displays this message on the \"Directory Servers\" screen: \"This server is responding normally. This server is not in your authentication search policy.\" However authentication will continue to function. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBind to an AD server.\r\nUse the defaults that places All Domain in the authentication search policy \r\nCheck status message will read: \"This server is responding normally\" \r\nSet the \"Allow authentication from any domain in the forest\" to disabled.\r\nRemove the All Domains authentication search policy\r\nAdd a specific domain to the authentication search policy\r\nCheck status message it will read \"This server is responding normally. This server is not in your authentication search policy.\"\r\nAuthentication will continue to function \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status message should be expanded to say. \"This server is authenticating across All Domains\" or \"This server is authenticating to (a) specific domain(s).\" and then only display \"This server is not in your authentication search policy.\" if it actually isn't.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe status displays \"This server is responding normally. This server is not in your authentication search policy.\" when it clearly is in the authentication policy in some form. The message seems to be directly tied to the \"/Active Directory/All Domains\" path, and if its in the authentication search policy.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAll Versions of Leopard\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDisabling the \"Allow authentication from any domain in the forest\" option but not deleting the \"/Active Directory/All Domains\" keeps the message \"\"This server is responding normally.\" showing that its directly checking for the \"/Active Directory/All Domains\" path."
