    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApple Mail cannot show or modify the IMAP subscriptions list on most IMAP servers.\r\n\r\nIMAP supports the concept of folder \"subscriptions.\" This allows you to filter out folders you do not want to see in your IMAP client.\r\n\r\nThis does not work in Apple Mail when connected to most IMAP servers. It *does* work when using a genuine Exchange Server.\r\n\r\nIt also works from Mozilla Thunderbird at all times (i.e., the problem appears to be in Mail, not the server implementations.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In Apple Mail, set up either an IMAP account pointing to an IMAP server, such as Gmail, the commercial Kerio MailServer, or the popular open source implementations Dovecot and Cyrus.\r\n\r\n2. In Apple Mail, click the \"gear\" icon in the lower-left corner of Apple Mail. From the menu that appears, choose \"Get Account Info.\" The \"Account Info\" dialog will appear.\r\n\r\n3. In the \"Account Info\" dialog, click the \"Subscription List\" tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApple Mail should show the list of folders, and allow you to check and uncheck the ones you want to \"subscribe\" to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApple Mail shows a blank list.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe subscription functionality works when Mail is connected to an Exchange Server. As far as I can tell, this is the only time it works.\r\n\r\nApple Support Discussions shows many users having this problem: http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=5668307\r\n\r\nThe widely-used Dovecot IMAP server mentions the problem on its support wiki: http://wiki.dovecot.org/Clients\r\n\r\nGmail support discussions mentions the problem: http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-POP-and-IMAP-en/browse_thread/thread/65cf8e0b1780041d#"
