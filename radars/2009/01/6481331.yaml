    description: "I received some scans of photos done by a commercial scanning service. They are TIFF files. When I try to open them with Preview, I get the message \"Couldn't open the file. It may be corrupt or a file format that Preview doesn't recognize.\" \r\n\r\nThe files open fine in GraphicConverter X 6.1. \r\n\r\nSample file is included."
