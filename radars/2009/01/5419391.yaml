    description: "17-Aug-2007 11:42 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe new Interface Builder supports toolbars and toolbar items.  When using bindings, specifically, the \"enabled\" binding, the running the toolbar customization palette will cause a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached \"Toolbar\" application.\r\n2. Click \"Customize\" on the toolbar.\r\n3. Click on the \"Can Refresh\" checkbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking on the checkbox should change the state of the toolbar item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSince toolbar support in Interface Builder is new, there is no existing behavior to test.  However, using this new feature should not crash the application.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is an Xcode 3.0 project with an NSToolbar setup using Interface Builder 3.0.  I've added an NSToolbarItem called \"Refresh\" that has it's \"enabled\" binding bound to the controller's \"canRefresh\".  Also attached is a crash dump, with stack trace, of the application after the crash."
