    description: "Leopard 9F33: X11 libXaw (-lXaw) missing libXaw.la file\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen compiling software that requires libXaw and the linker flag -lXaw is used with libtool the dependancies are not found because the libXaw.la file does not exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nYou will need to make sure that you have developer tools installed and the X11 package found on the Leopard installation disk. I'm not sure if installation order matters but I installed Mac OS X, then Xcode, Mac OS X updates to 10.5.5, then X11 from the installation disk.\r\n\r\nThe best way to demonstrate this is with a small open source application called gpsd. First download revision 5001 from gpsd's subversion repository. Here are the commands to checkout the code and build it.\r\n\r\n$ svn checkout -r 5001 http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gpsd/trunk gpsd\r\n$ cd gpsd\r\n$ export LIBTOOL=glibtool\r\n$ export LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize\r\n$ sh ./autogen.sh\r\n$ make\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect for it to compile cleanly and not fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe compile failed. Because this configure is setup to search for libraries explicitly the first one it looks for is Xaw, it is found. It then fails as you see during the build because libtool didn't know about other dependancies it would normally find in the libXaw.la file and place them on the build line command.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nRevision 5002 of the gpsd repository works around this by changing the order the libraries are searched for placing it in the following order: libXaw8, libXaw7, and then libXaw last.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nCreate a symlink from /usr/X11/lib/libXaw.la -> /usr/X11/lib/libXaw8.la"
