    description: "24-Jun-2008 04:09 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nIn Mail.app, I resize the Message Status header to be larger than the default so that it shows the unread number, along with the blue dot.  After running for some time, the Message Status header changes size to only be wide enough for the blue dot and the unread number is no longer visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere's no specific action I can pinpoint that causes the problem, unfortunately.  All I can say is that it happens after Mail.app is running for some time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Message Status header should always remain the size that I set it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Message Status header basically spontaneously resizes itself to be narrower than I set it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt's occurred in all versions of Mail.app in 10.5.  I don't recall this issue in 10.4 Mail.app.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLet me know if there's something in the logs that could indicate an issue.  I don't know if other headers are also affected or resize themselves.  I just know that it happens for Message Status probably once a week for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Jun-2008 01:21 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nAttached is a before screen shot, with the blue dot and unread number available.  Once it reverts back, I'll take another screen shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mail - before.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Jun-2008 07:12 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nHere's my preferences with the headers sized the way I like.\r\n\r\n\r\n'com.apple.mail.plist' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 07:54 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nOkay, it just happened again. Attached is an \"after\" screenshot.  BTW, I've updated to 10.5.4 since filing this bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Mail - after.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2008 07:56 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nI'm also attaching my current preferences, after the problem occurs."
