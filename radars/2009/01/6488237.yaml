    description: "Keychain Access does not offer a way to view all the access any particular application has to secured data. It clearly keeps a list, because I'm prompted to grant (once or permanently) or deny access once an application such as Safari requests access to a password, but there's no UI to review or change this application.\r\n\r\nPeople need the ability to audit and remove such trust."
