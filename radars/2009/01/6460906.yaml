    description: "Since 10.3, the old dyld APIs have been gradually superseded by the standard dlopen/dlsym/dlclose APIs in <dlfcn.h>, and have been deprecated starting with 10.5.\r\n\r\nOne useful API which has no equivalents in <dlfcn.h>, however, is NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory. This is useful for loading libraries which have been code-compressed or stored into a database.\r\n\r\nI propose an additional API, such as:\r\nextern void * dlopen_memory(const void *address, size_t size, int __mode);\r\nwhich probably can be factored out from the existing implementation."
