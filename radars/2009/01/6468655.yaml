    description: "Pages currently does not support soft hyphenation. The documentation only mentions that one can turn off or on hyphenation completely per document, per paragraph or per word. Please add support for inserting one's own 'soft hyphens' so one can fix automatic hyphenation errors without having to worry that the (hard) hyphen will stay in the middle of the word whenever text re-wraps.\r\n\r\nThanks."
