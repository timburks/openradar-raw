    description: "Summary:\r\nIn quirks mode (i.e. with no doctype), document.querySelector and querySelectorAll accepts only lower case input. Any upper case characters cause the call to return no results. querySelectorAll will return all case variations on the selector if it is passed as lower case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached demo page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither 3/3/3 (if we're being case-insensitive, more likely), or 1/1/1 if we choose to be case-sensitive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFound all three for the lower case input, 0 for the other two inputs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown for older builds, WebKit nightlies behave correctly (return 3/3/3 in this test).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a fairly bad bug. It's natural for JavaScript coders to respect case, and that's not an option right now with querySelectorAll. The latest build of jQuery (which uses the sizzle engine) allows WebKit to handle many searches, so users are going to suddenly find code breaking (the jQuery team is working on a workaround, possibly just toLowerCase'ing everyone's selectors, which isn't ideal)."
