    description: "I'm writing [redacted] which allows user to take a photo from iPhone camera and upload it to the web. My application saves photo before uploading using UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum. Simple implementation is attached to this bug. Problem begins to appear if user decides to quit application to proceed with uploading later. Code is blocking for the image to save, but the application is being killed by the watchdog for taking too long to quit. However Camera.app makes the same thing and it is working properly in this case.\r\n\r\nDTS team recommended me to file an enhancement request regarding this issue (Follow-up  [redacted])."
