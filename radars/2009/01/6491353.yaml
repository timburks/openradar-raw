    description: "Summary:\r\nThe popup video player in iTunes responds to rollover (transport controls appear) even when it is not the frontmost window, but does not support clickthrough. In fact, clicking on the controls just causes them to disappear until the mouse is moved again. The popup player (because it is floating) should either support non-focusing clickthrough (player controls are usable when iTunes is not the frontmost application without activating iTunes) or the player should not respond to rollover\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a video in iTunes and open the floating video player (Now Playing window)\r\n2. Switch to a different window or application\r\n3. Mouse over the window\r\n4. Try to click on one of the controls\r\n5. Move the mouse\r\n6. Click one of the controls again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither controls should not appear in step three (because the player doesn't have focus) or they should be functional in step four (and should not disappear). Ideally, operating the controls should NOT activate iTunes. Whichever window had focus before should keep it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step three, transport controls appear. In step four, they disappear again without the click having done anything.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIIRC, this behavior changed in iTunes 8. Not sure, though.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a screen capture of the bug in action. Initially, a video is paused and the window is not in focus. I try clicking the play button. I move the mouse and click again, then switch to another application and repeat the process."
