    description: "Summary:\r\nDragging an image to Icon Composer from an image editor or browser causes the sheet which allows you to specify which sizes to fill not to close. It seems to be ended, as I can close the document and quit the app after clicking Import, but it is not ordered out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Icon Composer file\r\n2. Drag an image from a website to it and click Import\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSheet closes and fills in the specified sizes with the dragged image\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSheet stays and the sizes are not filled in."
