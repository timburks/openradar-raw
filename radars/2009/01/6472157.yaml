    description: "04-Jan-2009 02:48 PM Sidney San Martin:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a table in an HTML email has the contenteditable attribute set, all of it's content will be \"clickable\". Short taps do nothing, but long taps (>4 seconds) cause MobileMail to crash immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(The first x steps describe assembling an HTML message, and are not part of the bug)\r\n1. Create a new plain text document with extension \".html\"\r\n2. Paste the following line as the only content of the document:\r\n<table contenteditable><tr><td>Tap here for >4 seconds.</td></tr></table>\r\n3. Save the document and open it in Safari\r\n4. Choose \"Mail Contents of This Page\" from the File menu, and send the email to an address checked by an iPhone\r\n5. Open the email on the iPhone, and tap and hold on the text (it should become highlighted)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tap is completely ignored (this text should not be clickable).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text is \"clickable\", and any taps longer than a couple of seconds (long enough for an \"action\" flag to be shown in MobileSafari) cause MobileMail to crash.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ncontenteditable table content is also clickable in MobileSafari (a bug?) but does not cause crashes.\r\n\r\n\"Configuration information\" is a dummy file. What should we put here for iPhone bugs?\r\n\r\n\r\n'empty' was successfully uploaded"
