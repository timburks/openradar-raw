    description: "My G4 Server (10.4.11) has been having problems and froze during a reboot. \r\n\r\nMy MacBook Pro (10.5.6) has several user accounts, one of which has a portable home directory synced to the server. \r\n\r\nDuring the server's freeze, I could not log into ANY account on the MacBook! \r\n\r\nI would click on an account on the login screen, and the cursor would appear in the password field, as expected. \r\n\r\nAs soon as I typed a single character of the password, I got the beachball and the computer became unresponsive. My only way to continue was to hit the power button and select Restart. \r\n\r\nThis happened repeatedly, with different accounts on the MBPro, until I physically shut down the server. Then the MBPro was back to normal. \r\n\r\nIf I may editorialize a bit, this is horrendous behavior."
