    description: "19-Aug-2008 07:41 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nInterface Builder allows assigning cells to NSTableColumns in an NSTableView.  Unfortunately, you cannot use a custom cell that is a direct descendant of NSCell.  You can only use custom cells that are subclasses of one of the supplied cells in the Library (NSTextFieldCell, NSImageCell, etc.).  There is no plain NSCell in the Library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Double click on a cell in a table column\r\n2. Set the class to your custom cell in the inspector.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIB should allow you to use your custom cell.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIB beeps and does not allow you to assign the class name.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are two workarounds.  First, assign the cell programatically in awakeFromNib by calling setDataCell: on the NSTableColumn instance.  The other workaround is to make your cell a subclass of one of the cell types that IB supports: NSTextFieldCell, NSImageCell, etc."
