    description: "I would also like access to the Calendar store so that I can read and modify all of the existing calendars and their entries, plus create new calendars and entries. Functionality similar to what can be done with AppleScript and iCal on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nMy application is for syncing appointment data between the iPhone and a custom in-house appointment database over WiFi and/or cellular network."
