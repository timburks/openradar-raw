    description: "There is no way to add a new device to an Ad Hoc provisioning profile. If I add a user for beta testing, I have to manually recreate a new profile.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I have to CLICK A LOT OF FUCKING CHECKBOXES.\r\n\r\nAnd since I have multiple products, I have to PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH OF THESE FUCKING CHECKBOXES GET CHECKED.\r\n\r\nI know that this change was done to prevent people from distributing products using Ad Hoc profiles, but all it does is penalize the developers who are playing by the rules. And the end result is that I don't add new beta testers for our products (resulting in less testing and lower quality.)\r\n\r\nPlease deal with Ad Hoc abuse by revoking certificates, not by making the editing process more cumbersome.\r\n\r\n12-Jan-2009 04:26 PM Craig Hockenberry:\r\nI have my Ad Hoc profile back now. And it's not at all obvious what is causing the root of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe Distribution certificate had been removed (Program Portal > Certificates > Distribution.) That, in turn, led the Ad Hoc provision from being \"invalidated\" so that I could not edit it.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be some indicator on the provisioning pages that tells you to check your certificates. Removing the Edit link is not enough to infer the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nA lot of these confusing problems with the Program Portal could be avoided if developers received an email a few days prior to a certificate or provisioning profile expiration. As it is now, you have to go LOOK for what's broken when the system could easily TELL you what's about to change."
