    description: "I have a private root certificate, which I have added to the Keychain.\r\n\r\nI have an HP iLO server which uses an SSL cert signed by our private root cert. It does *not* present a chain -- just its own cert.\r\n\r\nSafari proper trusts the root cert and doesn't bother me about the iLO server cert.\r\n\r\nBut when I launch an in-page Java applet, I get the standard Safari trust dialog. I should not have to trust each individual iLO cert -- Safari/Java should trust the root cert per Keychain Access, just as Safari does for static pages.\r\n\r\nSee also #6516612 -- the Java trust dialog actually hangs Safari."
