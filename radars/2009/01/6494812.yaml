    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the “Close after builds: On No Errors or Warnings” setting, Xcode ignores any errors that occurred in a shell script build phase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an empty project.\r\n2. Add a new target shell script target.\r\n3. Add “echo 'error: demonstrating the problem'” to the shell script phase.\r\n4. Open the build results window.\r\n5. In Xcode’s preferences, select the “Build Results Window: Close after builds: On No Errors or Warnings” option on the Building pane.\r\n6. Build the target (⌘B).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should log the error, and leave the build results window open because of the error in there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode _does_ log the error, but immediately closes the build results window. This does _not_ occur if the error/warning occurred during a compile files build phase, but I can’t speak as to the results with any other phase types.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is particularly a pain for unit test targets. I’ve attached a minimal sample project which demonstrates the problem."
