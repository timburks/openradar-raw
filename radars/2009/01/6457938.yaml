    description: "18-Dec-2008 10:03 PM Todd Ditchendorf:\r\nSummary: \r\n-------------------\r\nIf you set \"Full Keyboard Access\" to \"All controls\" in the \"Keyboard & Mouse\" Preference Pane, then the keyboard focus cycle in the the Xcode \"Project Find\" window is broken. \r\n\r\nIf \"All Controlls\" is set in the prefpane, then it is not possible in the Xcode \"Project Find\" window to type the <tab> key to cycle focus from the \"Find:\" to the \"Replace:\" combo boxes via the keyboard (or most of the other controls). Moving keyboard focus between these two text fields (without needing to resort to mousing in between) is the most common need/interaction with this window, so this behavior can be extremely annoying/jarring. Note that if you set \"Full Keyboard Access\" to \"Text boxes and lists only\" in the \"Keyboard & Mouse\" Preference pane (the default setting), then the behavior *changes* and you *can* tab between these two fields. :-[\r\n\t\r\nNote this is a problem in all Xcode modes: \"Default\", \"Condensed\", and \"All-in-one\". The behavior differs very slightly in the \"All-in-one\" mode, but the basic problem is the same: full keyboard navigation (especially between \"Find:\" and \"Replace:\") is broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n---------------------\r\n1. Open System Preferences.app -> \"Keyboard & Mouse\" Preference Pane -> \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" tab\r\n2. At the bottom of the pref pane, set \"Full Keyboard Access\" to \"All Controls\"\r\n3. Open Xcode. type command-shift-F for \"Find In Project...\". \"Project Find\" window appears\r\n4. Click on the \"Find:\" combo box/text field to give it keyboard focus\r\n5. Type <tab> key. see keyboard focus move to the popup menu button to the right\r\n6. type <tab> key again. see keyboard focus move right back to the \"Find:\" combo box/ text field.\r\n7. repeat. see focus only toggle between \"Find:\" and the popup menu to the right\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n---------------------\r\nIn step 5 or 6 (or perhaps later), keyboard focus should have moved to the \"Replace:\" text field. That is the most common keyboard interaction with this window. It would be nice if you could navigate to *all* of the controls in this window when \"Full Keyboard Access\" is set to \"All controls\", as that is clearly what the user has requested. But at least keyboard focus should cycle thru the \"Find:\" and \"Replace:\" text fields, since that is the most common interaction need.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n----------------------\r\nKeyboard focus cycles uselessly between two out of several controls, even tho the user has requested full keyboard navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n----------------------\r\nNone. This has been the behavior for as long as I can remember (at least 2 years).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n--------------------\r\nThis problem does not affect the \"Single File Find...\" window (command-F).\r\n\r\n\r\n'Xcode keyboard focus bug.png' was successfully uploaded"
