    description: "Summary: \r\nMozilla Firefox (as of 3.0) has extremely nice autocompletion in its URL bar, including sorting by frequency and recency, searching page titles, and searching bookmarks and history. I've been switching back and forth between Safari and Firefox lately and this has stood out as the single biggest advantage (for me) that Firefox has. I've even been able to hide the bookmarks bar due to it, freeing up more screen space. It'd be great if Safari got something similar. Supposedly Google Chrome has a similar feature that they've dubbed the \"omnibar\", but I haven't tried it."
