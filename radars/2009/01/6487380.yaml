    description: "When trying to refactor a class name to the same name but with changed case, Xcode thinks this file rename is impossible because a file named that already exists. Sample error message when trying to rename bitshiftAppDelegate into BitshiftAppDelegate:\r\n\r\n\"File with new name “BitshiftAppDelegate.h” already exists at same location as file with old name “bitshiftAppDelegate.h”.\r\n\r\nMove existing file or choose another name.\"\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nJust realize it's the same file and rename it."
