    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user launches an NSStatusItem-based application with LSUIElement set, any changes to their Spaces preferences will not take effect in the application until the user restarts said application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch and build a release version of the attached sample project.\r\n2. Launch the release version of the sample.\r\n3. Go to Spaces preferences and adjust it so that the window only appears in a specific space.\r\n4. Notice that this preference is not currently respected.\r\n5.  restart the sample app.\r\n6. Try testing the Spaces setting again.  it should open in the proper Space now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDock-based applications grab Spaces changes automatically.  I would expect Dockless windows to do so as well.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user thinks my application does not work with Spaces properly because they have to restart to get their Spaces preferences to stick.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations."
