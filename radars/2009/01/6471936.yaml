    description: "Summary:\r\nIf while ripping new tracks from a CD, you select other, unrelated tracks and delete them, a \"Deleting items...\" progress bar appears for several seconds, and the items are moved to the trash, but the track listing remains in the iTunes Library, giving the false impression that the items have not been deleted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart importing (ripping) tracks from a CD, in my case, the import is set to AAC \"Higher Quality\". The preference is also set to \"Import and Eject\". While the CD track are importing, select unrelated tracks from the main Music library. Press the Delete key on the keyboard. When asked, click the confirmation buttons \"Remove\" and \"Move to Trash\".\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe selected tracks will be deleted from the iTunes library listing and will be moved to the trash.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nA \"Deleting items...\" modal dialogue appears with a progress bar that takes several seconds per track selected to complete. The files for the tracks are moved to the trash, but the track listing remains in the iTunes library, giving the impression that the items have not been deleted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs under iTunes 8.0.2. Older versions unavailable for testing.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
