    description: "If you add a Run Script Build Phase to the end of a Target, that script is run before code signing occurs. This prevents the build from doing important things like:\r\n\r\n1) Packaging the final product in a ZIP file for upload to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\n2) Archiving the .app and .dSYM files in safe place for later symbolification (using symbolicatecrash and atos)."
