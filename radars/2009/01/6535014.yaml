    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode’s refactoring feature does not work with file types set to open in an external editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Work on a copy of your project.\r\n2. Set text file types to open in an external editor (for example TextMate) in Xcode’s File Types preferences.\r\n3. Open an Objective-C class interface and select a method.\r\n4. Open the refactoring window, and preview renaming the method to some other name. (Ideally pick a method and new selector that will not generate any warnings, for clarity.)\r\n5. Select one of the files with changes listed.\r\n6. Click “Apply” and then save all source files.\r\n7. Search for the original method name in the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 4, a FileMerge-esque pane should have been shown at the bottom of the refactoring window, showing the changes to be made to the file.\r\nAt step 7, there should not have been any instances of the method in the source. (A like-named method on other classes is okay; the same selector on the same class is not.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt step 4, the diff pane is blank, without any explanation.\r\nAt step 7, some or all of the source files will still retain the original method selector despite the rename refactoring having been applied.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a workaround, make Xcode the editor for text file types again, apply the refactoring, and then switch it back to TextMate. Then file a bug report duplicating this one out of frustration."
