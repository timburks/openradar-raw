    description: "Summary: \r\nThe Threading Programming Guide does not mention which thread-unsafe classes are usable from a background thread.  It has come to my attention that many thread-unsafe classes are also only usable from the main thread.  This is an important distinction that should be discussed explicitly in the Threaded Programming Guide.  Often times it is useful to spawn a background thread to avoid blocking the main thread, but this is not possible if a class is only usable on the main thread.  Appendix A of this document should also clarify which thread-unsafe classes are main-thread only and which are not."
