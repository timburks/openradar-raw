    description: "Summary:\r\nQT's native RGB format is k32ARGBPixelFormat, so if a codec allows decompression to both ARGB and RGBA it will choose the first. However, NVidia GPUs only natively support RGBA, and OpenGL has to perform a very slow texture conversion for every ARGB image. QT should support RGBA directly to avoid the major speed hit. (and macs should stop shipping nvidia since the drivers are so awful, but that won't happen)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Move attached \"Perian argb logging.component\" to ~/Library/QuickTime/.\r\n2. Run \"/Applications/QuickTime Player.app/Contents/MacOS/QuickTime Player\" in Terminal.\r\n3. Open attached \"nasa subtitled.mov\"\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nQT to use RGBA as the pixel format.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nQT uses ARGB (0x20).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone, has happened for as long as I can remember.\r\nNot a problem with ATi GPUs, not tested with Intel GPUs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached Shark profile was generated with the attached movie.\r\nSince there's only one frame in the ARGB subtitle track, it's very odd that the texture conversion for it is at the top of the profile; this might indicate some algorithmic problem which is more important than this bug. But please fix this one too.\r\n\r\nThe second highest function in Shark uses lame instructions like pinsrw/prefetcht0 which are slow or unnecessary under i386. Try fixing the data layout to get rid of them, SSE is not as flexible as Altivec."
