    description: "The kAudioSessionCategory_AmbientSound category of audiosessions is fine. But when the music is loud, you cannot add a lot of sound content above it. \r\n\r\nWhat would be very nice would be for the other sound channels to decrease when you set your sessionActive, play your sound at full level and then put the other channels back at their original levels.\r\n\r\nJust like when a mail arrives and you're listening to your iPod. Or like when you're using your Nanon +Nike+ and you have oral feedback on distance or time.\r\n\r\nJıɹʎɔ"
