    description: "Xcode 3.1.1's built-in docs for IOObjectRelease() do not say whether or not the function is thread safe.  Likewise for its header IOKitLib.h.  Please improve the docs by adding a comment about this.\r\n\r\nContrast with the old Carbon DisposePtr() method:\r\n\r\nIn MacMemory.h it says:\r\n\r\n *  Mac OS X threading:\r\n *    Thread safe since version 10.3\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of comment I seek for IOObjectRelease().\r\n\r\nI'd like to know if it is safe or not to call IOObjectRelease() from an Obj-C finalize method, but the docs have failed me in this instance."
