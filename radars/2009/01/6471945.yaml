    description: "Summary:\r\nMultiple episodes of the same podcast synced to the iPhone are treated as a song playlist and are played continuously, one into the other. This behavior is inconsistent with how podcasts are played on all iPods and versions of the iPhone prior to 2.2, which play one episode and then stop. This behavior also makes it very hard to keep \"x (least|most) recent new\" podcasts synced to the iPhone, because as soon as the first few seconds of the next episode start to play on the iPhone, the episode is no longer marked as new, and will be removed upon next sync, even if the episode was not intended to be listened to yet; causing a lot of unnecessary hand-modification of the \"new\" flag within iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSync \"x (least|most) recent new\" (where x>1) episodes of audio podcasts to iPhone. Play the first episode.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nWhen the episode is completely played, iPhone will revert to a stopped state, not playing anything.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\niPhone continues playing into the next episode until all episodes are played, unless the iPhone is manually stopped *before* the completion of the first episode played.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs under iPhone OS 2.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAll iPods and iPhones have worked the way I have wanted them to until this point - play one complete podcast episode, then stop. This new behaviour breaks the way I listen to podcasts, and especially becomes a problem when I may not be able to manually stop iPhone from continuing to play because I am incapacitated in some fashion, such as being asleep."
