    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone OS supports only QWERTY for English input, not Dvorak.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Settings.\r\n2. Tap General.\r\n3. Tap International.\r\n4. Tap Keyboards.\r\n\r\n1. Launch Settings.\r\n2. Tap Keyboard.\r\n3. Tap International Keyboards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA row named “English (Dvorak)”, or something similar, inhabits the list, and the user can enable it in preference to the default “English” (QWERTY) layout.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo row exists for Dvorak.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. This option has never existed in the iPhone OS before; this is a request.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI use an iPod touch, not an iPhone. I don't know whether the product should be “iPhone” (for its OS) or “iPod” (for its brand name)."
