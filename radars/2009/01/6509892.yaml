    description: "Summary: \r\nImmediately after launching any iPhone application it's possible to trigger Springboard to scroll to a new page of applications.  This behavior is stopped eventually during application launch usually mid-animation causing the Springboard to appear to be stuck between two pages of applications.  I've been able to reproduce this on three iPhone 3Gs, one iPod Touch 1G and one iPod Touch 2G.  All running various iterations of 2.X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure you have more than screen of applications. \r\n2. Tap any application icon to start it up.\r\n3. Immediately after tapping the icon, start to try to swipe left and/or right.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Springboard to not attempt to scroll left/right after launching an Application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpringboard still tries to scroll left or right while the application is launching.  You can see the icons moving behind the app launching Animation.  Once the app closes it will usually return to the Springboard on a whole different screen or sometimes stuck between two screens.  It looks a bit strange, and would be very disorientating to a user to be on a different screen or messed up screen upon return.  The user can easily re-scroll the screen again, nothing is stuck for good, but most would be unsure what is going on.\r\n\r\nI've attached a video of this bug as well.  If the attachment fails, it can be accessed at:\r\nhttp://patrickmccarron.com/temp/OddSpringboardGlitch.mp4\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf you are quick enough it happens every time, but a half second of delay causes it not to happen.  This you can see in the video as well, as I missed once during filming and didn't feel like editing it out.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot a huge bug, but can be disorientating to the user that may accidentally do it.  That's how I discovered it by improperly swiping and causing a firing open of an Application."
