    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working in an Xcode iPhone project, there are currently three available Executables, one for each iPhone OS version (2.0, 2.1, 2.2). When working on a 2.2-only project, I need to run with the 2.2 Executable, or it won't even run. When I switch to the Device as the active SDK, and then back to the Simulator as the active SDK, the Active Executable will be for OS version 2.0, even though it was at 2.2 previously.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an iPhone project that requires OS 2.2 by linking with AVFoundation (just to make the error obvious)\r\n2. Switch to Simulator (2.2) as active SDK\r\n3. Set YourApp - iPhone Simulator 2.2 as the Active Executable\r\n4. Switch to Device (2.2) as active SDK\r\n5. Switch to Simulator (2.2) as active SDK\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. The Active Executable version matches that of the selected SDK's version\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. The first Executable is selected as Active, which means the 2.0 executable is chosen instead of the 2.2.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown"
