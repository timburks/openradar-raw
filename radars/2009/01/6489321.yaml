    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no publicly available API for Import/Export plug-ins for Final Cut Pro.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nQuoting from the 2003 press release for Final Cut Pro 4 <http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/apr/06fcp4.html>:\r\n\r\n\"This new [XML] standards-based composition and metadata interchange format, combined with a new import/export plug-in API, allows developers to create tools that integrate Final Cut Pro 4 into a wide range of production workflows.\"\r\n\r\nI'm looking for to create an export plug-in for Final Cut Pro that will appear in FCP's \"Export\" menu, much like Automatic Duck XML Export. Currently I'm working on a separate app that will modify an exported XML, but if I could integrate the export as a menu item, that would make my client's lives that much easier. The PR piece above seems to say that this API would be made available to developers with the release of Final Cut Pro 4, almost six years ago.\r\n\r\nI asked about this on the pro-apps-dev mailing list, and was informed:\r\n\r\n\"There is no publicly available API to do what you want. Writing a separate app which modifies exported XML is the only supported way to do this at this time.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that was never made available as that PR piece seems to have promised. It would make my less tech-savvy clients (and believe me, there are plenty of them, especially in Associate Producer and Production Assistant positions) a lot more comfortable with getting the data they need out of Final Cut Pro.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
