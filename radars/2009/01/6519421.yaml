    description: When I type words into cells, Numbers underlines unknown words as possible misspellings. But when I Control-click on the highlighted word in the cell area, I don't get an option to learn it. When I click on it in the data entry field at the top of the window, there is no Learn Spelling option. I have to double-click the word, and then Control-click to get the Learn Spelling item.
