    description: I'm trying to have OS X rotate randomly through a set of photos in a folder, using the Tile setting. But it frequently seems to forget which set of photos to use, or to use the Tile setting. Sometimes (when I plug other monitors in) it even reverts to an iPhoto album I used to use for wallpaper. It's annoying.
