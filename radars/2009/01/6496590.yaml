    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Phone app, if you go to the Voicemail tab, if the proximity sensor gets activated (hold phone to face, put hand over sensor, etc), the iPhone screen goes black.  This should happen when a message is being played, but this also happens if a message is not being played (which makes it difficult to select a message to be played if there is nothing on the screen).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Phone app\r\n2. Go to Voicemail tab\r\n3. Don't start playing a message\r\n4. Cover proximity sensor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing should happen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen goes black\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
