    description: "A very common issue with MacBooks and second monitors is, you disconnect - then later reconnect a second monitor and you then have to manually move every window around to get back to where you were.\r\n\r\nThere are a few forum threads describing this in more detail...\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8818780&#8818780\r\n\r\nBasically OS X should remember the size and locations of windows on the 2nd monitor; then when the second monitor comes back restore them. (Folks could always disable this behaviour if they wished - but it seems everyone I mention this issue to has a similar gripe and wants the same behaviour). For this one usability improvement I'd happily pay for a new upgrade of OS X and I'm sure others would too :)\r\n\r\nI've seen this come up on numerous twitter comments too\r\nhttp://twitter.com/vmassol/statuses/1106702264\r\nhttp://twitter.com/aulia/statuses/1103455255\r\nhttp://twitter.com/ericholscher/statuses/973184511"
