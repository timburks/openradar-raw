    description: "iTunes Connect automatically updates the availability date to an incorrect value. This update also results in the product becoming unavailable.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open the pricing page in iTunes Connect with Manage Your Applications > Edit Information > Pricing\r\n\r\n2) Change your pricing tier and click on \"Save Changes\".\r\n\r\nAt this point, your availability date has gone from being in 2008 to being in 2009. In most cases, this also means that your product will also be unavailable in iTunes since the month and date have not changed. (Our product availability went from November 12th, 2008 to November 12th, 2009.)"
