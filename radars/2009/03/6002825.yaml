    description: "Summary\r\nCalculating the first weekday of a date's week for the Russian locale yields the next week.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nThe following code works correctly for the US locale, the weekStart variable pointing to the last Sunday. However, if the Russian locale is set in Settings applications, General>International>Region Format, the weekStart variable points to the next Sunday.\r\n// Get today's week\r\nNSDateComponents *thisWeek = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components: NSEraCalendarUnit | NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSWeekCalendarUnit fromDate: [NSDate date]];\r\n// Get the first day of this week\r\nNSUInteger firstDay = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] maximumRangeOfUnit: NSWeekdayCalendarUnit].location;\r\n// Get the start of the first day of this week as NSDate in the current time zone\r\n[thisWeek setWeekday: firstDay];\r\nNSDate *weekStart = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] dateFromComponents: thisWeek];\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nWeeks traditionally start on Monday in Russia, so the correct result would be the last Monday. Given that Russia uses the same Gregorian calendar as the United States, the last Sunday is also correct.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nThe following results were observed on June 12, 2008.\r\nExamining thisWeek variable shows that it contains the same components for both locales:\r\nEra=1 Year=2008 Month=6 Week=24 Weekday=1\r\nHowever, the dates calculated by NSCalendar are different:\r\nRussian locale: (2008-06-15 00:00:00 +0400 - 2008-06-22 00:00:00 +0400)\r\nUS locale: (2008-06-08 00:00:00 +0400 - 2008-06-15 00:00:00 +0400)"
