    description: "28-Feb-2009 07:23 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you remove a bookmark from the Bookmarks Menu, it will still appear under the \"Bookmarks\" section of the address bar until Safari is restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have a URL which appears under \"Bookmarks\" in the address bar. (see notes)\r\n2. Remove the URL using the bookmark editor.\r\n3. Start typing the URL in the address bar.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe URL doesn't appear under \"Bookmarks\" (though it may still appear in History or Top Hit).\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe URL still appears under Bookmarks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was a bookmark added under Safari 3 and I haven't cleared history. Had trouble reproducing with a new bookmark (see notes).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can't get this to happen with another URL, maybe because all the websites I can think of to add as bookmarks are already Top Hits and therefore continue to appear as such in the address bar after bookmarking them.\r\n\r\nI wish all URLs did that; for some of my bookmarks, I can't get them to appear as the top hit even after visiting them constantly, so they always appear as the last item in the address bar autocomplete."
