    description: "Summary:\r\nThe number pad variant of UIKeyboard presently does not offer the ability to expose a decimal point for entering float or double values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like an option that would allow me to expose a decimal in the bottom-left corner where there is presently a blank field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am iterating through the view hierarcy to find the keyboard and adding a custom view where the decimal should be.  Workable, but still, less code for me == more gooder.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
