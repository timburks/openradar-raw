    description: "Summary: \r\n\tA request to have the DiskManagement.framework made public (it is currently private)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\t1) Look in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks and see that DiskManagement.framework is there.\r\n\t2) Look in /System/Library/Frameworks and notice that DiskManagement.framework is not there.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\tWithout DiskManagement.framework it is difficult to get the bay number for a drive. There are many other functions that would be very helpful for sys-admins creating small programs to control their systems with this framework. It is currently use-at-your-own-risk, and I would prefer to not have to write around this and be fearful with every update."
