    description: "28-Feb-2009 07:48 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nI don't know how to backup my browsing history and all that to have a clean history, so I'm not able to create reproduction steps for this.\r\n\r\nI frequently use the WWWJDIC Text Word Translation page:\r\nhttp://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?9T\r\n\r\nwhich POSTs a form to:\r\nhttp://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?9U\r\n\r\n(paste 雨男 into the form and click Begin Translation)\r\n\r\nThe second page includes the original form in it, and the form target is that page again. So I end up POSTing to the second page more than I load the first page.\r\n\r\nHowever, the second page only works if POSTed to; it just shows an error if you load it directly. Despite this, Safari sees it as the more frequently-visited page and it is currently what my address bar autocompletes 'css' to. Instead, it shouldn't count POSTs as page visits for the purposes of autocompletion."
