    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have an NSProgressIndicator on a layer backed view it's animation seems to get blocked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a layer backed view\r\n2. Add an NSProgressIndicator\r\n3. Launch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe progress indicator should animate (not too hard to expect given we're using Core Animation ;) )\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress indicator doesn't animate\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can get around this by turning off the layer backing for the view the NSProgressIndicator is in after any animations you perform have finished, but in some cases this may not be possible."
