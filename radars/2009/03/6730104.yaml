    description: "Summary: \r\nSometimes is needed to have other values for the labels of an UISwitch (for example YES | NO instead of ON | OFF). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse a UISwitch control in an iPhone app. See that it has the labels ON | OFF. See that there's not possible to change them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be a public API to allow the developers to change the values of these labels."
