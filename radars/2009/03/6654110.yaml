    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nADC members should be able to discuss upcoming seeds on the AppleSeed forums.\r\n\r\nGiven the relative numbers of people who have access to upcoming seeds via ADC compared to AppleSeed, it would be incredibly useful for ADC members to be given access to the AppleSeed forums.\r\n\r\nThe current small community around AppleSeed has yet to reach a critical mass where the discussion forums are useful with regular posts that include whether a particular issue has been reported as a bug to Apple or not.\r\n\r\nIf there was a larger community on these forums, all of us who have access to the seeds would be much more effective testers, as we wouldn't be wasting our time supplying detailed bug reports for issues that Apple already knows about.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Buy ADC Premier account\r\n2. Search for Apple sanctioned discussion forum regarding unreleased OS X seeds.\r\n3. DENIED\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expected to be able to participate in an Apple sanctioned community where we can safely discuss seeds with others who are under the same NDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI could not find such a community..\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
