    description: "Sites dragged into Top Sites do not initially have \"delete\" and \"pin\" buttons\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt is possible to manually add a site to Top Sites by opening a second Safari window, selecting Top Sites, and then clicking Edit and dragging the site's favicon into Top Sites.\r\n\r\nHowever, when doing so the UI of Top Sites exhibits some inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a site in Safari 4 that you would like to add to \"Top Sites\". For my example, we'll use http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page.\r\n\r\n2. Open another window in Safari 4 by pressing Command-N.\r\n\r\n3. In the new window, show \"Top Sites\" if it is not already showing. (Shift-Command-1).\r\n\r\n4. Still in the new window, click the \"Edit\" button in the lower-right corner of Top Sites.\r\n\r\n5. Back in the first window (the one showing the jQuery API documentation), select the \"favicon\" -- the tiny icon next to the URL in the address bar and drag it into the Top Sites view in the second window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe site you added should appear in Top Sites and should have an \"X\" and a \"pushpin\" badged over it, just like all the other entries in Top Sites.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe site does get added to Top Sites, but does not have an \"X\" nor a \"pushpin\" control."
