    description: "Summary:\r\nNSEvent provides methods to create key events, mouse events, enter/exit events, and other events. It provides no way to create a scroll wheel event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry really hard to create a scroll wheel event. Give up using public API and resort to using -setValue:forKey: with an existing scroll wheel event.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to find a method -[NSEvent scrollWheelEventWithLocation:modifierFlags:timeStamp:windowNumber:context:deltaX:deltaY:deltaZ:].\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to create a scroll wheel event using NSEvent. Scroll wheel events created by way of a CGEventRef do not properly detect the window number, location in window, or context. I didn't try going by way of a Carbon EventRef yet, but that should really be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't think there's ever been a way to create a scroll wheel event using NSEvent/AppKit."
