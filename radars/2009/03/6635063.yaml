    description: "01-Mar-2009 07:24 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nThanks to a defective HD, I found an error in the Italian localization of the DiskArbitrarion framework version 2.2.1. It's in the Localizable.strings file [1].\r\n\r\nThe last line is:\r\n\"\\\" was not repairable by this computer. It is being made available to you with limited functionality. You must back up your data and reformat the disk as soon as possible.\" = \"” non può essere riparato da questo computer. È disponibile con funzionalità limitata. Devi eseguire i dati e riformattare il disco appena possibile.\";\r\n\r\nIt should be:\r\n\"\\\" was not repairable by this computer. It is being made available to you with limited functionality. You must back up your data and reformat the disk as soon as possible.\" = \"” non può essere riparato da questo computer. È disponibile con funzionalità limitata. Devi eseguire il backup dei dati e riformattare il disco appena possibile.\";\r\n\r\nI attached a diff output.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] </System/Library/Frameworks/DiskArbitration.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Italian.lproj/Localizable.strings>\r\n\r\n\r\n'diff_out.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n28-Aug-2009 11:41 AM Vanaja Pasumarthi :\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nSnow Leopard Client is available commercially as of August 28th, 2009 at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/\r\n\r\nUpon installing this software, please update this bug report with your results.\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Sep-2009 09:10 PM KIT CHEUNG :\r\nThis bug has been closed.  Engineering does not have enough information to properly investigate this reported issue.  This report will be reopened once the requested information has been provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Nov-2009 11:15 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI saw that on Snow Leopard the Localizable.strings file has been mainly rewritten and the error in the Italian localization of the file has gone.\r\nAnyway, while I was reviewing the new file I may have spotted a typo that could be present in the Localizable.string files of every localization.\r\n\r\nLine 7 is:\r\n\".\\\"\" = \".”\";\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the two characters should be switched because the dot should not be part of the disk name embraced by the left and right double quotation marks.\r\n\r\nThat is, line 7 should be:\r\n\"\\\".\" = \"”.\";\r\n\r\nI don't have a Snow Leopard system to test right now (I only have got the file from a friend of mine), so I apologize if my deduction is wrong.\r\n\r\n21-Sep-2009 10:10 PM KIT CHEUNG :\r\nThis bug has been closed.  Engineering does not have enough information to properly investigate this reported issue.  This report will be reopened once the requested information has been provided."
