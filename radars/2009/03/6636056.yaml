    description: "iChat Theater using iChat 4.0.7 (616) didn't work for a slideshow containing movies. Apparently the movie was cropped or stretched to a minimal frame that was only ~10 px high. The movie's resolution is 1280*720.\r\n\r\nIt was only possible to drag single photos onto the iChat Theater window."
