    description: "Summary:\r\nA NSView doesn't keep its custom bounds when its frame changes, contrary to the behavior documented for setFrame:.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInit a NSView subclass, give it a custom bounds rectangle, and resize it, causing its frame rectangle to change.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bounds rectangle remains the same, as documented in the NSView class reference for the setFrame: message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bounds are proportionally changed to match the new frame such that the scale factor remains the same.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would probably break things to change the behavior to the documented one, so I guess it's more of a documentation fix (or perhaps, a documentation clarification if it's just that I failed to understand it). I have enclosed a project that reproduces the problem; in it, the custom view is set to be resized when the window containing it is resized, so resizing the window changes the view frame, and since the square stays of the same size it's obvious the bounds do change as well. In a #if 0 comment is the workaround I use to get the documented behavior which is the one I am looking for, if you enable that code you see the square scale with the window."
