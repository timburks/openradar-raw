    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you set up a split view to allow it's subviews to collapse, it sets a state as to whether the subview is collapsed or not, which seems to be independent of the size of the view (ie whether it appears to be collapsed). Manually dragging a split view to collapse an item sets this state. Double clicking to collapse does not\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSSplitView\r\n2. Set it up so you can double click to collapse\r\n3. Double click the divider.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI appears to collapse the subview and sets the subview's state to collapsed. Clicking on the divider again will move it back to it's previous position\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI appears to collapse the subview, but it is not set to collapsed. As such, double clicking on the divider again does nothing\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can work around the double clicking to move back to the previous position side of things if you want to but it's code you shouldn't have to write. I've included a sample program to show the issue with a split view and labels telling you whether the opposite split view is technically collapsed. Dragging to the top or bottom manually will show that it collapses them. Double clicking will appear to collapse it to the bottom, but won't actually collapse it. If you then drag the divider down it will set its state to collapsed"
