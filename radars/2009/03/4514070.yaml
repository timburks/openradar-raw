    description: "14-Apr-2006 10:01 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt would be great if Xcode would run shell script phases also when the clean build action is performed, not only with the build and install build actions.\r\nWith this enhancement it would be possible to perform some custom cleaning actions with shell scripts that check the ACTION build setting. This could be very useful when Xcode uses shell scripts to run external programs, such as make, to build applications or libraries."
