    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nIn iPhone OS 3.0, a new messages icon was introduced. The old messages icon, while lacking the new seemingly useless diagonal stripes, was perfectly OK, it only had 'SMS' overlaid on top of it, hence it was redesigned.\r\n\r\nIn OS 3.0, the Messages icon gets not only an almost indiscernable bubble shape, but the gloss layer on the icon also DARKENS the bubble, while lightening the green surrounding area. This is not only inconsistent with -all- system icons, it also makes the icon hard to discern,  and it is aesthetically not pleasing. Not to mention, developers are supplied with a default method to apply gloss to their own icons, which is again, completely inconsistent with the design of this icon. While it may seem like a trivial modification of an icon, the horrible mis-design of this particular icon sets is so significantly apart from the system set that it warrants a bug report.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nSlide and unlock iPhone. Look at icon in the top left corner. Curl up in disgust.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nSee an icon that is consistent with the rest of the OS style and icons, and consistent with what Apple offers developers for styling their own icons.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\nSee an icon that appears to be erroneously rendered, and darkens white when gloss is applied (???), which is inconsistent with the rest of the system icon style and what Apple offers developers for styling their own icons. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAll previous versions of iPhone software feature a well-designed icon for SMS. Removing the 'SMS' text from this is a sufficient solution to the problem. Apply diagonal stripes if necessary."
