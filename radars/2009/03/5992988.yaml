    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen -[UINavigationController pushViewController:animated:] is animating to view that is very long, the animation is broken, and it appears to shred the contents of the destination screen.  This problem does not occur in the emulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart with a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nCreate a destination UIViewController.  \r\nIts view should contain a UITableView using style UITableViewStyleGrouped.\r\nThe table has a single cell of varible size.  \r\nThe cell contains a UILabel.\r\nThe height of the cell is 2226 pixels.\r\n\r\nInvoke [navController pushViewController: destinationView animated: YES].\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe destinationView slides smoothly from the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved results:\r\n\r\nThe screen appears to shred, and the destinationView never appears intact.\r\nA screenshot from Xcode shows just a black square where the view should appear, but the phone shows a shredded view.\r\nI'm attaching:\r\n* photo of the shredded screen\r\n* screenshot from the phone (which shows black box instead of shredding)\r\n* screen shot of emulator, which works fine\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe problem does not occur when the height of the UITableViewCell is shorter.\r\n\r\nThe problem did not occur in Beta 5."
