    description: "Previously, permissions for Folders created by Users within Finder, could be set using .GlobalPreferences.plist file to set the permissions mask value.  Finder appears to be ignoring this setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd a NSUmask setting for users, for example:\r\n\r\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences NSUmask 0 \r\n\r\nshould open up permissions completely, rwxrwxrwx  \r\n\r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\n\r\nAll Folders/files created through Finder are now always 'read only' for 'group' and 'other', regardless of the above plist file setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\n\r\nThis has been tried on various hardware and software versions of Leopard up to the latest Leopard build, but is still an issue.  This working method was fine in Tiger\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\n\r\nPreferences can still be set for Folders/files created through terminal, by adding a 'umask' setting in, for example, a .tcshrc file in the users home directory.  E.g.\r\n\r\numask 0000\r\n\r\nto mimic the above example of rwxrwxrwx"
