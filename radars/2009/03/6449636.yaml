    description: "The Xcode user script editor should have an option to run the script in the current project's directory. \r\n\r\nCurrently, you can choose, Home Directory, File System Root or Selection. Choosing Selection sometimes works, if the file you're editing is in the same directory as the .xcodeproj bundle and the source editor has focus. If no file is being edited, or the group tree has focus, then it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful, for example, to run the LLVM static analyzer from the User Scripts menu."
