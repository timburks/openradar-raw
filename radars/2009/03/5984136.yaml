    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing iPhone SDK beta 6, my app allows the user to call phone numbers.  If the device does not support dialing, it presents a very ugly alert box.  To avoid the alert, I want the app to determine whether the device can make calls.  However, the iPhone SDK API does not provide that information.   \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn Objective-C code, generate an NSURL in the format \"tel:8185551212\".  \r\nPass that URL to -[UIApplication openURL:].\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen the device can't make phone calls, -[UIApplication openURL:] should return a friendly message like \"Sorry, this device is not able to make phone calls.\"\r\n\r\nEven better, UIApplication or UIDevice would have a method to pre-flight the URL and make sure it can be handled.  Then an application can change its UI to prevent calls from being attempted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe device shows the alert \"Unsupported URL\" \"This URL wasn't loaded: tel:8185551212\".\r\n\r\nThere is no API for determining whether the device can make calls.  The -[NSURLConnection canHandleRequest:] method does not support \"tel:\" URLs, even on devices that can make calls."
