    description: "Summary: \r\nNSURLConnection connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse: delegate method does not properly cancel the connection\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile the source code at http://pitaya.ch/radar/urlconnectionRedirect.m\r\n2. Run with ./urlconnectionRedirect -cancelRedirect YES\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe connection:didReceiveData: and connectionDidFinishLoading: messages are sent to the ConnectionDelegate as documented in file:///Developer/Documentation/DocSets/com.apple.ADC_Reference_Library.CoreReference.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLConnection_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001697-BAJHIIDH\r\n\"If the delegate wishes to cancel the redirect, it should call the connection objectâ€™s cancel method. Alternatively, the delegate method can return nil to cancel the redirect, and the connection will continue to process. This has special relevance in the case where redirectResponse is not nil. In this case, any data that is loaded for the connection will be sent to the delegate, and the delegate will receive a connectionDidFinishLoading or connection:didFailLoadingWithError: message, as appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf nil is returned in connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse: then the connection is terminated and no more message is sent to the delegate at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on Mac OS X 10.5.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSteve Mykytyn had the exact same problem: http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2008/10/5/219452\r\nThe workaround suggested in reply to this message does not work.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you close this bug as \"Behaves correctly\", I come to Cupertino and I kick your ass."
