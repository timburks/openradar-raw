    description: "Assume the following:\r\n\r\n1) You have version 1.0 of an app that works with SDK 2.2.\r\n2) You love the new stuff in SDK 3.0 and release version 2.0 of your app.\r\n\r\nA bug is discovered in your app. It can be easily be fixed in both version 1.0 and 2.0 of your app.\r\n\r\nYou cannot release a fix for version 1.0 because iTunes Connect only allows one version to be uploaded. And since version 2.0 is using features specific to SDK 3.0 customers MUST upgrade the OS in order to get the fix.\r\n\r\nIn the case of iPod touch owners, this will cost them money. I don't like it when customers have to pay for my stupidity."
