    description: "When using the Apple Remote with an iPhoto 09 slideshow and performing functions like Pause/Play, Next and Previous the slideshow sometimes hangs and can not be closed using the UI. (The particular slideshows where this happened contained movies, but we didn't check whether this condition is needed to trigger the bug.)\r\nIn this state, the whole screen except the menu bar is taken by the slideshow, no dock or other apps are shown. Switching apps via Cmd-Tab is not possible.\r\n\r\nThe only resolution is to quit iPhoto regularly using Cmd-Q."
