    description: "Summary: \r\nThere is no visual feedback that you are viewing a password protected (.htaccess) website that you have already entered the password for and committed it to keychain\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit a .htaccess protected site.\r\n2. Enter your password at the prompt, remember it/add to keychain\r\n3. Restart Safari\r\n4. Revisit original site\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to be prompted for my password again, perhaps with the user and password automatically filled in? or at least some sort of visual clue that previously stored username and password have been used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPage loads without password request, and no visual feedback that you are on a password protected site\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has always happened in Safari\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFirefox prompts for my password again, with the user and password automatically filled in. This is a better approach."
