    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen selecting a document in a Dock stack using the arrow keys or type-ahead, it should be possible to delete the selected document using a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Command-Backspace as in the Finder). This would make it much easier to e.g. delete old documents from the Downloads folder in the Dock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- click a folder in the Dock to open it as a stack\r\n- use the arrow keys or type-ahead to select (highlight) a document in the stack\r\n- press Command-Backspace to delete the document like in the Finder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected document gets deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis applies for any stack configuration (fan/grid/list)."
