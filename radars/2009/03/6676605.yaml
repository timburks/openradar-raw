    description: "12-Mar-2009 02:01 PM Tim Burks:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nI have an iPhone application that uses a custom URL scheme. When opened from MobileMail or MobileSafari, the URLs properly start the app, but when viewed in the SMS app, they are not recognized as URLs and are thus ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Identify an app with a custom URL scheme\r\n2. Confirm that this scheme is recognized by MobileMail and/or MobileSafari\r\n3. Send your iPhone an SMS containing one of these URLs.\r\n4. View the URL in the SMS app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe URL should be correctly recognized, visually marked, and a touch on the URL should open it, launching the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe URL is not recognized.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA dissatisfying workaround is to send a conventional http URL to the device which can be recognized and opened by the SMS app, in turn opening Safari, and which then redirects MobileSafari to the desired app-specific URL.\r\n\r\nUsing this PHP script I confirmed that this works:\r\n----\r\n<?php\r\nheader( 'Location: ' . $_GET['target'] );\r\n?>\r\n\r\nThat's a redirect.\r\n\r\n<?php\r\necho $_GET['target'];\r\n?>\r\n----"
