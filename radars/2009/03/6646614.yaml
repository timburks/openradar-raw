    description: "04-Mar-2009 01:40 PM Karl Moskowski:\r\nWith codesign, tools now have associated Info.plist files, via the -sectcreate linker flag. However, the settings for Info.plist processing in the Packaging section of the Build properties are ignored for these types of targets and projects. They should be enabled, for example, to include build settings from xcconfig files or allow preprocessing.\r\n\r\n(A workaround is to use the Plist Compiler open-source project at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/plistcompiler>, but it's not good because it uses a non-plist syntax to generate plists, plus it's an external dependency.)"
