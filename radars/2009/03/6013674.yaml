    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOur app using the iPhone SDK uses UITextFieldDelegate to manage the keyboard state in a form.  It has several fields that the user should enter before the form can be dismissed.  We would like to disable the \"return\" key when the fields are not valid, so that the user does not press it when it would have no effect.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there is no mechanism to disable the \"return\" key in the SDK.  By comparison, Safari disables the return key (labeled \"Go\") when the text fields are empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInstantiate a UITextField object.\r\nImplement -[UITextFieldDelegate textFieldShouldReturn:] to return NO when the return-key action should not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen -[UITextFieldDelegate textFieldShouldReturn:] returns NO, the return key should be disabled: it should appear in grey and not respond to touches.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe return key is always colored blue and shows a highlight when the user presses it, even when -[UITextFieldDelegate textFieldShouldReturn:] returns NO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nAttached is a screen shot showing a form in which the return key should be disabled, but is not."
