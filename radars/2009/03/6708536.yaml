    description: "1. Enter Crop mode.\r\n2. Set a crop constraint (I just checked the \"Constraint\" box, which took the default -- 3072 x 2304 (original resolution).\r\n3. Drag a corner to adjust the crop rectangle\r\n\r\nObserved: Constraint is ignored; I choose rectangles that are not 4 x 3 without modifiers held down.\r\n\r\nExpected: Constraint should be honored..\r\n\r\nRegression: iPhoto v7.x / '08 honored constraint.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Select \"4 x 3 (Book)\", which is honored, or 3072 x 2304, from the pop-up. Apparently if I select *any* proportions from the list, they are honored, but just checking the box does not."
