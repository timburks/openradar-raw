    description: "Summary:\r\nThe inability to legally install the latest iPhone OS on a jailbroken device quietly encourages jailbreaking efforts and piracy in general. The latter hurts both 3rd parties and Apple's bottom line via lower App Store sales. If it is possible to determine that the iPhone cannot be activated legally, it should be amnestied and activated anyway.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go back in time to a point when iPhones were not available in my country.\r\n2. Buy an iPhone in the US without activation.\r\n3. Take it home.\r\n4. Since one cannot activate it without a contract with AT&T, jailbreak and unlock the device.\r\n5. Note that you cannot update iPhone OS without activation in 2009.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that Apple has possibly lost some profit during not-so-legal export of iPhones from the US. The thing is what's done is done and, from a customer point of view, a customer did not steal her iPhone, but rather paid her money according to Apple's price tag. Now the customer cannot update her iPhone without jailbreaking/unlocking even though things have changed and iPhones are legally available in her country. There go the jailbreak, Cydia, Appulous, Crackulous and friends. Meanwhile, Apple starts selling contract-free iPhones. \r\n\r\nIt is not entirely clear what Apple gains by requiring iPhone activation, but it is clear that the requirement does not help decrease the number of iPhones which *have* to be jailbroken after each update. This gives the underground community a raison d'Ãªtre. This gives our potential customers tools to circumvent App Store signatures. This makes piracy easier for everyone. Ultimately, people start using pirated software because it's too easy to get cracked applications, developers lose money, Apple loses its 30% sales commission."
