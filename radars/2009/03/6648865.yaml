    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nWhen Xcode indents split lines to line up colons in obj-c selectors, it uses as many tabs as it can, then switches to spaces. This causes a problem when people use different tab widths. Xcode should instead use the same number of tabs as existed on the first line of the statement, then use spaces from there. This would mean increasing the tab size would increase the left margin before the code, but the split line would still line up on colons properly.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Set Xcode to use 4-width hard tabs\r\n2. Turn on Syntax-Aware Indentation\r\n3. Inside a function, type out a line like the following:\r\n\r\nreturn [UIColor colorWithRed:0.5f\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   green:0.2f\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblue:0.1f\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   alpha:1.0f];\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS AT THIS POINT:\r\nXcode should indent the split lines such that the colons line up (if it doesn't, select the statement and choose Re-Indent).\r\n\r\nCONTINUED STEPS:\r\n4. Go to preferences and change the Tab width to 8\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nThe left margin of the code should increase, but the colons should still line up on the statement.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe colons no longer line up on the statement. Subsequent lines are now indented further than they should be.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nA really quick way to test if it's working \"right\" is to consider the following: if I change the tab width and select Re-Indent, will any text change? If it does, then the indentation pattern used by Xcode is incorrect. Tab width should not have any effect on how Xcode indents split lines."
