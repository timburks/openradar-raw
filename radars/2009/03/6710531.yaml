    description: "Summary: \r\nNSDateComponents objects archived with NSKeyedArchiver and unarchived later differ from their originals.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a keyed archive from an NSDateComponents object.\r\n2. Unarchive the archive with NSKeyedUnarchiver.\r\n3. Compare the resulting object to the original.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the date components do not change during archiving/unarchiving.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDuring archiving NSDateComponents objects do not archive unset components. During unarchiving unset integer values are indistinguishable from valid zero values, so every unset component becomes zero.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem is that NSCalendar objects for date calculations rely on NSDateComponents' components being either set or equal to NSUndefinedDateComponent. As a result, the dates returned by -dateFromComponents: before and after archiving NSDateComponents are different and the date returned after unarchiving is incorrect.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached sample code demonstrates the problem. Archiving/unarchiving NSDateComponents results in the following NSCalendar errors: 0001-01-01 becomes 0001-11-27 and 2001-01-01 becomes 2000-12-30."
