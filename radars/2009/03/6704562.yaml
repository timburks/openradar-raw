    description: "To Reproduce:\r\nLook at Mobile Safari. Note that when viewing a webpage in Arabic, words are rendered correctly. This is done by using the ICU library to break text into words so that the layout engine can produce the correct glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe system includes the ICU library, but its headers aren't available to third parties.\r\n\r\nWhat I want you to do:\r\n\r\nPublish, support, and document the ICU library as part of the OS X SDK, particularly on iPhone.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\nResolution: Apple says:\r\n\r\nCFStringTokenizer will give you word breaks.\r\n\r\nCoreText will give you layout. And both are public in SDK 3.2."

    title: iPhone has ICU library, but doesn't export the header file, so I can't link it.
