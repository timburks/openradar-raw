    description: "Description\r\nSummary,\r\nMail is FETCHing data in 8k chunks but Exchange 2007 sends two 4k chunks. The client idles the connection between each completed FETCH. This behavior causes attachments over 8 MB to take hours to download.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nWe estimate that of our 80,000 users 8% rely on Apple Mail. This issue thus has a significant business impact for 6,400 users.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nAs shown in the included client log 20090311_Apple_Mail_ConnectionLog.txt\r\nan email was sent at 12:12:47.312 \r\nSubject line of test 1 10_MB\r\nThe 10 MB .dmg file named 10_MB.dmg was attached using the attach button within Apple Mail.\r\n\r\nThere were no issues sending the mail.\r\nApple Mail then proceeded to attempt to download the attachment.\r\nThe Activity window within Apple Mail reported,\r\n[INBOX] Updating cache directory \r\nCaching attachments for 0 of 1: test 1 10_MB\r\nThere was no visible progress on the progress bar for this activity\r\nThe Activity window then reported,\r\n[Sent Messages] Updating cache\r\nCaching attachments for 0 of 1: test 1 10_MB\r\nThere was no visible progress on the progress bar for this activity during the 30 minutes we allowed the test to run. Based on other tests the download would eventually complete if allowed to run for the necessary amount of time.\r\nScreenshots of Apple Mail GUI are included.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\nThis behavior can be reproduced by sending an attachment over 8 MB to an Exchange 2007 server.\r\n\r\nThe above described behavior can be reproduced on multiple Mail clients.\r\nThe above described behavior can be reproduced on a clean install of 10.5.6\r\nThe above described behavior can be reproduced with various attachments over 8 MB.\r\n\r\nThe above described behavior can NOT be reproduce with the following configurations,\r\nClient Apple Mail v 3.5 (930.3) Server Exchange 2003\r\nClient Entourage v12.1.5, Server (Exchange 2007)\r\nClient Thunderbird v2.0.0.19, Server (Exchange 2007)\r\nClient Outlook 2003 v11.6568.6568, Server (Exchange 2007)\r\nClient Windows Live Mail, Server (Exchange 2007)\r\n\r\nExpected results\r\nThe download of a 10 MB email attachment should be completed in less than one minute.\r\n\r\nActual results\r\nWe allowed the test to run for 30 minutes. \r\nNo progress was indicated within the Activity window in Apple Mail.\r\nAt 12:44:55.396 we stopped the test, the 10 MB .dmg was never successfully downloaded.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\nWe have no workaround for this issue.\r\nWe can find no way to control how Apple Mail requests or receives data.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nTest was performed on 20090311 \r\nWe tested using the following client,\r\nHardware\r\n15‚Äù MacBook Pro  2.16 Ghz 2 GB RAM \r\nSoftware\r\nOS 10.5.6 fully patched \r\nApple Mail v3.5 (930.3)\r\n\r\nAnd the following server,\r\nExchange 2007 Version: 8.0.0.0\r\n\r\nApple Mail was configured as imap\r\nan entry in the hosts file assured that <dns name> resolved to <IP> \r\nA 10 MB r/w .dmg file was generated on the client using disk utility.\r\n\r\n- Conclusion\r\nThe problematic behavior occurs only with Apple Mail and Exchange 2007\r\nWe have submitted this issue to Microsoft.\r\nAs we understand it Apple Mail relies on an internal algorithm to progressively request larger chunks of email. Any information on why Apple Mail requests such a small chunk size (8k) or method to control the FETCH requests would be appreciated."
