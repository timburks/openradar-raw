    description: "UITableView supports quite a few useful animations when deleting an item, re-arranging items etc. These help the user visually see items disappearing, moving etc. NSTableView on the other hand has nothing like this. There are plenty of areas in which it could be improved with some Core Animation:\r\n\r\n1. Re-arranging columns: When I re-arrange columns, other columns could visual slide rather than jumping about\r\n\r\n2. Slide rows out of the way when dropping: At the moment when dropping items onto a table between two albums there is just a blue line that appears saying \"This is where it will appear\". It would make sense for the items around this area to slide out of the way to show the space the item will occupy (see the dock for how this is already used in OS X)\r\n\r\n3. Fade out items/slide up items when removing from a table: This would be a very useful transition for situations such as filtering. Those items that don't match the filter are removed from the table, possibly by a fade out/shrink while those remaining items slide up.\r\n\r\n4. Re-arranging rows visually on sorting: This one I'm a bit iffy on, but the idea is that when you sort a table, the rows fly around to visually re-arrange themselves. This could be more visually distracting than helpful, but I thought I'd throw it in there.\r\n\r\n5. MOST IMPORTANTLY, please make resizing table views on layer backed views be more friendly. Currently the content fades out and then in again, which is incredibly annoying."
