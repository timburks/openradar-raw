    description: "28-Feb-2009 11:38 PM Joachim Bengtsson:\r\nIf I want to open a link from another app in a specific window (perhaps because I use that window for specific research, or sometimes just because I don't want to open a new window), what I do is I open a new, blank tab in that window, and when I then click the external link, it'll open in that blank tab.\r\n\r\nSince the Top Sites tab in Safari 4.0b is just a fancy blank tab, it should retain this behavior, so that if you have a safari window with the Top Sites tab open and click a link in another app, the link should replace the Top Sites tab.\r\n\r\nSee also rdar://6634655."
