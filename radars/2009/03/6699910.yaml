    description: "19-Mar-2009 11:29 AM Tim Burks:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\n[NSURLRequest setAllowsAnyHTTPSCertificate:forHost:] should be a documented, public method.\r\n\r\nMany situations, especially during software development, involve https connections to sites without certificates, and it is a disservice to Apple's third-party development partners to not make them aware of this API which Apple uses internally. Information about this method is available on the internet, but unless there is source code publicly available, only you can publish an authoritative reference to this feature."
