    description: The bottom bar needs updating as it's lagging behind the rest of OS X. If the current square style is being kept then the colour needs to be made darker to match the toolbar (see Safari). Ideally though it would switch to the rounded style, like Finder, iTunes, iCal etc. Just because we're developers doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated to some minor UI enhancements that make things more consistent ;)
