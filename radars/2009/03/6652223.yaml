    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nA WebView displayed by a WebPluginView that is itself displayed in a WebView does not process any interactive page elements that are driven by mouse-moved events.\r\n\r\nThis means that CSS :hover rules are never executed, and no JavaScript onmouseover events are ever fired.\r\n\r\nAll the static stuff works: CSS styling is applied correctly, and JavaScript onclick handlers execute as expected. Interestingly, the onmouseovers also execute as soon as I click in the corresponding element. It's just the mouse-moved stuff that does not work, it looks like the webview never gets any mouseMoved: events.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\ncheck out the test project from\r\n\r\n    http://github.com/liyanage/webplugin-with-webview-tester\r\n\r\nbuild and run with these commands:\r\n\r\n    xcodebuild -target Tester\r\n    open build/Release/Tester.app\r\n\r\n(note that this will install the test .webplugin into your ~/Library/Internet Plugins)\r\n\r\nThe test app opens with a web view showing an HTML page with some interactive elements. The page also has an <object> tag that loads a file with the special extension that triggers the web plugin. The plugin itself consists of a WebView and this WebView is again filled with a HTML page that has the same interactive elements as the page hosting the <object>.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect the interactive elements in both the \"outer\" and the \"inner\" HTML pages to work the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe inner web view doesn't process anything that is mouse-moved event-related.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAlways occurs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee additional information in this mailing list thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/Webkitsdk-dev/2009/Mar/msg00016.html"
