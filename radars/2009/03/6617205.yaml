    description: "24-Feb-2009 09:32 AM Matt Sephton:\r\nIt would be great if Safari could remember it's state from one launch to the next, so it opened with the same windows and tabs it had when it was last quit.\r\n\r\nEquivalent to Firefox's \"When Firefox starts: Show my windows and tabs from last time\" preference\r\n\r\nPlease add this in a future version."
