    description: "Summary\r\n\r\nOur iPhone SDK application will link out to the Maps application to let the user see maps of businesses.  Once the user is in Maps, the only way for them to return to our app is to exit Maps and choose our app's icon on the main iPhone screen.  We would like a mechanism for the user to go directly back to our app, perhaps by pressing a Back navigation icon on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWe plan to use the -[UIApplication openURL:] message with a maps.google.com URL to link to the Maps app.  \r\n\r\nWhen our app executes sends that message, the iPhone will exit our app and launch Maps.  Our app will save state, so that the next time it launches, it will display the same screen the user was on previously.\r\n\r\nThe Maps app will launch and display the requested location.  But the Maps UI does not have a \"Back\" button or any other feature to let the user go back to the app they were previously in.\r\n\r\nDesired Results\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to pass the Maps application a \"back\" URL.  Our application would register URLs that launch different pages within the app.  \r\n\r\nWhen the Maps app gets a \"back\" URL, it would present a Back button in the UI.  When the user clicks on Back, it would open the URL, launching our app where the user left off."
