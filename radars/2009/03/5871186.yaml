    description: "Summary\r\n\r\nOur iPhone SDK application will link out to the Maps application to let the user see maps of businesses.  We would like to present more information on the Map than the current URL format supports.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWe plan to use the -[UIApplication openURL:] message with a maps.google.com URL to link to the Maps app.  \r\n\r\nWhen our app executes sends that message, the iPhone will exit our app and launch Maps.  The Map app will display a map using information extracted from the URL.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all Google Maps URL features are supported by the iPhone Maps URLs.  Furthermore, there are Maps features that are inaccessible via the Google Maps URL format.\r\n\r\nDesired Results\r\n\r\nDisplay custom icons:\r\n\r\nWe would like to use custom icons for markers rather than the standard pushpins.  This does not seem possible in the URL format."
