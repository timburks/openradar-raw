    description: "Summary: \r\nSafari 4's search field in the new toolbar will not resign focus properly when switching tabs. If the user switches to a tab with a focused text input field, that input field will appear to still be focused, although it is not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to a webpage that has a text field on it (the HTML page attached, for example)\r\n2. Focus that page's text field\r\n3. Create a new tab, it should become the main tab automatically\r\n4. Select the search field in the new toolbar\r\n5. Switch back to the tab with the text field\r\n6. Attempt to type something\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search field would be unfocused, and keyboard entry would go to the text field on the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth the search field in the toolbar and the text field on the page appear to remain focus. However, the search field actually has key focus, and key events go there instead of the text field on the web page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached HTML file."
