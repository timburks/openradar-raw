    description: "28-Mar-2009 11:25 PM Michael Ash:\r\nSummary: \r\nSeriously, this stuff is crazy. Certificates, provisioning profiles, mandatory code signing, what? It takes literally a day to get a basic Hello World program loaded onto an actual device from a standing start. And then the stuff breaks constantly. My iPod Touch has ceased to accept new programs on several occasions for what appear to be no reason whatsoever. I haven't even figured out how to fix it this last time. I mean, come on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy an iPhone.\r\n2. Don't be Apple.\r\n3. Open Xcode.\r\n4. Create a new iPhone Application project.\r\n5. Plug in iPhone.\r\n6. Set Xcode to build for Device.\r\n7. Do a Build and Run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe program should now be running on the iPhone, like how it works on a Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActually more like a Kafka story. Step 7 will fail, probably with some incomprehensible error. In order to get it working, you have to pay Apple a bunch of money, wait for approval, and then complete roughly 47 complicated steps, in order, with perfect precision, and essentially no feedback about which step has failed when it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt has always been this way. It probably will always be this way.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA less Mac-like development process is difficult to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Apr-2009 12:28 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nWe are always looking for ways to improve our products and services.
