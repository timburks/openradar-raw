    description: "Summary: Apple Mail fails to save an email (using File --> Save As) when Safari 4 Beta (5528.16) is installed.\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Attempt to save an email in Apple Mail.\r\nExpected Results: An email is saved in the target folder.\r\nActual Results: The email appears to have saved successfully, but there is no email in the target folder.\r\nRegression: This is a new problem in Safari 4. See \"Notes\" for log and a possible explanation.\r\nNotes: The following log output is generated when the failed save occurs:\r\n\r\n3/6/09 11:02:52 AM Mail[69232] NSData* -[WebArchive data](WebArchive*, objc_selector*) was called from a secondary thread during invocation of -[MessageSaver saveMessages]\r\nStack Trace: (\r\n(\r\n    2446610699,\r\n    2431741499,\r\n    2446610155,\r\n    2446610218,\r\n    2537240691,\r\n    2442680931,\r\n    1669253,\r\n    4075187,\r\n    1352668,\r\n    2446633533,\r\n    2446631976,\r\n    4035596,\r\n    4039374,\r\n    2502379501,\r\n    2502378388,\r\n    2500526229,\r\n    2500525906\r\n)) \r\n\r\nExcept for the date, time, and PID, the Stack Trace appears to remain the same each time.\r\nPossible explanation: It is no longer allowed to call WebKit from a secondary thread. This has broken GrowlMail (see http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2626), and it seems to be causing this problem as well.
