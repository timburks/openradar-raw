    description: "Summary:\r\n802.11n-capable MacBook Pro running Leopard experiences substantial-to-complete packet loss with 802.11n access points \"sometimes\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Join an 802.11n network.\r\n2) Use it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo interruption in communication.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes immediately, and sometimes after a while, all connections will become unusable due to packet loss. The connection indicator still shows a full strength connection. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nA pre-802.11n capable (Core Duo) as opposed to Core 2 Duo machine did not show the problem immediately next to a machine experiencing the problem.\r\n\r\nOther Core 2 Duo systems have shown the problem. \r\n\r\nAn external 802.11g USB dongle does not on the same hardware at the same time show the problem. \r\n\r\nThe problem will occur with neither the access point nor the laptop changing position (e.g. the antenna in the laptop is not defective). \r\n\r\nThe problem has not knowingly been observed on non-802.11n networks.\r\n\r\nWhen the problem is experienced, turning Airport off and back on does not have any effect on the problem; The machine will again associate and report reasonable signal.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe access points on which it occurs tend to be public (e.g. coffeehouse) 802.11n access points with neither WEP nor WPA, and some experimentation suggests the problem begins when new clients join, though I cannot tell you if those clients are 802.11b or not (and thus the problem is some artifact of a degraded mode), however, my suspicion is that there is a Broadcom firmware issue causing this problem in a circumstance something like this.\r\n\r\nPing to the first hop router (e.g. the access point) goes from full and minimal latency to high latency or packets simply dropped when the problem occurs. \r\n\r\nI attach the system profiler output from this machine. Note that there is currently an external USB 802.11g dongle attached and the on-board airport is disabled: the problem is currently occurring with the Linksys WRT110 (00:21:29:6a:1f:07) at the coffeehouse in which I am sitting.\r\n\r\n04-Mar-2009 11:02 PM:\r\nBuilt-in airport; the problem occurs with no dongle present and in general there's no reason for me to use the dongle when the built-in airport is functioning normally.\r\n\r\nThe system log attached shows joining \"SS Crazy Mocha\" with the built in Airport successfully at 11:59am 3/2; when en2 (the dongle) comes online at 12:37:32 3/2, the built-in airport has already been losing packets to the point of unusable.\r\n\r\nAt 12:41:14 you can see the Eye-Fi launch as I confirm it can see the wifi at the coffeehouse. It could. The problem continues to be isolated to the Airport only.\r\n\r\nAt 12:54, having already lost, I am composing the bug report, and use freshly-built KisMAC (not heretofore installed on this system; I fetched the source at 12:50 and built it) to gather information about the access point. Snoop activity from the broadcom is visible.\r\n\r\n06-Apr-2009 12:20 PM:\r\nWith a sample size of 2 (so far) I am 2 for 2 in getting packets to go through when the card goes into this mode by clicking on the airport menu item in the status bar and holding it open. I assume when you're scanning the airport card goes into a higher power mode and thus it's not a coincidence.\r\n\r\nObviously this is not a practical way to operate. A random guess: does 802.11n have some way of hinting what transmit power we need, and we believe it and excessively turn down our power? In any case, the issue still occurs with a 10.5.6 system with all patches applied, including the last airport patch."
