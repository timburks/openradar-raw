    description: "Summary: When using the Image With String patch in Quartz Composer, it is impossible to reset the output Width and Height to 0 after inserting a non-zero-length string.  Upon rendering a zero-length-string (after rendering a non-zero-length string), the output dimensions remain latched at their previous values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Render a non-zero-length string with the Image With String patch (\"Hello World!\" will do).  Note the output dimensions.  Clear the Input String value (\"\"), and check the dimension outputs -- they're unchanged (though line/glyph count are properly reset).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  Dimensions should get reset just as the other outputs do.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Dimensions are unchanged\r\n\r\nRegression:  There don't appear to be any workarounds, but disabling the use of the dimensions based on string length/glyph count are trivial, so no functionality is lost.\r\n\r\nNotes:  Attached is a composition that demonstrates this behaviour."
