    description: "When starting a new slideshow, it always plays music for the first time this slideshow is played. Even when turning off music and checking \"Save as default\", music always starts for the first time the slideshow is played.\r\n\r\nAlthough the option is saved for the next time this particular slide show is played it does not honor the selection for every new slideshow."
