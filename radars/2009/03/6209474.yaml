    description: "Summary:\r\nIn TextEdit, iChat and other Cocoa applications I often appreciate the ability to select columnar or discontiguous regions of text. And I use Cmd-Shift-8 as a calculator all the time. I miss these features in Mail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType a few lines of text.\r\nOption-drag a rectangle from the start of the first line to the middle of the last line.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA rectangular selection is established, that includes the first half of each line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA regular selection is established, including the whole of each line but the last.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niChat, TextEdit or Xcode support advanced editing."
