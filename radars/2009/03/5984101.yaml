    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing iPhone SDK beta 6, I am building a list view that is similar to the 'Featured' view in iTunes Store.  I am using a UILabel to display a two-line text field.  I have a small amount of vertical space, so I need to remove 2 pixels from the leading between the two lines.  I can't figure out how to do so.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn Interface Builder, I have set the font for the UILabel to Helvetica Bold 14.  See the attached xib.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nInterface Builder should let me change the leading.\r\n\r\nThe UIFont or UILabel classes should have a mechanism to change the leading.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI can't see any way to change the leading in IB.  \r\n\r\nReading the UIFont and UILabel class declarations, I don't see a property to change the leading or to create a new font with a different leading.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee the attached screen shots.  One is of my app, showing the wide leading (spacing) between the lines.  The second is of iTunes Store, showing the narrower leading that I want in my app."
