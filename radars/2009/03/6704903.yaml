    description: "Summary: \r\nThe character ’ (U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and ' (U+0027 APOSTROPHE) are treated differently by the autocorrection algorithm, such that ' is considered to be a part of a word and ’ is considered a word separator. This causes the iPhone to erroneously offer a correction when right quote is used instead of apostrophe in, for example, conjunctions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a UITextField, tap out \"That’s\" (using the tap-and-hold gesture on the apostrophe key to access the right quote character). Tap space to conclude the word.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo correction offered. \"That’s\" is considered equivalent to \"That's\" (with apostrophe) from the standpoint of the autocorrect system. The word is unchanged when space is tapped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"That\" is recognized as a word; the right-quote character is treated as a word delimiter; and the character \"s\" (now a word of its own as far as autocorrect is concerned) is corrected to \"a\" when space is tapped.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas occurred for as long as the curly quotes have been available in the soft keyboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
