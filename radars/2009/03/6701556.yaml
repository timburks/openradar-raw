    description: "19-Mar-2009 06:47 PM Michael Ash:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen the same file is open in multiple editors, Xcode performs parenthesis/bracket balancing at the cursor location of every window, not just the window which is being edited. When the cursor is placed after an unbalanced parenthesis/bracket, this results in a beep after every keystroke, a beep whose origin is not necessarily apparent to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a code file in Xcode.\r\n\r\n2. Get the file open in multiple editors. This can be done by seeing the file in the build window, the Project Find window, the debugger, or by simply right-clicking and selecting Open in Separate Editor.\r\n\r\n3. In one of the editors, type a closing ) that is not balanced by an opening (. Leave the cursor immediately after the ).\r\n\r\n4. Switch to the other editor and begin typing something syntactically sensible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEditing should proceed as usual, ignoring the state of the background editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode will perform balancing in the background editor window while typing into the foreground window. Since the cursor is on an unbalanced ), this results in a warning beep for every keystroke.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have observed this mysterious beeping behavior in Xcode for years, but only discovered the source of the problem today. I conclude that it has been there for quite some time, and is not OS or hardware dependent.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode is highly customizable. It's worth noting that this problem is much more dire when Xcode is set up to use as many different windows as possible, which is how I work, than it would be when telling Xcode to use as few windows as possible."
