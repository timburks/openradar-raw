    description: "Summary:\r\nNSCalendar's dateByAddingComponents:toDate:options: method returns a date that is a whole number of milliseconds since the Reference Date, regardless of any fraction of milliseconds present in the original date.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a date whose number of seconds since the Reference Date includes a fraction of a millisecond (i.e., the fractional part of the interval contains non-zero digits after 0.001).\r\n2. Create a Gregorian calendar.\r\n3. Create an NSDateComponents instance.\r\n4. Set the day component to -1.\r\n5. Ask the calendar to add the components to the original date (thereby subtracting one day).\r\n6. Use timeIntervalSinceDate: to subtract the original date from the computed date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the components in NSDateComponents are all of integral types, the calendar returns a computed date whose interval from the Reference Date has the same fraction of milliseconds as the original date (within the limits of floating-point arithmetic). As such, the interval between the two dates is exactly (or as close to exactly as possible) 86400.0000.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSCalendar truncates the computed date to a whole number of milliseconds. As such, the interval between the two dates is almost always greater than 86400.0000.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm including a test app. Here's its output on my system:\r\n\r\nStarting date: 258879920.079869\r\nOne day earlier: 258793520.079000\r\nInterval between: 86400.000869"
