    description: "07-Nov-2005 02:18 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nXc8M600:\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Xcode 2.2DP1 Shell Script Build Phases in Java Tool targets are always executed, regardless the modification date of supplied input and output files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Java Tool Project and name it as you want (in the next step I assume the it has been named JavaTest).\r\n2. Add a new Shell Script Build Phase to the predefined JavaTest Java Tool target.\r\n3. Copy the following command in the \"Script\" field of the Shell Script Build Phase:\r\ncp -f JavaTest.java CopiedJavaTest.java\r\n4. Type JavaTest.java in the \"Input Files\" field of the Shell Script Build Phase.\r\n5. Type CopiedJavaTest.java in the \"Output Files\" field of the Shell Script Build Phase.\r\n6. Close the build phase Inspector window.\r\n7. Build the target (Command-B).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Shell Script Build Phase should be runned only of the modification date of the input file is newer that the modification date of the output file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Shell Script Build Phase is always executed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA sample project is attached to the bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\n'RunScriptIOTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
