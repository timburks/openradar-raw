    description: "The names I use in iPhoto to tag people may not necessarily be the same that are used on Facebook.\r\n\r\nThis may because a serious problem, when people on facebook try to remain anonymous by using a fake name, while I may use their real name on my personal computer and for iPhoto's assigned names.\r\n\r\nThen, when I upload pictures of them to Facebook, their suddenly appear with their real name, not with the (fake) Facebook name. This is not good at all.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no work-around to this, unless I would use their facebook name in iPhoto as well, which makes no sense to me, where privacy is of no concern.\r\n\r\nThus, there should be either an option to disable the automatic submission of names when uploading to Facebook, or a way to match facebook names to iPhoto names.\r\n\r\nUntil then, the Facebook upload feature can be a dangerous beast which might upset my friends who tried to remain anonymous, with me _accidentally_ revealing their real name."
