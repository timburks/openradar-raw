    description: "Summary: \r\nFrom time to time, WindowServer crashes spontaneously after a keystroke.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis issue cannot be deterministically reproduced. Press a key (if I'm not mistaken, it has always happened in a Carbon/PPC application - Eudora)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keystroke is processed normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindowServer crashes, taking all user processes with it\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt has happened three times for me (twice in November, once today), totally randomly. I can't associate any specific circumstances with it except that I believe I always had Eudora frontmost, but that could also be because that's what I use most. The fact that the problem didn't happen before November doesn't mean anything - I only upgraded from a Powerbook with Tiger to a MBP with Leopard in November.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nStack trace of the crashing thread has always been identical, so I only provide one. See attachment.\r\n\r\nrelevant excerpt from CrashReport:\r\n\r\nProcess:         WindowServer [71]\r\nPath:            /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Resources/WindowServer\r\nIdentifier:      WindowServer\r\nVersion:         ???
