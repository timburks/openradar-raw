    description: "1. Open iMovie, with thumbnails missing.\r\n2. Let iMovie generate thumbnails.\r\n3. Bring another app to the front, completely hiding iMovie (or perhaps actually Hide iMovie -- not sure).\r\n\r\nActual:\r\niMovie's progress wheel in a rounded square spins on top of everything.\r\n\r\nExpected: When iMovie's main (only) window is covered, its spinner should be too."
