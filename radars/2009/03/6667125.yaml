    description: "Summary\r\nXcode easily put in an unresponsive state.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n1 Open a Cocoa Application project\r\n2 Build & Go.\r\n3.In Xcode open a New untitled document (<Command><Control>N) so it is the front window.\r\n4.Click in the window of another application, such as Safari, to bring it to the front.\r\n5.Click on the red title-bar close button of the Xcode project window. Note that it doesn't close.\r\n6 Click in the Xcode New untitled document. Note that it is unresponsive. \r\n7 Examine the menu bar, note that most items, including close and quit are grayed out.\r\n\r\nWorkAround: Click on the desktop, then click on the Xcode item in the dock. Now you can see that Xcode created an application modal dialog box: \"Stop tasks before closing?\" but neglected to bring it in front of its other windows.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'd seen this in other versions, but finally have a simple, reproducible test case.\r\n\r\nI'm using the Codewarrior style window layout of Xcode: what the preferences call the Condensed style."
