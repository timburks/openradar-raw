    description: "The zoomed image in the image progress bar (that appears when moving the cursor to the bottom of the screen) does appear at the wrong position when videos are part of the slide show.\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot. The zoomed image corresponds to the thumbnail on the far left and not to the actual position in the middle.\r\n\r\nI assume the position is calculated wrongly when videos are part of the slide show because the position advances to the right when videos are played."
