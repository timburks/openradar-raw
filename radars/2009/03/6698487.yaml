    description: "Summary: \r\nFor my application I need a numeric keyboard with a decimal separator. The most obvious choice would be UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad, but it lacks a locale-specific decimal separator. Using UIKeyboardTypeNumbersAndPunctuation instead is not a user-friendly solution, because the number keys are substantially smaller and there are a lot of keys unneeded for number input.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be extremely helpful to have a numeric keypad with a decimal separator button which automatically displays the correct separator glyph for the current locale."
