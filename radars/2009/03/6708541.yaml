    description: "I have noticed sometimes iPhoto gets confused about photo orientation. Today's steps to repro were:\r\n\r\n1. Import a batch of photos, including one which at 90deg which is tagged as such by Canon SD800IS.\r\n2. Crop the photo.\r\n3. Move to another photo.\r\n4. Return to the cropped photo.\r\n5. Revert to Original.\r\n6. Observe: iPhoto displayed the photo de-rotated (back to landscape, with everything 90deg off, as if it didn't have the camera hint that it was rotated when the photo was taken).\r\n7. Rotate CCW.\r\n8. Move away.\r\n9. Return to the photo.\r\n10. Observe: iPhoto de-rotated the photo again, as if it didn't know the camera was rotated for this photo.\r\n11. A little later, iPhoto has it in the correct (portrait) orientation; I don't know if a second Rotate CCW worked, or what."
