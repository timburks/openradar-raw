    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOn certain MP3 files (in particular, a subset of the IT Conversations podcast episodes) no metadata changes are saved, despite the UI initially registering that they did.  Additional effects are seen with podcast metadata and on the iPhone/iPod touch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Subscribe to the IT Conversations podcast <http://feeds.conversationsnetwork.org/channel/itc>.\r\n\r\n2. Download a sample episode that exhibits this issue (not all episodes do).  For example:\r\n\r\n<http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/audio/download/ITC.INNO-PhilWindley-2009.03.18.mp3>\r\n\r\n3. Select the episode.  Choose Get Info.\r\n\r\n4. If you're in the podcast view, note that the name has changed.\r\n\r\n5. Try to change some metadata, such as the title.\r\n\r\n6. Click OK.\r\n\r\n7. Note that the metadata changes appear to have taken effect in the list view.\r\n\r\n8. Choose Get Info again, or attempt to play the track.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe metadata changes are retained.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe metadata reverts to the information in the ID3 tags.  In the case of the podcast view, the more descriptive title information stored in the podcast feed is completely lost.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis issue also occurred with iTunes 8.0.  I did not test with earlier versions of iTunes.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this only occurs with a subset of IT Conversations episodes.  In particular, the production process for certain series likely differs.  The Tech Nation series (descriptions often begin \"Dr. Moira Gunn...\") does not exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe iPod app for iPhone and iPod touch is also confused by this situation.  When playing such a track, \"Loading Lyrics..\" appears for the duration of playback.  See the attached screenshots for an example, taken before and after an attempt to modify the metadata of the above-mentioned track."
