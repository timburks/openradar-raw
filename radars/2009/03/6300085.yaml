The toolbar/sidebar does not remain hidden. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the toolbar/sidebar is hidden it should not come back unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe toolbar/sidebar appears randomly on many folders, and consistently on folders opened from the desktop after Finder has been restarted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot applicable."
