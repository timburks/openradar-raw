    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nThe AFP client in 10.5.6 shows a misbehaviour with FSCatalogSearch that previous OS releases did not:\r\n\r\nThe effect is that FSCatalogSearch appears to search a AFP-mounted volume multiple times, returning the same results multiple times.\r\n\r\nThe way this happens is that when the catalog search should be finished, it would continue from start again, without letting the caller know that the search is finished. Effectively, it repeats the search multiple times.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. To view the effect, download my tool \"Find Any File\", which performs FSCatalogSearch searches, from here: http://files.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/FindAnyFile_1.1.zip\r\n\r\n2. Mount several remote OS X Server volumes. The more the better as the bug doesn't with all volumes, for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n3. Launch \"Find Any File\", select a remote volume to search, and enter a name to search that appears a decent amount of times, e.g. \"abc\" or \"000\".\r\n\r\n4. Perform the search.\r\n\r\n5. If possible, do the same search on the Server locally as well - there you won't ever see the bug appear, meaning that you'll get a correct number of search results.\r\n\r\n6. You know you are experiencing the bug if you see the results multiple times listed, and if the search takes the same amount of times longer than if the bug does not appear. For example: If the local search finds 25 items, then you'd get 50, 75, 100 etc. items found when searching the same volume mounted on a client.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe remote volume should show all found items only once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRandomly, even if performing the same search again successively, you'll get the same results multiple times.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis bug is known to happen only with 10.5.6 client mounting remote volumes. Also, I've only seen this happen with volumes from OS X Server (both 10.5.6 and 10.4.11 servers), but not, so far, on non-Server OS versions.\r\n\r\nDue to the randomness of the effect, I suspect an uninitialized variable in the AFP client's search code, directly related to the state for the end of the search.\r\n\r\nNote: I do not have access to 10.5.7 seeds so I cannot verify if this bug has been fixed there already."
