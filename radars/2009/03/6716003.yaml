    description: "In Mail.app, if I search for a word in \"Entire Message\", I never get any results.  Ever.  Even words that definitely exist in the messages in the folder I'm searching do not show.\r\n\r\nFor example, a search across over a year's worth of email for the word \"the\" results in no hits.\r\n\r\nI've followed the instructions in http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mail/3.0/en/10021.html and they do not help.\r\n\r\nIf I search with spotlight, I can find the messages without issue.  Also, the command-line mdfind finds them.\r\n\r\nI would expect Mail.app's search in the content of messages, which uses spotlight, to deliver the same results as Spotlight does?"
