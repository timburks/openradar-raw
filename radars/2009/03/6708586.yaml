    description: I selected 10 photos (18.6mb), and clicked the Flickr button. After linking it to my account, I discovered that iPhoto would only let me upload at "Web" resolution. Flickr lets me post at "Large (768 x 1024)" size, so "Web (faster uploading, prints up to 4" x 6") doesn't sound right. Either iPhoto should let me upload at higher resolution, or it should make clear that higher resolutions are only available to Flickr Pro users.
