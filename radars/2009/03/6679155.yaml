    description: "13-Mar-2009 05:58 AM Thomas Worrall:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere should be a button in Contacts to send the current contact to another phone as a \"Business Card\", via SMS or Bluetooth. (If for some reason only one of these is possible, then SMS is much more important than bluetooth.) It is embarrassing when a friend asks for a phone number via SMS, and you have to try and remember it to type into the SMS app. Inability to receive such Business Cards is also annoying.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have friend send you a Business Card (vcard) via SMS.\r\n2. View the message in SMS app.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe message shows a little contacts icon on the left, the name on the card in the centre, and a disclosure arrow on the right. Clicking this arrow will show the entire contents of the card, and has a button for \"Add to Contacts\" and \"Update Existing Contact\".\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe source code for the Business Card is displayed. Sometimes a phone number can be extracted, due to the iPhone parsing messages for phone numbers, but there is no way to add all the information to Contacts."
