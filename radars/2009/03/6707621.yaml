    description: "It would be nice if the file icons in the groups and files view showed a badge to indicate whether that file has any warnings or errors. It doesn't need to show how many there are, once you click on it the details list and the code view scroll bar will show that for you. \r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of Eclipse, which has this feature: http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/ef31d95209.png . Notice how some files have red squares with white crosses, or yellow triangles with exclamation marks. It provides a great visual tool to see which files are causing problems"
