    description: "Summary: \r\nUsing asl_log() to log a message containing multi-byte characters displays incorrectly in Xcode's console view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an Xcode project, add the following code to a method and run it.\r\n\taslclient client = asl_open(NULL, NULL, ASL_OPT_STDERR);\r\n\tasl_log(client, NULL, ASL_LEVEL_ERR, \"あ\");\r\n\tasl_close(client);\r\n\tNSLog(@\"あ\");\r\n\tfprintf(\"あ\\n\");\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe single character should be repeated on three lines, prefixed with info the first two times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first instance, from the call to asl_log(), prints incorrectly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem always occurs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe log entry appears to get entered into the ASL database correctly, since it displays correctly in Console.app and correctly returns from queries.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be related to rdar://problem/5695926, \"ASL provides no way to not escape messages written to a file\"."
