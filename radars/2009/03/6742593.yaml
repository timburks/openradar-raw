    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen filing a bug using bugreport.apple.com, the \"Problem Details:\" box starts out empty.  But I always start by copy/pasting the text from the \"description format\" link into it. That way I know I'm not missing some detail that Apple Engineering wants.\r\n\r\nIt would save me time if this text was already in the box.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog in to http://bugreport.apple.com, click \"New Problem\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA skeleton of what a bugreport should look like, that I can edit with the details of what I am reporting. (Or just blow away, if I've composed my report somewhere else).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA blank textbox.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone."
