    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have two folders containing one album each, and you add both folders into the iTunes Library using one drag, every song will be added with the same \"date added\" field. Afterwards, if you sort by date added, the new songs will be sorted apparently at random; this is inconvenient when you want to play both of these albums in order. To fix this, iTunes should sort songs in the same album into different groups as a tie-breaker to the date added.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have two folders with different albums in each that are not in iTunes.\r\n2. Select both albums and drag them into the Library.\r\n3. Sort the library by ascending date added and scroll to the bottom.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nAll songs from the first album should be listed above the second.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe songs are scattered together at random."
