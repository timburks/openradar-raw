    description: "28-Feb-2009 06:52 PM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nSafari 4 allows new tabs and windows to open with either an empty page or Top Sites; neither of these are real pages you would want to look at by themselves, but only an empty page can be replaced by an externally-clicked link. It would be nice if Top Sites also had this feature, since it's much more useful otherwise than a blank page.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Have another app that has externally clickable links (such as NetNewsWire, or a .url file).\r\n2. In Safari Preferences, set new windows to open as an empty page.\r\n3. Open a new window and then open the external link.\r\n4. Set new windows to open with Top Sites.\r\n5. Repeat step 3.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe new window is replaced with the external link.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nStep 5 opens another window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nnone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might annoy some users, if they wanted Top Sites open to edit it and were opening external links at the same time. I haven't wanted to do that yet."
