    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have an NSTableView nested in 2 NSSplitViews. The table view has a vertical and a horizontal scroller with autohidesScrollers set to YES. When I resize the window to the point where the vertical scroller is displayed the cornerView should be made visible and draw itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNow this does not happen when I move the window right to the point where the clip view is just 1px smaller then the document view. The scroller gets displayed (but with no knob set) and the corner view is only a white rectangle. When I resize the window just 1 px more the corner view and the scroller are displayed correctly. I don't mind the scroller but the corner view drives me crazy, because the area obviously flashes when I resize the window. The screenshot shows some custom drawing using cells but the problem also appears with the default cells and even with the default cornver view. The problem is that the corner view does not redraw itself properly.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nI found a workaround by subclassing NSScrollView and and manually setting the cornerView to display after the scrollview drawRect method has been invoked:\r\n\r\n@implementation STTableViewScrollView\r\n- (void) drawRect:(NSRect)rect\r\n{\r\n\t[[[self documentView] cornerView] setNeedsDisplay:YES];\r\n}\r\n@end"
