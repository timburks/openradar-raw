    description: Quite simply, the source list in the default and all-in-one layout modes sucks donkey balls. It is cluttered, confusing and a pain to work with. It is called the Groups & Files view, yet it also deals with targets, executables, SCM, booksmarks, project symbols etc. The thing is the condensed mode actually has this issue solved by putting all these into relevant groups which you switch between with a segmented control. This desperately needs bringing to the other modes as with anything but the smallest projects it starts becoming a pain to navigate.
