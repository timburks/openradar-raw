    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1 Install Google Notifier from http://google.com/mac , and log in to Google Calendar with it.\r\n2 move ~/Library/Contextual Menu Items/Google Notifier Quick Add CM Plugin.plugin to the trash.\r\n3 if ~/Library/Contextual Menu Items/ doesn't already exist, create it.\r\n3 Unzip the attached zip and place it in ~/Library/Contextual Menu Items\r\n4 Launch Text Edit. (Important: you must launch it after placing the .plugin.)\r\n5 In a New Untitled document: type: \r\n\r\nLunch on tomorrow at Fred's\r\n\r\n6 Select that whole line and right click or control click to reveal the contextual menu.\r\n7 Choose 'Quick Add to Google Calendar'.\r\n8 In a browser, verify that the event was added.\r\n9 In Console, this debug version of the plugin has logged what routines executed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSteps 4 through 9 give the expected results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n10 Launch Xcode (Important: you must launch it after placing the .plugin.)\r\n11 In a New Untitled document (<Control><Command>N): type: \r\n\r\nLunch on today at Ethel's\r\n\r\n12 Select that whole line and right click or control click to reveal the contextual menu.\r\n13 Choose 'Quick Add to Google Calendar'.\r\n14 In a browser, verify that the event was added. (It is not)\r\n15 In Console, this debug version of the plugin has logged what routines executed. (The action routine is not executed.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn the shipping version of Google Notifier, the plugin is not compiled Garbage Collection Ready, so Xcode doesn't load it, and doesn't display the menu item. This debug version is the first that Xcode loads, revealing the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want you to do:\r\nXcode should fully support Contextual Menu extensions: both showing them in the Contextual menu, and when users choose them, calling their action routines.\r\n\r\nReolution:\r\nContextual menu Items aren't supported at all on 10.6."
