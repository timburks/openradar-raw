    description: "When copying a file someplace that already has a file with the same name, the finder prompts for confirmation, before it over-writes the existing file.  But the operation can't be canceled by hitting the esc key.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would expect the button that cancels the copy to be named \"Cancel\", but it is named \"Stop\".\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nmake a file\r\ncopy it into a directory\r\ncopy it into the same directory again\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nI would expect the button that cancels the copy to be named \"Cancel\", and that pressing esc, or command-period would have the same effect as pressing it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Stop\" button does not seem to have a keyboard equivalent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown"
