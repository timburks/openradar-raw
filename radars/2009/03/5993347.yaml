    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen [UIViewController presentModalViewController:animated:] displays a modal view, it always uses an opaque background between the modal view and the underlying view.  This makes it impossible to use this method to display a modal form with the underlying view still visible through a translucent view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a UIView with transparency.\r\nCreate a UIViewController that will display the view.\r\nCreate a base UIView and UIViewController.\r\nInvoke [baseController presentModalViewController:overlay animated:YES].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe overlay view appears, and the underlying view appears through the transparency.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe overlay view is opaque, and the underlying view is invisible."
