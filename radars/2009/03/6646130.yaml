    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt's possible to manually add a URL to Top Sites (as explained in several places, including here: http://lifehacker.com/5161401/add-links-to-safari-4s-top-sites-in-windows).\r\n\r\nHowever, adding two URLs that are similar appears to work, but the next time Safari is started, one of the URLs will have been removed from Top Sites.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Safari and show Top Sites. Click the \"Edit\" button in the lower-right corner of Top Sites.\r\n\r\n2. Open another Safari window (Command-N). In that window, open the following URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference\r\n\r\n3. Select the \"favicon\" -- the tiny icon next to the URL in the address bar and drag it into the Top Sites view in the first window. It's now been added to Top Sites.\r\n\r\n4. Back in the second window, open the following URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM\r\n\r\n5. Select the \"favicon\" again and drag it into the Top Sites view in the first window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should now have two sites added to Top Sites that will always be there. If you close Top Sites and re-open it (Shift-Command-1), and then click \"Edit\", you'll see that the two sites you added have the \"pushpin\" turned on, meaning they should always be there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf you quit Safari and then start it again, you'll see that one of the two sites has disappeared from Top Sites (or, if it's still there, the \"pushpin\" that makes it permanent has been removed).\r\n\r\nThis only seems to happen when the two sites have similar URLs.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMarked resolved in Radar (and OpenRadar), as I can no longer reproduce the problem in the latest Safari beta released yesterday."
