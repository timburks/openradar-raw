    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen presentModalViewController is called on a UIViewController that has it's view positioned as a subView of a UIScrollview, the animation is shown at the x origin of the UIScrollView's content, which might be offscreen depending on the scroll offset of the UIScrollView.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a paging scroll view for two pages\r\n2) Create a UIViewController for each page, with the main views positioned side by side on the scroll view (so second page will have origin.x=320)\r\n3) create a third UIViewController to be shown modally\r\n4) scroll to first page\r\n5) have first page's UIViewController presentModalViewController the modal view WITH ANIMATION --> ok\r\n6) scroll to second page\r\n7) have second page's UIViewController presentModalViewController the modal view WITH ANIMATION --> the screen goes black during the animation time, then the modal view appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe animation should be visible for both pages\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe animation is apparently run at the origin of the scroll view's content, which is off-screen when the scroll view is scrolled to the second page.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe problem can sometimes be worked around by performing presentModalViewController on a view controller related to a non-scrolling parent view of the scoll view.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem becomes fatal with Apple provided UIViewControllers such as ABUnknownPersonViewController, which use presentModalViewController internally. In case of ABUnknownPersonViewController it is even worse, because when trying to edit the contact picture, the related alert (Take Photo / choose image) sheet is apparently presented ENTIRELY offscreen (not only the animation), actually making the application unoperable.\r\n\r\nThe problem was discussed by others (e.g. here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1195538/modalviewcontroller-doesnt-display-during-animation-when-paged-scrollview-is-scr), but the proposed workarounds do not help when using ABUnknownPersonViewController."
