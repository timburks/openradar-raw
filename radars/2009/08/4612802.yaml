    description: "04-Jul-2006 05:11 PM Jonas Maebe:\r\n* Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating custom Xcode project (to integrate third party compilers in Xcode), it often happens to me that for some reason unknown to me Xcode insists on executing the customized compilation  rules for all source files every time I build, even though nothing was changed.\r\n\r\nThere is however no way to find out why Xcode insists on rebuilding. For example, in one case I had made an error and specified a wrong (non-existant) output file for a shell script phase, so Xcode reran the script every time I built. It took me quite a while to realise I had simply made a typo in the output file name.\r\n\r\nSo my request is for Xcode to write in the build log why exactly it wants to rebuild a particular target/source file, execute a script again etc. in order to make it easier to debug such issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1) Build any Xcode project\r\n2) Look at the detailed build log\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actual results\r\n\r\nThere are some mentions of \"Checking Dependencies\", but that's it\r\n\r\n\r\n* Expected results\r\n\r\nWhenever a source file is recompiled (using a built-in or custom rule), a shell script is run, or any other phase is executed, write out the reason why it is (re)run."
