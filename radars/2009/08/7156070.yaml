    description: "Summary:\r\nTesting APNs; if a adhoc build of application be developed is pushed to the device, can no longer test in DEBUG/DEVICE mode.  Result should be I am permitted to test in DEBUG/TEST or ADHOC mode at will.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Deploy app to device as DEBUG build (development provision cert)\r\n2. App works, testing against APNs sandbox\r\n3. Deploy app to device with DISTRO BUILD (adhoc provision cert)\r\n4. App works, testing against APNs production\r\n5. repeat steps #1, spring board crashes if registerForRemoteNotificationTypes is called\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt will, developer shall be able to develop in debug mode and test in adhoc mode prior to preparing testing for customer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen application in Adhoc mode, it crashes causing springboard to restart!\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWork around is currently to reset device, losing all data, but it still will not let you test in either mode!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
