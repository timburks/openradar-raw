    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up the Mac OS X Install DVD's Optional Installs\r\n2. Start installing Xcode.\r\n3. Try to install something from the Optional Installs mpkg.\r\n4. \"Waiting for other installations to complete.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can cancel the second install (or \"Go Back\"), since it hasn't started yet and maybe I decide I don't have time to do both installs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am stuck waiting for both installs to finish, even if I change my mind.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWell, actually running the installs in parallel would be nice, but certainly more dangerous.\r\n\r\nI realize that when the user clicks \"Install\", they're supposed to mean it. But users are finicky beasts, and allowing the user to cancel whenever it is reasonable seems...reasonable. (Unless there's a technical reason why this wouldn't work.)"
