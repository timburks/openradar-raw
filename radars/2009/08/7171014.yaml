    description: "26-Aug-2009 12:08 PM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen an external monitor is attached to a MacBook Pro, open Windows, Desktop icons and the Dock do not correctly move to the correct positions on the attached monitor, but are displayed as if the resolution of the external monitor is the same as the MBP.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing a MacBook Pro (2GHz Core Duo, system info attached) and a non Apple external monitor connected via a DVI/VGA adapter, where the external monitor has a higher resolution (1680x1050 vs 1440x900) than the MBP\r\n\r\n1. With the external monitor disconnected, set the Dock to be on the right hand side of the screen\r\n2. Attach the external monitor.  Configure the displays set up for spanning, with the external monitor on the right hand side of the MBP and the system menu on the external monitor\r\n3. Detach the external monitor\r\n4. Re-attach the external monitor. Dock is not in the correct expected position\r\n5. Detach & re-attach and confirm same effect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindows, the Dock and Desktop icons move to positions on the external monitor that reflect the increased resolution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWindows, the Dock and Desktop icons display on the external monitor, but their positions reflect the MBP's resolution, not the external monitor's.  In addition, when using Dock magnification, the Dock behaves as if it is still at the MBP resolution, getting cut off 2/3rds down the screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked fine on Leopard, 10.5.x, but Snow Leopard 10.6.0 / 10A432 exhibits this issue\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUsing detect displays or gather windows in the System Preferences > Displays does NOT work as a workaround.  Going to the Arrangement tab and making a slight change to the arrangement does fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Screen shot 2009-08-26 at 11.42.20.png' and 'MacBook Pro.spx.zip' were successfully uploaded"
