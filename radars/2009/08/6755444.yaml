    description: "03-Apr-2009 02:46 PM Victor Costan:\r\nSummary: \r\niPhone 3.0's StoreKit (so far) misses out on an opportunity of improving the security of the iPhone ecosystem. Applications that are a front-end to a Web service could greatly improve security, if we had a PII-stripped version of the iTunes Store transaction log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A, as this is a new feature request.\r\nHowever, the following issues are prompting me to file this request.\r\n1) The iPhone 2.0 protection scheme is currently hacked, and applications experience piracy rates of over 60%\r\n2) The iPhone 3.0 StoreKit scheme seems to be equally vulnerable to hacking. Our applications are responsible   for relaying the purchase information to the server, but we have no protection against the leakage of any secret we might store on the phone\r\n3) Normal Web services are much harder to crack, because all the decision code lies on the server side. With the information below, we could do the same for iPhone applications backed by Web servers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like to get the following information from the Apple Store, when a transaction happens - some transaction unique ID, timestamp, my product ID, cryptographic hash ( application-dependent salt + iPhone device ID ), quantity (for the StoreKit transactions), apple's signature over the data. Ideally, developers would be able to configure REST callbacks (for immediate feedback) as well as a bulk-retrieval mode (perhaps RSS format, covering the last 24 hours) to recover from possible server crashes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRight now, the iPhone APIs give no way of distinguishing between the UUID of an iPhone belonging to a paying user, and the UUID of an iPhone running a pirated copy of an application. This was OK until cracking became so commoditized with Crackulous and Pwnage Tool.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs an iPhone developer, I would really like to get this fixed. I don't want to pay royalties to a 3rd party so my app isn't ridiculously easy to crack, when I'm already paying 30% royalties to Apple. The fact is, iPhone is extremely popular, and because of that there's a huge number of people who will try and eventually succeed at hacking any protection scheme that only lives in the phone.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening.\r\n\r\n11-Apr-2009 02:09 PM Victor Costan:\r\nMy iPhone application, StockPlay, is experiencing over 98% piracy. At that level, it's not worth it for us to maintain the required server backends. I removed the application from the store, and we're advising the few people that actually bought it to seek refunds."
