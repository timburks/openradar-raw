    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes supports moving library items to a different location, such as an external hard drive. When it cannot locate them, it will prompt for their location, and store this in its library database. If that item happens to be offline while syncing with an iPhone OS device, iTunes will incorrectly assume that you're missing purchased items, and offer to transfer them back to your iTunes library. The library now features the same item twice; once within the Mobile Applications folder, and once at your preferred location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy an application from the App Store (either in iTunes or on your iPhone OS device).\r\n2. Have the application synced so it is both in iTunes and on your device.\r\n3. Disconnect your iPhone OS device.\r\n4. Quit iTunes.\r\n5. Move the application from ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/ to an external volume (e.g. /Volumes/MyExternalVolume/iTunes External/\r\n6. Relaunch iTunes.\r\n7. In the iTunes Applications section, select the application, and, from the contextual menu, pick Get Info.\r\n8. iTunes will prompt you for the new location. Select it from /Volumes/MyExternalVolume/iTunes External/.\r\n9. Quit iTunes again.\r\n10. Disconnect your external hard drive.\r\n11. Relaunch iTunes again.\r\n12. Re-connect your iPhone OS device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should acknowledge that the application exists on your machine, as a reference to it is still in the library, even though the actual location cannot currently be accessed (thanks to step 10).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes assumes that, even though the reference still exists, the file does not, and offers to copy it twice. You end up with the file twice in the library, and twice on your drives.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTested with Myst (http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=311941991&mt=8). Due it is size, it is particularly desirable to keep on an external drive.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nFixed some time ago. No longer reproducible as of 10.0.1."
