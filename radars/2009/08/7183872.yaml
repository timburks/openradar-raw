    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSince iPhone OS 3.0, an Airplane Mode reminder shows up every time when an app with UIRequiresPersistentWiFi setting on is opened/becomes active in Airplane Mode. This is annoying and causes usability problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an app that does nothing but with UIRequiresPersistentWiFi setting on in the Info.plist, or use this:\r\n\r\n   http://github.com/lukhnos/BugReportApps/tree/master\r\n\r\n   Particularly use the DoNothing-UIPersistentWifiAnnoyance folder\r\n\r\n2. Build the app and run on an iPhone with OS >= 3.0\r\n3. Now switch to Airplane Mode, whether wifi is off before that does not matter\r\n4. Open the app\r\n5. An airplane mode reminder (shown in attachment AirplaneModeReminder.png) shows up before the user can use the app\r\n6. Turn off the screen\r\n7. Turn on the screen, making the app become active again\r\n8. The reminder shows up again\r\n9. Repeat 6.-8.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf the app needs UIRequiresPersistentWiFi, the OS should only remind the user once when the app opens, and that's all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe OS reminds the user not only once, but every time when the app becomes active.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a new addition in OS 3.0. Before I have received no report from users complaining this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI understand why iPhone OS want to do this. UIRequiresPersistentWiFi is a hint to the OS that the app needs wifi. Problem is, app needs that setting because it doesn't want to see wifi disconnected when the app is active. Whether the app wants to remind the user *it needs wifi* is another matter--and here OS makes the decision for the app.\r\n\r\nThis can be annoying because user already knows they're in airplane mode, and usually also know the full consequence of being in that mode. OS 3.0 now already reminds user once. To repeat that reminder every time when the app becomes active again is annoying. For example, if the user wakes up the phone simply because they want to adjust some settings, then switch off screen again, then the reminder blocks in the middle of the quick adjustment, and can be confusing."
