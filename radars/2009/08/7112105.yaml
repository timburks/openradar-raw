    description: "I have just discovered that you can hide items in the source list per split view, which may I say is one of the most awesome things I have found in Xcode as it fixes what IMO was the worst part of Xcode.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is one problem with it, the context menus don't know what to work on. If you create a split view in the source list and then start trying to show/hide things using the preferences item of the context menu, it works on the opposite subview.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a split view in the source list\r\n2. Try removing some items by right clicking and removing with the preferences submenu, it works fine on the correct view.\r\n3. Delete something in the top split view by hitting backspace\r\n4. Now try removing something in the bottom split view using the context menu preferences submenu. Notice how it removes it from the top view.\r\n\r\nTo better visualise it I've created a video for your viewing pleasure: http://dropbox.mcubedsw.com/crazyxcodemenu.mov"
