    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presented with a file whose name begins with a number, Xcode's autocomplete, CodeSense syntax coloring, and textual navigation functions fail.\r\n- Autocompletion and syntax coloring fail to function with regards to the contents of that file as included by another (i.e., if 123Functions.h is included by Utility.m, then autocompletion in Utility.m does not pick up any declarations from 123Functions.h)\r\n- Keyboard navigation malfunctions when the name of such a file appears in a string. For example, when option- or control- navigating across the string #import \"123Functions.h\", the cursor treats \"123\" as a single word, each character in \"Function\" as a separate word, and either \"s.\" or \".h\" as a single word, depending upon whether the cursor approaches from the left or the right.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode Cocoa Application project.\r\n2. Create a new header file named \"123Functions.h\".\r\n3. Define a structure named TestStruct in 123Functions.h with a few members.\r\n4. Add #import \"123Functions.h\" to the application delegate file.\r\n5. Attempt to use control-left arrow, control-right arrow, option-left arrow, and option-right arrow to navigate within the #import statement.\r\n6. With syntax coloring and autocomplete turned on, attempt to declare a variable of type \"struct TestStruct\", and to access the members of the structure.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The modifier-arrow key navigation will treat \"123\", \"Functions\", and \".h\" as separate words and subwords.\r\n- The type of the structure variable, and the fields within the structure will be autocompleted when they are typed.\r\n- The name of the structure and the fields within it will be colored according to the current syntax coloring settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The modifer keys treat \"123\", \"F\", \"u\", \"n\", \"c\", \"t\", \"i\", \"o\", \"n\", \"s.\" (from the left), and \".h\" (from the right)\" all as separate words and subwords.\r\n- The type and fields of the strucutre are not recognized by autocompletion.\r\n- No syntax coloring related to the structure variable takes place.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown."
