    description: "Summary:\r\nGlobal keyboard shortcuts like cmd-Tab should only be sent to another machine when it is remotely controlled in full screen mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a control session to another Mac using Apple Remote Desktop 3.3.\r\n2. Press cmd-Tab to switch to another local application or cmd-Space to search with Spotlight.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf cmd-Tab was pressed, the Remote Desktop application is no longer the front most application. If cmd-Space was pressed, the Spotlight menu would become key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth shortcuts are sent to the remote Mac.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs an administrator managing multiple Macs, I have a strong interest that control session windows behave like document windows. By taking over all keyboard commands, Remote Desktop no longer allows me to efficiently switch between the control session itself and other essential information such as inventory databases, password lists, checklists and troubleshooting references.\r\n\r\nWhat previously took less than a second, now involves reaching for the mouse or trackpad. As a keyboard aficionado I beg you to introduce a user default to switch back to the pre-3.3 behavior. Also cmd-` should cycle through Remote Desktopâ€™s own windows like in other applications."
