    description: "The NSRuleEditor delegate methods are excellent for simple applications, but thus far, I have yet to solve a rather simple task. I would like the very first row in my NSRuleEditor to have a single NSString child for the nil criterion and each subsequent row to have two children for the nil criterion, which would create a popup button. Currently this does not appear to be possible.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution to this problem is to have the row that is being acted upon passed into each delegate method so\r\n\r\n\truleEditor:child:forCriterion:withRowType:\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n\truleEditor:child:forCriterion:inRow:withRowType:\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\truleEditor:numberOfChildrenForCriterion:withRowType:\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n\truleEditor:numberOfChildrenForCriterion:inRow:withRowType:\r\n\r\nSince there is no context when the delegate is queried for the child criteria for the nil parent, it makes it impossible to know which set of root criteria to return to the delegate caller."
