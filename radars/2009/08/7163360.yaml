    description: "Summary:\r\nLaunch Services always runs an application as x86_64, i386, or ppc, in exactly that order of preference, regardless of any Info.plist keys attempting to influence its choice.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an application.\r\n2. Set this value in Info.plist:\r\n\t<key>LSMinimumSystemVersionByArchitecture</key>\r\n\t<dict>\r\n\t\t<key>x86_64</key>\r\n\t\t<string>10.6.0</string>\r\n\t</dict>\r\n3. Run your application from the Finder on Leopard on a 64-bit Intel Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLeopard runs the application in i386 or ppc, since the application says that its x86_64 version requires a later version of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeopard runs the application in x86_64.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know, this has never worked.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther Info.plist keys are similarly broken. Other things I tried:\r\n\r\n\t<key>LSArchitecturePriority</key>\r\n\t<array>\r\n\t\t<string>i386</string>\r\n\t\t<string>x86_64</string>\r\n\t\t<string>ppc</string>\r\n\t</array>\r\n\r\nIgnored; the application runs in x86_64.\r\n\r\n\t<key>LSExecutableArchitectures</key>\r\n\t<array>\r\n\t\t<string>i386</string>\r\n\t\t<string>ppc</string>\r\n\t</array>\r\n\r\n(Notice that x86_64 is missing.) Ignored; the application runs in x86_64.\r\n\r\n24-Aug-2009 03:47:\r\nFurther testing has this problem not showing up in Finder, only Xcode (x-radar://problem/7163358). I'm no longer certain that the problem was occurring in Finder before; I might have simply misread Console.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved (for now) and can be closed."
