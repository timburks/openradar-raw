    description: "When syncing with Google is enabled in AddressBook preferences, individual contacts sync to Google Contacts, but the group organisation is ignored completely. Google Contacts does support groups, so GoogleContactSync.framework should too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Enable Synchronise contacts with Google in AddressBook Preferences.\r\n2) Create a group and place one or more contacts in it, in AddressBook.\r\n3) Log in to http://contacts.google.com and check contacts.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected my contacts _and their group organisation_ to be reflected in Google Contacts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the blank groups provided by Google were listed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is part of a series of bugs on Google Contact Sync: groups, nicknames, non-standard addresses, and photos."
