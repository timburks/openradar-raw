    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen GetIconFamilyData is used to access the 512x512 and 256x256 icon resources in an .icns file, it always returns a -50 (paramErr.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open the attached project.\r\n2) Open the test.icns file and verify that it contains resources for the 512x512 and 256x256 sizes.\r\n3) Build and run the project.\r\n4) Open the output.icns file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe output.icns file should contain the 512x512 and 256x256 resources from the original test.icns file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 512x512 and 256x256 resources are missing. The console shows a -50 paramErr when trying to read the kIconServices512PixelDataARGB and kIconServices256PixelDataARGB resources.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nGetIconFamilyData worked correctly with large resources in 10.5 (Leopard.) It has been able to read all resources sizes correctly since Mac OS 9. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem can be worked around by creating a CGImageSourceRef, reading each CFImageRef, and extracting the pre-multiplied pixels from a CGBitmapContext with a kCGColorSpaceGenericRGB color space. This is far from obvious.\r\n\r\nThe attached project can be downloaded from http://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/IconFamilyBugsRadar.zip"
