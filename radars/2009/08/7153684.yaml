    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSyncing of keychain data between trusted computers should be freely available and possible without a 3rd party.\r\n\r\nKeychain data is amongst the most sensitive and important that a person can have.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nKeychain syncing on OS X is currently only available via mobileMe - a cloud based service in which the user has no way to verify that their data is not accessible by other people. Even if the user trusts Apple to keep the data safe, the internet over which the data must travel is undeniably insecure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is possible to create multiple keychains, however, it is not possible to merge the changes made in two copies of the same keychain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should be an  unalienable right to be able to sync keychain data directly between any two computers, behind firewalls, via local area networks etc.\r\n\r\nJust as Time Machine provides phenomenal backup ability to every Mac OS user, so too should keychain syncing be an out-of-the-box feature available to every mac user.\r\n\r\nAlso, with USB-Sticks small enough to fit on your physical keychain, it would also make sense to be able to sync with an encrypted image on a USB stick.\r\n\r\nObviously, syncing between keychains should only be possible if they have a common origin: ie: they must have the same cryptographically produced keychain ID. It should not be possible to merge data from someone elses keychain.\r\n\r\nThe use of hash trees (much like git, mercurial & co handle source code) combined with 256 AES encrypted data structures could provide a solid solution.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nKeychain Access (the program) should also be made a much more prominent part of OS X.\r\nMost people that I have worked with don't even know of its existence. The number of times I've\r\nstopped people from writing their passwords on scraps of paper by simply showing them\r\nKeychain Access is embarrassing."
