    description: "Summary:\r\nAt least one significant part of the Mac version of the Memory Management Performance Guidelines is no longer applicable to Leopard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load up the Mac version of the Memory Management Performance Guidelines.\r\n2. Hit the “Examining Memory Allocation Patterns” chapter (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/FindingPatterns.html).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page contains information on using Instruments to diagnose memory-management problems in applications for Mac OS X Leopard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page contains information on using Instruments to diagnose memory-management problems in applications for Mac OS X Tiger.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe page was not out-of-date before Apple replaced most of the old performance tools with Instruments in Leopard.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nRead the iPhone version of the Memory Management Performance Guidelines. (I sure am glad the iPhone docs are public now!)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterestingly, the iPhone version of the document contains information specific to Mac OS X, so it may be that you simply forgot to copy the new document over to the Mac OS X version."
