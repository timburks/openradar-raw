    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Dock a folder with \"view contents as a list\" containing a symbolic link or a alias to a folder shows it as a regular file without expanding it in a browsable way as regular folders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClick on a folder in the Dock set as \"view contents as a list\" which contains a symbolic link or alias to a folder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee a arrow at right to drill down into the folder linked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe linked/aliased folder is shown as a file.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIndeed a link to a folder is not a regular folder , but it can be argued it is a folder not a file , and the functionality was there in OSX 10.4 and sorely missed."
