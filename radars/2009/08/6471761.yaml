    description: "04-Jan-2009 12:59 AM Jonas Maebe:\r\n* Summary\r\n\r\nRecently I finished the initial port of the Free Pascal Compiler to target the iPhone/iPod Touch platform. While the basic underlying Mac OS X system is pretty much the same as that of a desktop, our basic run time library works fine (it's based on the BSD/posix api's in libc and libiconv).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that since our compiler does not parse C nor Objective-C, people cannot directly use any of the iPhone-specific frameworks. I/We can also not translate and distribute them, due to the iPhone SDK agreement (no distribution of derivative works)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only possible way to offer our users a proper interface to the iPhone frameworks (other than Apple including someone's personal Pascal translations of the C/Objective-C headers in the iPhone SDK -- which would be fine too, for what it's worth), is by using automated translation at install time.\r\n\r\nBridgeSupport files (man 5 BridgeSupport) would be ideally suited for this. Unfortunately, the gen_bridge_metadata(1) ruby script requires running test programs on the target platform in order to generate such files. Since\r\n\r\na) it's not possible to run ruby scripts (which is what gen_bridge_metadata is) on the iPhone/iPod Touch (let alone that it could compile anything on the device itself)\r\nb) it's not possible to remotely execute test programs on an iPhone/iPod Touch in a legit way (other than possibly AppleScripting Xcode)\r\n\r\nthere is no way that we can generate these files ourselves at installation time (and subsequently convert them to Pascal interfaces).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I'd like to ask you to include BridgeSupport files for the iPhone frameworks in a future version of the iPhone SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Expected results\r\n\r\nA way for users of non-C/Objective-C languages to make use of a standard translation of the headers of the iPhone SDK, possibly by including BridgeSupport interfaces to the iPhone SDK frameworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actual results\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to legally create and distribute translations of the iPhone SDK framework headers for our compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Notes\r\n\r\nOur compiler generates native, compiled code. The programs it generates are not interpreted (even though BridgeSupport files are often used to provide interoperability with interpreted languages)."
