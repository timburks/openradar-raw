    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nI believe it would be a worthwhile enhancement to Mac OS X to provide an administrator-controlled volume limiter in the same way iPods have a PIN-controlled volume limit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Macs continaing powered speakers (iMacs in particular) are very, very loud at maximum volume.  This presents a problem for both parents and lab administrators.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to have an addition to the Sound preference pane that enabled an administrator to set the overall maximum volume that the computer is allowed to produce.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way for an administrator to set a system-wide 'maximum allowed volume' level that ordinary users cannot exceed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHaving command-line, MCX and Apple Remote Desktop support for this control would also be desirable in the context of school computing labs."
