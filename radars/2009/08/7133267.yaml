    description: "Summary:\r\nThe only useful way to track upload progress is to use CFReadStreamCopyProperty(readStream, kCFStreamPropertyHTTPRequestBytesWrittenCount); In current implementation it is completely unusable for uploading stuff that's < 128kb\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to upload small image (less than 100 kilobytes) using CFNetwork API\r\n2. Track upload progress using CFReadStreamCopyProperty(readStream, kCFStreamPropertyHTTPRequestBytesWrittenCount)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrecise upload tracking. For example, with 4Kb or 32Kb step.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is returning 128Kb all the time while upload process goes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem appears from 2.0 version of iPhone SDK\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated discussions from Dev Forums:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/9824\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/36639"
