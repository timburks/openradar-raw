    description: "11-Aug-2009 02:14 PM Roman Busyghin:\r\nThere are two awesome applications for Android: Locale (http://www.twofortyfouram.com/product.html) and Astrid (http://www.weloveastrid.com/). The tandem makes awesome work together. By leveraging Locale, Astrid is able to remind you not just when but also where tasks are due. It would be nice to see something like this on the iPhone. I create location, assign it to a TODO item. When my iPhone appears in appropriate location it will pop up an alert."
