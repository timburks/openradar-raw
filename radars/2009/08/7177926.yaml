    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing Remote Install Mac OS X to install 10.6 onto a MacBook Air using a HD partition (created from a disk image)  fails part way through boot-up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a partition on a HD and image a copy of the 10.6 installation disk or disk image to that partition.\r\n2. Start Remote Install Mac OS X\r\n3. The partition will be available as a source for installation\r\n4. Select the OS X installation partition\r\n5. Choose any of the options for connectivity (either Airport or Ethernet)\r\n6.  Boot up a MacBook Air holding option while booting.\r\n7. Select the remote installation disc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem should boot up correctly into the Mac OS X installer (or alternatively the option to use the partition should not be available at all)\r\n\r\nActual Results:  \r\nThe boot up will end up in an infinite loop. If verbose mode is used to boot up, the initial stage where the kernel is downloaded via TFTP is successful, but the subsequent stage where after loading several kernel modules, including network drivers, the boot process attempts to download the remainder of the necessary files fails.\r\n\r\nThe process gets locked in an infinite loop outputting error messages about _readBytes returning error 0xe000002c2\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't know if partition boot-ups are intended to be supported. But they should either work properly or not be available for selection at all. \r\n\r\nDoing a Remote Install from a real optical disk or from a mounted disk image works fine."
