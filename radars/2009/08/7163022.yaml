    description: "Summary:\r\nThe behavior of the arrow keys on a selection of rows in a list view differs between Cocoa applications and Carbon applications.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Cocoa application\r\n2. Go to a list view in a with at least 4 rows: A, B, C, and D.\r\n3. Click row B to select it.\r\n4. Hold down the shift key and click row D.\r\n5. Press the up arrow key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly row A is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly row C is selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works as expected in Carbon applications, like the Finder, and iTunes.  It works differently in Cocoa applications, like Safari, Address Book, and Font Book.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI checked the HIG, and deselection via the keyboard doesn't appear to be addressed.  Selecting the next row outside of the selection, however, seems like the better design.  You don't have to know in which direction the selection was made to know which row will be highlighted, and it lets you navigate to either end of the selection.  It's also very similar to how text deselection works.\r\n\r\n01-Sep-2009 03:03 PM:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nThe Cocoa way is the correct way.  Finder has been updated in Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nMac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard\r\nAugust 28th, 2009\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/"
