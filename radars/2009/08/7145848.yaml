    description: "Summary: \r\nGoogle Contact Sync parses the text-blob used by Google Contacts for each (mailing) address field poorly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Enable Synchronise with Google in Address Book preferences.\r\n2) Create a contact with the address as follows:\r\n2a) Street number&name field: \"Room 205\\nSchool of law\" where \"\\n\" is a new line in the same field.\r\n2b) Blank city, state, zip.\r\n3) Sync.\r\n4) Check Google Contacts.\r\n5) Sync.\r\n6) Check Address Book. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the address text to stay as I had entered it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy address was rearranged incorrectly, as follows:\r\nThe street number&name was \"Room\". The city was \"School of Law\". The Zip was 205.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a data corruption bug.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is part of a series of bugs on Google Contact Sync: groups (rdar://problem/7145839), nicknames, non-standard addresses, and photos (rdar://problem/7145845)."
