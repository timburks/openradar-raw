    description: "After a restart, the installer app (for stuff like iWork or the iPhone SDK) works fine. However, after an undetermined amount of uptime, it will start to fail, and just never leave the \"Preparing Installation\" phase.  The only console message is this:\r\n\r\n7/30/09 9:01:37 AM\tInstaller[38184]\t*** -[NSMachPort handlePortMessage:]: dropping incoming DO message because the connection or ports are invalid"
