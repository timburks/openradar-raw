    description: "Summary:  When connected to the Internet via an ad hoc network, the iPhone/iPod touch should offer IP address lookup as a backup to the location service.\r\n\r\nNotes:  Services such as Loki.com's FindMe service use IP address lookup as a fallback when the Skyhook Wireless API is unable to determine your location using Wi-Fi Positioning.  The IP address lookup is not as reliable as Wi-Fi Positioning, but it allows general device location when Wi-Fi Positioning cannot be used.  Currently, the Wi-Fi Positioning System does not work when the iPhone or iPod touch is connected to the Internet using the Internet Sharing function in the Sharing pane of System Preferences when there are no routers within range.  The iPhone can fall back on its Cell ID and GPS support, but the iPod touch is limited to WPS.  Applications on the iPod touch under these conditions are unable to return location information, which gives the appearance of location support not working and of elements of the application not functioning.  With the location information provided by an IP address lookup, location aware applications would be able to provide their location functionality in situations in which WPS fails to provide location data."
