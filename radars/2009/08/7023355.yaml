    description: "iPhoto uses its own UI with Time Machine which is great. Unfortunately it is missing the feature to delete a specific item from this or all backups.\r\n\r\nThis is important because iPhoto more and more collects all (raw) videos. After cutting them in iMovie and deleting them in iPhoto, I want to reclaim the disk space on the backup drive, too."
