    description: "Summary:\r\nNumber of apps with updates available is consistent between iTunes and the iPhone app store. Oftentimes one or both of these sources is incorrect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Observe the badge on App Store on the iPhone\r\n2. Observe the badge besides \"Applications\" in iTUnes\r\n3. Start  check for updates in iTunes and record results\r\n4. Start check for updates in iPhone app store and check results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTHe counts and results should be consistent all the way through. i.e. if 1 app is available for update all badges should say \"1\" and the number of apps displayed for update should be 1. After the update all badges should read 0 and no updates should be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe badge numbers are often wrong and may not be consistent with each other.  Sometimes iTunes and the iPhone will both indicate 1 update being available, but trying to actually get the update in iTunes will result in iTunes saying no updates are available or vice versa.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have always been the case ever since the app store was introduced.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPretty much any other combination of inaccuracy and mismatch also occur, however there appears to be no pattern to \"which way\" things are wrong."
