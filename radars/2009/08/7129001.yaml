    description: "Summary: \r\nIn the kqueue API, BSD (where kqueue comes from) supports NOTE_TRACK and NOTE_CHILD which allows tracking subprocesses across calls to fork. Mac OS X does not support these notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open sys/event.h\r\n2. Scroll to the bottom.\r\n3. Read where it says:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * DEPRECATED!!!!!!!!!\r\n * NOTE_TRACK, NOTE_TRACKERR, and NOTE_CHILD are no longer supported as of 10.5\r\n */\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that Mac OS X supports the full suite of kqueue notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMac OS X leaves out these extremely important notifications.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAccording to this header comment these do not work on 10.5. (It is known that they panic 10.4 prior to some later 10.4 bugfix release.) This comment also exists on 10.6 which would seem to indicate that they have not been re-implemented for Snow Leopard either.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWithout these notifications, trying to track process lifetime requires using kqueue for just a first-pass notification mechanism to say that \"something changed\", then using other APIs to re-scan the entire system process list to see exactly what that change was. This is not only inefficient but also highly complicated and prone to race conditions."
