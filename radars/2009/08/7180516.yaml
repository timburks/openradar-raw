    description: "28-Aug-2009 07:43 PM Christopher Wright:\r\nSummary:  When inside a Lighting Patch with Casts Shadows enabled, objects rendered inside Iterators only render the first (or last?) iteration, skipping the rest.  E.G., if an iterator was to render 10 cubes, only 1 would be drawn.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n   1) Create a lighting patch\r\n   2) Enable Casts Shadows on said patch\r\n   3) Inside the Lighting patch, place an Interator patch\r\n   4) Inside the Iterator patch, place a Sphere patch (or cube, or sprite, or whatever)\r\n   5) Inside the Iterator patch, place an Iterator Variables patch\r\n   6) Attach the Iterator Variable's Position output to the Sphere (or cube, et.al.)'s X Position input\r\n   7) Enable rendering\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n10 Spheres along the X axis, from 0 to 1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1 Sphere.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis always happens, with no known workarounds.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
