    description: "Summary:\r\nViews that implement mouseDown and are the views of an NSMenuItem (setView:), don't receive mouseDown except on a multiple click.  mouseDown is not called on single click.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Make an NSStatusItem in the systemStatusBar.  In my case, mine used a custom view that responded to mouseDown to toggle the menu with popUpStatusItemMenu:.\r\n\r\n2.  Make an NSMenu, with an NSMenuItem and set the item's view to a NSView subclass.\r\n\r\n3.  In that NSView subclass (the one for the NSMenuItem), implement mouseDown: (I just made an NSLog to check).\r\n\r\n4.  Build and Go --> Click the view in the menu item of the menu, you'll notice that it doesn't respond to single clicks, however, it responds to multiple (double, for example) clicks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmouseDown will be called on all clicks, regardless of click count.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmouseDown is only called on multiple clicks in a row (double clicks, etc).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMy Macbook Pro (2.2Ghz) is running Leopard, and it seems it was able to be reproduced frequently.  On occasion it would respond on the single click, but after closing and reopening the menu, it would no longer do that."
