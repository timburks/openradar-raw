    description: "The import dialog in iPhoto should allow deleting a selection of photos instead of importing them. Either by\r\n\r\n- allowing to drag to the trash\r\n- Cmd-Backspace\r\n- \"Delete selection\" button\r\n- Context menu\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nOftentimes some photos were already imported in an earlier batch. If not deleted right after importing (which makes sense in a lot of cases to get prints in a shop, upload them to another computer etc.) the photos are still on the card. Then, after deleting junk photos, these junk photos will be imported again - very annoying.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other situations where deleting photos directly (not only after importing them) is needed."
