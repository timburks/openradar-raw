    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode always builds the Active Architecture, and can be set to only build the Active Architecture for a given configuration, but leaves the decision of which architecture to run up to the operating system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be on a 64-bit Intel machine on Mac OS X Leopard.\r\n2. Set the Active Architecture to ppc or i386.\r\n3. Build ppc+i386+x86_64.\r\n4. Run the executable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode runs the executable as ppc or i386â€”whichever one you set as the Active Architecture.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode ignores the Active Architecture and just runs the executable normally, which means it always runs as x86_64, i386, or ppc in exactly that order of preference.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo idea.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode does behave as documented, but I argue that the documented behavior is next to useless. As documented and implemented, the Active Architecture feature serves only to support the Build Active Architecture Only build setting. If that setting is off, the Active Architecture feature is useless; it may as well not even be in the application.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Xcode currently does not have any easy way to run an architecture other than the one the operating system selects. The Active Architecture menu is so obvious a way to do this that I thought it did!\r\n\r\nCompounded by x-radar://problem/7163360.\r\n\r\nComponent versions\r\nXcode IDE: 1191.0\r\nXcode Core: 1192.0\r\nToolSupport: 1186.0"
