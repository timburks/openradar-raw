    description: "Summary:\r\nIn QuickTime X Player, when saving a movie that has been downloaded through HTTP, the cached copy QuickTime already has is disregarded, and the movie is instead downloaded again. While this works, it is a needless waste of time and bandwidth. In comparison to QuickTime 7 Player, the time to save a movie can go from a few seconds to several minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to a page containing movies, such as http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/gamer/.\r\n2. Click \"Trailer 2a\", then \"720p\".\r\n3. Wait as QuickTime X Player opens and downloads the movie.\r\n4. Go to File -> Save Asâ€¦. Pick \"Movie\" as the Format, any name and location, and click \"Save\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSaving should take mere seconds. The file is already there; it just needs to be copied from QuickTime's cache to the user-desired location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSaving takes multiple minutes. From Activity Monitor's Network tab, we can easily gleam that QuickTime is downloading the data all over again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked correctly in QuickTime 7 Player, as still evidenced in the optional install of QuickTime 7 in Snow Leopard."
