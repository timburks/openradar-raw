    description: "10-May-2009 11:18 AM Jonas Maebe:\r\n* Summary\r\n\r\nIf a program contains DW_TAG_constant entries in the global scope, these are removed by dsymutil. \r\n\r\nSince DW_TAG_constant entries do not by themselves correspond to any memory location, I think the comments regarding debug map entries from rdar://problem/5643496 do not apply here.\r\n\r\nThose comments are also the reason why I'm not simply using DW_TAG_variable along with an AT_const_value(), although that already works in gdb (while DW_TAG_constant are not recognised, even though Apple appears to have specifically patched gdb's dwarf2read.c to add some kind of support for DW_TAG_constant).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n(the attached files are for i386)\r\n1) unpack the attachment and change to the \"const\" directory\r\n2) ./ppas.sh\r\n3) dwarfdump const.o\r\n4) dsymutil const\r\n5) dwarfdump const.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/const\r\n\r\n\r\n* Expected results\r\n\r\nIn both steps 3 and 5, there should be a TAG_constant entry for the constant \"MYINT\".\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actual results\r\n\r\nThe TAG_constant entry exists in step 3, but not in step 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Notes\r\n\r\nDW_TAG_constant entries in a local scope (e.g., in a function scope), are not removed by dsymutil.\r\n\r\nVersion information:\r\n@(#)PROGRAM:dsymutil  PROJECT:dwarfutils-49\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'const.tbz' was successfully uploaded"
