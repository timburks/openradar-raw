    description: "The time limit for two taps to be considered a double-tap, is not defined.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\n\r\nIn order to handle single-tap and double-tap differently, Apple's guide says to do performSelector...afterDelay with some 'reasonable' interval on first tap (and cancel it later if the second tap is detected).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if the interval is too short (0.1), the single tap action will be performed even when double-tapping. If it's too long (0.8), the user will be waiting unnecessarily for the single-tap to be recognized, when there is no possibility for a double-tap (if using the tapCount) property.\r\n\r\nIt has to be exactly the correct number, in order to work optimally, but definitely not smaller, or there's a chance for bugs (simultaneous single-tap and double-tap)."
