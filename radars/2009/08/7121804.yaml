    description: "05-Aug-2009 05:43 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nIphone apps that play audio need to properly handle the beginning and end of audio interruptions caused by incoming phone calls.  For example, one of the arguments to AudioSessionInitialize() is an interruption-handler function.  This function will be called at the beginning of an interruption (e.g. when an incoming phone call is received) and again at the end (e.g. when the user completes or declines the call).\r\n\r\nHowever this is very awkward to debug, even with a dedicated development-only iPhone.  Every edit/compile/test cycle requires the extra steps of calling the development phone from another phone, waiting for the cell network to complete the call, declining the call, and hanging up the calling phone.\r\n\r\nThis is slowing down development right now as I'm having some issues with recovering from an interruption, and I'm finding the constant mental context switching of going back and forth to the phone network distracting.\r\n\r\nIt would be immensely helpful if the iPhone simulator had an option to simulate an incoming phone call.  Put it on the Hardware menu next to \"simulate memory warning\", and make it interrupt apps in the same way that a real phone call would do so on a device."
