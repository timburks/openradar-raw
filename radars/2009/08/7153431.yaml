    description: "19-Aug-2009 04:02 AM Roman Busyghin:\r\n== Initial discussion:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/24586?tstart=0\r\n\r\n> Am I correct in thinking there is no way to get access to the\r\n> password the user set in Settings?\r\n \r\nThat's correct.  This is, unfortunately, a bug <rdar://problem/7005982> The proxy password is stored in the keychain, but it's stored in a section of the keychain that you can't access.  Remember that iPhone OS has the notion of keychain access groups that determines which applications are allowed to access which keychain items.  Apple applications typical reside in the \"apple\" access group, and thus can share keychain items like the proxy credentials.  Your application is not in this group, and you can't put it in that group, and thus you can't access these credentials.\r\n \r\nThe standard workaround is to write code to handle authentication challenges, get the password from the user, and save the password in your own area of the keychain.  This might seem like a waste of code, but that's not entirely true.  Even if you could get at the system setting, you'd still have to handle the case where that password is wrong, and the code you'd write to handle that case is very similar to the code you'll have to write to workaround this restriction.\r\n\r\n== Conclusion:\r\nIt would be nice to use user's WiFi proxy password while communicating over proxy instead of writing additional code and duplicate proxy password within application's keychain."
