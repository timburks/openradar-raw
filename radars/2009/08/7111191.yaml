    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCommand-clicking the title of a Finder window opens a popup “path menu”. In previous versions of Mac OS X, command-clicking one of the folders in this menu would open a new finder window for the selected folder. In Snow Leopard build 10A421a, command-clicking one of the folders in this menu changes the path of the existing finder window. This is a regression from behaviour in earlier Mac OS X versions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a Finder window for the user’s Documents folder.\r\n2. Command-click the title of the window.\r\n3. Command-click the users’s home directory in the popup menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA second Finder window will open at the user’s home directory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe path of the Finder window will be changed to the user’s home directory.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe behaviour under Tiger and Leopard was as described in “Expected Results”. The behaviour in Snow Leopard is a regression."
