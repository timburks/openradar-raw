    description: "The localization of the screen sharing functionality in Finder is incorrect. Please see the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe German word \"Freigabe\" means that a service is opened for access from a remote machine.\r\nIn this case, the functionality is the opposite: The client computer accesses the screen of the remote machine.\r\n\r\nWith the current localization the user would normally expect to setup settings to give the selected computer access to his own screen."
