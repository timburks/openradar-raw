    description: "16-Jul-2009 10:40 PM Jonas Maebe:\r\n* Summary\r\n\r\nFSF gdb does not have support for TAG_constant, but it has support for TAG_variable in combination with AT_const_value. Apple gdb supports the latter as well, and it works fine, but in case such entries appear in the global scope, they are removed by dsymutil due to an absence of debug map entries as explained by you in  rdar://problem/5643496).\r\n\r\nSince these constants do not correspond to any memory location, it is normal that there are no debug map entries since these constants are not associated with any symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1) unpack the attached archive (it's x86_64 code)\r\n2) cd dwarfconstvar\r\n3) ./ppas.sh\r\n4) gdb dwarfconstvar\r\n5) b PASCALMAIN\r\n6) run\r\n7) p globalconst\r\n8) step\r\n9) p localconst\r\n10) quite gdb, run dsymutil on dwarfconstvar and repeat steps 4 till 9\r\n\r\n\r\n* Expected results\r\n\r\nBoth before and after running dsymutil, both globalconst and localconst should be printed in step 7 resp. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Actual results\r\n\r\nAfter running dsymutil, globalconst is no longer known.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Notes\r\n\r\nRunning dwarfdump on dwarfconstvar.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/dwarfconstvar confirms that the debug information for globalconst is not included there.\r\n\r\n\r\n'dwarfconstvar.tbz' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2009 10:47 PM Jonas Maebe:\r\nSorry, please use dwarfconstvar-fixed.tbz rather than dwarfconstvar.tbz (the former called a version of the linker on my machine that I patched to fix 5591394)"
