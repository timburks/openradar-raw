    description: "Quote from http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSHTTPCookieStorage_Class/Reference/Reference.html:\r\n\r\n> NSHTTPCookieStorage implements a singleton object (shared instance) that manages the shared cookie \r\n> storage. These cookies are shared among all applications and are kept in sync cross-process.\r\n\r\nThat's actually incorrect. I have checked NSHTTPCookieStorage under iPhone OS 3.0 and it is working only for application sandbox.\r\n\r\nRelated topic from Dev Forums: https://devforums.apple.com/message/107797"
