    description: "When dragging files into an Xcode project, a sheet appears with the topmost option being a checkbox, which asks whether the files should be copied (if needed). When checked, the files are generally copied to the root directory of the project.\r\n\r\nHowever, many projects are organized with subdirectories, for instance all my projects have Source, XIBs, Frameworks, Graphics, and Resources folders.\r\n\r\nIt would be wonderful to add underneath this checkbox, a drop-down box that lists the subdirectories of the folder (recursively maybe?) and lets us choose the subdirectory it should be copied to, rather than the root dir."
