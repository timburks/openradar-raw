    description: "Summary:\r\nNSXMLNode nodesForXPath:error: and objectsForXQuery:constants:error: methods do not work anymore when using the XPath matches function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see the self-explaining nodesForXPathIsWorking() function at http://gist.github.com/164839.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nnodesForXPathIsWorking() returns YES\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnodesForXPathIsWorking() returns NO\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug was introduced in Mac OS 10.5.8. The test program was working on Mac OS 10.5.7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have tracked this bug down to the pcre_compile function of the private XQuery framework. This function always return NULL along with the error \"this version of PCRE is not compiled with PCRE_UTF8 support\". This error is not reported on the console but I was able to read it by examining memory in gdb.\r\n\r\nThe test program at http://gist.github.com/164839 also provides a very hackish workaround for the i386 architecture.\r\n\r\nNote that the XPath replace and tokenize functions are also affected by this bug.\r\n\r\nThis bug is classified as \"Serious Bug\", but it should probably be classified as \"Extremely Serious Bug\" given that there is no non-hackish workaround."
