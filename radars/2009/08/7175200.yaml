    description: "Summary: \r\nXCode3.2 fails to correctly link categories contained in external static libraries for ARM targets.  Specifically in the example provided I am using a category on NSData that uses the common crypto code  that is linked into a static library. \r\n\r\nThe code works under XCode 3.1.3 under 10.5.8; under 10.6 (10432) and XCode 3.2 the linker fails to include the category code in the ARM binary.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Unzip included test program\r\n1. Compile for simulator and run - will work \r\n2. Compile and debug on device - will crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNSData category code be linked into final  ARM binary and work as expected when called from a host program\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen running my application on the simulator the code works as expected; when running on the device a unknown selector exception is thrown.   \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nCompile and run this project under XCode 3.1.3 under 10.5.8 for both the simulator and the device\r\nLinker fails to bind category code into final binary for the ARM target as is shown in the included symbol dumps\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached is a zip file containing a demo project, and two symbol dumps from compiled ARM and i386 binaries.  The symbol dumps clearly show that the i386 binaries has all of the required code;the ARM binaries do not."
