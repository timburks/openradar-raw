    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening a PNG image with RGB/16 encoding in the Xcode 3.1.4 built-in viewer crashes Xcode, displaying an \"unrecognized selector\" message. The object on which the selector is called varies; the selector is always 'bytes'.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create an RGB image file with 16 bits per pixel using a graphics editor (reporter used Adobe Photoshop CS4).\r\n2. Save the file and import it into an Xcode project.\r\n3. Single-click the file in the Xcode file browser, causing Xcode to attempt to open the file in a viewer.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe image is displayed in Xcode, or an error message is displayed stating that Xcode does not support RGB/16-encoded PNG files.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nA message is displayed stating that Xcode caught an internal exception when the unrecognized selector \"bytes\" was sent to an object. Xcode crashes shortly thereafter, logging a stack trace to the console.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem is always reproducible, even when creating a new file in Adobe Photoshop CS4 (removing the possibility of a single corrupt file crashing Xcode). The problem does not occur when the same file is converted to RGB/8 encoding and saved, then opened in Xcode. The reporter only tested files created in Photoshop CS4 and opened in Xcode 3.1.4 on a MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.5.7 on a 2.4GHz dual-core processor with 4GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample file (crash.png) that crashes Xcode. It is a 47x45 PNG encoded in RGB/16 and created in Adobe Photoshop CS4. The crash produced by this file may not correspond to the crash log attached.\r\n\r\n28-Aug-2009 03:43 PM Vanaja Pasumarthi :\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nSnow Leopard Client is available commercially as of August 28th, 2009 at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/\r\n\r\nUpon installing this software, please update this bug report with your results."
