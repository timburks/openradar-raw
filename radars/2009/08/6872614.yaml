    description: "09-May-2009 01:21 PM Derek Morr:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAirport Extreme (and presumably other Airport models) does not support IPv6 addresses in the \"Syslog Destination Address\" field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Launch Airport Utility, and select and Airport Extreme.\r\n\r\n2) Click \"Manual Setup\"\r\n\r\n3) Click on the \"Advanced\" tab.\r\n\r\n4) In the \"Syslog Destination Address\" field, try to enter an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to paste an IPv6 address in the field, such as \"2001:470:1f07:ef0:219:e3ff:fed4:5512\". Alternatively, you should be able to type in an IPv6 address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf you try to paste an address, the IPv6 address will be truncated to 15 characters (which is also the max length of an IPv4 address). In the example above, the address is truncated to \"2001:470:1f07:e\".\r\n\r\nIf you try to type the address, you will be unable to enter non-numeric characters, even though \"a\" - \"e\" are allowed in IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot showing the address truncation.\r\n\r\n\r\n'airport_syslog.tiff' was successfully uploaded"
