    description: "The Xcode Organizer window is an excellent tool for uploading applications and downloading data from multiple test devices. The problem is that it can't be automated.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWhy do we need this automation?\r\n\r\n• Automated testing of applications requires getting predefined datasets onto the device prior to testing and downloading results after the tests.\r\n\r\n• With applications that use GameKit, a build must often be distributed to several devices at once. A script that runs xcodebuild doesn't have any way to move the resulting binary to multiple devices for testing. The current workflow goes something like this:\r\n\r\n     1) Build target\r\n     2) Open Organizer window\r\n     3) Select device 1\r\n     4) Install & wait\r\n     5) Select device 2\r\n     6) Install & wait\r\n     7) Select device 3\r\n     8) Install & wait\r\n     9) Close Organizer window\r\n     10) Start debugging\r\n\r\nProposed Solution\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nI propose a command line tool that works something like this:\r\n\r\n$ xcodetransfer --upload MyDevice1 --id com.example.MyApp --binary MyApp.app\r\n\r\n$ xcodetransfer --upload MyDevice1 --id com.example.MyApp --sandbox Documents/MyData.sqlite\r\n\r\n$ xcodetransfer --download MyDevice1 --id com.example.MyApp --sandbox Documents/MyData.sqlite\r\n\r\n$ xcodetransfer --download MyDevice1 --id com.example.MyApp --sandbox Library/Preferences/com.example.MyApp.plist\r\n\r\nIn essence, this gives us a file transfer facility. Imagine how fun web development would be without FTP and you'll quickly see how essential this tool would be for iPhone development."
