    description: "20-Aug-2009 09:29 PM David McCabe:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe standard behavior in Mac OS when dragging any object is that dropping on the menu bar cancels the drag. However, if you drag a Terminal window tab to the menu bar, the window is simply moved to the top of the screen. In contrast, Safari follows the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a Terminal window.\r\n2. Create a new tab so that the tab bar is visible.\r\n3. Click and drag any of the tabs.\r\n4. Release the drag over the menu bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe tab should snap back to its previous location.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThe tab turns into a new window at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn Safari, dragged tabs are shown as proxy thumbnails of the windows, whereas in Terminal, the entire window is dragged around by the tab. Arguably, because the window is never allowed to enter the menu bar, but follows the normal window-dragging behavior, the current behavior is correct. However, it is still useful to have some area for canceling drags, and that area is the menu bar."
