    description: "Summary:\r\nAddress Book’s main window loses three pixels of height every time you quit and relaunch it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Address Book.\r\n2. Drag its main window to the very top of your screen, just under your menubar.\r\n3. Quit it.\r\n4. Relaunch it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected its main window to be the same height as it had been when I quit it.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bottom edge of the window is where it was when I quit it, but the window is three pixels shorter, leaving a three pixel gap between the menubar and the Address Book window where before quitting there had been no such gap.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nKeep quitting and relaunching and it gets shorter, and shorter, and shorter…\r\n\r\nThis is annoying, surprising, and given how obsessive I am about making sure all my windows are placed and sized according to my Master Plan, disturbing."
