    description: "Summary.\r\nThere are times that copy/paste does not work when copying data from some apps to a Mail window. This only applies from some sources, but is fine for others. It is not even dependent on the source app, but something else I can't determine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce.\r\n1. Open this page in Safari Version 4 Public Beta (5528.17).\r\n\r\nhttp://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idl_html_help/SIZE.html\r\n\r\n2. Select some text from the page and type command-C to copy.\r\n3. Open Mail.\r\n4. Open a new message.\r\n5. Hit command-V to paste. Nothing is pasted. Repeat with Firefox - it works. Copy from Safari and paste into TextEdit - that's ok too. I don't know what is particularly special about the page given above as other web pages do work.\r\n\r\nSecond test.\r\n1. Download the application \"R\":\r\nhttp://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/R-2.9.0.dmg (from http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu/)\r\n2. Install app. (Sorry to have you go through all this, but it's another reproducible example that shows that this may be Mail's fault.)\r\n3. Run R.\r\n4. As the simplest example, enter this in the console window:\r\nplot(1,1)\r\n5. Make the new plot window that just opened active.\r\n6. Hit command-c to copy. This will copy the graph as a PDF.\r\n7. Open a new Mail window (i.e. compose new email) and paste. The plot should appear, but nothing does.\r\n8. Paste in a new TextEdit or Pages window. The graphic appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nCopied text/data appears as expected when pasting.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nWhen pasting in the first example, Mail plays an alert beep. When pasting in the second example, no beep is played.\r\n\r\nRegression\r\nCopy paste certainly worked from Safari to Mail in the past, as well as from R. I don't know when this began to happen. \r\n\r\nNotes\r\nMore information is available here:\r\nhttp://markmail.org/search/?q=margarte#query:margarte+page:1+mid:s7fhqddfjdpkrl25+state:results\r\n\r\nThis person seems to not be able to paste into Word as well."
