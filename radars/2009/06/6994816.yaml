    description: "Summary: \r\nI would like to be able to constrain zooming to just vertical or just horizontal in a UIScrollview.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIScrollViewDelegate with some viewForZoomingInScrollView: delegate magic as one normally would and pinch.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn a limited number of cases, it would be nice to be able to stretch the view only horizontally or only vertically.  Imagine a calendar application much like your own that shows a user their entire day but also allows the user to zoom in (stretching only the height of an hour) to see more detail.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe zoom always zooms in both the horizontal and vertical directions.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGiving the UIScrollview a property such as \"constrainsZooming\" and adding delegate methods that only get called when it is YES such as \"ViewForHorizontalZoomingInScrollView:\" and  \"ViewForVerticalZoomingInScrollView:\" would be quite useful.  You would also have to allow one to set the vertical and horizontal zoom factors separately in, say, setHorizontalZoom: and setVerticalZoom:.  SetZoom would probably set both horizontal and vertical zoom properties if constrainsZooming is NO."
