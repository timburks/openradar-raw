    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease allow the iTunes Library Sharing ability to work when iTunes is not running.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup 2 computers both running iTunes.\r\n2. On computer 1 setup iTunes Library Sharing.\r\n3. Close iTunes on computer 1\r\n4. Open iTunes on computer 2\r\n5. See that no share shows up to computer 2\r\n6. Reopen iTunes on computer 1\r\n7. Notice that now a share shows on computer 2\r\n8. Close iTunes on computer 1\r\n9. Notice that now the share goes away from computer 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should at least give you the option to allow sharing when iTunes is not running. Perhaps by using the always running iTunesHelper process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen you want to share your iTunes library with another computer in your house, you must actively think about it and prepare by opening iTunes on the \"source\" computer. This makes for a very unfriendly user experience, for example when you have say a Mac mini running as a glorified media center. To be able to have access at any time you would have to leave iTunes always running on the \"source\" computer.\r\n\r\nAnother example would simply be that you have a Mac Pro (or iMac) which has your iTunes library, and you are in another room working on your MacBook Pro. If you decide you want to listen to music you would have to go into the room where the desktop computer is and open iTunes then head back to your MacBook now being able to access your main music library.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a problem for anyone with multiple computers, as there is no good way to sync Gigs of music between computers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone"
