    description: "11-Jul-2007 10:36 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nWhen a scheduled Backup Plan in run in Backup 3.x that Backup is always incremental.  Whilst this is suitable for backups to external storage devices, it is not always appropriate for optical media.  I would request an option in Backup to specify that a scheduled backup should always be a Full Backup rather than an incremental one.  This should be on the scheduling level rather than the Plan level as this would allow a Plan to have both incremental backups and full backups scheduled.\r\n\r\nFor example this would allow data to be backed up incrementally daily but then have a full backup to optical media on a monthly basis without requiring the user to explicitly request a full backup from the relevant menu item."
