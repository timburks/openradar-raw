    description: "Summary:\r\nThe chapter “Registering Dependent Keys” in the KVO Programming Guide assumes that the reader is using Core Data, even though KVO does not require Core Data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the “Registering Dependent Keys” chapter (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/Concepts/DependentKeys.html).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe chapter clearly explains how to make one property depend on another in both Tiger and Leopard, and includes information specific to Core Data for readers who are using Core Data in their applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe chapter explains how to make “the value of one property depend… on that of one or more other attributes in another entity.” The chapter is useless for readers who aren't using Core Data, because it constantly talks about entities and attributes and relationships, which are terms specific to Core Data (and database administration) and are not defined previously in a general-KVO context within the KVO Guide.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe 2006-06-28 edition of the KVO Guide, while ignorant of to-many relationships, was not dependent on Core Data. The update that rewrote the chapter to assume knowledge of Core Data from top to bottom, which was one of the two from this year, is the one that broke it for readers who have not yet used Core Data.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe new version of the chapter also does not describe how to depend on another property of the same object in Mac OS X 10.4, which that version of Foundation *does* allow. It mentions the method one would use to do that, but only in saying that you can't use it to depend on a key path."
