    description: "07-Jun-2009 12:48 AM Chris Pepper:\r\niPhoto makes it very difficult to find the original of a photo (either the unmodified Original, or the Modified current version). This should be easy, as it is in iTunes. Edit in External Editor will find the current editable version, but that's inadequate."
