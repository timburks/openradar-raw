    description: "Summary:\r\nInstalling Java Update 4 prevents the use of strong cryptographic keys. This appears to be a regression of the issue fixed in Java Update 2 in September of last year, as documented at <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3179> (final issue mentioned on the page). The policy no longer appears to allow keys stronger than 128 bits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOur system was working fine. We installed Java Update 4 on one machine and after the installation, any attempts to use a 192-bit PKCS12 key cause a 'java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size'. Another machine had not yet been updated, and continued to work fine; we updated that machine to Update 4 and immediately the same problem manifested itself. A third machine that does not have the update continues to work without producing any exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expected the decryption process to proceed without errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\njava.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe three machines we've observed this issue on are all MacBook Pros (one unibody and two older models), all otherwise up-to-date with all software updates.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nComparing the non-updated machine with the updated machines, the problem appears to be caused by incorrect versions of the files 'local_policy.jar' and 'US_export_policy.jar' in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Home/lib/security.\r\n\r\nWe are able to work around the problem by replacing these files with the versions of the files from the machine that has not yet been updated with Update 4. Replacing these two JAR files causes the problem to disappear."
