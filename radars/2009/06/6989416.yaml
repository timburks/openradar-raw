    description: "It'd be great if Apple could provide a proper API into the App Store for developers. The specific information which would be most helpful is:\r\n\r\n1. Being able to query the ranking of an application, in a specific category, or chart, on a per country basis.\r\n\r\n2. Being able to retrieve all the reviews for a specific application on a per version, per country basis.\r\n\r\n3. Being able to retrieve trend and financial reports.\r\n\r\n4. Being able to generate promo codes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this information must be scraped from the Store or iTunes Connect, and as such is prone to breakage when the store layout is changed. Not to mention how inefficient it is collecting information this way."
