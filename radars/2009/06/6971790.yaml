Requests made of the file system hang until a response is received from the server.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are unfortunate enough to experience such a hang, you should still be getting a dialog stating that the server is not responding and that dialog gives you the chance to \"disconnect\" (i.e. forcibly unmount) the unresponsive file system which should cause apps accessing that file system to continue.\r\n\r\nAre you not getting that dialog?\r\n\r\n16-Jun-2009 08:27 PM Yann Bizeul:\r\nYou misunderstood my bug report, I'm aware these messages are expected behavior, since the server is no longer available. The bug is that I do not get the \"disconnect\" dialog box, and applications are freezing one by one, when diskarbitration is hanging I/Os.\r\nThe only solution to avoid the reboot of Mac OS, is to power-on the server again, then I get the dialog box in the finder that ask me to disconnect the server."
