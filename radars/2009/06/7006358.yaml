    description: "In iPhone OS 3.0, copying an attachment in Mail provides two types on the pasteboard: (1) an image type containing the image data if the attachment is an image, or just the attachment icon if not, and (2) a URL, which contains a content identifier (the \"cid:\" URL scheme) for the attachment itself.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to get at the contents of Mail attachments from a 3rd party application. Either via adding a third type to those placed on the pasteboard when copying an attachment from Mail, or by adding a URL handler for the \"cid\" scheme, so that a 3rd party application could fetch the attachment data given the URL that already exists on the pasteboard."
