    description: "Applications often print large amounts of output.\r\n\r\nI often want to find every line of output containing some string. For example, my logging may include the name of the source file and I may want to see only logged lines including that name.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Xcodeâ€™s Console window had a way for me to type that string, and highlight every matching line or filter to show only matching lines."
