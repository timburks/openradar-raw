    description: "Currently there is no ability to offer time limited demo versions of applications on the App Store. 'Lite' apps which cripple access to features are  really not a great substitute, as the idea of a demo is to give a full app experience for a limited time.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the ability to create time limited demo applications would be an easy way for people to purchase the full version once their time was up."
