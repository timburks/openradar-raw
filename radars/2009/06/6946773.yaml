    description: "04-Jun-2009 12:01 PM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen entering your address in the Account / Billing Info section of the Mobile Me website, Scottish counties such as Perthshire, Angus and others are not included.  Lumped together as \"Central\" (not even Central Scotland)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login to www.me.com using a mobileme account\r\n2. Click on Account button (grey button with head & shoulders silhouette).  Re-enter password\r\n3. Click on Billiing Info section in list on left.\r\n4. Set the Country to United Kingdom.\r\n5. Click on the State/Province pop up menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAngus, Perthshire, Ayrshire and other Scottish counties included\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSouthern counties lumped together as \"Borders\", others as \"Central\", northern ones as \"Highlands\". Oddly Fife and Strathclyde are included.  Wales and Northern Ireland have their counties split out appropriately, but Scottish counties are clearly not important to Apple.   Neither is having the Mobile Me dates internationalised to a format that everyone else in the world recognises except the US."
