    description: "The requirement that a paid app is necessary for developers to implement In App Purchase is ludicrously unjustifiable. The rational given that when customers download a free app, that they expect it to be free forever is just ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn fact I'd go further and say that it flies in the face of many years of software development where free 'demo' versions were and continue to be given away free for evaluation, with the ability for customers to easily purchase a full version for continued use at the end of the evaluation period.\r\n\r\nThat seems like just one case were In App Purchase would be coupled perfectly with a free app.\r\n\r\nDemo versions is something which developers have been asking for since the app store was launched. Not only is there no sign of this being implemented, now it seems Apple are going out of their way to intentionally block one possible method developers could have to implement true demos. \r\n\r\nDeveloper feedback at WWDC was pretty clear on this too. Remove the artificial restriction.\r\n\r\nFinally, lets say a customer does download a free app, then finds out they have to pay to access content, or pay to continue using it after an evaluation period. What have the lost if they decide not to continue use? They're not out of pocket at all. \r\n\r\nIt's a ludicrous unnecessary requirement if you ask me."
