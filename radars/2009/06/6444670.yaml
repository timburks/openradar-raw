    description: "One thing which would be great to see with the App Store is realtime notifications of sales, similar to paypals Instant Payment Notification system. Basically developers register a URL or their choice with Apple, and the sale data is posted to that URL by Apple servers whenever a sale is made.\r\n\r\nPart of the rational behind this style notification is so that developer created lead tracking codes can be added to itunes urls when advertising products. These codes would then come through on the sale notifications, which will allow developers to concretely measure the cost and response to various marketing options, in near realtime."
