    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen a JavaScript bookmarklet in Safari for iPhone 3.0 uses window.getSelection(), it does not work. The selection is removed as soon as the bookmarks menu is opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a JavaScript bookmarklet that uses window.getSelection(), like the one here: https://junecloud.com/ds/grab/ or the \"view selection\" one here: https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagedata.html\r\n2. Open a web page\r\n3. Select some text\r\n4. Tap the bookmarks button\r\n5. Select the bookmarklet\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bookmarklet should be able to access the selected text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs soon as the bookmarks button is tapped, the selection is removed, so the script is unable to see what text was selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
