    description: "30-Jun-2009 11:36 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nUnsubscribing Calendars on iPhone can be confusing\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iCal on a Mac, create a calendar, add some events.\r\n2. Publich calendar to MobileMe.\r\n3. Send an email for the published calendar\r\n4. On an iPhone, open the mail with the subscription URL\r\n5. In the mail message, click and hold on the webcal:// subscription URL\r\n6. When prompted, select \"Open\" calendar\r\n7. When prompted,select \"Subscribe\" to the calendar\r\n8. Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Would expect subscribed calendars to be under the \"Calendars\" Section\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Instead they are \"Accounts\", all other items in this section are Mail accounts.  Calendars are not \"accounts\"\r\n\r\nWith 11 email accounts set-up on my iPhone, I repeatedly scrolled past the subscribed calendars and did not notice them on the list.  All settings below relate to Mail, until the Contacts section, which is clearly marked.  Below this is the Calendars section.  Subscribed calendars should be placed here as a second choice.\r\n\r\nPreferably it should be possible to unsubscribe calendars from the Calendar app, rather than have to go in Settings in the first place."
