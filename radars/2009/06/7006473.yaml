    description: "25-Jun-2009 11:20 AM Jeremy Knope:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode no longer searches the user's keychains when checking the code signing identities set in the build settings.  In previous version of Xcode (3.1.1 and earlier I believe) the listed code signing identities would be from all available keychains.  The codesign utility still searches keychains like it says it should, but Xcode bails before trying in it's dependency checking step, only scanning the default keychain now.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Store a code signing certificate in a non-default keychain\r\n2. Set a target to have code signing identity of that certificate's name\r\n3. Hit build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should successfully build & codesign the target's product with the named certificate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode bails immediately after hitting build on it's 'checking dependencies' step saying it can not find the code signing identity in the user's keychains.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem was introduced in one of the iPhone SDKs first, but now is a problem in Xcode 3.2 on 10.6 and Xcode 3.1.3 on 10.5."
