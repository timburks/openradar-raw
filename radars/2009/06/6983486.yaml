    description: "Every time a phone link is launched by a native application an alert is shown to the user asking permission to place the call. The documentation, Apple URL Scheme Reference: Phone Links, last updated: 2009-06-08,  clearly stated than only HTML links displays an alert.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Objective-C:\r\n1.- NSURL *phoneURL = [NSURL URLWithString:telURLString];\r\n2.- [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:phoneURL];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the URL is correct, the phone.app should launch and \"initiates dialing without further prompting from the user.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert displays asking if the user really wants to dial the phone number and initiates dialing if the user accepts.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe alert only occurs in iPhone OS 3.0. Previous versions didn't display the alert. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApple current iPhone OS 3.0 documentation:\r\nApple URL Scheme Reference: Phone Links\r\nThe tel URL scheme is used to launch the Phone application and initiate dialing of the specified phone number. Tapping a telephone link on a webpage displays an alert asking if the user really wants to dial the phone number and initiates dialing if the user accepts. In a native application, opening a URL with the tel scheme initiates dialing without further prompting from the user."
