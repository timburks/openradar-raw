    description: "* Summary:\r\nSetting the base SDK to 3.0 and the deployment target to 2.2 should produce code that works on 2.2 devices. In many cases this is true, but this does not work for (at least) libxml2. By comparison, libsqlite3 does not have any issues.\r\n\r\n* Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a basic iPhone application from template\r\n2) Set project-level Base SDK to 3.0\r\n3) Set project-level deployment target to 2.2\r\n4) Build and run on 2.2 device, to confirm correct behavior.\r\n5) Add libxml2 to target\r\n6) Build and run on 2.2 device; note crash at launch in dyld code.\r\n\r\nError log:\r\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib\r\n  Referenced from:\r\n/var/mobile/Applications/D7E82736-AD0B-423A-A404-C36A561E3452/TestApp.app/TestApp\r\n  Reason: Incompatible library version: TestApp requires\r\nversion 10.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 9.0.0\r\n\r\n2.2 SDK to 2.2 and 3.0 devices, 3.0 SDK to 3.0 devices, and 3.0 SDK to 2.2 simulator all work correctly. The problem only occurs with 3.0 SDK to 2.2 devices.\r\n\r\n* Expected Results:\r\nBe able to link libxml2 in 3.0 SDK and still launch on 2.2 devices.\r\n\r\n* Actual Results:\r\nCrash on 2.2 devices due to linkage expecting a later version of libxml2 than is provided on the device.\r\n\r\n* Notes\r\nAfter diagnosing this problem, it was easy reproduced by another developer in an independent environment."
