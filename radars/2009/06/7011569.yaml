    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease add a common \"area\" (ie: folder) to allow iPhone applications to be able to share information or store plist files allowing for inter-application communication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(One of MANY possibilities)\r\n1. Use an application to download a file (ex: Briefcase) and that file is now on your device.\r\n2. Try to access that file in ANY other application (ex: Quickoffice), including standard applications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be some way for applications to share information, so a program like Briefcase can allow you to specify to make file(s) accessible to other programs and therefore either insert that file into a shared folder, or perhaps placing a reference to the file in a system wide database which states allowed files.\r\nThen when an application like Quickoffice starts it can show you the available files that are shared from other apps and therefore allow you to access them in it's program.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no current ways to share information between applications, so I download a file in a program like Briefcase and I have no way to access that file in another program like Quickoffice.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone"
