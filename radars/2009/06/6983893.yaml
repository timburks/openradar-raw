    description: "Summary: \r\nCustomisations to the order of the tabs in App Store are no longer remembered under OS 3.0. App Store always defaults to Featured, instead of opening in the view the user was last using.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open App Store on the iPhone.\r\n2) Tap 'More'.\r\n3) Tap 'Edit'.\r\n4) Change the bottom icons to be (L-R): Redeem, Categories, Search, Updates\r\n5) Tap 'Done'.\r\n6) Tap 'Updates'.\r\n7) Press the Home button.\r\n8) Open App Store again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp Store quickly opens on the Updates tab, with Redeem, Categories, Search, Updates, More showing at the bottom of the screen. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Loading\" screen remains for about 10 seconds (if on GPRS). App Store opens on the Featured tab, with Featured, Categories, Top 25, Search, More showing at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not occur with 2.2.1. iPhone 3G, 16Gb on O2-UK.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen on a slow connection, or when Apple's servers are slow, defaulting to Featured makes startup of the whole app take about 10 seconds, which is far too long. At the very least, the tab bar should display before App Store attempts to load data from the network, so the user can switch away from the data-heavy Featured tab.\r\n\r\nAnd why is Updates not in the tab bar by default, anyway? That seems to be a pretty important function...\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to Bug ID# 6983893.  After further investigation it has been determined that this is a known issue, which is currently being investigated by engineering.  This issue has been filed in our bug database under the original Bug ID# 6964191."
