    description: I upgraded my 10.5.7 Server with the WWDC DVD on my Mac Pro. It installed a bunch of files and rebooted. Then it sat at the Welcome screen for 90 minutes until I gave up and power cycled the box. Now when I boot that volume all I get is the Welcome screen. The spinny indicator in the corner spins but the Continue button is never enabled. I can open and close the Help window but nothing else.
