    description: "22-Aug-2007 11:07 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWould like to be able to access the Core Data Model for a project from withing Interface Builder 3.0\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nUnder NeXTStep with the DBKit it was possible to browse a data model from within Interface Builder.  This allow connecting table columns, text field and other controls directly to the model, graphically by dragging links from the control to the specific attribute within the data model.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Core Data it should be possible to do something similar with IB 3.0.\r\n\r\nWhen binding a control to a model attribute via a controller you have to remember and correctly type the model key path.  Whilst there is some completion in the current version, IB3 does not know about model attributes that have just been created in the Data Model as it doesn't automatically stay in sync.  It would be far less error prone if the a) the binding could be made graphically and b) the binding could be made graphically to a representation of the data model within IB3."
