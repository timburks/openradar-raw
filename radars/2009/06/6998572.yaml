    description: "Summary:\r\nCopy in Mobile Safari fails to function properly after media playback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mobile Safari and navigate to any page with playable media. Google Voice and YouTube are perfect examples.\r\n2. (Optional: to demonstrate that it works at one point, and what should be expected) Hold finger over a text word on the page until it is highlighted, then lift your finger to show the copy dialogue.\r\n3. Play a media file (video, audio, or YouTube) from within Mobile Safari.\r\n4. On any page, try step 2 again. Notice that text and other items can still be selected, and the resize draggers still work, but upon finger lift there is no copy dialogue.\r\n5. If you close and reopen Mobile Safari, or click in a text field, the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCopy dialogue should appear when selecting text or pictures on a page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCopy dialogue does not appear, but selection works by itself. Since there is no dialogue, the selection can not be used.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3Gs, and iPod touch 1st generation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing a text field on the page or returning to the Home screen and opening Mobile Safari will allow the dialogue to work again.\r\n\r\n'iPhone-Screenshots.tar.gz' uploaded"
