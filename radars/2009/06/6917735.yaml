    description: "Summary: \r\nXcode presently only supports 3 different SCM systems - CVS, Perforce and Subversion.\r\n\r\nSupport from within Xcode for distributed version control systems - specifically, git - is requested.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the support should be provided via an open, documented plugin system [similar to that used for web browser plugins], so that third-parties can provide support for SCM systems in addition to those provided by the dev tools team.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Launch Xcode.app\r\n2. Select \"SCM > Configure SCM Repositories...\"\r\n3. Click \"+\" below the list of SCM repositories\r\n4. In the panel that appears, select \"Git\"\r\n5. Provide the required git repository information for Xcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCan't speculate on engineering effort required to implement such a plugin system, but in an ideal world, developers then wouldn't necessarily have to wait for the dev tools team to implement support for their chosen SCM system(s)."
