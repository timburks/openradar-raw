    description: "After capturing an image using UIImagePickerController, an application can save the resulting UIImage in the Photos Album using UIWriteImageToSavedPhotosAlbum().\r\n\r\nWhen capturing a video using the same UIImagePickerController, there is no way for an application to save the resulting filesystem reference in the UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL key. There also isn't a way to save the NSData object created with that NSURL.\r\n\r\nIf a user records a video with the camera, it is likely they want to save it in the Camera Roll as well as use it in the application that presented the interface. There needs to be a function like UIWriteMediaURLToSavedPhotosAlbum() to do this."
