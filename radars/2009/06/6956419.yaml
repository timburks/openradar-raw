    description: "Summary:\r\nThe feature from the Safari 4.0 beta that placed the tabs up in the top title bar should be added back into the release version of Safari 4, either as the default or, more reasonably, as an option in Safari preferences. This feature was well-liked by many users as it saves limited screen real estate with an elegant user interface."
