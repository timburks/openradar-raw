    description: Many of the photos imported from my Canon PowerShot SD800 IS do not automatically get the right rotation in iPhoto. Some do autorotate correctly, but a significant proportion do not. I'm attaching one example of a portrait photo which came in with landscape orientation. I've been seeing this for at least a couple weeks -- not sure when it started.
