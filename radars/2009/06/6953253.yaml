    description: When I configure a proxy that is protected by proxy auth, Safari can use it just fine, however when I use NSURLConnection to load a URL, I can see the proxy being used (via tcpdump on the server), however the only result I get is a squid authentication error page. I therefore draw the conclusion that NSURLConnection does not use the proxy auth settings.
