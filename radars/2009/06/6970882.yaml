    description: 'A new and improved way of handling tabstops has been detailed here: http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/ . It would be nice to see this in Xcode as it would help make code formatting much easier and more reliable. In a nutshell elastic tabstops makes vertically adjacent tabstops all the same width, essentially moving code into a table like structure. For more information and an example please read the prior link.'
