    description: "When zooming into a CATiledLayer, the contents of the tile at the outer zoom level remain in place (transformed) until replaced by the contents of the tile at the inner zoom level, allowing for continuity in the user's experience. \r\n\r\nWhen zooming out, however, the contents of the tile at the inner zoom level often disappear before the contents of the tile at the outer zoom level appear, leaving a blank which is completely disorienting for the user.\r\n\r\nCATiledLayer should never remove zoom-transformed tiles until they are ready to be replaced."
