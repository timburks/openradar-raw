    description: "Summary: \r\nA music file in iTunes can have a Media Kind (Music, Audiobook, Voice Memo) set in the Options tab of the Get Info window. For video files, the same setting exists, with Movie, TV Show and Music Video as options. In Smart Playlists, the latter choice of three is available as a criterion named \"Video Kind\". For music files, however, there appears to be no \"Music Kind\" or \"Song Kind\" equivalent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a voice memo on an iPhone.\r\n2. Sync with iTunes. The memo gets the correct media kind \"Voice Memo\" automatically.\r\n3. Attempt to create a Smart Playlists that filters for this kind.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou'll pick a \"Music Kind\", \"Song Kind\", \"Media Kind\" or similar criterion and set that to \"Voice Memo\", just like you can with video files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't; this criterion is not available for filtering."
