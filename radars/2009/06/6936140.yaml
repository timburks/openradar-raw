    description: "Summary: \r\nCrash reports now contain an application specific information section, it'd be great to be able to use it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Attempt to generate a crashlog with app specific information that you choose\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome public method exists for doing this\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSomething like this is required: http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/samba/samba-187/patches/add-smb-panic-string-to-crashreporter\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has existed as long as app specific info in crash logs has.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur current workaround is to use the private method, but only in debug builds, and with a note attached explaining that it's only in debug builds. Hopefully that's not a problem."
