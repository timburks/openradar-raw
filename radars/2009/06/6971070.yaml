    description: "Summary: \r\niTunes 8.2 randomly decides that it won't allow one to drag a song from a song list to \r\na playlist\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to drag a song from the Library->Music section to a playlist. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see a representation of the row I am dragging from the music section by my mouse as I drag it to a playlist and then let go of the mouse button and the song is added to a user created playlist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot drag song. iTunes won't let you drag and drop anything\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI cannot narrow down the causes of this problem right now, but I do know I did not experience this problem prior to iTunes 8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only solution to fix this problem appears to be Quitting iTunes and re-opening the app."
