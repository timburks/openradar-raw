    description: "29-Jun-2009 10:43 AM Chris Foresman:\r\nSummary: \r\nSince installing Safari 4.0.1, the \"Reopen All Windows from Last Session\" command in the History menu does not work. Safari instead opens an empty window that cannot be closed and does not load any content. A screen cap of such a window is attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Quit Safari with windows open.\r\n2. Restart Safari.\r\n3. Click History > Reopen All Windows from Last Session\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari will open all windows and tabs from the last session and begin loading the contents.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA blank window, usually titled \"Untitled 2\" will open. No other windows open. No content is loaded, and the window cannot be closed or used for browsing. It will not accept any clicks, though hovers seem to be properly registered.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis feature worked fine in Safari 4 betas.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA screen shot of the problem window is included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 4.png' was successfully uploaded"
