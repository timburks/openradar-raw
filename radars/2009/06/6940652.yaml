    description: "The iPhone device uses the modern (Objective C 2.0) runtime. The iPhone simulator uses the legacy runtime.\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to take advantage of new runtime features. One example is leaving ivar declarations out of an @interface (and relying solely on @property declarations.) To use this feature, you'd have to litter your code with #if !TARGET_OS_IPHONE.\r\n\r\nOf course, the hard part is making sure that the word size in the simulator is the same as the device. I'm not asking for 64-bit NSIntegers when I'm testing my iPhone code :-)"
