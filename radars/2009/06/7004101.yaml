    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Coding Guidelines for Cocoa document is unclear on whether the underscore prefix is reserved by Apple on both instance-variable names and method selectors, or only on selectors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read “Typographic Conventions” under “Code Naming Basics” in the Coding Guidelines (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001281-1002931-BBCFHEAB).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation clearly states all the places where the underscore prefix is reserved, and at least the most significant places where it is not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation implies that it is reserved on everything, and only explicit calls out method selectors.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't think it's ever been clear about this, so no.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is some debate among Cocoa programmers about whether one should use the underscore prefix for instance variable names. Mike Lee (who is an Apple engineer) says they are reserved (https://twitter.com/bmf/status/2316498904); Kevin Ballard says that another Apple engineer told him that they are not (https://twitter.com/eridius/status/2316519684). I, for one, would welcome a final, definitive answer in the documentation."
