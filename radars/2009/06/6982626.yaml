    description: "Summary: \r\nData sent and received while tethered (either via USB or Bluetooth) is not reflected in the data usage statistics (Settings → General → Usage).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Reset data usage statistics.\r\n2. Enable tethering on iPhone\r\n3. Connect iPhone to computer via USB or Bluetooth\r\n4. Send/receive data on the computer (visit websites, watch video, etc).\r\n5. End tethering session.\r\n6. Check usage statistics (Settings → General → Usage).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe data usage statistics should reflect data sent & received by the computer while it was tethered to the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nData sent & received by the computer while it was tethered to the iPhone is *not* reflected in the usage stats.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGiven that data consumption is likely higher while tethered, having accurate usage stats including tethered use is important."
