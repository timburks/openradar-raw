    description: "27-Jun-2009 04:50 PM Ian Meyer:\r\nSummary: \r\nSometimes, kernel_task will take up all available CPU cycles, and cause the computer to warm up and fans to run more, on a first-generation MacBook Air w/SSD.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have been unable to isolate any specific cause. I have encountered this while running on wireless and using the USB-Ethernet adapter. I've also had it happen while plugged in to power and on battery.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI don't expect this to happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nkernel_task runs off with my cpu and the computer gets hot\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been happening for several months, under several revisions of 10.5, including 10.5.7. I wiped 10.5.7 today and installed the WWDC release, then updated to 10A394.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFrom my research online, it appears this is a common issue, without a known or acknowledged resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n'stackshot-syms.log' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Jun-2009 11:24 AM Ian Meyer:\r\nIt's happening again, with Airport off and the USB Ethernet adapter connected. The entire system is really laggy. I'm attaching another stackshot log.\r\n\r\n\r\n'stackshot-syms.log' was successfully uploaded"
