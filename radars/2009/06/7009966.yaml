    description: "If an app was already purchased and the customer wants to redownload it, he has to purchase it again. The customer has to authenticate in order to approve the purchase, then after that he will be notified that the download was free if it was free.\r\n\r\nThe customer has no opportunity to reject a second payment should the redownload not be possible.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, the alert that a free download will be granted, should be placed *in advance* of the purchase confirmation dialog.\r\n\r\nThere are several circumstances where a free redownload is not granted:\r\n- the customer has several iTunes accounts and was logged in with the wrong account that has not purchased the app before\r\n- Transfer of app into different account: Because Apple does not support a transfer of apps maintaining the purchaser history, customers will be charged again if they redownload the app from the new vendor account. The customer most likely has not noticed the change of the vendor account. See rdar://6469857 and http://www.futuretap.com/blog/transferring-an-iphone-app-last-episode/"
