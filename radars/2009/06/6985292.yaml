    description: "Summary: \r\n\tFor dual-boot computer labs we need a programatic way of setting the boot device from within Windows. The BootCamp control panel is fine for 1-to-1 deployments, but is not useable in a computer lab setting (where users do not have admin rights). Additionally the solution needs to be able to be activated while at the Windows equivalent of the loginwindow (allowing BootPicker-like applications to be created, and nightly maintenance scripts to use it).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\tN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\tPlease note that this affects large purchases of Macintoshes. The custom-workaround created at Stanford (which involves creating a custom EFI partition as a gatekeepter between the two OS's) allowed Stanford to double its purchase of Apple hardware. Other institutions would be likely to follow this lead if there were a more viable path than the current incarnation of BootPicker allows.\r\n\r\n\tIf you need a reason why the current route for BootPicker is not viable there are three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Between 2 consecutive Windows users you need to reboot twice... that is too long to be useable.\r\n\r\n2. Windows maintenance often requires reboots, and this is not practical without having someone stand there (not workable in large labs).\r\n\r\n3. Many places are coming from having dedicated Windows hardware, putting the MacOS in the permanently dominant position is not politically acceptable in those cases."
