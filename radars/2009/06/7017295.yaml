    description: "* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nI am having an issue with my iPhone application that targets SDK 2.2.1. GDB is giving be invalid values for variables when stepping through code.\r\n\r\nI have a TextViewController class, which is based on the TextViewController class in UICatalog. The class is initialized in two separate view controllers, both in -viewDidLoad. \r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nIn one case, GDB reports the address of the textViewController to be 0x0, although the code works as expected and NSLog(@\"%@\", tvController) prints the object's description correctly. I've included a sample project that demonstrates this case (again, recreatable on a 3.0 device while targeting SDK 2.2.1).\r\n\r\nIn another case, GDB reports the textViewController to point to my view controller's table view and toolbar (there are two instances of the TextViewController in this view controller). In this case, the delegate and title of the textViewController are properly set, but when my delegate method gets called on the main view controller, GDB reports that the textViewController parameter has no textView or delegate and that another instance variable is of the wrong type (a text view in the main view controller is reported as a UIBarButtonItem). I can provide my own production code for this if necessary.\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nThe issue only occurs when running on a device with OS 3.0. It does not occur when targeting SDK 3.0, or when running in the simulator using SDK and OS 2.2.1 or SDK 3.0 and OS 3.0.  I am running OS X 10.5.7 with Xcode 3.1.3. I have created a new project, copied my code in and the bug is still recreatable.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nFollow-up:  [REDACTED] \r\nI have contacted Apple Developer Technical Support and they have suggested that I file a bug report (follow up ID above). A sample project recreating the first case is attached. Production code can be provided if necessary."
