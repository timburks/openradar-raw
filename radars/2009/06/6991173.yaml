    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes will happily display the UDID for an iPod touch, but does not provide a way to copy it to the Clipboard, requiring the user to re-type it the long string of hex digits by hand if he wishes to send it to a software developer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch iTunes.\r\n2. Plug in an iPod touch. (An iPhone may also work.)\r\n3. If it isn't already selected, select the iPod touch in the source list.\r\n4. Click on the serial number to switch that line to show the UDID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can select the UDID and copy it to the clipboard. Alternatively, there's a Copy to Clipboard button I can click.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have no way to extract the UDID but to re-type all 40 hex digits manually.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm guessing not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe probability of a typo somewhere in this long string of digits is high, especially between decimal digits, and among CDEF on a QWERTY keyboard.\r\n\r\n19-Jun-2009 10:27 PM Peter Hosey:\r\nAccording to Zac West, it is possible to hit Copy while the iPod is selected, and it will copy the UDID. My own testing revealed that it will copy the Serial Number or the UDID, whichever is visible.\r\n\r\nSo iTunes does provide a useful way, but it is not obvious. This report should be an Enhancement, then, requesting an obvious way to do this."
