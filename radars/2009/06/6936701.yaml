    description: "01-Jun-2009 07:36 AM Gregory Seidman:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen setting UIStatusBarHidden to true and UIInterfaceOrientation to UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight in the Info.plist, any UIAlertView shown will appear as if the app were running in portrait mode. Turning off UIStatusBarHidden is a workaround.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a new iPhone app project.\r\n2) In the Info.plist, set UIStatusBarHidden to true (boolean value) and UIInterfaceOrientation to UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight (string value).\r\n3) Display a UIAlertView from any part of the app code (e.g. -applicationDidFinishLaunching:).\r\n4) Notice that the alert appears as if the phone were in portrait mode.\r\n5) Set UIStatusBarHidden to false in Info.plist and run it again.\r\n6) Notice that the alert appears appropriately in landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect UIAlertViews to be aware of the app current orientation, regardless of the UIStatusBar's state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAlert views are displayed with an incorrect orientation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt seems to occur with 2.2.1 and all previous versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
