    description: "In prior SDK versions, the '_' character was used automatically by the templates when your project name contained a space for your ProductName property.  This meant it was also used in the application identifier.  With 3.1.3, the underscore character now generates an error during signing that underscore is an invalid character in the app ID.  If we change our app id to not have an underscore, the app can be signed, but for users who are upgrading, they will lose their data associated with the app because the app appears to be a new app.  This is an extremely serious issue for any developers doing upgrades of apps with spaces in their names.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this may cause users to have to repurchase the app as well."
