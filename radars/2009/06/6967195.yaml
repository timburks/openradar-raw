    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have a view controller in a nav in a tabbar controller that has a nav toolbar and a tabbar. Then push a view controller that hidesBottomBarWhenPushed. It hides the toolbar without animating. When you pop back to it, it shows the view controller then the toolbar appears without animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put a view controller in a nav con in a tab bar.\r\n2. have the nav bar show its toolbar.\r\n3. push a view controller that hidesBottomBarWhenPushed\r\n4. pop it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nToolbar should stay on the 1st view con when the push is happening and be there when the pop happens. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Toolbar is taken away before the push and added back after the pop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm guessing its not taking having a toolbar and a tabbar at the same time into account."
