    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn the Messages app there is no way to determine if messages have failed to send if the user exits the Messages app. Also there is no way to tell if there are unsent messages to a particular contact, i.e. the user has started typing a message and moved to do something else without pressing send, leaving a message unsent.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nAttempt to send a text message to a contact in an area with no cell coverage, if you remain in the message view a red exclamation mark will appear next to the message but if you quit Messages while the message is sending you receive no notification that the message has failed to send. If you return to list view while the message is sending a message will appear below the contact indicating a failure but this itself is not very conspicuous\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\niPhone should offer an indicator to the user that there is unprocessed data associated with a particular contact. A red dot next to the name in list view where a blue dot normally appears for unread messages would indicate to the user that the particular contact has data which requires action, either sending or resending of a message. Also iPhone should notify the user if a message fails to send even when they have exited the app as important messages may go unsent."
