    description: "Summary:\r\nObjective-C 2.0 added class extensions, which are a great way to add required, but private, method declarations. With the modern runtime, I think it would be only natural to add required instance variables as a feature of class extensions. For example, a class Foo could have a private class extension which adds some instance variables:\r\n\r\n// Foo.h\r\n@interface Foo : NSObject {\r\n\t// ivars go here\r\n}\r\n@end\r\n\r\n// Foo.m\r\n@interface Foo () {\r\n\t// hidden ivars go here\r\n}\r\n@end\r\n\r\n@implementation Foo\r\n// implementation goes here\r\n@end\r\n\r\nIn addition to the organizational benefit of being able to define instance variables in the class extension that describes their use, it also provides you with control over the visibility of ivars. For example, if you would declare an ivar as @private, you can do one better and not even advertise its presence at all.\r\n\r\nWhen using Objective-C++ in small sections of your code, this can also make it easier to avoid having to compile more and more of your source files as C++; you could declare the C++ instance variables in a class extension either in your implementation file or in a private header (included by Objective-C++-compiled subclasses, perhaps).\r\n\r\nThis further encourages encapsulation and adds to the already significant value that class extensions and the modern runtimeâ€™s ivar synthesis allow by adding a new tool to the box.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
