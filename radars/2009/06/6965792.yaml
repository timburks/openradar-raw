    description: "Summary:\r\nUITableView calls is delegate method -tableView:viewForHeaderInSection: every time it scrolls (on every single change of contentOffset). This results in a sizable performance hit, especially in the case where the developer is not aware of this fact (as I'm guessing is the predominant case) and does not cache the UIView being returned for use as the header and instead allocates and sets up a new UIView on every message.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement -tableView:viewForHeaderInSection: for a UITableViewController subclass.\r\n2. Create and set up a UIView to be used for the header.\r\n3. NSLog each call to -tableView:viewForHeaderInSection:, and return the created header view.\r\n4. Run and Debug, pull up the debugging console, and drag on the table view to scroll.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new message is logged only when a new section scrolls into the visible area. In other words, the table view's delegate is only asked for a section header view as needed, and no more.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWatch as the debugging console fills (and probably lags behind) with a tide of logging messages, since the -tableView:viewForHeaderInSection: method is called on every minute change to contentOffset."
