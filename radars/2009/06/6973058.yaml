    description: "When installing the 3.0 GMC on an iPhone 2G (for testing) using a 3G SIM card, verification through iTunes brings up an AT&T \"you don't have a data plan\" dialog.  Prior to the 3.0 GMC, I was able to put firmware on the 2G iPhone and activate with the 3G card.  In order to activate the 2G phone, I had to sign up with AT&T to use the $20 \"bolt on\" data plan, activate the phone, and then call them to fix the account, which they can't do as the 3G S is on the way and I have a \"pending upgrade.\"  The representative at AT&T indicates to me that I can no longer use my 3G card in my 2G phone as the system is now checking which device I'm running on and will disallow connection or possibly place data roaming charges on the bill, neither of which is acceptable to me.  She also suggested to me that I put the SIM card in the 2G phone as that is the data plan that my account currently shows so as to avoid 3G data roaming charges.\r\n\r\nI should, as an iPhone developer and as an AT&T 3G customer, be able to put the SIM card in my 2G phone, activate the phone, and use the 2G phone without charge or other artificial limit as the data plan for the 3G includes all of the same services (edge) as are present on the 2G.  \r\n\r\nMy intuition is that the change back to using iTunes to activate iPhones and / or some device verification additions to the AT&T system are causing this problem.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix: work with AT&T to allow an early model of iPhone to be activated through iTunes with a later model's SIM card without plan modification and ensure that developers with multiple models of iPhone can use the SIM from a higher-priced data plan (that of the 3G and 3G S) in the older model phone."
