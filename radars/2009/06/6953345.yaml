    description: "I move iPhoto between monitors fairly frequently, and each time I adjust the grid photo size to be as large as I can get it while fitting n photos wide (I normally use 6). This is awkward to get just right.\r\n\r\niPhoto should make it easier to show photos as large as possible while still fitting a desired number per row. Easiest would probably be to let users hold down the Option key and step between maximum size while fitting n photos per row -- jumping from 5 to 6 to 7 and skipping the slightly smaller sizes that 'waste' space without allowing more photos to be seen. This would correspond to the way the Option key constrains the Dock to 'optimal' sizes (clean multiples)."
