    description: "Summary: \r\nWould like to restrict access to iTunes / iLife applications so that information is readonly.  So for example, songs can be played, play count will increment, but song titles cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nThis would allow children to have access to a shared iTunes / iPhoto library without any risk of causing accidental damage."
