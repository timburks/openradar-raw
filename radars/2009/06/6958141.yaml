    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an SDK the user doesn't have is selected in the “Base SDK” pop-up menu on the Info window for the project object, the pop-up button appears disabled, even though it is actually enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive an Xcode project whose Base SDK is one you don't have; for example, the iPhone SDK, or an old version.\r\n2. Get Info on the project object.\r\n3. Observe the enabled/disabled state of the pop-up button.\r\n4. Change the base SDK.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pop-up button appears enabled, and is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe pop-up button appears disabled, but is enabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm not aware of one.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is that Xcode uses the disabled text color for the title of the pop-up button when a missing SDK is selected in it. The red color that Xcode uses for missing file references would make much more sense here. (In the pop-up menu, the disabled text color is correct, since the missing SDK is a disabled menu item.)\r\n\r\n[Attached screenshot: http://boredzo.org/screenshots/Xcode-ThisPopUpIsNotDisabled.png ]"
