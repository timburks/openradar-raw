    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSetting the property currentTime on a playing AVAudioPlayer instance, should seek to the given time. Instead, playback is stopped and\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download, compile and run the following xcode project:\r\n\r\n  http://www.xinsight.ca/AVAudioPlayerTest.zip\r\n\r\n2. The xcode project instantiates an AVAudioPlayer and starts playing a 20-second caf file.\r\n\r\n3. Click on the \"FWD\" button while the audio file is playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAVAudioPlayer instance should seek to the correct time and continue playing. (This is what happens in the 2.2.1 Simulator)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. AVAudioPlayer instance stops playing\r\n2. The AVAudioPlayerDelegate method audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successful when it has not in fact finished playing.\r\n\r\nThe following messages are output by NSLog:\r\n\r\nNOT OK. Why is audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying called if currentTime is less than duration?\r\naudioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:successfully: 1 currentTime:5.05 duration:20.00\r\nNOT OK. after setting currentTime play status changed: wasPlaying:1 isPlaying:0\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\n1. Checking currentTime in audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying and ignoring if it is less than the duration.\r\n2. Calling play after setting currentTime\r\n\r\nRegression/Isolation:\r\n\r\nSample xcode project works as expected in 2.2.1 Simulator. Fails in 3.0 Simulator."
