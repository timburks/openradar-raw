    description: "Summary:\r\nLets assume two UIViewControllers hierarchically managed by a UINavigatioController and both were pushed into the stack. Now, if the device orientation changes to landscape and the top view controller is popped, on viewWillDisappear: accessing the sefl.navigationController property will return a nil value.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case when accessing self.navigationController if the orientation is portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Using the NavBar sample code attached to this report, run the app in device or simulator;\r\n1. Select View 1;\r\n2. Rotate device or the simulator to landscape;\r\n3. Hit the NavBar back button to pop the view controller.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Xcode's Console window, the last log entry, should display something like -[PageOneViewController viewWillDisappear:] - <UINavigationController: 0xd19230> indicating that the self.navigationController property isn't returning nil.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn Xcode's Console window, the last log entry displays \"[PageOneViewController viewWillDisappear:] - (null)\" indicating that the self.navigationController property is returning nil.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is not the case when device orientation is portrait, so I'd expect the same to happen in landscape. \r\n\r\nAlso, if I did not misunderstood the documentation, it backs up this behaviour by saying that the property returns the navigation controller as long as the view controller is in the stack. I guess one can assume the view controller is still in the stack at the time of viewWillDisappear:, as opposed to viewDidDisappear:.\r\n\r\n'NavBar.zip' was successfully uploaded"
