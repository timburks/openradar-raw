    description: "Summary: \r\nFile uploader at public.me.com/username is missing features, in particular multiple file upload, found at www.me.com/idisk\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain a MobileMe account, <username>.\r\n\r\n2.  On a Mac logged in to the MobileMe account, set the MobileMe iDisk to allow Read and Write access to Your iDisk Public Folder in the iDisk tab of the MobileMe pane of System Preferences.\r\n\r\n3.  On a Mac, using an unauthenticated browser, go to http://public.me.com/<username>\r\n\r\n4.  Click the upload button in the top right of the page.\r\n\r\n5.  Click the browse button for \"file to upload\" in the resultant dialogue window.\r\n\r\n6.  In the resultant file chooser system dialogue window, click on a sample file (say, <file1>) to upload.\r\n\r\n7.  Holding the apple button, click a distinct second sample upload file (<file2>).\r\n\r\n8.  Hit return to select, and hit the \"upload\" button to initiate upload.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1.  Both <file1> and <file2> queue for upload and are eventually uploaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1.  Only the last file selected, <file2>, is uploaded.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a new MobileMe file uploader in use at http://www.me.com/idisk for logged in users.  But unauthenticated users uploading to username's Public folder are redirected to the oldschool .Mac site from http://public.me.com/username to http://idisk.mac.com/<username>-Public?view=web, which does not allow multiple file upload.  Unauthenticated users using the Public folder should be taken instead to a modern MobileMe site on the me.com domain which supports multiple file upload.\r\n\r\nYour tracking number for this issue is Bug ID# 7014058."
