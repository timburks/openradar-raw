    description: "22-Aug-2007 11:01 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nIn Interface Builder you can currently create Connections (Outlets & Actions) graphically by Ctrl-dragging from one item to another or using the Connections HUD.  Would like to be able to do the same for Bindings\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nWhen creating bindings most of the time no settings are changed.  Only the Bind to object and the Model Key Path are set.  This is equivalent to the Target & Outlet/Action for a connection.  The default Controller Key and settings are normally sufficient for most Bindings.\r\n\r\nTherefore it should be possible to create bindings graphically in the same was as you can for Connections."
