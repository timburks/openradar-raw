    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari receives any content (including a single character) after a 304 Not Modified header, it will completely stop rendering the page on which it's working and instead deliver blank content with no source.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect to a web server, have it send a 304 header with any content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDespite the fact that web servers should, in theory, not return anything after a 304, many do so erroneously and other browsers simply ignore the content and display the page as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompletely blank page in Safari with empty source\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens in both Safari 4.0, 4.0.1, and all Safari 4 betas.  It happened less frequently with Safari 3, but was definitely an issue."
