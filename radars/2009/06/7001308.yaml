    description: "23-Jun-2009 10:09 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nI inserted a 2gb SD Ultra II Plus card into my MBP, and started importing photos. Nothing happened -- no progress. I closed the lid, opened it, and saw iPhoto still showed it was importing, but no progress.\r\n\r\nI tried to quit, but iPhoto ignored me. I grabbed a sample, and Force Quit, and got a message that I had improperly removed a device. This happend sometimes with this card -- it's not a very solid connection.\r\n\r\nApparently iPhoto didn't actually quit. It and the Finder still showed the card. I clicked Import All... I got a message that the import was already in progress. This time, Force Quit worked. I relaunched, but iPhoto never showed its window, so I Force Quit again. I'll attach the crash report."
