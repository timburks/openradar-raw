    description: "Summary:\r\nDirect dependencies between targets in different projects on differing SDKs can use the wrong SDK for the depended-upon target.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new Xcode project, using an iPhone application project template.\r\n2. Make a second new Xcode project, using the Mac Cocoa framework target template.\r\n3. Drag the Mac framework project into the iPhone application project as a project reference.\r\n4. Create a direct dependency from the iPhone application target to the Mac Cocoa framework target (such that the Mac Cocoa framework target will be built before the iPhone application target is).\r\n5. Build the iPhone application target.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Mac Cocoa framework target should be built against its base SDK (macosx10.5), and then the iPhone application target should be built against the active SDK (one of the iPhone SDKs, perhaps the OS 3.0 device one).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the Mac Cocoa framework target is built against the active SDK, which fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n\ttarget specifies product type 'com.apple.product-type.framework', but there's no such product type for the 'iphonesimulator' platform\r\n\r\nNote that we are _not_ trying to link the iPhone application against the framework, which of course would be expected to not work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is in response to the reply to rdar://6849924, which stated that I should accomplish dependencies from iPhone targets onto Mac frameworks via inter-project dependencies. Unfortunately, that fails in the identical manner, as this radar and the attached projects demonstrate. Please see the aforementioned radar for more details onto this.\r\n\r\nAggregate targets fail identically."
