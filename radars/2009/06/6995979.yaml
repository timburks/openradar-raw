    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the UIMenuController is showing, it hides if you tap anywhere on the screen. BUT, if you tap the status bar, it does not, even if the tap is registered as a button tap (navigation bar button). This means that if the menu controller is showing and you tap the status bar right above the back button, you nav will switch screens and still have the menu controller showing. It also means if you tap the status bar when the menu controller is showing, what you are editing might slide off the screen when the scrollview slides to top.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages App.\r\n2. Go to a conversation that is pretty long.\r\n3. Double tap the bottom message so the copy view pops up.\r\n4. Tap the status bar so the scrollView scrolls to top.\r\n5. (Optional) Instead of tapping the middle of the status bar tap right above the edit button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMenu Controller View should hide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMenu Controller stays visible, even thought the bubble you are copying isn't even on the screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso try opening the copy view on the text field and click above edit."
