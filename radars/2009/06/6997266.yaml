    description: "When adding localizations, iTunes Connect does not allow me to save the new localization if an error like \"app name already taken\" was presented before. After correcting the app name problem and clicking \"Save\", iTunes Connect displays the error message: 'No changes have been made. Please make your changes or click \"Cancel\"'. All subsequent tries to add the localization (also after clicking cancel and adding the localization again)  fail with the same error.\r\n\r\nIn this case the only resort is logging out and back in.\r\n\r\niTunes Connect should have a better error recovery and not force me to log in again after having made a mistake."
