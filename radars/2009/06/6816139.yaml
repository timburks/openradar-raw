    description: "22-Apr-2009 05:20 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nSummary: \r\nProgrammatic zooming-out MapKit with a factor of 1.1 leads to a zoom-out with a factor of 2.\r\nProgrammatic zooming-in MapKit with a factor of 0.9 either leads to a no-change or to a zoom-out with a factor of 2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease check the attached project. The zoom-out button is zooming out with a factor of 1.1. The zoom-in button is zooming in with a factor of 0.9.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nZooming out should slightly zoom out by 10%. Zooming-in should slightly zoom in by 10%.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe zoom-out always zooms out by a factor of 2 instead of 1.1.\r\nThe zoom-in does not change the zoom level at all if the current zoom level was at a \"standard\" zoom level. If the user pinches the mapView to zoom-in slightly, a subsequent invocation of zoomIn leads to a small zoom-out, returning to the previous \"standard\" zoom level.\r\nIf the user pinches the mapView to zoom-out slightly, a subsequent invocation of zoomIn leads to a large zoom-out with a factor of nearly 2.0, returning to the previous \"standard\" zoom level * 2.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBug occurs equally under under Simulator and device  (3.0b3 7a280f).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks like MKMapView setRegion:animated always rounds up to the next \"standard\" zoom level. This behavior makes all apps impossible that need to zoom to a specifically calculated zoom level, e.g. for displaying a specific set of POIs with the optimal bounding rect.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,\r\n\r\nsetRegion:MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(...) animated:\r\n\r\ndoes not work as advertised because it changes the map span only in powers of 2.\r\n\r\nPlease see also rdar://problem/6757252 for similar problems when moving the center.\r\n\r\n22-Apr-2009 06:07 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\n'MapTest r6816139.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Apr-2009 12:55 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nOur tests with 3.0b4 are showing that this problem is still existing and the behavior didn't change at all.\r\n\r\n10-May-2009 11:36 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nOur tests with 3.0b5 are showing that this problem is still existing and the behavior didn't change at all."
