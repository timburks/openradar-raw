    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPresently, there is no way for a developer to be able to tell if the current version of the app is a legitimate version purchased on the iTunes AppStore or not. More and more, there are sites out there that offer cracked versions of for-pay iPhone apps. This harms both commercial app-developers and Apple. I propose that Apple provide a simple API to help developers detect whether an end-user has actually purchased the current application.\r\n\r\nThis would take a very simple form, perhaps as an added function call on the new Store API. Since the current app id and version are already in the bundle, the API call doesn't need any additional parameters. Just a YES/NO response whether the app was bought from the iTunes app store or not.\r\n\r\nIf the answer is NO, the app is then free to do whatever they want to do -- from putting up a warning, to downshifting to a lower-function form, to outright stopping from working. The app should be able to call this function at random times from inside the app -- in case crackers patch the app to take out startup code.\r\n\r\nTo enhance security, the iTunes account info should never exposed to individual apps. If there is a need to prompt the user for credentials, the API could do this without letting the app ever see the username/password.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such an API would be that developers can choose to use it or not. And if the call fails (meaning there's no record of purchase on the iTunes store) they can choose whatever policy to implement."
