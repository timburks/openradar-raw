    description: "Summary:\r\nThe keyboards in the Settings app are sorted by the ISO 639 code for their language, not by their displayed name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFrom the Home screen:\r\n1. Tap Settings.\r\n2. Tap General.\r\n3. Tap International.\r\n4. Tap Keyboards.\r\n\r\nAlternatively:\r\n3. Tap Keyboard.\r\n4. Tap International Keyboards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Settings app presents a list of keyboards, sorted by name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Settings app presents a list of keyboards, sorted by the ISO 639 code for the language each is most useful for.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think it was like this in 2.2.1 as well, but I'm not sure. So, no.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExamples of how this fails:\r\n- Croatian is under H (hr).\r\n- Dutch and Flemish are under N (nl).\r\n- German, Greek, and Spanish all come before Estonian (de, el, es, and et, respectively).\r\n- The two Chinese keyboards are last (zh)."
