    description: "10.5 Mail.app had the feature to drag a recipient from a message view into the search field in order to search for all mails to or from this address. It is very convenient to find all mails from or to the address of the currently viewed message.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been omitted in 10.6. Please bring it back!\r\n\r\nAlternatively, an additional entry in the context menu \"Search all messages from/to this address\" would be great. too. \"From\" or \"To\" in the context menu would be adopted to the message, so for the From-address, the context menu entry would be \"Search all messages from this address\". The same logic should be applied for dragging an address into the search field: The scope should be set to either \"From\" or \"To\"."
