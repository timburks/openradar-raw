    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a low bandwidth connection, MPMoviePlayerController will start showing Loading... messages. If two messages come close together, the UI will stay on screen and will not fade away.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look for a HTTP-LS source and open it in Safari (I have only tested with HTTP-LS, I do not know if it happens also in pre-recorded sources).\r\n2. Reduce the bandwidth of the connection between the device and the source.\r\n3. If two Loading... messages are produced very close (less that 5-10 seconds), the UI will not fade away, even if you restore the full bandwidth to the connection.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe UI should fade away if there was no Loading... message for a determinate number of seconds (like it happens when only one Loading... message is displayed).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behavior I describe was found in an application that was using MPMoviePlayerController, but I have used Safari to prove that is not an application specific issue, but an OS issue.\r\n\r\nI have setup an Apache web server in my Mac OS X 10.6.2, and my segmenter to output its results in a directory served by Apache.\r\n\r\nI have pointed the device to this web server address and started streaming. Both the device is connected to our company WiFi network, and the computer is connected through LAN to the same network the WiFi router is connected to. Without problems the bandwidth between the device and the computer is high enough for transmitting more than 864kbps.\r\n\r\nWhile playing, I reduce the bandwidth for the Apache port using ipfw command line tool, to about 400kbps. After a couple of seconds the UI shows the Loading... message.\r\n\r\nIf I immediately turn the bandwidth up again (unlimited) the Loading... message disappear and the UI fades away after some seconds (5-10 seconds).\r\n\r\nIf I keep the bandwidth cap for a while, and I get a second Loading... message (before the UI has faded away, but when the Loading... message has disappeared) and immediately remove the bandwidth cap, the UI will not fade away (I have been several minutes waiting). Apache is sending the files as fast as the network allows (more or less 1500kbps)."
