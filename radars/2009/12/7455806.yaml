    description: "I received \"Concierge Mac.ics\" from Apple. I clicked \"Add this to your calendar\" in Mail.app, and iCal began to add the event.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the pop-up menu for which calendar to add to did *not* list any of my existing calendars. I *had* to choose \"New Calendar\" (screenshot).\r\n\r\nThen I was able to Control-click the event, move it to my \"Chris\" calendar, and delete the bogus \"Technical Support\" calendar iCal just created.\r\n\r\nI quit iCal, opened the file again, and iCal's pop-up showed my calendars properly this time.\r\n\r\nNote: I use BusySync and also have a CalDAV calendar set up.\r\n\r\nSee also http://db.tidbits.com/article/10817 which sounds relevant."
