    description: "Summary: \r\nUITextView or its superclass UIScrollView should provide a feature to disable / enable scrolling in a particular direction. It's possible to do this using Interface Builder, but it doesn't work the same way when it's done programmatically.\r\nThe directional lock is not working properly when the UIScrollView is created programmatically. It doesn't show the proper \"locking\" behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create UITextView / UIScrollView programmatically.\r\n2. Set its content.\r\n3. Set directional lock to enabled.\r\n4. Hide horizontal scroll indicator (this has no relation, since it's only an indicator).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UITextView should behave exactly just like when it's created using Interface Builder. It should be able to lock horizontal scrolling, if the content size width is not over its bounds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UITextView horizontal scrolling is still enabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem doesn't occur when the view is created by using Interface Builder. But, it should behave the same way when it's done programmatically. Because, there are other reasons to choose programmatic way in creating it."
