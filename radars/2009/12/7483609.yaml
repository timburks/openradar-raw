    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you assign music to a custom slideshow in iPhoto, and the path to the music file contains an ampersand, then attempting to sync photos from iPhoto with an iPod/iPhone/Apple TV using iTunes will result in an error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a custom slideshow in iPhoto by selecting \"New Album\" from the File menu and choosing \"Slideshow\" as the kind of album to create.\r\n2. Select the newly created slideshow and click the \"Music\" button in the bottom center of the window\r\n3. In the list of songs from iTunes that is displayed, select a song where either the name, artist, or album of the song contains an ampersand character and click \"Apply\". (with the standard iTunes media folder organization, this should result in an ampersand being in the path to the music file).\r\n4. Quit iPhoto\r\n5. Open iTunes, and connect an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV\r\n6. Select the device and in the Photos section, choose to sync the entire iPhoto library to the device\r\n7. Click the \"Sync\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should sync the content of the iPhoto library to the device successfully\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, an error message reading \"iTunes cannot sync photos to (whatever device you’re using) because of a problem on your computer. An unknown error occurred (-50)”\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe root cause of the problem is that when iPhoto writes out the AlbumData.xml file for the library, the ampersand character is not escaped correctly, resulting in a parser error when trying to read the XML file. This affects any program that reads the AlbumData.xml, including iTunes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is the same issue as reported in bug 7469235"
