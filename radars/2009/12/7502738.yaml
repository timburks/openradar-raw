    description: "An Apple engineer on a mailing list I frequent suggested that I submit my fixes to Apple's Reachability Sample to Apple via Bug Reporter. \r\n\r\nHence, here is my announcement post:\r\n\r\nGentlefolk,\r\n\r\n\tApple requires all network enabled iPhone apps to include a test for network transitions. They even provide a sample project, Reachability, to help developers implement this feature. In my opinion, unfortunately, it isn't particularly well done. Due to the issues I detail on my blog, I would not ship it in my app.\r\n\r\n\tEven though Apple's license allows me to keep my fixes to myself, I did not think I should. The code was a free to me. I'm making my extensions free to everyone too. (To gain liability protection, I cover my extensions with the new BSD license.)\r\n\r\n\tHere's the URL to my announcement post: <http://blog.ddg.com/?p=24>.\r\n\r\nAnon,\r\nAndrew\r\n____________________________________\r\nAndrew W.

If Apple wants to pick up these fixes, then I will be flexible about these terms. (IOW, I'm making this code public to help as many developers as possible. I don't want a license agreement to stand between Apple and I working together to achieve this goal.)"
