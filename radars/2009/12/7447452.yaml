    description: "I have 3 movies, created by iMovie:\r\n\r\njulia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower-large.m4v (960*540)\r\njulia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower-medium.m4v (640*360)\r\njulia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower-iphone.m4v (480*272)\r\njulia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower.mov (created with MakeRefMovie 2.0, resaved with v2.0.1)\r\n\r\nWhen I double-click on the .mov reference movie, Launch Services opens it with QuickTime Player Launcher (per the Finder's Info window). That, in turn, opens julia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower-medium.m4v in QuickTime Player 7 v7.6.3 (630) [QuickTimeâ„¢ Version 7.6.3 (1591.3)]. It should, however, be opening -large instead.\r\n\r\nIf I use Open With: QuickTime Player in the Info window, QuickTime Player (X) 10.0 (90.3.1) opens julia-2009-12-05-chaos-tower-large.m4v, which is the correct movie.\r\n\r\nI have a 1.5mbps DSL connection, and gigabit to the SMB server hosting the video, but I cannot find where to control or verify the connection speed QuickTime believes I have. It *shouldn't be <768kbps, but I want to confirm."
