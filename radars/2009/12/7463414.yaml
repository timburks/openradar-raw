    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language document is not very clear about exactly what, syntactically, super is, and the two places where it does address the matter contradic teach other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Read the Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language.\r\n2. Search for super.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind a clear explanation of super's exact syntactic role.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind two contradictory indications of super's nature.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn page 136 of the PDF, in the Index, super is listed under “super variable”.\r\n\r\nOn page 46, the section titled “Redefining self” begins:\r\n\r\n> super is simply a flag to the compiler telling it where to begin searching for the method to perform; it’s used only as the receiver of a message. But self is a variable name that can be used in any number of ways, even assigned a new value.\r\n\r\nReal-world usage doesn't help clarify the matter. GCC 4.2.1 agrees with the Index, treating super as a variable. (Inexplicably, though, the variable's type is void *, as determined by using self and super as the results of a ternary expression and reading the resulting type-mismatch warning.) clang 1.0.1 agrees with “Redefining self”, raising an error upon any attempt to use super either outside of a message expression or as a term in a ternary expression, although the error does say “cannot compile this scalar expression yet”, implying that it may support this in the future.\r\n\r\nThe more I read of the language doc, the more I think the Index entry is the part that's wrong: super is a keyword, not a variable. clang has it right as of 1.0.1, but should drop the word “yet”."
