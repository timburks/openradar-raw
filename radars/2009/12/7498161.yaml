    description: While the MPMoviePlayerController is playing a movie file which includes an audio track, the audio from the movie is not silenced when the ring/silent switch on the iPhone is in the silent position.  The position of this switch has no effect on the MPMoviePlayerController playing of audio, which can only serve to annoy users of the phone who expect all audio to be silenced when the switch is in the silent position.
