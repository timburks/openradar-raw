    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be helpful for Xcode to provide a way to strip away ALL derived files from a project.  I occasionally want to get rid of all cache-like files that could be regenerated without loss of data.  For example, to email source code or archive it on small external media.  I understand I can manually remove the Build folder, etc.  The issues is that Xcode created all these files, knows where they are, and knows better than I which ones are easily recreated later.  One potential solution is to add extra check boxes on the Clean All Targets pop-up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(1) click [Clean All Targets], ideally indicating that you want all derived files cleaned\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Build folder would be deleted, the whole project would be only marginally larger than the sum of all source file sizes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe best you can do now is [Clean All Targets].  In my current app that reduces my Build folder from 16.7 MB to 8.4 MB.  When size matters, I'd like an easy way to shrink my project from 8.5 to 0.1 MB.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBelatedly filing this issue here, originally discussed on Xcode-users: http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2008/Dec/msg00029.html"
