    description: "Summary: \r\nUsers whose web content is managed by Parental Controls call back to apple.com when requesting an addition to usage allowance. Not only is this odd behavior, considering the fact that Parental Controls utilises a specialised apache config to be setup as a proxy, it poses potential security/privacy issues. It should not be calling external locations to allow content addition.\r\n\r\nChecking the strings on /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FamilyControls.framework/Resources/ParentalControls.app/Contents/MacOS/ParentalControls shows that this URL is hardcoded in the binary. So I can only assume that the binary checks for this URL and when it finds it, then prompts the user with username and password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a user to be managed by Parental Controls, and enable Web Filtering for specified websites.\r\n2. Login as the managed user.\r\n3. Open any web browser and try to browse to an unspecified website.\r\n4. Click \"Add Website\" and notice the URL that is placed in the address bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that, if this were to utilise a website to provide webfilter additions, that it'd use one defined in the DocumentRoot in the httpd.conf that parentalcontrols utilises (/Library/Application Support/Apple/ParentalControls/ContentFiltering/) or at least something locally on the machine.\r\n\r\nOr just to change the hardcoded value to utilise a fictiuous localhost:8080 url.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalls back to apple.com and sends/receive real data from apple.com\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a tarball of a few screenshots, a capture of the tcp stream and the output of the strings of ParentalControls binary.\r\n\r\n31-Oct-2007 09:12 AM Jesse Pearson:\r\n'contentfilter.tgz' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2008 09:11 PM Jesse Pearson:\r\nLooks to have been fixed in the Combo Update/Security Update 2008-001.\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2008 07:44 PM Apple:\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in the Mac OS X 10.5.2 Combo Update available at http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosx_updates/macosx1052comboupdate.html.  Please verify with this latest release and update this report with your results.\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.5.2 Combo Update\r\nPost Date:  February 11, 2008\r\n<http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/macosx_updates/macosx1052comboupdate.html>"
