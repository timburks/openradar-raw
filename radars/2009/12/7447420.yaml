    description: "1. On a MacBook Pro, connect a 1920*1200 DVI monitor.\r\n2. Put the menu bar on the internal monitor.\r\n3. Move iMovie to the external monitor; zoom it to full size.\r\n4. Window:Viewer on Secondary Display.\r\n5. Viewer disappears entirely.\r\n\r\nApparently the viewer is full-screen on the secondary display, completely concealed behind the full-screen window.\r\n\r\nIt should be Viewer on *Other* Display, and with the main window on the secondary display, the Viewer should jump to the *primary* display.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Keep the main iMovie window on the primary display."
