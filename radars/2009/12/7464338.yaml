    description: "Summary:\r\nThe open source projects' sources published on the Apple Open Source [1] website are updated only by product releases. That is, if another type of update, such as a security update, pushes down a new binary release of a project without changing the main product version number, the sources are not published.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs an example, this is the case of the apache_mod_php project that's part of the Mac OS X product. At the time of this writing, according to the Apple Open Source website [2] the apache_mod_php release used by Mac OS X 10.5.8 is apache_mod_php-44.2. Actually, this is not true because Security Update 2009-006 [3] updated the apache_mod_php version used by Mac OS X 10.5.8 to apache_mod_php-44.4. This is easily proven by the output of the phpinfo() function on an up to date Mac OS X 10.5.8 box. Moreover, I cannot even find the apache_mod_php-44.4 release in the project main directory [4].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The apache_mod_php-44.4 release should be available in the project main directory [4] on the Apple Open Source website.\r\n2. The Releases section of the Apple Open Source website should show another entry for the 10.5 Mac OS X product line reflecting the projects' releases used in Mac OS X 10.5.8 after the security update, such as the apache_mod_php-44.4 one. For example, it may be named \"Mac OS X 10.5.8 + Security Update 2009-006\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sources of the apache_mod_php-44.4 release are not published anywhere.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease take the apache_mod_php-44.4 case only as an example. This bug is about the general issue of currently used open source projects' sources not always published on the Apple Open Source website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] <http://www.opensource.apple.com/>\r\n[2] <http://www.opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-1058/>\r\n[3] <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3937>\r\n[4] <http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/apache_mod_php/>\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Dec-2009 09:02 PM DARIN MARSHALL :\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting this issue.
