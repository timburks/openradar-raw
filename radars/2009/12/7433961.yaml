    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening DMG file often causing computer to become unresponsive for 30+ seconds\r\n\r\nEnv:\r\nSoftware:\r\n Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.2 Build 10C2234\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\n  Model Name:\tiMac\r\n  Model Identifier:\tiMac11,1\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i5\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.66 GHz\r\n  Number Of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number Of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t8 MB\r\n  Memory:\t4 GB\r\n  Processor Interconnect Speed:\t4.8 GT/s\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tIM111.0034.B00\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.54f33\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. From the Downloads Stack, to install new software, I click on a a file with the .dmg file extension that I have not previously opened.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComputer continues to be responsive as it opens the DMG.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe the mouse cursor changes to a spinning beachball, and the system is non-response for an extended period of times. For many DMG files it's in excess of 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt does not happen for all DMG, but for many of them.\r\n\r\nMost often the sequence of events starts with me downloading the DMG in Safari. Safari is set to automatically open safe files, so the sequence continues automatically.\r\n\r\nOnce the DMG has opened, most often I don't experience the extreme degradation in performance when I try to reproduce with the same DMG, but sometimes it does.\r\n\r\nHaving encountered the issue, does not prevent me from encountering it when opening additional DMGs.\r\n\r\n01-Dec-2009 12:16 PM Lloyd Budd:\r\nI should note that this is a brand new computer, so it has very little software currently installed or running on it.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an issue described numerous times.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.mactalk.com.au/11/18306-imac-freezes-when-unpacking-dmg-file.html\r\n\"iMac Freezes when unpacking dmg file - MacTalk Forums\r\n15th September 2006, 04:06 AM\r\nxfodder  \r\n \r\nas the title says, sometimes when i unpack a dmg file my entire computer locks up ... it only happens on some dmg files (especially ones from omni group eg. omniplan beta)\r\n\r\nwhen i say entire computer i mean ENTIRE computer ... everything will freeze except the mouse cursor and music will stop if playing ... it freezes for about 5 - 8 seconds then it unfreezes and all is well ... \r\n\r\nanyone know of any reasons why it would be freezing ... and is there a quick fix (hopefully without the need to re-install mac os)\""
