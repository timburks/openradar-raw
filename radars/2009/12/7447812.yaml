    description: "*** Summary: The size of the preview image for QTCapture can be set by calling -[QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput setPixelBufferAttributes:] with the appropriate argument (e.g. 640 x 480).\r\n\r\n(as documented here: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2008/qa1582.html)\r\n\r\n\"Note: While not currently documented, the QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput class also supports the setPixelBufferAttributes: method.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, if any compression format (with the exception of QTCompressionOptionsSD240SizeH264Video ) is set on the output, when movie recording starts, the video preview resolution switches back to the original resolution (e.g. 1280 x 1024).\r\n\r\nAfter recording has completed, calling -[QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput setPixelBufferAttributes:] no longer has any effect.\r\n\r\n*** Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Call -[QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput setPixelBufferAttributes:]\r\n\r\n2) Start movie recording.\r\n\r\nI've attached a modified Apple code sample (QTRecorder) which shows this behaviour.\r\n\r\n*** Expected Results:\r\n\r\nI would not expect the specifically requested preview size to change.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I would expect it to be able to be reset after movie recording completes.\r\n\r\n*** Actual Results: \r\n\r\nAs described above.\r\n\r\n*** Regression\r\n\r\nI've not tried with Snow Leopard yet.\r\n\r\n*** Notes\r\n\r\nThe attached modified version of QTRecorder demonstrates the issue. It logs the preview image description in the preview delegate method, and tries to reset the preview image size in the movie recording did stop delegate method.\r\n\r\nI've marked all changes to the original with \"Added\"\r\n\r\nLook at the console output to see the preview image size change, but not change back."
