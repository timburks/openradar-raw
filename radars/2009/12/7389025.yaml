    description: "Summary: \r\nAlthough Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" is supposed to be \"the world’s most advanced operating system\", graphics wise it is still stuck in the stone-age, supporting only OpenGL 2.1 (GLSL 1.20) which has been released in August 2006, more than 3 years ago. OpenGL 3.0 through OpenGL 3.2 and GLSL 1.30 through 1.50 remain unsupported.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Mac OS X 10.6.2, \"the world’s most advanced operating system\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Mac OS X to support OpenGL 3.x as it is supported on less advanced operating systems like Windows, Linux, Solaris and even FreeBSD. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMac OS X 10.6.2 does not support OpenGL 3.0 which has been released more than 15 months ago, and by extension also not any newer versions or their accompanying GLSL versions. Also recent OpenGL extensions remain unsupported.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not occur when installing a less advanced operating system on your mac hardware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI especially *need* GLSL 1.30, also GLSL 1.40 and the extension GL_ARB_texture_query_lod, and i need it yesterday."
