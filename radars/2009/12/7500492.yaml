    description: "29-Dec-2009 05:33 AM Sam McCall:\r\nSummary:\r\nCertain PNG images are not displayed correctly in Finder icons, Preview.app, Safari, etc. Certain regions of the image are corrupted, and the contents of these corrupted regions vary each time the file is loaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Open Safari, visit http://www.reddit.com/static/mailgray.png\r\n2: Open Firefox, visit the same address\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nEnvelope graphic displayed in both cases\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nSafari displays envelope graphic with corruption, Firefox displays graphic correctly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAccording to this discussion thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aj5xy/does_anyone_else_have_this_problem_on_safari_or/) this likely occurred between 10.5 and 10.6, or between 10.6.1 and 10.6.2. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSoftware such as Firefox and Photoshop CS4 render the images correctly, while more seemingly native applications (Finder, Preview) and those embedding WebKit (Safari, Google Chrome) have the corruption.\r\n\r\nThe PNG file in question has a bit-depth of 2 (4 colors) and an odd width (15) so that the row data is not a whole number of bytes. Adjusting the image's width to 16 in the PNG header results in no corruption.\r\n\r\nI've created a 3x3 test file which is a 2-bit grayscale image of a black and white checkerboard pattern. This also exhibits the problem, it is attached (test.png).\r\n\r\nI'm running on an iMac7,1 and experiencing the problem both on 64-bit Safari and 32-bit Google Chrome, if that makes a difference.\r\n\r\n(Attachment \"test.png\" posted at http://abstractable.net/misc/apple_broken.png)"
