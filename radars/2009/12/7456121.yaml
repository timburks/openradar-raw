    description: "We would like to see the private API\r\n\r\nUIAlert -setNumberOfRows:\r\n\r\nbe made public. It is very useful to place the buttons of a UIAlert below each other, especially when considering localizations. In most cases, non-English languages tend to have longer words so the buttons don't fit beside each other.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.futuretap.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/setNumberOfRows-2.png for illustration.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to use a UIActionSheet is not optimal because it doesn't allow specifying a title (only a message). Also in situations where the previous step already was a UIActionSheet it doesn't look nice when multiple UIActionSheets are cascaded."
