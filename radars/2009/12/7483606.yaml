    description: "17-Dec-2009 11:07 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nInterface Builder 3.2 has support for bottom bars by being able to set a window's content border.

IB usually enforces positioning by \"snapping\" controls into place, and this would be much welcomed in the bottom bar as well.  The Human Interface Guidelines  provides specific positioning requirements in:\r\n\r\n  Layout Guidelines , Positioning Text and Controls in a Bottom Bar\r\n  <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGLayout/XHIGLayout.html>"
