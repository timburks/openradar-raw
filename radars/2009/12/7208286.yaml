    description: "09-Sep-2009 11:41 AM Pepi Zawodsky:\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm using Spaces and use control-arrowkeys to switch among them. Sometimes the bezel display which shows me from which space to which space I have moved will stick on the screen. Under 10.5.x this also happed sometimes, the bezel would go away when pressing the control key for a second and upon release of the key the bezel would go away.\r\nThis does not work under 10.6 anymore, instead the bezel sticks. Another thing that sometimes, but not always accurs in this context is, that the systems totally looses any text input via the MBP internal keyboard EXCEPT for the switching spaces shortcut. ALL other keypresses are ignored. No way to use ANY keyboard shortcut, or input ANY text.\r\nThe Trackpad continues to work properly and is the only way to interact with the system to get to a clean logout. Spaces surprisingly can still be switched via the designated keyboard commands. This is the only keyboard commands that are accepted in this case.\r\n\r\nCompleteley logging out the user and logging back in again remedies the problem, which may occur again at any time. A restart is not necessary. I expect this to be a bug in the Dock, Spaces or loginwindow, maybe SystemUIserver.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI don't know under which exact circumstances this can be triggered, but it happened to me several times now.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter switching spaces the bezel display should always fade out after releasing the modifier keys. The system should definitely keep accepting all keyboard input.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpaces bezel sticks on screen, doesn't go away anymore. Sometimes fades out after several minutes, but will keep to stick again if spaces are switched again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've only seen this on my MacBook Pro 17\" Unibody (Early 2009) with the internal keyboard as I don't use any other Mac with a screen at the moment. I haven't tested how external USB Keyboards or mouses behave under said circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCompletely logging out the affected User can be used as a workaround to temporarily solve the problem until it comes again. A system restart is not necessary, but doesn't do any harm either.\r\n\r\n\r\n'MacBook Pro.spx.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Sep-2009 04:20 PM Pepi Zawodsky:\r\nProblem still present in 10.6.1 (10B504).\r\n\r\nAdditional info about the problem:\r\n\r\nSometimes logging out does not immediately resolve the problem. It takes the login screen up to 10 Minutes to react to keyboard input again. Additional problem in that case is that klicking the trackpad does not work at the login screen as well. So one cannot even klick restart, just wait for an extended period of time and hope for the best.\r\nConnecting an external USB Keyboard or mouse does not help either. The mouse will actually allow you to move the arrow on screen, but klicks will still not be accepted. This happens with an old Apple USB Mouse (white no-button model) and a current mighty mouse. Haven't checked with a bluetooth rodent, since I don't have one of these. Yet I expect them to have the same problem.\r\nPutting the system to sleep in that case works, but will not help with the keyboard problem or the no-klicks issue as well. It will still take time.\r\n\r\nSometimes even that doesn't help. One has to force a hard reboot then or, if you're lucky, you can SSH into the machine or use ARD to hopefully get some means of a clean reboot so you don' f*** up the filesystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother time I had the problem I didn't want to wait so long, and directly chose reboot from the ï£¿ menu. The system didn't even manage to completely log out that time. Instead it hung for over 30 minutes. No way to SSH into the box, even if it was correctly responding to pings and definitely should answer an SSH login attempt. coudln't try ARD under the circumstances given at that moment.\r\n\r\nOdd enough, the space switching keyboards command is still the ONLY keypresses that the system will accept in that state.\r\n\r\nI've even tried activating the keyboard viewer, and was able to klick keys. The ususally should enter characters klicked into a document. Klicking the keys worked, but no text was entered. Every key on the keyboard I pressed did actually correctly show up on the keyboard viewer, yet not a single keystroke gets handed off to the system.\r\n\r\nAll the symptoms are the same under 10.6.0 and 10.6.1. Having to (force a) reboot several times a day because I cannot use any keyboard anymore makes Snow Leopard a totally unusable system for ANY user at the moment. And the filesystems definitely don't like recurring unclean shutdowns as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Jan-2010 12:08 AM YVONNE  VILLA  :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nCan you please try uninstalling KeyRemap4MacBook and see if this issue goes away?\r\n\r\n\r\nRE: Removing KeyRemap4MacBook does not resolve the issue. Also accurs on MacBook Pro 15-inch Core2Duo.\r\nRemoving TextExpander also does not resolve the issue."
