    description: "12-Dec-2009 06:21 PM Pepi Zawodsky:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen synching PodCasts to an iPhone iTunes since 9.0.2 automatically disables the synching of that PodCast when there are no episodes downloaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSubscribe to any PodCast in iTunes. Download episodes. Set up synching with iPhone for that PodCast.\r\nWhen you have listened to all the episodes and there are currently no episodes in iTunes available iTunes disables synching of that PodCast without asking the user, or informing the user that it did. Even if the user did not want iTunes to do so.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should NEVER disable synching of PodCasts by itself without the user instructing iTunes to do so, or even without notifying the user that it did.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen there are no episodes in iTunes for a given PodCast iTunes automatically disables synching.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSince iTunes 9.0.2, tested with iPhone 3G (3.1.2)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug is especially annoying as I'd expect iTunes to automatically sync new episodes as they are released and downloaded.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have subscibed to \"Mac OS X Server QuickTips\" from Apple.\r\nI've seen all the episodes that were released to date, so I'm still subscribed to the PodCast, but I have deleted all viewed episodes from iTunes to save space. The next time i sync my iPhone iTunes disables synching of that PodCast completely. I do not want it to do so!\r\nWhen Apple releases a new episode of the Mac OS X Server QuickTips iTunes automatically downloads that episode for me. When I sync my iPhone to have that episode (and all other new episodes of other PodCasts) with me I expect that new episode to arrive on my iPhone. Instead, the episode is NOT synched over as iTunes has deliberately disabled synching for that PodCast without my consent or even telling the user that it did so.\r\n\r\nI have to go into the PodCast pane for my iPhone to explicitly turn on synching for that PodCast again, and sync again. Only to find that iTunes will disable synching again when I've listened to that Episode.\r\n\r\nWhen you're subscribed to many (10 or more) PodCasts this gets extremely annoying since one cannot rely on iTunes synching anymore which has worked perfectly before.\r\n\r\nI did let iTunes handle my PodCast synching totally automatic. I could tell it to always have the 10 least recent unlistened/unwatched episodes of all the PodCasts I'd like to carry with me during travel/commute. Worked perfeclty as it would autorotate my Episodes as I was listening to them and I could always be sure that iTunes would transfer any new episodes of a PodCast to my iPhone. Hook up the iPhone, press sync and I was good to go.\r\n\r\nNow with this bug one needs to hook up the iPhone and check each and every time I want to sync if there are all the checkmarks set to sync the PodCasts I want to have. Then sync, double check only to find out that I missed one and sync again. Only to find out I missed another one, but now I'm on the road, so I cannot correct the problem anymore.\r\n"
