    description: "08-Sep-2009 03:16 PM Pepi Zawodsky:\r\nSummary:\r\nSpaces automatically switches spaces upon application launch even if \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" is unchecked and an app is bound to a specific desktop/space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nActivate spaces, uncheck \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\". Bind any app to a specific space only, for example space 2. Swtich to space 1 and launch said application. Spaces will automatically switch to space 2 without user interaction and despite explicitly told not to do so.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpaces should stay on the active space and NOT automatically switch to another space upon application launch.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpaces does switch to the space the application launched is bound to without asking the user, stealing focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly occurs when an app is bound to a specific space and the user is not currently in that space when the application launches/is launched. This is a new bug in 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a"
