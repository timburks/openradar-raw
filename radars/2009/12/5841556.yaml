    description: "4-Apr-2008 12:28 AM Vladimir Magaziy:\r\nSummary: \r\nMail inserts separates continuous text into lines, but there is no ability to turn this feature off provided.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.\r\n2. Create a new message and input some continuous text.\r\n3. Send the message.\r\n4. Open the sent message in some mail client (MS Outlook, for instance) or a web page of mail service if any.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message in other mail clients (web forms) looks the same way it was created (see Mail.png in the attachment)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message contains separations (see Yahoo.png in the attachment).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe message looks as expected in Mail, but not in other mail clients or mail services with a Web interface.\r\n\r\nThe lines are really narrow for a cyrillic text, so my messages look like a column in a newspaper, but it was not expected (see Mail2.png and Yahoo2.png in the attachment). All URIs are broken up into parts, which makes them useless -- all the time I have to explain my friends and fellows they should combine them from the parts, some of them are not successful and I am just annoyed about that.\r\n\r\nI do need a mechanism in Mail  which allows me turn this automatic separations of lines off once and forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n04-Apr-2008 11:37 PM Vladimir Magaziy:\r\nThe messages which were shown in the screenshots from the original bug report are attached as Message1.eml and Message2.eml (they were saved from the Sent mailbox).\r\n\r\nI also sent another message to my mailbox with a continuous cyrillic text, please see attachment:\r\nNewMessage_AppleMail_Inbox.eml -- Raw source of received message (from Inbox)\r\nNewMessage_AppleMail_Inbox.png -- Its screenshot in Apple Mail (looks as expected)\r\nNewMessage_FromAppleMail_SentBox.eml -- Raw source of sent message (from SendBox)\r\nNewMessage_AppleMail_SentBox.png -- Its screenshot in Apple Mail (the expected look)\r\nNewMessage_FromMSOutlook.png  -- Raw message source saved from MS Outlook\r\nNewMessage_FromMSOutlook.msg -- Message in MS Outlook format (not sure it's useful, but anyway...)\r\nNewMessage_FromWindowsMail.eml -- Raw message source saved from Windows Mail\r\nNewMessage_FromWindowsMail.png -- Its screenshot in Windows Mail. LOOKS SEPARATED INTO LINES REGARDLESS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NewMessage_AppleMail_Inbox.eml AND NewMessage_FromWindowsMail.eml IS THE LAST END OF LINE!!! Here is what diff says:\r\n\r\n$ diff -c NewMessage_AppleMail_Inbox.eml NewMessage_FromWindowsMail.eml\r\n*** NewMessage_AppleMail_Inbox.eml\t2008-04-05 00:17:21.000000000 +0300\r\n--- NewMessage_FromWindowsMail.eml\t2008-04-04 21:12:30.000000000 +0300\r\n***************\r\n*** 69,72 ****\r\n  0LTQtdC70LjRgtC10LvQtdC5INCt0YLQviAgDQrRgdC+0L7QsdGJ0LXQvdC40LUg0LHQtdC3INGA\r\n  0LDQt9C00LXQu9C40YLQtdC70LXQuSDQrdGC0L4gIA0K0YHQvtC+0LHRidC10L3QuNC1INCx0LXQ\r\n  tyDRgNCw0LfQtNC10LvQuNGC0LXQu9C10Lkg0K3RgtC+ICANCtGB0L7QvtCx0YnQtdC90LjQtSDQ\r\n! sdC10Lcg0YDQsNC30LTQtdC70LjRgtC10LvQtdC5DQoNCkJlc3QgcmVnYXJkcy4uLi4=\r\n--- 69,72 ----\r\n  0LTQtdC70LjRgtC10LvQtdC5INCt0YLQviAgDQrRgdC+0L7QsdGJ0LXQvdC40LUg0LHQtdC3INGA\r\n  0LDQt9C00LXQu9C40YLQtdC70LXQuSDQrdGC0L4gIA0K0YHQvtC+0LHRidC10L3QuNC1INCx0LXQ\r\n  tyDRgNCw0LfQtNC10LvQuNGC0LXQu9C10Lkg0K3RgtC+ICANCtGB0L7QvtCx0YnQtdC90LjQtSDQ\r\n! sdC10Lcg0YDQsNC30LTQtdC70LjRgtC10LvQtdC5DQoNCkJlc3QgcmVnYXJkcy4uLi4=\r\n\\ No newline at end of file\r\n\r\nThis problem is not because of the use of Exchange server definitely, it is reproduced with 'direct' mail accounts. Don't know how to explain correctly... I send my messages directly to my accounts at yahoo.com or other similar services and receive them directly (no use of an Exchange server), and the problem is observed in Windows mail clients and even in web interfaces reviewed in Safari. But when the message is shown by Apple Mail it looks as expected, and this makes me suspect Apple Mail does something wrong with its messages. Unfortunately, I am not guru in MIME format and I am not able to parse the base64 encoding ti understand what's getting wrong with line endings.\r\n\r\nThanks for so quick reply!\r\n\r\n\r\n'ArchiveNew.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n16-Apr-2008 11:57 PM Vladimir Magaziy:\r\nNo, I do not set the text encoding manually. I have never used this feature of Apple Mail, so definitely this is not the case. \r\n\r\nYES, the bug can be reproduced with a message containing Latin characters only, but a length of separated lines is a shorter comparing with lines of messages that contained Cyrillic text. Please have a look at the new attachment:\r\n\r\nLatin_Message_AppleMail.jpg - Screenshot of how the message should look like (no separations)\r\nLatin_Message_AppleMail_Inbox.eml - Raw message from Apple Mail's Inbox\r\nLatin_Message_AppleMail_SentBox.eml - Raw message from Apple Mail's Sent box\r\nLatin_Message_MSOutlook.jpg - Screenshot of MS Outlook (contains separations, see my comments in red, since I've got a localized version of MS Outlook)\r\nLatin_Message_MSOutlook.msg - Not sure this is useful, but anyway I provide it\r\nLatin_Message_WindowsMail.jpg - Screenshot of Windows Mail (contains separations\r\nLatin_Message_WindowsMail.eml - Raw message from Windows Mail.\r\n\r\nOnce again the only difference between Latin_Message_WindowsMail.eml and Latin_Message_AppleMail_Inbox.eml is the last character:\r\n$ diff Latin_Message_WindowsMail.eml Latin_Message_AppleMail_Inbox.eml \r\n38c38\r\n< - Vova\r\n\\ No newline at end of file\r\n---\r\n> - Vova\r\n\r\nAnd Latin_Message_AppleMail.jpg and Latin_Message_WindowsMail.jpg look really different! I think the problem is Apple Mail skips (ignores) additional separators of lines it inserts, but Windows Mail and other mail clients show them always, so this leads to such an ugly appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'ArchiveLatinMessage.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n05-Sep-2009 09:39 AM Vladimir Magaziy:\r\nCan be reproduced with Mail 4.0 (1075/1075.2) on Snow Leopard (10A432). Any update on this? Is it possible to work it around somehow on SnoL? \r\n\r\n\r\n'Archive-1.zip' was successfully uploaded"
