    description: "Xcode is fantastic, but if you need to move back and forth between two projects (for instance, if you're referring to some previous work that you did on another project) the only ways to do it are fairly cumbersome: \r\n\r\n* navigate to the Window menu and select the new project\r\n* use command-backtick (the tilde key) to move between application windows\r\n* use expose to view all windows and select the other project window.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if a key binding, such as the one used in the terminal to navigate between tabs (command+shift+[ or command + shift + ]) could be used to navigate from one project window to another, ignoring other windows such as the debugger, console, documentation, etc.\r\n\r\nSimply switching between the main project windows would be great, although this might be further enhanced by remembering the previous z order of the windows associated with each project and restoring their old position in bulk."
