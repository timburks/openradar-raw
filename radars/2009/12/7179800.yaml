    description: "Summary:\r\nThe links to pages on the new Mac Reference Library front page do not work when opened using ⌘-return.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load up the Mac Reference Library front page (http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/navigation/index.html).\r\n2. Using the tab key (Safari) or type-ahead find (OmniWeb), put focus on a link to a documentation page, such as a class reference.\r\n3. Press ⌘-return.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe desired page opens in a new tab.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac Reference Library opens in a new tab.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes, as of the day the new Mac Reference Library was deployed. The previous documentation site used real links, which work just fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is that all of the documentation links on the Mac Reference Library front page are fakes, linking only to “#”. JavaScript onmouseover handlers set the links' hrefs to actual page URLs, but onmouseover handlers do not trigger when a mouse cursor never gets anywhere near the link.\r\n\r\nI can't even guess why you did this. What is the advantage of “lazily” hooking up the links in JavaScript? Isn't this actually more work? Wouldn't it be easier to simply put the href in the link when you create it?\r\n\r\nAnother problem that the “lazy” link-binding is likely to cause is poor to no representation in Google's index for the new page URLs. The links don't actually go to documentation pages until the user-agent runs the JavaScript onmouseover handler, and Googlebot doesn't run JavaScript.\r\n\r\n23-Dec-2009 01:34 PM Peter Hosey:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
