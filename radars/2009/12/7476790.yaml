    description: "Summary: \r\nRight now, developers need to rely on AdHoc distribution method to test their unreleased app or in a more familiar term: beta testing.\r\n\r\nThis is quite inefficient and cumbersome, since the AdHoc device provisioning profile is limited to 100 and we need to also maintain it if some are inactive. Besides, some of these testers may not be an active users of the app. So, this will limit developers ability to test their app before official release to new users.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be great if there's a mechanism to provide unreleased apps to \"existing users\" so they could test it for free, before official release which will also be provided to new users besides the existing users.\r\n\r\nThis unreleased apps testing could also be limited by trial mode in 7 - 14 days.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis suggestion may only valid for existing apps on the store, which should already have existing user base. AdHoc distribution method may only be necessary for testing new apps that don't exist on the store."
