    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlaying a quicktime movie file with subtitles results in the subtitles being displayed only for a short time, memory usage of Quicktime Player X increases until application and system become unresponsive. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Encoded a DVD using Handbrake 0.9.4 including the closed captions from the disc as subtitles for the movie.\r\n2. Play encoded movie in QTX, enable subtitles.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMovie should have played with the subtitles switched on, subtitles should be displayed properly through out the length of the movie.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSubtitles are displayed for a short time while the movie plays and memory usage continues to climb while QTX is playing the movie file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSubtitles work correctly in Quicktime 7 (v7.6.3 (630))"
