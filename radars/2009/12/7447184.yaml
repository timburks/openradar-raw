Select a word in BBEdit.\r\n6. Control-click the word and select Look up in Dictionary.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nFor 3, Dictionary opens, showing the selected word from BBEdit.\r\nFor 6, Dictionary opens, showing the last-used word (i.e., from #3) instead of the correct word from BBEdit.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nBare Bones says this problem was not present in 10.5.\r\nWhen I select the Panel instead of the App in Dictionary.app's preferences, BBEdit shows the right word in the pop-up window."
