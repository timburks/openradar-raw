    description: "03-Dec-2009 01:38 AM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCookies are hard to identify in safari.\r\nIt would be very helpful if they could be filtered / sorted by the time that they were added / last modified.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the cookies sheet in the Security tab of Safari's preferences.\r\nThe only columns available are: Website, Name, Path, Sec…, Expires and Contents.\r\n\r\nProblem: some sites, such as german telekom, insist on cookies being allowed from any server in order to change some user preferences. The cookies are only used for session tracking and are provided by a separate server. After the change has been made, the cookies can be removed.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is \"Bad Practice™\" on german telekom's part, it would be great if the cookies could be listed by \"date added\" or \"date modified\" so that such trackers can be identified and removed with due prejudice.\r\nI have noticed that increasingly sites insist that users allow cookies, javascript, pop-up windows. It's not a problem that is going to go away by itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe addition of (optional) columns \"Date Added\" and \"Date Modified\" to the cookies sheet in Safari's Security preferences.\r\nThe columns should be sortable (by date, not by the displayed characters)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to determine which cookies were created or modified in a particular time-frame.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA suitable bug-report has also been sent to german telekom."
