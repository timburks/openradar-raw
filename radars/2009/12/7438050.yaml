    description: "Summary:\r\nQuickTime X doesn't honor a HTTP 401 Response. When the Webserver demands User Authentication Quicktime simply ignores the request.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nOpen a HTTP Basic protected .m3u8 playlist file. http://www.example.com/prog_index.m3u8\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\nQuickTime should ask the user for credentials as described in http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.8\r\n\r\nActual Result:\r\nQuicktime Error Message: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (OSStatus error -128.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhone OS3.x has the desired behavior. iTunes has the desired behaviour for \"classic\" HTTP Streaming (icecast protocol).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's not clear if this can be classified as a bug. According to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.2 the UserAgent MAY present a Password dialog. So it's clearly RFC conform. However this limits the usage of Quicktime X for protected streams. It's also unclear why the iPhone handles it and the desktop doesn't. If it's not considered a bug please change the classification to \"Enhancement Request\"."
