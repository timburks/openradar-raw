    description: "17-Dec-2009 05:29 PM Aidan Steele:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCFReadStream and CFWriteStream define methods to read stream properties. One such property is a reference to the SSLContextRef associated with the stream when SSL/TLS is in use. The constant used to refer to this property (kCFStreamPropertySocketSSLContext) is defined in the library (cf. open source here[1]), but this constant is not defined in any header files.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThis constant would be defined in the CFNetwork headers along with all the other associated socket properties.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[1]: http://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-476.10/CFSocketStream.c\r\n\r\n07-Feb-2010 07:39 PM Aidan Steele:\r\nIt's been about six weeks since I opened this bug report. Has this perhaps slipped under the radar, so to speak? :-)\r\n\r\n09-Jun-2010 07:06 PM Aidan Steele:\r\nPlease forgive my impatience, but it has now been almost six months since filing this bug report and no acknowledgement of its existence has been made. Has any progress been made on this front?\r\n\r\n24-Jul-2010 05:37 AM DARIN MARSHALL :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information: \r\n\r\nWe don't expect to make this property public as we will likely be changing the implementation at a later date."
