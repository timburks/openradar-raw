    description: "01-Dec-2009 02:38 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nWhenever I use \"Use left\" or \"Use right\" from the \"Merge\" popup during a compare of several files in a folder, the keyboard focus is removed from the NSBrowser showing the directories. Thus, the typical keyboard workflow of select an item, Cmd-2 or Cmd-3 (choose left/right) down arrow to select the next file, lather, rinse, repeat doesn't work. Furthermore, I can't tab to get the browser selected again. I always have to reach for the mouse and select the next item.\r\n\r\nIt'd be appreciated if you maintained the first responder in that window. Thank you."
