    description: "Xcode 3.2: problem with \"Inline method hidden\" for old projects (\"different visibility\") Bug ID# 7444677\r\n\r\nI compiled a project for the first time in Xcode 3.2 which had been developed under OSX 10.5 with an earlier version of Xcode.  (Not sure which version number, but I probably downloaded and installed it within the last 6 months.)  I got 107 warnings of the form:\r\n\r\n  ld: warning: ... has different visibility (default) in ... and (hidden) in ...\r\n\r\nA web search lead me to this conversation:\r\n\r\n  http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4428\r\n\r\nwhich suggested a basic solution/work-around for the problem via a build option called \"Inline method hidden\" aka GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN.  That is fine, however my experience -- and according to my \"reading between the lines\", the experience of \"jules\" on that forum discussion -- was like this:\r\n\r\n(1) got the unexpected warnings, Googled for help\r\n(2) located the Xcode flag (\"Inline method hidden\") it was OFF\r\n(3) turned it ON\r\n(4) recompiled, no improvement\r\n(5) actually read the one-liner description for the flag\r\n(6) turned it OFF\r\n(7) everything was ok\r\n\r\nThat is: while the flag initially displayed as being OFF, it acted as if it were ON, and didn't do what I wanted until I turned it ON then OFF.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the subtleties but OFF (by which I mean \"really OFF\") seems like a good default value.\r\n\r\nI have attached an archive (\"code 20091203 archive.zip\") of my code directory from yesterday's backup before I did the compilation and other fiddling.  The project in question is called TextureSynthesisTest, it uses code from a sibling folder called \"beagle-3.0.3\".  I removed the rest of the contents of \"code\" to meet the 50 MB limit for attachments.  Note that this is non-public, preliminary software.\r\n\r\n\r\nCraig Reynolds\r\nhttp://www.red3d.com/cwr/"
