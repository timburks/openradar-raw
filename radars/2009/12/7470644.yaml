    description: "When your navigation stack's root view controller has a leftBarButtonItem, calling setViewControllers:animated:YES with one or more additional VCs keeps the root leftBarButtonItem on screen.  The proper top item's back button is also visible, but the root VC's button is highlighted and its action selector is called when tapping.\r\n\r\nSee attached project and screenshot.  This problem does not occur if you pass animated:NO.  I've tried a few workarounds, including setting the leftBarButtonItem to nil before proceeding and/or deferring the call to setViewControllers via performSelector:withObject:afterDelay, but had no luck."
