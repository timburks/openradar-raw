    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating objects in a block running on a background thread that are then stored elsewhere on the main thread via a dispatch_sync() call are reaped prematurely and result in EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile and run the test program.\r\n2. Wait for \"Done\" to be presented in the console. 10000 number objects have been created and stored in an array at that point.\r\n3. Click the \"Click Me\" button.\r\n4. *BOOM*\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe objects created on the background thread should not be reaped since they are accessible from a root object in the main thread.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey're being reaped.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can keep it from happening by issuing a CFRetain/CFRelease immediately on the created objects, but that seems like cheating.\r\n\r\nBy the way, this only seems to happen with NSDecimalNumber objects. I've tried to reproduce it with NSString and NSNumber objects and they both work as expected.\r\n\r\nProject can be found at http://files.me.com/aclark78/198u39"
