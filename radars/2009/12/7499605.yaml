    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen right-clicking with the MacBook1,1 or MacBookPro5,1's trackpad on a file icon in Finder on at least Mac OS X 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 (didn't test 10.6.0), the \"Open With\" menu repeats itself 4 times. When right-clicking with a bluetooth mouse, this effect doesn't appear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using the trackpad right-click (two-fingers, or Ctrl-Click) on a filetype icon.\r\n2. Move the mouse cursor to \"Open With>\"\r\n3. Using a bluetooth mouse (didn't test wired), right-click (or Ctrl-click) on a filetype icon.\r\n4. Repeat step 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that the output of this menu would not at all be derived or dependent upon the type of input used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu becomes duplicated up to 4 times.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know all the revisions of 10.5 pass this test. I've only noticed the issue in 10.6.1 and 10.6.2, though 10.6.0 might be affected as well. Likewise, this may be a model issue, attached are the two machine configurations I tested. The MacBookPro5,1 is a upgraded install from 10.5; the MacBook1,1 is a fresh install upgraded to 10.6.2 using Software Update and some additional media software installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a video to describe this. In it, I first right-click using the trackpad, and then I pair a bluetooth Belkin Mouse (model F8T041) and right-click with it.\r\n\r\nI've found a few apple support forum threads about this: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2146991\r\n\r\n02-Jan-2010 12:09 PM Jesse Pearson:\r\nI just wanted to point out my limited tests reveal this on those filetypes handled by iTunes as the default application. So this may be related to iTunes in some way, too."
