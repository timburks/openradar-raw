    description: "When an NSTableColumn is set non-editable in the Interface Builder inspector, and later is bound to an NSArrayController, \"Conditionally Sets Editable\" cannot be unchecked.\r\n\r\nTO REPRODUCE\r\nOpen the attached XIB in Interface Builder.\r\nNote that all NSTableColumns in the table have the \"Editable\" property cleared.\r\nSelect the \"Sender\" column.\r\nBind that column to AllMessages -> sender.\r\nClick on the \"Conditionally Sets Editable\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED\r\nThe checkbox clears.\r\n\r\nACTUAL\r\nThe checkbox cannot be cleared.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\nI don't remember this being the case in earlier versions, and clearing both Editable and Conditionally Sets Editable seems to me a reasonable thing to do. If it is not, the checkbox should be disabled.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Go to the first panel of the inspector, and check \"Editable.\" \"Conditionally Sets Editable\" can now be cleared. Then go back to \"Editable,\" and uncheck it. \"Conditionally Sets Editable\" remains cleared, as desired."
