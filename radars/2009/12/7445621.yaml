    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCGPDFPage excessively caching content stream\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWhen a CGPDFPageRef is obtained via CGPDFDocumentGetPage(), its memory usage is minimal. However, once that page has been rendered using CGContextDrawPDFPage(), its content stream appears to be cached somewhere.\r\n\r\nFor pages with lots of images this is a problem, because the CGPDFDocument appears to retain the page until it is itself released, even during low memory warnings on the iPhone, and the CGPDFPage does not appear to relinquish its cache until it is deallocated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA low memory warning should cause CGPDFPage to flush its cache.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA low memory warning does not cause CGPDFPage to flush its cache.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI think this is a duplicate of bug #6367689. I have also opened a DTS request on the issue (Follow-up:  [redacted]). Please consider this a strong vote to have it fixed! It really is critical on a device with such little memory; the existence of this bug essentially means that writing a PDF viewer is impossible."
