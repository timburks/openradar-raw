    description: "13-Dec-2009 11:33 AM Stuart Lamble:\r\nSummary: When downloading software updates using the command line softwareupdate utility with the \"-d\" parameter, the output displays a message erroneously indicating that the package has been installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n * Install a clean system with required updates needing to be installed.\r\n * Download, but do not actually install, the updates by using softwareupdate -d (in the case that triggered this report, I specifically asked for the Xcode3.2.1Update-3.2.1 update; the OS X 10.6.2 update was also available but was specifically not requested, as I opted to download it via other means.)\r\n * Observe the output message claiming that the update has been installed.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n * The software should be downloaded and cached, but NOT installed.\r\n * The output messages should reflect this situation.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n * The software is downloaded and cached, but NOT installed.\r\n * The output messages erroneously imply that the package HAS been installed.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes: I have not attempted to reproduce this issue, as my ADSL connection has been slowed to an untenably slow rate for the next week due to exceeding my download quota for the month. I therefore cannot comment on whether the issue occurs only when downloading a single specified update, or if it also manifests with multiple specified updates, or all available updates. The documented behaviour is correct; the issue is purely with the status messages implying that the update(s?) in question have been installed."
