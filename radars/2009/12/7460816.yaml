    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, the Javascript prompt() function opens a dialog with a standard text field. In one of these fields, text can be selected, but the cut/copy/paste buttons do not appear (except on a fresh launch with no pages open).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari on iPhone OS 3.1.2\r\n2. Tap the address bar\r\n3. Enter javascript:prompt()\r\n4. Tap the Go button\r\n5. Tap in the new dialog's text field\r\n\r\nIf the cut/copy/paste do appear, copy and paste some text then cancel and try again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cut/copy/paste buttons should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cut/copy/paste buttons do not appear. Text selection works as expected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have tested this on both an original iPhone and iPhone 3GS running OS 3.1.2, as well as the iPhone simulator. This problem does not occur on my very first attempt after closing all pages and resetting the phone. After using the cut/copy/paste buttons once, they do not appear again in subsequent attempts.\r\n\r\n<GMT11-Dec-2009 22:34:06GMT>:\r\nThe same problem occurs with any text field added to a UIAlertView (whether using addSubview or the undocumented addTextFieldWithValue), so this problem extends beyond Safari."
