    description: "On OSX 10.5.8: I finished my backup and was hurrying to put away the external disk.  I'd dragged its icon to the Trash/Eject icon, but must have not waiting for the disk icon to disappear before pulling out the Firewire cable.  I got the pop-up telling me it had not been correctly put away.  Dang!  So I plugged it back in and ... and ... nothing.  Uh oh, now I'm *really* screwed, now it won't even mount.  I yanked the cord again, closed up the laptop and walked away in a black mood, fuming about lost data.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as I realized later, everything was fine.  It was just that OSX wanted to run fsck_hfs before mounting the disk again.  This was apparent the second time around because I had the big window of Activity Monitor open (like \"top\").\r\n\r\nFrom a \"user comfort\" point of view, I suggest that it would be MUCH better if the Desktop gave some indication that (1) yes, it HAD noticed that I'd plugged a disk in, and (2) it would be a while before it would mount.  For instance if it showed the disk icon in some altered form (semi transparent, or overlaid with a progress bar, or...) I would at least have known that OSX was working on the disk and I shouldn't disconnect it."
