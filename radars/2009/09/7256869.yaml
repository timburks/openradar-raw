    description: "Summary: \r\nSnow Leopard now asks for your password a lot more than previous OS versions, basically because 'sleep' was redefined with regards to screen locking. Previously, sleep meant computer sleep, whereas now it means display sleep.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(assuming a portable computer)\r\n1. Set your screen saver to activate 'Never', and define at least one hot corner for it to activate.\r\n2. Set your display sleep time to anything except 'Never' (shorter times are obviously easier for testing)\r\n3. Set your computer sleep time to 'Never' (for power adapter)\r\n4. Set the 'Require password X minutes after sleep or screen saver begins' setting to 'immediately'\r\n5. Leave your machine in the following states:\r\n5a. At home, plugged in, with the lid open, as you idly wander in and out of the room to check news or sports scores, facebook or an ebay auction.\r\n5b. Grab it and go somewhere.\r\n5c. On your desk at work, unplugged, and go get a coffee.\r\n5d. On your desk at work, unplugged, and go for lunch.\r\n5e. On your desk at work, plugged in, and activate the screensaver hotcorner before you run to the bank.\r\n5f. Someone else you don't know grabs it and goes somewhere.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe computer will lock itself in all cases except in my trusted environment of home (5a) where I leave it plugged in and accessible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNow in Snow Leopard, the screen will lock in all cases, including while using the computer sporadically or in a trusted environment.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n10.5.x and before allowed no locking in trusted environments, and locking in untrusted environments without changing settings.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis quote from a website says it well:\r\n'But probably the worst offender in Snow Leopard is the new-found demand that you enter your password after the screen dims. Previously, you could have your display turn off after a certain period (and, as long as a screen saver wasn’t triggered), you didn’t have to enter a password to wake the machine up. If you closed the lid, or triggered a full system sleep, then you’d be prompted for a password.'\r\nUsing the delayed requirement for a password is a poor solution, requiring occasional use to always occur within a specified time or else the screen will be locked anyway, but allowing the occasional prying eyes in 5d-f to use that feature against me.\r\nThe only other workaround is to set the screen not to sleep, which restores the previous functionality, but at the cost of increased energy consumption and shortened display life, neither of which seem a reasonable tradeoff."
