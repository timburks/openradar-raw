    description: "Finder switches folders spontaneously on mounted AFP Volume\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes when a folder is opened in a Finder window, the Finder goes into the double clicked folder as expected, but shortly after jumps back automatically with no action from the user.\r\n\r\nThis happens when the folder is on a mounted AFP Volume. Both the server and the client have installed Mac OS X 10.6.1.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to describe the problem, so I made a screen recording. Watch it here:\r\nhttp://superpixel.ch/bugreport/spontaneous-afp-jump.mp4"
