    description: "Summary: \r\nThe \"Play/Pause\" key on keyboard launches iTunes.app when it isn't supposed to. Keyboard includes both Apple's laptop keyboards, external keyboards, and all other non-Apple keyboards that feature \"media control\" keys.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open VLC and open some clip\r\n2. Press the Play/Stop key\r\n3. iTunes.app launches when the user intends to use the media control key to control VLC\r\n4. VLC playback disrupted, iTunes launches and plays whatever track is in the current playlistâ€”in sum, bad user experience\r\n5. Replace VLC with any media app (e.g. Spotify which is popular in Europe) that handles media control keys and repeat steps 2.-4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMedia control key should only control the foreground app, or the app that asks for it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes.app always launches whenever a media control key is pressed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBefore Snow Leopard, the behavior is always that only the foreground app handles the media control key (other than volume keys)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEither iTunes.app / System Preferences provides an option to disable the iTunes-launch feature, or rollback to pre-10.6 behavior, is desirable. A workaround on the developers' side by using Quartz Event Tap to filter system defined keys seems possible, but ugly, error-prone and can run into horrible scenes if security-related modal dialogs pop up."
