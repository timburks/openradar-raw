    description: "[Summary]\r\n\r\nWhen editing some source code in the Xcode IDE, using completion to insert a TextMacro (like typing \"ma\" to insert the \"NSMutableArray * array;\" as defined by the embed TextMacro objc.mutablearray) won't work if the \"OnlyAtBOL\" key is not set (or set to NO) for this TextMacro definition (in the xctxtmacro file)\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, only TextMacros that are defined with OnlyAtBOL=YES are working with \"typing completion\" (the other TextMacros can still be inserted using the \"Insert Text Macro\" menu item, anyway).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Steps to Reproduce]\r\n\r\n - Open any \".m\" file in Xcode IDE, and type some text defined as a CompletionPrefix for any TextMacro (and in the correct context)\r\n - For example, place the cursor inside a method definition, on the line after the open bracket \"{\", and type \"ma\". The \"NSMutableArray * array;\" TextMacro should be proposed but is not.\r\n - Or use the attached custom TextMacro file and test by typing the \"bug\" CompletionPrefix in any code file (see comments below and in the file)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Expected Results]\r\n - The TextMacro should be proposed in the autocompletion/CodeSense menu that apears when you begin typing the CompletionPrefix of the TextMacro\r\n\r\n[Actual Results]\r\n - The TextMacro is not proposed in the codesense menu\r\n\r\n[Regression]\r\n - Was working in Xcode 3.1 and OSX 10.5.8\r\n - Not working any more here in Xcode 3.2 on OSX 10.6.1\r\n\r\n\r\n[Notes]\r\nA sample xctxtmacro has been attached to test this behavior.\r\n - Place it in \"~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Specifications\"\r\n - relaunch Xcode, then test the TextMacro : type \"bug\" anywhere in a source code file and the TextMacro should appear in the completion menu.\r\n - comment or remove the \"OnlyAtBOL=YES;\" line in the xctxtmacro file and quit and relaunch Xcode again\r\n - The TextMacro is not proposed in the completion menu anymore"
