    description: "20-Sep-2009 08:25 PM Andrew Lee:\r\nSummary: \r\nSymbol for Tab in menu shortcuts is confusing\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, pull down the Window menu.  (Safari is just an example.)\r\n2. Look at the keyboard shortcut for Select Next Tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would want it to be clear what that keyboard shortcut is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks very much like a right arrow, and users could be puzzled and frustrated when Control-RightArrow doesn't select the next tab (in the Safari example).  One user who was indeed puzzled posted recently to Omnigroup's MacTalk list.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI propose that the special tab symbol be replaced with the word \"TAB\", in the same font that's used for function keys like F15, F16, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are other special characters that are potentially confusing, but I think the Tab symbol is an especially good candidate for replacing, because it's only three characters (at least in English) *and* it's so easy to confuse with something else.\r\n\r\nAdd to Problem Details\r\n                                \t\r\n\r\n\r\n20-Sep-2009 08:45 PM Andrew Lee:\r\nOn the mactalk thread I mentioned, Arno Hautala suggested: \"Apple should introduce an option to to display the shortcuts with their textual names, rather than the symbols which don't appear on the keyboard anymore.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/macosx-talk/2009-September/136074.html\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nUpdate from Apple on 9/26:\r\n\r\nAfter further investigation it has been determined that this is a known issue, which is currently being investigated by engineering.  This issue has been filed in our bug database under the original Bug ID# 2451168."
