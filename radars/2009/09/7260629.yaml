    description: "29-Sep-2009 01:15 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nCropping photos in iPhoto 09 is more complicated than it was in iPhoto 06\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a photo in iPhoto 09\r\n2. Double click to edit the photo, discover that no longer works\r\n3. Click on Edit button\r\n4. Try to select area to crop to, find that doesn't work\r\n5. Click on Crop button\r\n6. Resize crop area, default position of which may be completely unrelated to where you want it.\r\n7. Move Cropping HUD out of the way, as it is almost always in the way of seeing what you want to do\r\n7. Click Apply.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto 06 user interace:\r\n1. Double click on a photo to edit\r\n2. Select area to crop to\r\n3. Click Crop\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Find & click on edit button to edit\r\n2. Click on Crop button\r\n3. Adjust crop rectangle, often requiring more movement and adjustment than before, may require moving HUD\r\n4. Click on Apply\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhoto 06 interface provided the same level of control but was considerably simpler to use.  The single extra step in 09 belies how much more difficult it is to crop a photo in 09 compared to 06\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Resizing of image before cropping can sometimes be quite disconcerting as things move about\r\n- Default crop rectangle may be completely unrelated to where I want to crop to, and adjusting it normally takes more time than creating my own\r\n- HUD often gets in the way\r\n- HUD does not remember the position I moved it to and always ends up back in the bottom centre of the picture, requiring me to move it.\r\n- HUD has almost not free space to use as a handle to move it out of the way.\r\n- Trying to recrop an image that has already been cropped, rezooms to original photo.  So I have to zoom in to see any extra detail on a large resolution image to fine tune cropping.  in 06 I could do a quick rough crop and then fine tune.  Process in 06:\r\n1. Select Area\r\n2. Hit Crop\r\n3. Select smaller area\r\n4. Hit Crop.\r\n\r\nIn 09:\r\n1. Hit Crop\r\n2. Move HUD\r\n3. Adjust Crop rectangle\r\n4. Hit Apply\r\n5. Hit Crop\r\n6. Move HUD again\r\n7. Move Navigation Window\r\n8. Zoom back to area previously cropped to\r\n9. Adjust crop rectangle\r\n10 Hit Apply."
