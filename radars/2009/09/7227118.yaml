    description: "Summary: \r\nNormally in almost all Mac OS X windows when the user right-clicks on the title a dropdown appears showing the location in the file system of the resource depicted by the window. \r\nI will call this the path stack dropdown or just path stack. \r\n\r\nIn earlier versions of the Finder (including the Finder in OS X 10.5.8) one could employ various modifier combinations when clicking an entry in the path stack. \r\n\r\nFor example when command is pressed and some entry in the path stack is clicked a new window would open with the location of the clicked entry shown. The new Finder in OS X 10.6.1 ignores all modifier keys in any combination and always opens clicked path stack entries  in the current (frontmost) window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a window in the Finder\r\n2. Right- or ctrl-click on the title of the window\r\n3. With the path stack visible hold down any of the modifier keys (command, control, alt or shift)\r\n4. Left-click any entry in the path stack except the top most\r\n5. Depress the modifier key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHolding down command should open a new window\r\nHolding down alt should open a new window while closing the old\r\netc... these combinations are well known from Motorola days. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe location is changed but the window stays always the same.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nMac OS X 10.5.8 with the Carbon based Finder does not show this problem.\r\nMac OS X 10.6 with the Cocoa based Finder exhibits this problem\r\nMac OS X 10.6.1 with the Cocoa based Finder exhibits this problem"
