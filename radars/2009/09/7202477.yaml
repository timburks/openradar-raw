    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode doesn't detect a variable if the assigned value is casted, meaning you can't bring up the menu for it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add the following code to a method:\r\n\r\nNSString *string = (NSString *)@\"test\";\r\n[string length];\r\n\r\n2. Try hovering over the string variable name in the second line, see how it highlights all instances in the scope and brings up the menu\r\n3. Move your mouse off the variable, so the highlight goes away\r\n4. Now hover over the string variable declaration, see how it doesn't highlight at all and you can't bring up the menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould highlight all instances of the variable in the current scope\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoesn't\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf you hover over another instance of the variable and then move directly to where it is assigned, the highlight remains and you can bring up the menu, but not edit all in scope\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe above example is pretty trivial, but it works for any case where you cast when you assign."
