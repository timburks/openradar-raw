It doesn't any longer on 10.6. Others have reported drives spinning down when not desired:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ccgus/status/4131367987\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ccgus/status/4130660293\r\nhttps://twitter.com/robotspacer/statuses/4136763332\r\n\r\n\r\n'MacBook Pro.txt' was successfully uploaded"
