    description: "When I click a phone number label, Address Book shows me a menu to see the number in large type; Phone Amego adds items to this menu. The menu is *not* available, however, when I right-click a phone number without a selection, or when I left-click on the number area at all. It should be.\r\n\r\nThe Large Type item is in the contextual menu when I select and right-click on the number, but not the Phone Amego items. I don't know if this is an issue in Amego, but I am reporting it both here and there. Supplemental items should be in the contextual menu, not just the label pop-up menu.\r\n\r\nI have a 'home' IM (reppep@mac.com) and a 'Google Talk' IM. Address Book. When I click their labels, both let me search with Spotlight, but Address Book dims the \"Send Instant Message\" option for my AIM address. Confusingly, it is available for my Google Talk address.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Screen shot 2009-09-08 at 12.21.05 PM.png' and 'reppep.teriyaki.10A432.2009-09-08.spx' were successfully uploaded"
