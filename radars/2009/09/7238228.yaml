    description: "Summary: on the iPhone/iPod touch, once a calendar event has been created it is not possible to change the calendar of the event.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPod/iPhone open Calendar.  \r\n2. Either a) select an event which has been created in Calendar or on the desktop calendar app, or \r\n     b) create a new event and set the calendar to the desired calendar.\r\n3. Select the event, hit the Edit button.\r\n4. Note the lack of \"Calendar\", and option to pick desired calendar, in details.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne would expect a \"Calendar\" cell after the \"Alert\" cell and before the \"Notes\" cell, much as is in the event creation view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSaid \"Calendar\" cell is in fact, not where one would expect it to be.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPerhaps this was an oversight?  Adding this ability wouldn't seem to make anything overly complicated for the user, as the option exists when creating an event.  It would be less surprising to users if the event editing view mirrored the event creation view.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: RESPONSE from apple:\r\nThis is a follow up to Bug ID# 7238228.  After further investigation it has been determined that this is a known issue, which is currently being investigated by engineering.  This issue has been filed in our bug database under the original Bug ID# 5756204. The original bug number being used to track this duplicate issue can be found in the State column, in this format:  Duplicate/OrigBug#."
