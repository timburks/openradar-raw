    description: "Have a look at the attached screenshots of Maps.app in iPhone OS 3.0 beta 2.\r\n\r\nThe map lacks antialiasing in normal state. However, as soon as a callout view is displayed, the view is nicely antialiased. As soon as the callout view is deselected, the non-antialiased view returns.\r\n\r\nThe effect is more or less noticeable in different zoom levels. It happens in both Maps.app and in custom apps using MKMapView.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Images.zip' was successfully uploaded"
