    description: "30-Sep-2009 12:18 PM Steve Quirke:\r\nSummary:\r\nMac Mail users see two email addresses in the from field when they receive messages from a user with extended characters (for example, umlauts) in their Exchange display name.  This then causes problems when you reply - as only one address is valid.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nSetup Mail to use Exchange - modify the display name value in Active Directory to include extended characters.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nMail users will see two items in the from field when they receive messages from users with extended characters in their display name.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe this behaviour also affects Leopard mail.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a screenshot, so you'll see what I mean.  I don't \"actually\" have umlauts in my name :)"
