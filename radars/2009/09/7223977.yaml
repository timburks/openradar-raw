    description: "Xcode's documentation viewer is one of the Xcode app's windows. It would be more usable as a separate application:\r\n\r\n  * it would then be accessible via Cmd-Tab, facilitating easy switching between code and documentation (Cmd-` only works for this if you only have a single editor window and a single documentation window).\r\n  * it could be moved to a separate Space.\r\n  * Multiple documentation windows would be easier to manage through application Expos√©\r\n  * When it crashes (which it does a little too often when searching), it would not take Xcode down with it.\r\n  * If it implemented a custom URL schema for searching for documentation, it would allow third-party apps to integrate better."
