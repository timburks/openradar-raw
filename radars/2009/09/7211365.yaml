    description: "iTunes requires WAY WAY too much tabbing.\r\n\r\nIn iTunes 8, in 3-column Browse mode with a playlist selected, I could tab all the way through the UI and back in about 6 keypresses:\r\nFind\r\nGenre\r\nArtist\r\nAlbum\r\nTrack\r\nPlaylist\r\n\r\nIn iTunes 9, the selection goes through:\r\nBack\r\nPlay/Pause\r\nForward\r\nVolume\r\nCycle Views\r\nsometimes a bogus rectangle in the yellow status area, depending on the current status view\r\nShow Track\r\nList View\r\nGrid View\r\nCover Flow View\r\nFind\r\nTrack\r\nthen through the controls at the bottom (where it's hard to notice)\r\nand finally back to the Source list.\r\n\r\nThat's too much to be useful in the normal case.\r\n\r\nYes, I have the option to allow me to Tab to controls on, but this is a ridiculous amount of tabbing for *not* being in Universal Access / assisted mode.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in iTunes 8 it required 8 Shift-Tabs to finally reach the Genre field. In 9, it's down to 7, forwards is not the inverse of backwards. Shift-Tab goes:\r\nArtist checkbox\r\nCancel\r\nOK\r\nInfo\r\nRating checkbox\r\n\r\nBut Info/Video/Sorting/Options at the top, and not between OK and the Rating checkbox. Further, the forward order is:\r\nRating checkbox\r\nOK\r\nCancel\r\nInfo\r\nArtist checkbox\r\nSo this way Rating and OK are adjacent, instead of Rating and Info.\r\n\r\nForward and reverse ought to match.\r\n\r\nAlso, it takes 33 Tabs to cycle all the way around the (multiple item) Info window. That makes changing anything other than Artist a royal pain with the keyboard, especially if it's something you do frequently (I often want to change Genre)."
