CMD+SPACE\r\n1. Type \"Safari\"\r\n2. Attempt to drag the Safari application to the dock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari item follows mouse and is added to dock on release\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari item adamantly refuses any interaction except a single click to \"open\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI love spotlight and took the applications folder out of my dock preferring simply to search an app and hit enter.\r\nI do a lot of command line work and I often drag folders from the finder title bar to terminal and was surprised when I couldn't drag in folders & files from a spotlight search (without opening the \"Show All\" results window."
