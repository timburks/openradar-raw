    description: "21-Aug-2009 02:35 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nSafari used to understand a command line option (/useDebugWebKit) which allowed easy switching between release and debug builds.  I would like to request that this option be put back, or an equivalent mechanism created.\r\n\r\nThis feature is very helpful for working on the WebKit project, as testing in release mode or debug mode can be done without having to rebuild the WebKit tree.\r\n\r\nAs things stand, you must build WebKit in the mode you wish to test each time, wasting a half hour or so to regenerate a release build if you want to confirm that you have fixed a bug.  The other option is to maintain wholly separate development trees so that you can quickly switch from release to debug and back.  Neither choice is ideal.\r\n\r\nThe run-time flag allows you to have both builds present, and dynamically switch between the two without having to rebuild."
