    description: "IntelliJ IDEA has a really neat features called \"Intention Actions\":\r\n\r\n  <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/code_assistance.html#Various_Intention_Actions>\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the editor detects some condition, such as an undefined method or missing import statement, and it provides assistance.  There's a huge list of supported intention actions:\r\n\r\n  <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/intentions.jsp>\r\n\r\nSome useful ones for Objective-C would be:\r\n\r\n* Detect methods implementations that have no declaration.  Offer to create the declaration either publicly in the .h file or privately in a class extension inside the .m file.\r\n\r\n* Detect classes that need to be imported and offer to add the #import line.\r\n\r\nThere's no doubt a lot more possibilities, as can be seen from the IntelliJ documentation.  This was one of the most useful features of Idea, and I'd love to see it in Xcode."
