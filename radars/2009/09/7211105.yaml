    description: "I check my mail from many places, my blackberry, Outlook on my PC at work, Outlook on a Win7 VM at home, Mail from my Macbook Pro, and Mail from my Mac Pro.  Both Macs are running snow leopard and experiencing the same problem of the inbox size getting stuck at a count.  as far as i can tell its nothing specific, rebuilding the mailbox fixes it, but I figured I should report it to see what shakes loose.  Happy to provide more/better information if necessary, but I figure this will get marked as a dupe anyway.\r\n\r\nUpdated: 11-Sep-2009 09:51 PM\r\nI have attached a screenshot as requested.  Since you can't see the entire inbox, you'll have to take my word for it, that while there are in fact 8 unread messages in the Gmail account, the Exchange account doesn't have 18 :)  \r\n\r\nThis may be related to rdar://7201289, i'm not sure."
