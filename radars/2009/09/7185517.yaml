    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe AirPort Utility transforms the Global Hostname Password field to lowercase preventing the use of passwords containing uppercase characters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open AirPort Utility.\r\n2. Double-click an AirPort to bring up it's configuration.\r\n3. Click the 'Base Station' tab.\r\n4. Click the Edit button below the Airport name field.\r\n5. Enable the tickbox beside 'Use dynamic global hostname'.\r\n6. Enter the Hostname and User credentails along with a Password containing uppercase characters.\r\n7. Click Done.\r\n8. Open the File menu and select 'Save a Copy As...' and save the configuration.\r\n9. Open the configuration in a text editor.\r\n10. Find the text string '<key>wbHP</key>'.\r\n11. The line below contains an XML string node showing that the password has been changed to lowercase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat the password would be retained in the case it was entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe password is converted to lowercase.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis bug appears in the AirPort utility version 5.4.2 on both OS X 10.5 and 10.6. I have not tried earlier releases of the utility or of OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround for this bug is to change the password to the correct case in a text editor and then import the configuration into the AirPort Utility."
