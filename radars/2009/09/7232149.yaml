    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a project containing a folder reference and a target that copies the folder into its product, changes to files inside the referenced folder do not cause Xcode to re-copy the folder into the product.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project from the Mac OS X application project template.\r\n2. Create a folder within the project root.\r\n3. Add a file to the project root.\r\n4. Add a reference to the folder to the project.\r\n5. Add the folder reference to the application target's Copy Bundle Resources phase.\r\n6. Build.\r\n7. Edit the file, making sure to save your work (if appropriate).\r\n8. Build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode re-copies the folder, or (optimally) the changed file alone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode does nothing, successfully.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nTouch the folder before building.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne real example is Adium, in which the “folders” in question are bundles: Emoticon, status-icon, service-icon, Dock-icon, and sound packs. Changing any of the files inside the pack should cause Xcode to re-copy the pack (or the changed files) in the next build.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of this by a Stack Overflow question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1438898/xcode-building-and-resources-folders). The questioner is experiencing the same problem building their iPhone app.\r\n\r\n[Uploaded test app: http://boredzo.org/stuph/LinesOfText-r0.tbz ]"
