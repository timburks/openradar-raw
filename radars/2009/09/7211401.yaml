    description: iTunes 8 showed which (audio/video/application) file was synching over to the iPhone. iTunes 9 just shows an uninformative barberpole. This prevents the user from estimating how much longer the sync will take. When moving multiple video files, sync takes quite a while, so this is important information we've lost.
