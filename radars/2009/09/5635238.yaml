    description: "07-Dec-2007 04:38 PM Sebastian Hagedorn:\r\nSummary: When the Sort Artist feature is used in iTunes in such a way that one Sort Artist entry is used for more than one Artist entry, the iPod will show multiple entries for the same artist.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce: Use iTunes 7.x. Choose various songs. One example for me are albums by:\r\n\r\nNeil Young\r\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse\r\nNeil Young with Crazy Horse\r\n\r\nSet the Sort Artist for all tracks to the same value. In my case that value is \"Young, Neil\". Sync to an iPod Classic. On the iPod, navigate to Music -> Artists. Find the artists used above. In my case, they are found (correctly) under the letter Y. However, each of those artists appears multiple times. I have altogether 15 such entries! Each entry contains the complete list of albums by that artist.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The list should have one entry per artist. One could also argue that there should be only one entry for the Sort Artist, but that's a matter of opinion.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The artist entries are multiplied.\r\n\r\nRegression: On an earlier iPod 60 GB the behavior was different, but also not correct. There only one artist was displayed, e.g. only Neil Young. The others were suppressed. That meant that you couldn't access those other albums via the artist list. They were accessible using the albums list. The current behavior has been the same ever since firmware version 1.0.\r\n\r\nNotes: All my tests were done using a Mac running OS X 10.4.11 and iTunes 7.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17-Sep-2009 10:42 AM Sebastian Hagedorn:\r\nJust as an update, this problem still exists with iTunes 9."
