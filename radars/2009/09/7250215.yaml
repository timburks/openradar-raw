    description: "SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhile iPhone SDK does provide a way for an application to prevent the screen from locking, by disabling the idle timer, the SDK lacks the ability for the application developer to programmatically set the backlight level. However, the iPod application included with iPhone OS demonstrates this is achievable. Please make the GSEventSetBacklightFactor and GSEventSetBacklightLevel methods public or introduce a new API that replicates their functionality. \r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Create an application that disables idle timer.\r\n2. Attempt to programmatically raise or lower the backlight level.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe developer is able to call a single method that accepts an int or float parameter to set the backlight level. \r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS\r\n\r\nThere is no public API that can be called.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNOTES"
