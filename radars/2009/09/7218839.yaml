    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Software Update for Windows places iPhone Configuration Utility 2.1 in the Updates section, not the New Software section, even when a previous version has never been installed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a fresh VM of Microsoft Windows (in my case: 7 Enterprise).\r\n2. Install a piece of Apple software unrelated to iPhone Configuration Utility (in my case: Bonjour 1.0.6). Make sure to tick the box to include Apple Software Update.\r\n3. In Software Update, Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the Updates section, you should only receive updates to the software you have installed â€” in my case, only Bonjour. Everything else should be available in the New Software section.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile iTunes + QuickTime, Safari 4 and QuickTime are in the New Software section, iPhone Configuration Utility is placed in Updates.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSort of. From my experience, previous versions of iPhone Configuration Utility did not appear in either section.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
