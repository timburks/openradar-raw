    description: "===[Summary]===\r\n\r\n1) [BUG] The Services enabled in the \"Services\" PrefPane does not appear in the Contextual Menu (e.g. right-clicking on a file in the Finder won't show the \"N?ew Email With Attachment\") until we go to the \"Services\" PrefPane to disable and re-enable the Service again by clicking the checkbox.\r\n(NB : Snow Leopard installed by updating a MacOSX Leopard)\r\n\r\n2) [UI/Usability] The Services Preferences is *really* unfriendly :\r\n\r\n - It is really not logical to find the Services Preferences in the \"Keyboard\" PrefPane, under Keyboard Shortcuts. Can't see why it's hidden in there, makes it hard to find (and moreover, the \"Keyboard\" prefpane lies in the \"Hardware\" section of System Preferences...) Why not a dedicated Services PrefPane, in either the \"Personal\" or the \"System\" section?\r\n\r\n - The list of services is really strangly sorted (Pictures, Internet, Files and Folders, ...), independantly to the application it comes from. And there is no indication to tell from which app the Service comes (not even the app icon), so who can tell what a generically named \"Send\" service might do if we don't know if it comes from a FTP client, a Mail client, an IM client, ... which makes it very difficult to know which services we cant to enable or disable.\r\n\r\n\r\n===[Steps to Reproduce]===\r\n\r\n1) On a Mac with Snow Leopard installed via an update from Leopard, right-clic on any element\r\n\r\n\r\n===[Expected Results]===\r\n\r\n1) The available Services should show up in the Contextual Menu, as they do in the \"Services\" menuitem in the app menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n===[Actual Results]===\r\n\r\n1) The available Services won't show in the CM unless we disabled and reenabled back again in the Services Preferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n===[Regression]===\r\n\r\n\r\n===[Notes]===\r\n\r\nThis bug is not a big deal but actually will make people think that Services are not so useful, if they don't see them in the CM. That's what I thought, giving me a very bad impression over Services, and almost gave up using the Services in OSX.6 until I realized some other people with SL (and probably a clean install) have them in the CM, which give them a real reason to be used."
