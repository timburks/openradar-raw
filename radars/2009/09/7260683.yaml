    description: "29-Sep-2009 01:32 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\niPhoto 09 Cropping HUD has no easy point of clicking to move it\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a photo in iPhoto 09\r\n2. Hit Edit\r\n3. Click on Crop\r\n4. Try to move Cropping HUD out of the way\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- HUD does not appear, as per iPhoto 06\r\n- If HUD does appear it is in the position I last moved it to\r\n- If HUD appears in the default position (always), should be easy to move out of the way, by having a clearly definied area for clicking on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- HUD always appears in default position, bottom centre above photo, has very limited space around controls to click on to move.\r\n- Very limited space around controls\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhoto 06 had no cropping HUD and therefore it didn't need to be moved out of the way every time a photo is cropped.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see rdar://7260629 and rdar://7260675"
