    description: "I believe the following bug to be related to rdar://7240036 .\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with quick look plugins where multiple plugins have registered for the same UTI. In short, there is no way for the user to tell the quick look system which plugin should get used for which UTI. This problem is further compounded by the fact that, apparently, plugins installed in ~/Library/QuickLook do not have priority (as they should), so there is no way for individual users to override system-level plugins."
