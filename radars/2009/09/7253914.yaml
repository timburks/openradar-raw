    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen the Dock is pinned to the end, contextual menus are misplaced for icons near the end.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pin the Dock to the end (defaults write com.apple.Dock pinning end; killall Dock).\r\n2. Right-click on the Trash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contextual menu should be shaped like a rounded rectangle with a triangle pointing at the Trash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe triangle points further towards the beginning of the Dock.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appears to be triggered when a contextual menu would naturally be placed past the edge of the screen.  When the Dock is positioned on the bottom of the screen, the menu is only slightly misplaced.  On the left or the right, however, the menu appears to point two or three icons higher.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached screenshot of a right-positioned dock also shows another bug.  When the command key is pressed, causing the Trash's \"Securely Empty Trash\" menu item to appear, the menu expands, covering the Dock.  This happens regardless of the pinning of the Dock."
