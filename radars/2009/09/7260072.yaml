    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen machine(s) are sleeping at midnight local time, the iCal dock icon does not update to the new date.\r\nEven once machine comes out of sleep it still never updates.\r\n\r\nIf you open iCal the icon changes to the correct date, but once iCal is closed it goes back to the wrong date.\r\n\r\nIf this happens several days in a row, the iCal icon can show as being several days off.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious issue as everyone uses the iCal icon to quickly see the date, and this causes you to think it is the wrong date.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place your computer into sleep mode before midnight local time and leave say overnight\r\n2. Take computer out of sleep mode next morning and find the wrong date in the icon\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe computer should update the iCal icon when the computer comes out of sleep, to show the correct date.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe wrong date shows, and can end up many days incorrect if you continually go into sleep mode before midnight.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was a problem 10.5.1 but was then fixed until the release of 10.6 when the bug was reintroduced. 10.6.1 also contains the bug.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTemporary workarounds are waiting until 12:01am to put the computer into sleep mode, or to remove iCal from the dock and then add iCal back into the dock.\r\n\r\nI have included a screenshot showing the iCal icon and the systems date.\r\n\r\nThe old 10.5.1 version of this same issue was tracked under: radar://5532612\r\n\r\n'Screen shot 2009-09-28 at 8.40.09 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
