    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nThe \"Languages and Text\" pane of the system preference tool of Snow Leopard has a new search text field to allow the user to filter the content of the input method list. Snow Leopard do support many languages and the search field helps users to find the keyboard layout or input method they desire easily. But there is a bug to enable/disable an input method. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI suggest that you are now using only a keyboard layout and it is \"U.S\".\r\n\r\n1. Launch system preference and click on the \"Languages and Text\" pane.\r\n2. Click on the \"Input Source\" tab.\r\n3. Type a keyboard in the search field, such as \"German\". And then the list contains only \"German\" and \"Swiss German\". The checkboxes of them should both unchecked.\r\n4. Click on the checkbox of \"German\", then german keyboard is enabled.\r\n5. Click on the checkbox again, the checkbox is now unchecked.\r\n6. Click on the checkbox again, the checkbox should be checked, but it is not."
