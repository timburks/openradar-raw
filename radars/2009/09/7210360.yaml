    description: "09-Sep-2009 03:53 PM Timothy Hatch:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSpotlight has started to behave like quicksilver (only finding apps after they've been launched once) after I upgraded to Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Press the spotlight shortcut key\r\n2. Type \"grab\", \"podcast capture\", or some other app you haven't launched before\r\n3. Wait for the spotlight spinner to stop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n   The /Applications/Utilities/Grab.app to be in the results list, preferably the top result.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n   Grab.app isn't listed at all, even in the full results\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n   Worked in Tiger, and Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n   After launching the app once, it's found in the list and displayed as the top hit."
