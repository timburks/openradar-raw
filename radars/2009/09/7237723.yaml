    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"touch and hold\"  \"Save Image\" functionality in Safari on a GIF image, the image is saved to the Camera Roll as what appears to be a GIF file that has been renamed into a JPG. The image renders  horribly blurrily. It looks like a blown up verison of the thumbnail.\r\n\r\nAdditionally when synced with iPhoto. iPhoto shows a blank image in the place of its thumbnail. Upon import the image looks perfectly good.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a website that has a GIF image on it.  I used a banner ad (that happened to be a GIF) from http://thestar.com\r\n2. Touch and hold the image\r\n3. Choose Save Image.\r\n4. Go to Camera Roll and look at your saved image\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe saved image should look identical to the image you were viewing in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe saved image looks like a very blurry blown up thumbnail\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appeared* (See notes) to work fine in 3.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have included 4 images.  The image as saved by an iPhone running 3.0, the image as saved by an iPhone running 3.1, the image as saved by a Mac running Safari and a screen shot of iPhoto when importing from the 3.1 iPhone.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the image from the Mac you'll note it is a GIF and came as a .GIF file (I renamed all file names but preserved the original extensions). \r\n\r\nIf you look at the image from the 3.0 iPhone it is labeled a .JPG and actually is a .JPG. (You'll note it is actually 3 times bigger than the original GIF file. It seems like the iPhone tried to recompress it or otherwise transform it)\r\n\r\nIf you look at the image from the 3.1 iPhone you'll see that it has a .JPG extension but is actually a .GIF (and indeed is almost the exact same size as the original GIF). In this case it seems like the iPhone rather than recompressing, tried to preserve the original file but  somehow named it wrong or gave it incorrect type information.\r\n\r\nAll 3 of these files will render perfectly normally on a Mac, but the Camera app on the iPhone will not properly render the 3.1 image. Additionally as shown in the iPhoto screen shot, iPhoto can not properly display the thumbnail of these \"GIFs labeled as JPGs\" Althoguh once imported it can display them correctly.\r\n\r\nThis bug at first sounds similar to other bugs friends have complained about on 3.0 iPod touches (seemingly resolved in 3.1) but is actually a distinct bug and does not seem to effect saving of JPGs,  only of GIFs."
