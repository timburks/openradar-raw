    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating a ScreenShot (cmd-ctrl-shift-4) on a non hardware accelerated Monitor does not create a ScreenShot. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\nUse a Software like ScreenRecycler or attach a DisplayLink usb monitor adapter will create a non hardware accelerated Framebuffer. Everything works fine, but for making ScreenShots on such a display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould work just like it did in Tiger and Leopard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe crosshair appears, the clicking sound is made but no ScreenShot is created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards - Patrick Stein\r\n ---\r\nauthor of: ScreenRecycler, JollysFastVNC, SmartSleep, SmartSokoban and more."
