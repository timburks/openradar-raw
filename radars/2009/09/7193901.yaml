    description: "Summary:\r\nPackageMaker will save an empty <productname>-contents.xml file if the user never selects the product in the source list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a PackageMaker document.\r\n2. Don't select any of the products in the source list. You can select the overall entry or the choice(s) without triggering this bug.\r\n3. Save the document As.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPackageMaker saves an exact duplicate of the original document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPackageMaker does not initially load any information about the files to install. When you save, it doesn't have this information, so it doesn't save this information, so the <productname>-contents.xml file in the saved .pmdoc bundle is empty.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProbably in the last overhaul of PackageMaker.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you do select the product in the source list, then it does (finally) load information about the files to install, and saving will work correctly. It considers this a change and marks the document as dirty. That's a separate bug."
