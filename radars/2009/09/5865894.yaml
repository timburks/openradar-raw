    description: "15-Apr-2008 02:51 PM Claire Connelly:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nNumbers uses titles from header columns and rows to compose ``user friendly'' formulas.  If, however, you happen to have a quote in one of these fields, Numbers will use that value, but will create a formula that doesn't work.  The cell has a red triangle; hovering gets up a tool tip that reads ``The formula contains an invalid reference.''  (Copying it to a new cell gets you ``The formula contains a syntax error.'')\r\n\r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open a new Numbers spreadsheet with headers\r\n2. Create a spreadsheet that looks like the following (with the first row and column being headers):\r\n\r\n   Length   Number  Price    Total \r\n   3'            3              $1.95  formula\r\n\r\n3. In the Total column (cell marked formula), create a formula that multiples the Number field by the Price field. \r\n\r\n* RESULTS\r\nNumbers uses the column and row header names in the formula.  But the single quote (short for foot in my example) creates an error:``The formula contains an invalid reference.'' \r\n\r\n* REGRESSION\r\nSeems to be in both 1.02 (latest release) and the previous version.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nI will attach a spreadsheet demonstrating this issue.\r\n\r\nNote that this problem caused me to just use Excel, which doesn't use named columns/rows and worked fine.  My partner refused to believe my story about my experience, which led us to figuring out that the quote mark was the problem.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine if you delete Numbers's helpful suggestions and manually type the cell id (B9, A2, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n'quotes-in-headers.numbers.zip' was successfully uploaded"
