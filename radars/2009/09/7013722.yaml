    description: "27-Jun-2009 03:36 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe snippet given in the Core Data Snippets document for Fetching Attribute Values that Satisfy a Given Condition only applies to saved changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Window-based Application and Use Core Data for storage.\r\n2. Edit the data model to have an Entity \"Employee\" with an NSDecimal \"salary\" attribute.\r\n3. In -applicationDidFinishLaunching, create a new Employee and set its salary.\r\n4. Paste the snippet for Fetching Attribute Values that Satisfy a Given Condition.\r\n5. Modify the snippet to find the \"max:\" \"salary\" of an \"Employee\".\r\n6. NSLog(@\"%@\", requestedValue);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe salary set in step two.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(null)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSending the -save message to the Managed Object Context causes the snippet to work as expected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy unit tests don't use a persistent store, and this behavior was unexpected, especially since -includesPendingChanges defaults to YES.\r\n\r\n03-Jul-2009 09:34 PM:\r\nCommenting out the -save: call in the app delegate (and removing any previously saved stores) will demonstrate the issue."
