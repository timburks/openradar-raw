    description: "As discussed in this quartzcomposer-dev mailing list thread --- http://www.mail-archive.com/quartzcomposer-dev@lists.apple.com/msg03672.html --- it would be awesome if the Render In Image patch could provide an optional \"Depth Buffer Image\" output, which would provide per-pixel 3D depth information for the rendered image.\r\n\r\nThis would allow for a multitude of rendering tricks, such as Screen Space Ambient Occlusion and Depth of Field Simulation."
