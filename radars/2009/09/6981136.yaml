    description: Although iPhone OS 3 includes the ability to download videos from the iTunes Store, it appears that there is no way to begin watching the movie or TV show until it has completed downloading. Being able to steam from the iTunes store would greatly improve the usefulness of iTunes on iPhone and iPod touch.
