    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen you drag a photo from iPhoto to another application the file path provided does not always exist if the photo was from a shared iPhoto connection (DPAP).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Have shared iPhoto libraries on the network.\r\n1. Connect to a shared iPhoto library.\r\n2. Drag the photo into any program that accepts image drags (or right-click and attempt to Show File).\r\n3. Unless you have viewed the photo at full size, the photo does not exist at the provided path.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be given a path that works.  iPhoto should download the photos in the drag by the time the drag is completed (or shortly thereafter).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo only exists at the location if the photo has been viewed at full size or if the editor has been brought up.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm using this in a new application to upload photos to an online service.  For local photos it works fine, but remote photos require these little workarounds to make it work.  I can handle delayed downloads (just keep checking the path) but forcing the user to view every photo at full size is a little strange and they won't go for that."
