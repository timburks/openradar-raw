    description: "28-Sep-2009 01:38 PM Steven Fisher:\r\nSummary: \r\nInterface Builder's parsing of @property in .h files requires a particular order that Objective-C does not enforce. Developers will be left scratching their heads wondering why a property doesn't appear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a copy of CoreDataBooks.\r\n2. Open EditingViewController.h.\r\n3. Open EditingView.xib in Interface Builder.\r\n4. Remove the connection for textField from File's Owner (so we can simulate a developer doing the initial connection).\r\n5. Find the line:\r\n@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITextField *textField;\r\nReplace it with:\r\n@property IBOutlet (nonatomic, retain) UITextField *textField;\r\n6. Build the project in Xcode. Note that the project builds successfully.\r\n7. Open EditingView.xib in Interface Builder. Note that the textField connection no longer appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the project should generate a warning when building, or Interface Builder should detect the (admittedly mis-ordered) keywords.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject is built without warnings or errors, and Interface Builder does not detect the outlet (nor give any indication why).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile the keywords are intentionally mis-ordered in this case, it's easy enough to do this by accident."
