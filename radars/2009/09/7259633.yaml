    description: "28-Sep-2009 05:01 PM Claire Connelly:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nA new Snow Leopard machine can print to an HP DesignJet 1055cm printer just fine.  Installing Apple's HP Printer Driver update package (version 2.1 or 2.2) causes printing to fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get a fresh Snow Leopard machine without the printer driver updates package installed.  \r\n2. Install the printer-driver updates package.  \r\n3. Failures happen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDocuments should be printed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDocuments fail to print.  From Preview (printing a large PDF), a dialog appears reading\r\n\r\n   Print\r\n   Error while printing.\r\n\r\nConsole messages log has messages similar to\r\n\r\n9/28/09 4:47:03 PM\tPreview[209]\tPrinting failed because PMSessionEndDocumentNoDialog() returned -30870.\r\n\r\nIn the CUPS error log, messages similar to those in the attached log file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrinting worked before the update package came out; printing on a new machine works until the update package is installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDiscovered on my MacBook Pro, upgraded to Snow Leopard, then later upgraded with the HP printer driver package (2.1).  Replicated on a brand-new iMac with Snow Leopard preinstalled; printing worked until version 2.2 of the HP printer driver update package was installed.\r\n\r\nAttached are a System Profile report for the MacBook Pro and the iMac, CUPS error_log files from both machines, and a sample poster (in both PDF and PPT) that printed before the update and does not print after the update.\r\n\r\n(Note that I had also tried printing this document using its original PowerPoint file, which failed with similar messages.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'logs-sample-etc.zip' and 'system-profiles.zip' were successfully uploaded"
