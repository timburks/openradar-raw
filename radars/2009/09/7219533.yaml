    description: "Summary:\r\nRecipe files in a CoreUI .bundle all end with a .xml extension, even though they are binary property lists, and therefore should end with .plist, .bin, or no extension at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/UI.bundle/Contents/Recipes on Snow Leopard, or \x03/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/(AquaUI|LeopardUI).bundle/Contents/Recipes.\r\n2. Notice files ending with .xml in there.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe files ought to be in an XML-based format, or end with a different extension.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe files end with .xml, but aren't XML-based.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone. Same in 10.5 Leopard, which introduced CoreUI.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProperty Lists *can* be in an XML-based format, though this is less efficient."
