    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the phone is passcode-locked, it allows emergency calls, but dialing other numbers is blocked. However, Voice Control allows one to dial any number without providing the passcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Passcode Lock.\r\n2. Lock the phone.\r\n3. Hold down the Home key to activate Voice Control.\r\n4. Say \"Dial [any non-emergency phone number]\" or \"Call [contact name]\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone should refuse to make the call, or should prompt for the passcode (ideally via voice).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe call is placed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested prior to OS 3.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMost Voice Control users who passcode-lock their phones will probably want to be able to voice-dial from a locked phone without having to enter their passcode. However, this ability makes the emergency-numbers-only restriction moot. To  bring consistency, I suggest either removing the restriction or adding a voice prompt for the passcode when Voice Command is activated on a passcode-locked phone."
