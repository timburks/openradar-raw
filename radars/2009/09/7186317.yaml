    description: "01-Sep-2009 05:46 PM Lukhnos Liu:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn Snow Leopard, when Microsoft Excel 2004 runs with the Mac in dual-screen config (with USB keyboard attached), the WindowServer process often crashes and is killed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install Microsoft Office 2004 (Excel 2004) on a Snow Leopard 10A432 system\r\n2. Attach a secondary screen to the Mac, and attach a USB keyboard\r\n3. Start using Excel\r\n4. Suddenly, the entire login session is killed. Turns out that WindowServer crashes out of seg fault. Console log shows miserable stories.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExcel should not cause WindowServer to crash. This renders Excel 2004 unusable on Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash is frequent and unpredictable. Interestingly, this never occurs in single-screen mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nOn OS X 10.5 with the same configuration, it is noticed that keyboard is not responsible in Excel 2004 every now and then. When that happened, I had to move the mouse pointer outside of Excel, e.g. click on the Finder, then click on Excel to go back, then keyboard resumed responding. I wonder if this was because some system call raised exception."
