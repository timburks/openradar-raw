    description: "When emptying the Trash, there is a small panel that comes up, showing the percentage done via a bar, how many items are deleted, and a cancel button.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be reduced to the following:\r\n\r\nShow a spinning progress indicator over the Trash itself, with a number under it that indicates progress in percentage.\r\n\r\nThe progress indicator would be indeterminate while the process is beginning, and then determinate while the process is continuing.\r\n\r\nWhen hovered, there would be an X button over the middle (akin to the corner close buttons in Dashboard widgets). Clicking it would cancel the operation.\r\n\r\nThis would be a great improvement, for everyone. Everyone agrees. (Yes, I've asked everyone. They also said they like your software and wanted me to tell you thanks.)"
