    description: "Summary: \r\nPreview.app in Snow Leopard has removed the option to print without scaling, and recreating this behaviour with the remaining options is quite complex and requires 4 extra steps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a document in Preview.app, such as a PDF, of a known paper size.\r\n2. Select 'File' > 'Printâ€¦'\r\n3. Change the paper size to one where the default scale value with the default 'Scale to Fit:' 'Print Entire Image' is not 100%. This step is often unnecessary, as many documents will require reduction to include margins, even if the paper sizes match.\r\n4. Select 'Scale:'\r\n5. Select the scale % value.\r\n6. Delete the scale value.\r\n7. Input '100' in the scale value box using the keyboard.\r\n8. Press tab to avoid radar #7256827.\r\n9. Click 'Print'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClick on a single option to print at 100%, if by chance that wasn't the default option. This would have been one step.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoes what it says. Steps 4 through 8 are necessary to print at 100% in most cases.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behaviour was as expected in OS X 10.5.x and previous versions, or we wouldn't be having this discussion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPrinting at 100% is the only scaling that is common enough to warrant a button to make it an easy one to get to. Preview.app itself even has an 'Actual Size' toolbar button, but has removed this function for printing.\r\nGraphic designers (and other professionals) or specific applications (such as printing on pre-cut or pre-printed paper, labels, or DVDs) can commonly require printing at 100%, and using PDF to distribute documents makes Preview.app the most logical choice for many printing jobs.\r\nHaving something other than 100% as a default can cause expensive media to be ruined by a mis-scaled printout, unless these 4 (+1) steps are followed every time.\r\nMost other apps, including Safari, Mail.app and TextEdit default to no scaling, making Preview.app an exception."
