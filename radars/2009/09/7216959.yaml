    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac OS X 10.6 source release at http://opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-106/ includes the ld64 project at version 95.2.12, but it cannot be built due to a missing dependency on libunwind, the sources for which do not appear to be available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fetch http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/ld64/ld64-95.2.12.tar.gz.\r\n2. Try to build it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to build ld64 as distributed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDue to missing headers from libunwind, ld64 cannot be built as is.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHaven't tried, but cf. Notes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCf. e.g. http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/ld64-95.2.12/src/ld/MachOReaderRelocatable.hpp, with some of its includes:\r\n\r\n#include <libunwind/DwarfInstructions.hpp>\r\n#include <libunwind/AddressSpace.hpp>\r\n#include <libunwind/Registers.hpp>\r\n\r\n10.5.8's ld64 doesn't appear to require libunwind: http://opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/ld64-77.1/src/MachOReaderRelocatable.hpp"
