    description: "01-Sep-2009 06:06 PM Evan Schoenberg:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen opening an HID device, kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice does not work in 10.6, while it did work in previous versions of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain the IOHIDDeviceDeviceInterface corresponding to the kIOHIDDeviceDeviceInterfaceID interface for kIOHIDDeviceTypeID plugin of the \"AppleIRController\" IOService.\r\n2. Open it with the kIOHIDOptionsTypeSeizeDevice option.\r\n3. Add elements to its IOHIDDeviceQueueInterface and schedule its event source in the run loop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly your application receives the events.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelivered events (e.g. 'volume up' on the Apple remote) are delivered both to your application and to the system, causing response by Finder or the nearest active Apple application (so, Finder performs volume up).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways in Mac OS X 10.6 10A432. I was not part of the beta process so do not know when this appeared during 10.6 beta, if it didn't appear from the beginning.\r\nNever in Mac OS X 10.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can provide sample code for this if desired; putting it together out of my larger project is non-trivial, so I didn't want to submit it unless it was needed."
