    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nZhuyin input method is one of the built-in Traditional Chinese input methods, which uses phonetic symbols (as known as \"Bopomofo\") as radicals to input Traditional Chinese text. it is the most popular way to input Chinese text in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS X 10.6, uses can decide to enable or disable some extra dictionaries to customize the Zhuyin input method to satisfy their need. However, if the \"Physics and Chemistry\" dictionary above them is enabled, the input method behaves weird and users can no longer to input Chinese text as they expect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable the Zhuyin input method by using the \"Language and Text\" pane of the system preference utility.\r\n\r\n2. Launch a text editor, such as \"TextEdit.app\", switch to Zhuyin input method by using the input menu.\r\n\r\n3. Try to type something, such as \"5j/ jp6gj bj4z83\", the result should be \"中文輸入法\", the Chinese text means \"Chinese input method\".\r\n\r\n4. Open the preference window of the Traditional Chinese input method. Click on the \"Preferences\" menu item of the input menu.\r\n\r\n5. Click on the latest tab \"Dictionaries\", check \"Physics and Chemistry\".\r\n\r\n6. Try to type \"5j/ jp6gj bj4z83\" again, the result becomes something like \" ˊ ˋˇ\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter the dictionary is enabled, \"5j/ jp6gj bj4z83\" will be radicals as \"ㄓㄨㄥ ㄨㄣˊ ㄕㄨ ㄖㄨˋ ㄈㄚˇ\" in the input buffer area first, and then become the final correct result \"中文輸入法\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Chinese characters could not be composed, what is sent to the text editor is some Bopomofo symbols which represents tones only.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe screenshot of the input method preference is attached."
