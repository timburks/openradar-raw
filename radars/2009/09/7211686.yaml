    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari on the iPhone, the only way of playing an HTML5 audio element is to enter the fullscreen quicktime playback.  There appears to be no way of using javascript to allow users to play audio while still viewing the webpage.  We'd love to be able to enhance http://audioboo.fm for a better experience on the iPhone, but can't while this restriction is in place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  var audio = new Audio('http://boos.audioboo.fm/attachments/17171/Recording.mp3');\r\n  audio.play();\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio starts playing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens"
