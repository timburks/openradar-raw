    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a behavior mismatch in Finder between icon view and column or list views. In icon view, a cmd-click will select a file on mouse-down and deselect a file on mouse-up. In list and column views, both selection and deselection happen on mouse-down. This can lead to unexpected behavior when a user has selected a set of files (using cmd-click) and then goes to drag them to a new destination while still holding down the cmd key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a Finder window in column view\r\n2. Use cmd-click to select a few files\r\n3. While still holding down the command key, grab one of the selected files in order to drag the selected files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the selected files will be dragged, as happens in icon view or on the desktop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe clicked file is immediately deselected, and the drag then only applies to the newly-deselected file. The rest of the selected files remain in their previous location.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nFinder works as expected on 10.5.8. This is a new issue in Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCmd-dragging is usually identical to dragging with no modifier key pressed, so in most cases, a simple workaround is to release the command key before dragging. However, I suspect this is an issue with NSTableView (or possibly NSMatrix), and some third-party applications may override the standard behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, Adium 1.3 allows users to display the contact list as a borderless window. Since there is no frame, users move this borderless window by simply dragging it. In order to select multiple contacts and/or drag them into new groups, Adium users hold down the command key to override the default window-dragging behavior. Hence, the ability to cmd-drag is important. (The Adium contact list is a subclass of NSOutlineView, but when the command-key is pressed mouse events are handled by NSOutlineView instead of the custom window-moving behavior.)"
