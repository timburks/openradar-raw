    description: "Summary: access to the calendar framework is not supported currently, but should be, as is access to the addressbook framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: n/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results: it would be nice if both read and write access to the calendar store were implemented, as a new class of productivity apps could make use of the user's calendar data.  at the very least, read access would be useful.\r\n\r\nActual Results: the calendar framework is currently not a public framework.\r\n\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\nNotes: it would be nice to know if this is in the pipeline for a future SDK release, or if Apple is unwilling to implement this."
