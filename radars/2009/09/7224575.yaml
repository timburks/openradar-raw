    description: "Summary:\r\nThis bug has been annoying me for years.\r\nWhen you configure a VPN account, and add a domain to VPN on Demand, it doesn't work by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Open Network pref pane\r\n2) Click the plus button\r\n3) select Interface: VPN\r\n4) Leave the other options as they are.\r\nYou will now have a blank VPN with a configuration named \"Default\", which you can neither delete nor rename.\r\n5) Fill in the server name, account.\r\n6) Use \"password\" and \"shared secret\" to log in. Leave group blank.\r\n7) Click the Advancedâ€¦ button\r\n8) Click the VPN on Demand tab\r\n9) Click the plus button.\r\n10) Enter a custom domain you want to be routed through the VPN. Make this domain connect via the Default configuration.\r\n11) Click the excessive amounts of OK, Save and Apply buttons that appear, before you are allowed to quit.\r\n12) Switch to Safari.\r\n13) Enter the domain you used in step 10 into the address bar (or a subdomain thereof)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe VPN would connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The DNS lookup fails.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nBetween steps 4 and 5, if you create a custom configuration, then use that in step 10, everything works as expected."
