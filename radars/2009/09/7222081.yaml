    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a program creates an NSOpenPanel and calls setResolvesAliases:YES on that open panel, it's in a state where if a shared directory is picked, at that time or a few more times through the picking of a directory a crash will happen when the panel closes.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the test program attached to this bug\r\n2. Turn on file sharing and share a directory with access for everyone (we found it by sharing the desktop, I'm not sure if that is key).\r\n3. Click on the path control in the window, and pick the shared directory. The test app should crash. \r\n4. If it doesn't crash, keep clicking on the path control and choosing other directories. It should crash within 5 times of repeating this.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- doesn't crash\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n- crashes\r\n\r\nRegression\r\n- happens in both 10.6.0 and 10.6.1\r\n- It looks like other Cocoa apps are affected (Safari crashed on me attempting to attach the crash log, while Firefox didn't).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n Workaround: not calling setResolvesAliases: YES causes the crash to go away."
