    description: "Snow Leopard comes with Heiti TC (“Hei TC”), a traditional Chinese typeface that replaced LiHei Pro.\r\n\r\nIt has a number of errors, inconsistencies and imbalances, voiding professional use.\r\n\r\niPhone OS 3.× also comes with this erroneous typeface.\r\n\r\nWe ask Apple to rework the typeface so that it adheres to the high standards that Apple represents.\r\n\r\nhttp://fixhei.monoceroi.com/"
