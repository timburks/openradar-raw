    description: "Summary: \r\niTunes 9 fixed a crucial user experience bug, where clicking the green zoom button in the main iTunes window opened a mini player. This was the correct fix, as the behavior is not expected, nor is it consistent with the behavior of other windows throughout the Mac OS. iTunes 9.0.1 appears to have reintroduced this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes.\r\n2. Click the zoom button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window will expand to fill either the content in the window, or the available size on the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window disappears and is replaced with the mini player. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niTunes 9.0 fixed this issue. All other versions of iTunes, dating back to iTunes 1.0, are affected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
