    description: "04-Sep-2009 03:27 AM Andrew Lee:\r\nSummary: \r\nExtract a method name from selected text and put it in the pasteboard\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Objective-C file in Xcode.\r\n2. Enter either a method declaration like either:\r\n\r\n- (void)putBook:(NSString *)theBookName\r\n      inSection:(NSString *)theSectionName\r\n      ofLibrary:(NSString *)theLibraryName\r\n         inCity:(NSString *)theCityName;\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n[masterLibrarian putBook:@\"The Dark Knight\"\r\n               inSection:@\"Graphic Novels\"\r\n               ofLibrary:@\"Mid-Manhattan Branch\"\r\n                  inCity:@\"New York City\"];\r\n\r\n3. Select the four lines of the method declaration or method invocation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like a variation of the Copy command that puts just the method name into my pasteboard, and not the whole declaration.  In the example above, this would be putBook:inSection:ofLibrary:inCity:.  This would allow me to paste the method name into, say, a HeaderDoc comment or other documentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is currently not possible.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAdd to Problem Details\r\n\r\n\r\n04-Sep-2009 03:40 AM Andrew Lee:\r\nP.S.  It would be handy if Xcode could provide this as a Service so I could do this method-name-copying in any application.\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Sep-2009 08:39 PM:\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nPlease create user script as depicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Sep-2009 07:55 PM Andrew Lee:\r\nSorry, I don't understand the request -- what is meant by \"user script,\" and how do I create one?\r\n\r\n\r\n29-Sep-2009 05:11 PM:\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nUsing the menu command: Scripts -> Edit User Scripts.... There is documentation on them."
