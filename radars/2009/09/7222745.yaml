    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an 8-core (2x 2.26GHz Quad Core Xeon) Mac Pro from June, 2009 with two NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 cards and two 24\" LED Cinema Displays. When I go into System Preferences -> Displays, the brightness slider on both windows that come up control the right display only. I therefore can't adjust the brightness of my left display.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Acquire a recent Mac Pro with the configuration outlined in the Summary.\r\n2. Open up System Preferences and go into Displays.\r\n3. Try to adjust the brightness of each individual display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach Brightness slider should control the brightness of the display on which it is shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth Brightness sliders control the brightness on only one display.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
