    description: "13-Nov-2008 04:54 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nThe example code on http://developer.apple.com/opensource/cflite.html does not build.\r\n\r\n1.  The initial problem is that you cannot build CFLite (CF-299 through CF-476.15) under Windows.  (See separate bug rdar://6370058).\r\n2.  Assuming a user works hard enough to get CFLite built under Cygwin, the example program will not build because it uses the CFWriteStream object, but this is not included in as of CF-299.  It does appear to be present in newer versions.\r\n\r\n17-Nov-2008 04:36 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nNote:  The example does appear to build and run properly using CoreFoundation (CF-Lite) version 476.15.  It probably works for several earlier versions as well -- just not the 299 version documented on the \"http://developer.apple.com/opensource/cflite.html\" web page."
