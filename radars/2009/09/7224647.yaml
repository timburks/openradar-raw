    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I create a VPN account, I expect passwords and shared secrets for this account which are already in my keychain to be picked up and used.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Create a VPN account on one machine.\r\n2) Synch your keychain with mobile me.\r\n3) On a second machine, merge in the keychain from the first machine with another synch.\r\n4) Create a new VPN account with the same server and username as the first one.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe network pref pane would realise that they are the same account, and use the password and shared secret already in the keychain.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nI have to open Keychain access, find the shared secret, enter my password so I can read it, then go back to the Network pref pane and paste it. Doing so then creates a new entry in my login keychain for my password and the shared secret, duplicating the ones that have just been synched from the first machine."
