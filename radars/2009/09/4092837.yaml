    description: "Summary: \r\nThe Text-to-Speech manager can't read IPA, even though by it's nature it doesn't need any special processing, all the phonetic values are given in the letters!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1) Write something using IPA, e.g. http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usor:Nickshanks/IPA\r\n2) Select the text\r\n3) Go to the Speech service menu and start speaking the text\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nI would hear accurate representation of what I had written being rendered by the speech synthesizer.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nOnly ASCII characters were read out, thus i heard a long stream of \"a th e g f bl t e p\" instead of words. Not yet tested in 10.4."
