    description: "Summary:\r\nSelecting an installable product in the source list of a PackageMaker document causes PackageMaker to increase the document's change count, marking it as dirty if it wasn't already.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a PackageMaker document.\r\n2. Expand any choice.\r\n3. Select any of the products under that choice.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document's change count is unaffected, because you haven't changed anything.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPackageMaker does something that it considers a change, incrementing the change count, so the document becomes dirty.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProbably in the last overhaul of PackageMaker.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCounterpart to x-radar://problem/7193901, which is what happens if you *don't* select a product and then you save."
