    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen exporting a sequence using the ProRes 422 720p 25 preset from FCP7, the resulting file will playback at 1280x720 in QT 7, but will be cropped to 1248×702 in QTX, regardless of QT7's \"Conform Aperture to...\" setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new sequence\r\n2. load sequence preset ProRes 422 720p 25\r\n3. Add any media to sequence\r\n4. Export sequence to Self-Contained .mov\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFCS7 should set the size to \"1280x720\".\r\nQTX Player should display the file at 1280x720\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFCS7 sets the size to \"1280x720 (1248x702)\"\r\nQTX Player crops the video to 1248×702\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nQT7 Player at least respects the \"Conform Aperture to...\" setting in the .mov, but QTX does not.\r\nFiles exported from FCP6.x do not contain the faulty 1248x702 metadata\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis breaks my workflow. I need to go back to FCP6 to continue working.\r\nThis might be also applicable for other Sequence dimensions, such as 1080i, but I didnt test.\r\n\r\n\r\n'qt7.png' was successfully uploaded"
