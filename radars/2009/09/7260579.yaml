    description: "29-Sep-2009 12:44 PM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen double clicking on a photo in iPhoto, you are not moved into Editing mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an album in iPhoto 09\r\n2. Double click on a photo \r\n3. Look for editing controls for cropping, enhance, red eye, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto switched to Editing mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhoto is expanded to fill the pane, controls on toolbar are restricted to subset of those available for the whole album.  There is absolutely nothing you can do with the picture that you could not have done before double clicking.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDouble clicking a photo in iPhoto 06 switched to Editing mode, presenting controls for cropping, enhance, red eye removal, colour adjument etc.  This has become a two step (double click, then hit edit) process in iPhoto 09.  Alternatively you can hit the edit button, but this takes away the double click behaviour of iPhoto 06\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhilst it is clearly a design decision, it is a poor one.  Double clicking in iPhoto 09 simply removes some of the controls in the toolbar, but doesn't give any new ones.  Worse still, clicking the photo again unzooms the photo and returns you to the album.  Nowhere in any computing interface on the Mac, iPhone or elsewhere does clicking an item effectively close it.  This is a completely backwards user interaction and big step backwards in usability in iPhoto 09 over 06.  After 8-9 months of using iPhoto 09, this is not something I have got used to, but simply found increasingly frustrating."
