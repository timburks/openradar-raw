    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the user's Home folder is on another volume, and the user tells Installer to install to his Home folder, Installer attempts to install to the base of that volume, not the actual Home folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Installer package configured to only install to the Home folder (e.g., that of GrowlMail).\r\n2. Install.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstaller installs to the user's Home folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the user does not have write access to the root of the volume that houses the user's Home folder, the installation will fail. If the user does have such write access, the installation will succeed, but in the wrong place, as Installer will install the files to the base of that volume, not to the user's Home folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. This worked in Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy Home folder is /Volumes/Home-etc/Users/prh.\r\nInstaller should install GrowlMail to /Volumes/Home-etc/Users/prh/Library/Mail/Bundles.\r\nInstaller instead installs GrowlMail to /Volumes/Home-etc/Library/Mail/Bundles. Note that that is not within my Home folder (Installer creates a Library alongside Users).\r\n\r\nAdded 2009-09-10T23:09-0700:\r\nNot a regression from Leopard after all. Leopard's installer says “The Installer could not create the folder “/Volumes/Home-etc/Library/Mail/Bundles”.” At least Leopard's error message was clearer."
