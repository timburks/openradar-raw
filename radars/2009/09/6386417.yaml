    description: "9-Nov-2008 03:16 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nThe CF-Lite sources contain varying levels of cross-platform support.  An examination of CF-Lite sources from the 299.0 release through the 476.15 release show that Linux and Windows specific routines are present for many library functions.  Sometimes Windows functionality that was present in one release (e.g., CF-299) has been stripped out, or in other cases simple \"#if defined(__WIN32__)\" is replaced with \"#if 0\".\r\n\r\nI request that the Open Source distribution of the CF-Lite routines always include the WIndows support logic.  These implementations generally exist in the wild (i.e., if you look at CF-299 sources you can retrieve some of the missing functionality), and don't seem to contain any sensitive Apple-specific logic.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that leaving the Windows and Linux support logic in place would also require less work on your part in producing the Open Source tarball of the sources.\r\n\r\nPlease modify the source distribution process to include the Windows logic!"
