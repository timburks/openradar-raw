    description: "09-Sep-2009 09:33 PM Neil Lee:\r\nWith the grid view and iTunes store backgrounds now defaulting to white in iTunes 9, it now makes working with album art in those views literally painful - I'm getting a headache from the harsh contrast.\r\n\r\nThe iTunes 8 grid background colour was much less glaring and more usable, especially over long periods of time. Could iTunes 9's background colours be reverted back to the iTunes 8?\r\n\r\n(I'm 100% for UI evolution and change, but notwithstanding the aesthetic issues of the new white background, it's just not that usable.)"
