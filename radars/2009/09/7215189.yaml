    description: "When completing methods that take blocks, for example NSArray's enumerateUsingBlock:, it would be great if Xcode's completion would fill in the block template for you.  It's a bit of a pain to type in the ^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) every time.  Also, I don't always remember the number, type, and order of parameters needed for the block (even though it was just on screen a second ago).\r\n\r\nAttaching two screenshots of what completion does now, and what it should ideally do.  Ideally, it would even add the block start, \"^{\", and end, \"}];]\", and place my cursor on the correct line, as in the after_completion_ideal.png screen shot.\r\n\r\n25-Sep-2009 02:34 PM:\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nStarting from the state shown in after_completion_now.png, pressing return will result in the state shown in after_completion_ideal.png."
