    description: "Summary: \r\nOpening a folder on your Desktop set to column view, and selecting-all, selects one level up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a folder on your desktop containing a few items. Set that folder to open in column view.\r\n2. Open up said folder.\r\n3. Hit cmd-a to Select All.\r\n4. Notice that it doesn't select the items in the folder - it selects all the items on your Desktop instead, which is one level up from where it should be selecting.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the items in the folder that I *opened* to be selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActually the items on the Desktop, one level up from where I wanted to operate, were selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOS X 10.5.8 & lower."
