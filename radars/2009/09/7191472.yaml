    description: "02-Sep-2009 09:41 PM Guillaume Rischard:\r\nSummary:  There is no way to determine a tab's activity or inactivity without activating it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open a new terminal window, then another tab. In the new tab, type sleep 5 && echo Hello. Immediately switch back to the first tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: After five seconds, the second tab's label displays some indicator of activity. After some more time, the label displays some indicator of inactivity.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No change in the appearance of the other tab's label.\r\n\r\nRegression: None.\r\n\r\nNotes: A small symbol could be added next to the text, or the colour of the tabs or the text within them could change - red is hot, blue is cold."
