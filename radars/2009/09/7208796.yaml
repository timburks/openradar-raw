    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWith windows minimized or an app hidden the UI does not get updated such as when locking the keychain from the Keychain Access menu extra so Dock Expose can expose sensitive information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Enable menu bar access to Keychain Access at Keychain Access > Preferences > General.\r\n2) Bring up an entry's info window, check \"Show Password,\" and enter your password if prompted to reveal the sensitive information.\r\n3) Hide Keychain Access by choosing Keychain Access > Hide Keychain Access from the menu bar or pressing cmd+H\r\n4) Click the Keychain Access menu extra and choose Lock All Keychains.\r\n5) Click and hold on Keychain Access icon in the Dock to bring up Dock Expose.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDock Expose displays the UI that reflects the user's \"Lock All Keychains\" selection\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDock Expose displays the UI as it was last seen, including secure contents.\r\n\r\nOther Notes: Clicking the Keychain Access icon to activate Keychain Access correctly shows that the keychain is locked. This appears related to lazy drawing of the UI when the app is hidden or the window is minimized. I've used Keychain Access as the example application, but this also applies to other applications where sensitive data might be stored."
