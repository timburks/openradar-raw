    description: "Summary:\r\nProperty List Editor always shows NSSupportsSuddenTermination by its raw name, not under a localized name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Info.plist file in either Xcode's Property List Editor or the separate Property List Editor application.\r\n2. If the file does not already contain a NSSupportsSuddenTermination pair, turn on “Show Raw Keys/Values”, then add a row with NSSupportsSuddenTermination as the key.\r\n3. Make sure “Show Raw Keys/Values” is turned off.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSSupportsSuddenTermination row shows under a localized name, such as “Supports sudden termination” in English.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe row always shows under the raw name “NSSupportsSuddenTermination”, even if “Show Raw Keys/Values” is turned off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis wasn't a problem before NSSupportsSuddenTermination was a valid key.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile it does not show a localized name with “Show Raw Keys/Values” off, it does correctly identify the key as having a Boolean value, and present a checkbox in the Value column."
