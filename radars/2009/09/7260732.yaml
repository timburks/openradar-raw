    description: "29-Sep-2009 02:51 PM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nRed Eye removal in iPhoto 09 is harder to use than iPhoto 06\r\n\r\nAuto Process in iPhoto 06\r\n1. Select a photo, double click to edit\r\n2. Click on Red Eye Removal button\r\n3. Click in centre of each eye to be removed\r\n\r\nAuto process in iPhoto 09\r\n1. Select a photo, click on Edit button\r\n2. Click on Red Eye removal button\r\n3. Click on Auto in Red Eye HUD\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the auto process in '09 works well and requires fewer steps.\r\n\r\nManual Process in iPhoto 06\r\n1. Select a photo, double click to Edit\r\n2. Select area around an eye\r\n3. Click on Red Eye removal button\r\n4. repeat steps 2 & 3 for each eye\r\n\r\nManual Process in iPhoto 09\r\n1. Select a photo, click on Edit button\r\n2. Adjust size of red eye tool\r\n3. Click on eye\r\n4. Repeat steps 2 & r for each eye.\r\n\r\nThe key differences in the manual process are:\r\n- Adjusting the size in the Red Eye HUD is hard to gauge as it is positioned away from each eye.  Selecting around the eye in iPhoto 06 meant that you always got the size right\r\n- When selecting an area in iPhoto 06, there was effective red edge detection within the selected area, so only the red part got blackened. In iPhoto 06, using wider area was only an issue if the person had a reddish eyelid.\r\n- In iPhoto 09, the entire area under the red eye tool gets blackened to some extent, so you have to use a precisely sized area, accurately targeted at the centre of the eye. Which given the difficulty of selecting the correct size given the relative placement of the HUD & eyes in the photo, is very difficult to do\r\n- Using red eye reduction on a selected area with no red in it in 06 leaves the photo unchanged, in 09 you will always get a dark grey circle.\r\n- Using the size set to zero in 09 gives better (06-like) results than setting a size\r\n\r\n- Red Eye HUD floats over all windows and is visible even when switched to another app."
