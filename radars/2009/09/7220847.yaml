    description: "Summary:\r\nSomeone at Apple is making changes to /private/etc/openldap/schema/apple.schema without updating the version/timestamp at the top of the file. This makes it difficult to know when schema changes occur during the beta periods and if/when a schema change occurs during a point update. Files in /private/etc/openldap/schema/ have to be diffed manually during each OS revision to know for sure. When adding apple.schema to other directory systems (e.g., Active Directory) it's important to know when Apple makes changes to this file so we can evaluate whether we need to make the same change our directory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a 10.5.8 system, note the first line of /private/etc/openldap/schema/apple.schema.\r\n2. On a 10.6.1 system, note the first line of /private/etc/openldap/schema/apple.schema.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThey should be different since there are significant changes to the schema since 10.5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth files show\r\n\r\n#ident $Id: apple.schema,v 1.44.2.2 2006/06/01 02:27:03 sjones Exp $\r\n\r\nAccording to this line, the files should be identical. They are not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this line is no longer going to be updated, please remove it. Otherwise, please update it when changes are made.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThis issue has been addressed in Mac OS X Lion Developer PreviewÂ Build 11A390."
