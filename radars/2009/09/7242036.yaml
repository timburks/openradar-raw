    description: "When tabbing into a name field and typing quickly, iPhoto drops the first few characters typed -- I have to pause a few seconds, wait for the cursor to update, then type. This is on a 2.4GHz/4gb MBP.\r\n\r\nIn full-screen editing with the Info box's title area active, Command-Left/Right does not switch photos. I have to hit Return to get out of editing the title before I can change photos. This is an unnecessary step per photo, and not required when editing in the main iPhoto window.\r\n\r\nWhen typing into a text field, I cannot dismiss other face boxes. I have to hit Return or click the background to get out of typing mode first, then point at the box, and finally click the x.\r\n\r\nWhen editing faces, the Tab key should first move to faces that just need confirmation, then unnamed faces, and finally to named faces (so they can be edited if necessary).\r\n\r\nIn Confirm Names and other views, it should be easy to restrict the set of photos to recent (n months, perhaps taken from the Last n months album setting), and/or photos with edited titles (since untitled photos are more likely to be junk and not worth reviewing faces on).\r\n\r\nIn the Check/X boxes to confirm a name, Space should work, as it normally triggers buttons, rather than requiring Return.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at an album or set of photos, I should be able to search by presence or absence of a face."
