    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWestern Digital WD5000BEVT and Seagate Momentus 5400.6 (ST9500325) almost unusable with my MacBook Pro with the current EFI firmware (1.7)\r\n\r\nStep to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Replace the stock HDD with a WD5000BEVT or ST9500325\r\n2. It's usable, but there is serious performance hit—e.g. the system often halts for no reason, disk reading can be extremely slow sometimes\r\n3. Seagate Momentus actually has a jumper setting to make the HDD operate in 1.5 Gbps mode. Add the jumper and the situation worsens—beachball can be seen every 1-3 mintues, each time the wait can be up to 10-20 secs. This makes daily work impossible (mine involves Mail, Xcode, VMware Fusion, the latter two admittedly among some heavy HDD crunchers)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo noticeable performance drop with 3rd-party HDDs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSerious performance drop that renders the system very unusable. I had to revert back to the stock HDD.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease take some time to go through this discussion thread:\r\n\r\n  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2054387&start=0&tstart=15\r\n\r\nApparently it's a large-scale problem involving so many MacBook Pros."
