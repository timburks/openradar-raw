    description: "When copying the image representation of the UIImage of a file taken from the camera or from the Photo library, all metadata is deleted except for width and height.\r\n\r\nMetadata is part of a photo. It is not a different information. A photo should never be without its metadata. \r\n\r\nPlease read the strong case made by James Duncan Davidson (Tomcat developer, Rails Developer and Mac lover), now a professional photographer, here: \r\nhttp://blog.duncandavidson.com/2008/04/flickr-strips-copyright-metada.html\r\nhttp://twitter.com/duncan/status/3610708620\r\n\r\nYou can also read the recommendations from the IPTC metata group :\r\n\r\nWhile the image data is the most important part, IPTC metadata provide essential informationfor creating an image management system and workflow. Its use for ownership, copyright,billing and archiving, search and retrieval purposes is undisputed. IPTC metadata brings orderto a chaotic flood of pictures.Camera Exif technical metadata is emerging in a similar way as the means to raise the qualityof pictures and the speed of processing to new levels – two functions that newspapers andmagazines cannot afford to ignore. Exif metadata is the key to the correct handling of anyJPEG compression and decompression process, picture orientation and colour management.While automatic post-camera image enhancements are mostly the result of powerful imageanalysis and enhancement software, Exif metadata can be used to supplement or controlabsolute or enhanced colour changes, preserve skin tones, regulate sharpness, contrast, white balance and tone reproduction or a reduction in image ”noise.” Some software companies areusing Exif metadata to fine tune images and to add Exif metadata that can be useful later forother software applications.\r\n\r\nTaken from http://www.iptc.org/goto/?phmdwp2007   2007 IPTC standards. \r\n\r\nThe fact that all metadata is stripped is even more astonishing when the image taken is directly coming from the camera of the iPhone , without the photo library thing."
