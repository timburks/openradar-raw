    description: "When I call reloadSlideshowItemAtIndex on my IKSlideshow instance, I expect the delegate method slideshowItemAtIndex to be called again to refresh the data and redisplay the current image (say, if I have a thumb and am downloading the full-size image, I want to update the display).\r\n\r\nHowever, no matter what kind of data I return (NSImage, NSString, NSURL have been tried), the slideshow does not re-request the data when reloadSlideshowItemAtIndex or reloadData are called.\r\n\r\n02-Sep-2009 02:00 PM \r\nThis behavior has changed in 10.6.  Now NOTHING is called when I call reloadData, not even the datasource method to get the count of items, as 10.5 did.\r\n\r\nWhat's going on?"
