    description: "09-Sep-2009 02:14 PM Joshua Emmons:\r\nStarting with iTunes 9, there is no way to enter Mini Player mode without using the keyboard (option-click on the green glob, command-shift-M) or menu (View->Switch to Mini Player). Considering the number of times users jump back and forth between the Mini Player and Full iTunes vs. the number of times users resize the Full iTunes window (the new functionality of the green glob) this was clearly the wrong trade-off to make.\r\n\r\nPlease restore the old functionality of the green glob or add a new button to the Full iTunes interface for switching to Mini Player mode."
