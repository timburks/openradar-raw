    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen sorting the Music Library via \"Album by Year\", the tracks on multi-disc albums are interleaved. That is, instead of \"d1t1, d1t2, d2t1, d2t2\", iTunes will sort the tracks as \"d1t1, d2t1, d1t2, d2t2\". The same interleaving occurs when sorting via \"Album by Artist\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nImport a multi-disc album into iTunes. Ensure that discs and tracks are correctly tagged. Sort the Music Library via \"Album by Year\" or \"Album by Artist\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tracks of the albums first disc will be presented in sequential order, followed by the tracks of the second disc, also in sequential order. I.e. \"d1t1, d1t2, d2t1, d2t2\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tracks of both discs are presented interleaved. I.e. \"d1t1, d2t1, d1t2, d2t2\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem occurs in iTunes 9.0.  It does not occur in previous versions of iTunes."
