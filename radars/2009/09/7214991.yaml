    description: "Summary: \r\nWhenever you try to install a Mac OS X application package via Installer while the iPhone Simulator is running the Installer will stall for no reason.  It wont fail or provide an error message, it will just sit there waiting with the user not knowning what is going on.  Once you quit the iPhone Simulator then Installer will resume and in most cases fail.   \r\n\r\nThis also effects System Update when installing updates in some cases.  That's harder to test reproducable effects due to the lack of an easy triggerable System Update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start iPhone Configuration Utility\r\n2. Open a .pkg or .mpkg file to trigger Installer to launch to install the application.\r\n3. Continue through to the copy files phase\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect iPhone Simulator running not to interfere with the installng of Mac OS packages via Installer, packages should install with no issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstaller will never finish, it will just sit hanging there.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've tested this on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.6.1, don't have a Tiger or Leopard machine on hand to test it on.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone at this time, nothing was noticable or unique to this happening on the Console so no log is attached."
