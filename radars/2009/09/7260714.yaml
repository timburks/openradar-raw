    description: "29-Sep-2009 02:20 PM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWhen an image that has been cropped is cropped again, the original, full image appears, loosing detail of large resolution images, making it harder to precisely crop.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Select an photo in iPhoto\r\n2. Click Edit\r\n3. Click Crop\r\n4. Hit Apply\r\n5. Hit Crop Again\r\n\r\nExpected results\r\n\r\nCropped image remains in place, with new cropping rectangle set within it, with \r\n\r\nActual results\r\n\r\nImage zooms out to original, uncropped image, with cropping rectangle placed where first crop was done.\r\n\r\nRegression\r\n\r\nIn iPhoto 06, did not have to hit crop before selecting area to crop. This was simpler and easier. \r\n\r\nNotes.\r\n- It is in very, very rare case that I and I suspect most users will find they have cropped too tightly.  Instead it is more likely that you want to crop more tightly.  Therefore zooming out to the original, uncropped image is counter productive. \r\n- In particular on an image that has a greater resolution than the image pane of iPhoto, zooming out looses detail and prevents you from \r\n- The only other option is to zoom in the image, but it is difficult to zoom to the previous area cropped.\r\n- Adjusting the crop area stops you from seeing the area that you originally cropped, so it becomes easy to move the crop area outside the original cropping bounds, which is not what was intended.  When the image stayed cropped in iPhoto 06, you knew you would not include more of the photo by accident. \r\n\r\n- In '06 I could do a quick rough crop and then fine tune.  Process in 06:\r\n1. Select Area\r\n2. Hit Crop\r\n3. Select smaller area\r\n4. Hit Crop.\r\n\r\nIn iPhoto 09:\r\n1. Hit Crop\r\n2. Move HUD\r\n3. Adjust Crop rectangle\r\n4. Hit Apply\r\n5. Hit Crop\r\n6. Move HUD again\r\n7. Move Navigation Window\r\n8. Zoom back to area previously cropped to\r\n9. Adjust crop rectangle\r\n10 Hit Apply.\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue of images cropped too tightly in iPhoto 06, the process would be:\r\n1. Select Area\r\n2. Hit Crop\r\n3. Select Revert To Original\r\n4. Select Area\r\n5. Hit Crop\r\n\r\nIn iPhoto 09, the process is:\r\n1. Hit Crop\r\n2. Adjust Crop Area\r\n3. Hit Apply\r\n4. Hit Crop\r\n5. Adjust Crop Area\r\n6. Hit Apply.\r\n\r\nEven if there is no need to move the cropping HUD or Navigation HUD or zoom, the process of too-tight cropping is easier to resolve in iPhoto 06 than in iPhoto 09.  This \"feature\" really is a solution looking for a problem."
