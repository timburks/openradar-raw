    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere exists no well-documented method -- using the Store Kit API or otherwise -- of ensuring that applications consuming resources on developers' servers have been paid for through the App Store. \r\n\r\nIf an application exists primarily to facilitate the use of consumable goods through in-app purchases, the customer reasonably expects to be entitled to some amount of those goods from the get-go (i.e. application installation). However, there is no method by which a developer can ensure that illegitimate users cannot consume these once-only \"initial\" consumables, nor ensuring that legitimate users cannot re-consume the initial consumables upon application re-installation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA method by which a developer can confirm purchase of application. A suggested[1] and sound method for achieving this is by initiating a -restoreCompletedTransaction request using the Store Kit API and checking the 'transaction' corresponding to the product ID of the app submitted to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no way of ensuring that users can only consume goods that are included in the price of app purchase are only consumed once and by the legitimate user. There is also rampant piracy that could be curbed through this method.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe abovementioned expected result may already exist. Unfortunately, the sandbox is not an adequate environment in which to test the desired behaviour, as we are unable to emulate the process of buying an application. Please advise if this behaviour is already implemented.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/28676?tstart=0"
