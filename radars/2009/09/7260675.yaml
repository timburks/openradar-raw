    description: "Summary: \r\niPhoto 09 Cropping HUD does not remember its position\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a photo to crop\r\n2. Click on Crop\r\n3. Move the Cropping HUD, whcih is inevitably in the way of where you want to crop.  Good luck trying to find a few free pixels to click on to move the HUD\r\n4. Click Apply\r\n5. Select a different photo\r\n6. Click on Crop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCropping HUD is where I moved it to before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCropping HUD moves back to default position\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo cropping HUD in iPhoto 06, controls in HUD were on toolbar, out of way of picture\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDon't really want the cropping HUD to appear at all.  I appreciate that space on the toolbar was limited, but perhaps the controls could contextually appear in a mini-toolbar that does not overlap the photo, once an area has been selected for cropping.  See rdar://7260629 for wider issues with cropping UI & context for this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease do not fix this bug, get rid of the cropping HUD altogether."
