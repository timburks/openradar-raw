    description: "Summary: \r\nHei TC, a new Traditional Chinese font that is shipped with Snow Leopard, and one that's intended to replace the long-serving LiHei Pro, contains a substantial number of characters with disputable forms (stroke composition, radical form and component position). Many of the characters are the most frequently used ones, causing a visual problem for both Taiwanese and Hong Kong Traditional Chinese users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy and paste the words \"清\" and \"晴\" and set it to Hei TC (either Light or Medium)\r\n2. Notice that the \"moon\" component, \"月\", is different in the two characters. The moon in the character, 清 (clear), is the moon itself. But in the character 晴 (sunny), the moon component is shown as a Japanese 円.\r\n3. A more detailed enumeration is provided by Zonble Yang at: http://cocoa.zonble.net/tagged/Heiti_Tc ; attached is a PDF document written by him to illustrate the details\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe components in the listed characters (see attachments) should be consistent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe components in the listed characters are not consistent. Some are downright wrong in the sense that they do not conform to the standard promulgated by Taiwan's Ministry of Education (MOE).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n1. None of such inconsistency is found in LiHei Pro\r\n2. Curiously, none of such inconsistency is found in Hei SC, persumably the same family of font that covers the Simplified Chinese character set. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt could be possible that when Apple commissioned the font, the foundry used the composition found in Kangxi Dictionary (example: 請, also wrong in Hei TC, has the 円-component in it, cf: http://www.kangxizidian.com/kangxi/1167.gif). Unfortunately, writing forms evolve and the standard form in Taiwan is the MOE standard. The character forms used by LiHei Pro (sans serif) and the most popular PMingLi U (which comes with Windows, a serif typeface) are the most accepted ones.\r\n\r\nI suggest Apple commission the font foundry for a review of these character forms. These have an objective standard to compare to. Admittedly people are less sensitive to how Kanjis are written these days, especially with minor details, but the 月-円 constrast, along with many other examples in the attachment is simply too glaring. This makes using Hei TC for printed material and visual design unacceptable and impossible.\r\n\r\nPlease also refer to rdar://7072541 for further information."
