    description: "Summary:\r\nAnother bug that's been around for ages and still isn't fixed, if you use VPN and MobileMe together, nothing gets synched.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Create a VPN account in the Network pref pane as normal.\r\n2) Turn on Preferences synching in the Mobile Me pref pane.\r\n3) Do a synch on that machine, then on another.\r\n4) Open the network pref pane on the second machine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe VPN account would show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't. I have to create it again manually."
