    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Apple introduced the OS X version number into the Safari UA string, it replaced the dots with underscores. The stated reason was that hypothetical sites that looked for the string \"4.\" or \"4.0\" would trigger on \"Mac OS X 10.4.0\" and go into 'Netscape 4 mode', delivering a poorer experience.\r\nThe introduction of \"Version/4.0\" as a parameter at the end of the string negates this argument, as now you're going to trigger all those netscape scripts anyway.\r\n\r\nI have not noticed ANY detrimental effect on the internet due to the introduction of \"4.\" into the UA string.\r\nI suggest therefore that the underscores be reverted back to dots in the Mac OS X version number.\r\nYou should probably also drop the Mozilla, KHTML and Gecko names now. Safari/WebKit has been on the market for 6 years and all sites that are not being maintained will have had their domains expire by now!\r\nDon't make life harder for current and future developers in trying to make poorly coded sites look good. If a site looks crap that reflects badly on the site owner, and might encourage them to update it for this decade.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nnone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Safari/530.17 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5.7; en-GB) AppleWebKit/530.17 Version/4.0\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-gb) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/530.17\""
