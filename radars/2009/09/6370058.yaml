    description: "13-Nov-2008 04:49 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nAs OS X grows its market share, more companies are interested in building software that can be easily maintained on OS X and Windows.  The CFLite library (http://developer.apple.com/opensource/cflite.html) appears to be an extremely useful library for building cross-platform software.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the current distribution (ranging from CF-299 through CF-476.15) cannot be readily built on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe instructions for building via Cygwin do not work, failing to build various elements that make use of 'dirent.h' structures that are not supported under Cygwin.  Furthermore, many files fail to build due to the use of the return values of C-style casts, which trigger compile errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Nov-2008 11:55 AM Brent Fulgham:\r\nI have pieced together Xcode and Visual Studio projects that allow me to build CF-Lite on both Windows and Mac OS X (http://code.google.com/p/cf-lite).\r\n\r\n06-Feb-2009 10:43 PM Brent Fulgham:\r\nI have opened a project on Sourceforge that supports building the software under Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux:\r\n\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/opencflite/"
