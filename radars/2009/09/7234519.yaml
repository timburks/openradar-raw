    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nScreenSharing has problems when small screen is connected to the System. As soon as I set one of the monitors to 640x480 resolution ScreenSharing has problems connecting to the System with the small monitor.  It connects/disconnects/reconnects continuesly and does not respond to mouse input.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nConnect multiple monitors to a Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.1 . Set one of the monitors to 640x480 resolution. Now try to connect via ScreenSharing to that Mac. \r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nScreenSharing should work fine as it does with higher resolutions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreenSharing disconnects and reconnects. A real usage is not possible. Using JollsFastVNC instead of the inbuilt ScreenSharing did not work with 10.6.0 but works now with 10.6.1 even though the inbuilt does not work.\r\n\r\nRegards - Patrick Stein\r\n \r\n---\r\nauthor of: ScreenRecycler, JollysFastVNC, SmartSleep, SmartSokoban and more."
