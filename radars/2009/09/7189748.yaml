    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe icons of the files and bundles in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ could do with some more thought.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1) Install Snow Leopard\r\n2) Install Flip4Mac, including the web browser plugin.\r\n3) Install RealPlayer, including the web browser plugin.\r\n\r\nExpected Appearance:\r\n\r\nEither: all the plugins have a brick icon adorned with a graphic (like the netscape ones do now) showing which browser API they use.\r\nOr: All the plugins have a brick icon adorned with a graphic depicting what they add to browsers (so for example the two flash plugins would have the adobe logo on one brick face and the flash logo on the other)\r\n\r\nI don't care which, as long as it is consistent and done by the OS.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Appearance:\r\n\r\nTwo of the four \".plugin\" bundles have \"netscape\" lego brick icons.\r\nThe other two \".plugin\" bundles have a plain lego brick icon.\r\nOne of the \".webplugin\" bundles has a plain lego brick icon.\r\nThe other \".webplugin\" has a generic file icon.\r\nThe one \".bundle\" symlink has a plain lego icon.\r\nBoth of the \".xpt\" files have the generic file icon.\r\nThe folder looks a mess as a result."
