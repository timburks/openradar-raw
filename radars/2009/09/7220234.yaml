    description: "Summary: \r\nApplications copied into a folder via a stack in the dock have the \"broken application\" icon even after copying is finished.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open a DMG containing some application, such as Firefox.\r\n2) Drag the application icon onto a stack in the Dock, such as the Applications folder stack.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce the app has finished copying, its icon appears correctly in the stack.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe stack still shows the \"broken application\" icon even after the application has finished copying. Copying some other file into the folder in question fixes the application's icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTestes only on OS X 10.6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
