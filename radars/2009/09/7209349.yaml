    description: "Summary: \r\nOne cannot call dlopen a library linked with CoreFoundation in a (sub) thread if CoreFoundation wasn't initialized in the first place. CFInitialize is called, apparently checks if the thread is the main thread and if it is not, crashes with a SIGTRAP.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a shared library linked with CoreFoundation framework.\r\n2. Create a program that is not linked with CoreFoundation and that dlopen-s the above-mentioned library in a thread.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should open the library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe process crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis didn't occur with MacOS X 10.5.x."
