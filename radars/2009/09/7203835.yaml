    description: "It would be useful to have more places to run scripts in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. Pre build scripts\r\nPre build scripts could be used to build prerequisites like -xcconfig files or config.h headers. This is not possible with a \"Run Script Build phases\", since dependency tracking takes place before any build phase is triggered.\r\n\r\n2. Post build scripts\r\nSimilar to above, but running after the build finished (including code signing etc). Useful for additional packaging, validity checking etc.\r\n\r\n3. Pre/Post SCM Commit scripts.\r\nTo check project integrity.\r\n\r\n4. Pre/Post File Save Script.\r\nTo check/alter a file before saving. E.g. remove trailing whitespace.\r\n\r\n5. User definable Project Actions.\r\nI'm aware of the Organizer's ability to define arbitrary actions. But this per user (not part of the project). I'd like to define actions like build or clean that show up in the build menu and that are part of a project."
