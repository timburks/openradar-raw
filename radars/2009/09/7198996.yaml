    description: "Summary:\r\nNo application owns Software License Agreement windows, and thus the window cannot be brought forward with command-tab to any application once hidden.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Download a disk image with Safari which will require a SLA, OR double-click on a .dmg file which will require a SLA.\r\n2. Command-tab to another app, hiding the SLA window.\r\n3. Command-tab back to the Finder or Safari (whichever app launched the DMG).\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nCommand-tab back to Finder or Safari (whichever launched the DMG) will bring the SLA window forward to be addressed.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe SLA window does not come forward at any point. This makes it very confusing A.) if launched from the Finder, the user only sees that the DMG still has not opened, but there is no indication why, or B.) if launched from Safari, the downloads window states \"Displaying the software license agreement\", but there is no obvious way to bring this SLA window forward.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nExposé can be used to find the SLA window, assuming the user is aware of the Exposé functionality. This, however, does not address the non-obvious like between the Finder or Safari waiting for input from the user, yet that input window is not \"owned\" by either app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis same issue is present in all versions of Mac OS X 10.5. Earlier versions are not currently available for testing."
