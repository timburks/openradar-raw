    description: "Summary:\r\nPackageMaker does not save the values of “Allow Relocation” checkboxes for application sub-components.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an application.\r\n2. Create a preference-pane bundle that contains the application as a resource.\r\n3. Create a PackageMaker document with the prefpane as its top-level component.\r\n4. Uncheck “Allow Relocation” for the prefpane *and* the application inside it.\r\n5. Save.\r\n6. Close the document or quit.\r\n7. Open the document.\r\n8. Return to the Components tab.\r\n9. Expand your top-level component.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see that the application sub-component's relocation checkbox is unchecked, exactly as you set it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see that the application sub-component's relocation checkbox is checked.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. 3.0.3/174 correctly saves and loads the relocation settings.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs noted in x-radar://problem/7199214, it is never appropriate to relocate the resources in a bundle to somewhere outside that bundle. The only thing worse is forcing that relocation to be enabled.\r\n\r\nIf you view the document's XML in a text editor after saving, you'll find that the element for the application sub-component contains a <mod>isRelocatable</mod> element. Thus, PackageMaker has thrown away the unchecking of the box *on save*, which is data loss.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you save the document in 3.0.3/174, or you hand-edit 3.0.4-saved XML to remove those elements, and then re-open the document in 3.0.4, it still shows the boxes as checked, ignoring the uncheckedness in the document. So this is data loss both ways."
