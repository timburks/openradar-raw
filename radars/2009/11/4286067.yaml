    description: "04-Oct-2005 10:18 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nIn the Customize sheet of the Datest section of the Formats tab of the Internation pane of System Preferneces, there is an option to inclue the era in date formats.  It should be possible to chose BCE/CE as alternatives to BC/AD.\r\n\r\nSee these web pages for background information about why this is a good idea:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?le=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=BCE+CE+AD+BC\r\n\r\n04-Nov-2009 07:01 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nThis problem remains in Mac OS X 10.6 Leopard.\r\n\r\n04-Nov-2009 07:01 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nErr...
