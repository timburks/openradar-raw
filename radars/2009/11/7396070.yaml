    description: "15-Nov-2009 06:51 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nChanging the global build products directory while a project is open causes copying of embedded frameworks to fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) In Xcode prefs, set the Build Products directory to a custom location set to /tmp/build/.\r\n2) Build a project that uses a framework from an embedded project.\r\n3) Clean the project (double broom).\r\n4) In Xcode prefs, set the Build Products directory to the Project directory.\r\n5) Build project again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project should build cleanly in both steps 2 and 5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build fails in step 5.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a work-around, close and re-open the project after step 4 causes the next build to succeed.\r\n\r\nAttached are build transcripts for step 5, both a failure and a successful build after the work-around.  In the failure case, you can see it still trying to references SpiffyKit.framework from /tmp/build even though the build directory has changed.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/27036/Radar/7396070/Spiffy.tbz2\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/27036/Radar/7396070/build_failure.txt\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/27036/Radar/7396070/build_success.txt"
