    description: "05-Nov-2009 03:32 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\none of the REALLY nice things about using the mighty mouse is middle-clicking on html links in safari.\r\n(new tab in background - click and forget).\r\n\r\nThis is no longer possible with the magic mouse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a two-finger click could be recognised as a third button?"
