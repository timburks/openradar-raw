    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is currently no stable way for an application to know when Time Machine starts, finishes, or stops backing up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add yourself as an observer for distributed notifications under three officially-supported Time Machine notification names.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReceive notifications when Time Machine begins backing up, when Time Machine finishes backing up, and when the user cancels a back-up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such officially-supported names exist, which means you must either add yourself as an observer for undocumented notification names or searching the system log for messages from backupd.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo. There has never been such a feature in Time Machine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe current undocumented notifications don't distinguish cancellations from completions (unless you observe for other notifications and match up coincident pairs), and monitoring the system log requires polling."
