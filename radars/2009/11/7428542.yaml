    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen running iTunes - primarily when the disk is already under constant random disk I/O - the computer will cease to function. That is the moment a function or action that requires disk access will hang until the power is pulled from any open application. Attempts to open a new application will hang the process attempting to open or even show items on disk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open iTunes during constant random disk I/O\r\n2. Wait a period of time of as long as 5 minutes\r\n3. Watch as apps begin to slowly become unresponsive the moment they require something not available in memory.\r\n---\r\nAdditional optional steps:\r\n4. Think you're insane and put disk under heavy load with no ill effects.\r\n5. Continue thinking you're insane and repeat steps 1 to 3 with fans on full blast and see the computer stop functioning.\r\n6. Check your hard drive with Disk Utility and Disk Warrior. Format it and upgrade it from Leopard (10.5.7) to Snow Leopard (10.6.0) and see the computer stop functioning.\r\n7. Upgrade to iTunes 9 and subsequent Snow Leopard updates (10.6.1 and 10.6.2) and see no difference.\r\n8. Run computer fine for two weeks straight and see it crash in the middle of editing documents because you plugged your iPhone in to sync.\r\n9. In frustration, create a new user account, place the system under constant random IO and open iTunes to see the same result.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nComputer would continue functioning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nComputer becomes unresponsive requiring a forced shutdown. No kernel panic, no logs of any kind since 2 or 3 minutes before you actually turn off the machine as logs require a hard drive to be available to log to.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis occurred with Mac OS X 10.5.x and iTunes 8.2 as well."
