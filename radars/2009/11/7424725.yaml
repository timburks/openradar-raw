    description: "We have an accessible MKMapView in our app.\r\n\r\nWhen starting the read all mode of VoiceOver by two-finger swiping to the top, VO starts reading all MKAnnotationViews. The problem is that the mapview is automatically centered to the currently spoken MKAnnotationView. This behavior is not desirable In our app, because moving the map initiates new fetches of annotations. These newly fetched annotations cause the mapView to scroll further infinitely.\r\n\r\nWe would like to have a hook to detect when this \"speak all\" mode is activated. Then we could disable scrollEnabled on the mapView in this case. Likewise, we need a hook to reenable scrolling as soon as \"speak all\" is canceled."
