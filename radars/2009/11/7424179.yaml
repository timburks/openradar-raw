    description: As of the Mac SDK that ships with Xcode (Developer Tools) 3.2, NSArray does not have a -firstObject method that is public. However, there is a private one with this name. Inexperienced ObjC coders often write categories without prefixing the method names (myself included) and can run into trouble unless this is either made public (and thus they delete their dangerous categories) or it is deleted (making their dangerous categories slightly less dangerous).
