    description: "Summary:\r\nInterface Builder does not respect its assigned space and instead opens new windows in whatever the current space is. This behavior is not consistent with how it should behave when assigned to a specific space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assign Interface Builder to a specific space, say, Space 4.\r\n2. Move to a different space than the IB assigned space, say, Space 3.\r\n3a. Open a NIB/XIB from a Finder window, or...\r\n3b. Open a NIB/XIB from the Xcode sidebar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe newly opened document should be opened in the assigned space (Space 4).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe document is instead opened inside the current space (Space 3)."
