    description: "06-Sep-2009 04:43 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nKeychain provides very little information about keys at all, and many certificates also look identical in the initial overview window.\r\n\r\nIt is often impossible to verify which items have been correctly imported or not, housekeeping (deleting unused or unwanted keys) is not an a workable option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen Keychain Access.app\r\nClick on the \"Keys\" category.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAt least some information about each key should be provided.\r\n\r\nIt would be very good if the user were able to provide personal tags to keys, which would appear in Keychain Access' overview as well as in Mail.app, for example when signing emails, or in safari when certificate authentication is required (especially if multiple certificates are applicable).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMy keys list currently has 4 keys called \"<key>\" - with no additional information, three \"Key from secure.cacert.org\" keys - again with no additional information, and two \"Stephen Riehm\" private keys, with no additional information.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I have several certificates which are all called \"Stephen Riehm\" - however, at least it is possible to view more information about the certificates by double-clicking on them and viewing their details.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been bugging me since at least Mac OS 10.5 - however, as I collect more keys and certificates, the problem is only getting worse.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nKey and certificate management should be an important feature of OS-X - not buried in Utilities where very few people look.\r\n\r\nPlease consider promoting Keychain Access to the Dock by default, and updating its interface to make it suitable for the mass market.\r\n\r\nThe \"secure notes\" feature of Keychain Access is also a very useful feature which could use some promotion."
