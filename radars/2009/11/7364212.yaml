    description: "I use VNC through an ssh tunnel to connect to 2 CentOS Linux servers.\r\n\r\npepper@teriyaki:~$ alias vncsaba\r\nalias vncsaba='(sleep 4; open vnc://127.0.0.1:5901) & ssh -C -4 -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 saba'\r\n\r\nThis worked a couple months ago, but failed this morning. I could connect, but only saw a white screen.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, when I restarted the vncserver, the white screen changed to show the proper Linux desktop, then the connection broke, then the white box came back.\r\n\r\nThis was repeatable across both Linux servers.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that the Linux vncviewer program worked properly -- no white box.\r\n\r\nThe workaround was to force Screen Sharing to run in 32-bit mode, which avoided the white screen and let me control the Linux sessions normally.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090916105559390"
