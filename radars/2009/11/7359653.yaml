    description: "03-Nov-2009 04:38 PM Jed Soane:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe retouch tool in Aperture no longer works on 16-bit, grayscale TIFF images with the combination of Snow Leopard and Aperture 2.1.4. It also means that all of the grayscale images I have previously retouched will display (minus any re-touches) but will not load for editing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Import a 16-bit grayscale TIFF into Aperture\r\n2. Select the Retouch tool\r\n3. Attempt to retouch part of the image\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image should be retouched. The stroke count should increment to 1 in the Retouch section of the Adjustments tab. \"Undo Add Retouch\"  should appear in the Edit menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is not retouched. The stroke count remains at zero in the Retouch section of the Adjustments tab. \"Undo Add Retouch\" does appear in the Edit menu.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRetouching grayscale images in Aperture 2.1.4 was working fine under Leopard, OS X 10.5.8 but does not work under Snow Leopard, OS X 10.6.1.\r\nRetouching grayscale images in Aperture 2.1.3 does work under Snow Leopard, OS X 10.6.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn addition to not being able to retouch newly imported grayscale images, any old grayscale images that had been retouched previously are displayed without the retouches and all of the Adjustments in the Adjustments tab are grayed-out (\"Image loading...\" appears at the top of the Adjustments tab).\r\n\r\nI have found a Knowledge Base article that mentions that grayscale images are not supported (http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23887?viewlocale=en_US). If this is true I would have appreciated it if Aperture had not let me import them at all."
