    description: "20-Nov-2009 02:21 PM Andrew Wooster:\r\n** SUMMARY:\r\nRogueSheep recently blogged [0] that an app of theirs that uses the Three20 [1] framework was rejected because:\r\n\r\n\"\"\"The notice from Apple indicated that we had used a private method of UIViewController called previousViewController. Interestingly enough, we did not explicitly use this call anywhere in our code. Looking a bit into the version of the Three20 library we were using revealed that it coincidentally contained a category that added a method to UIViewController called previousViewController.\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI believe this to be a false positive. Apologies in advance if I'm wrong. I'm working on very little information here. [*]\r\n\r\n** STEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\nAttached is a test project which should trigger the false positive in your static analyzer (or whatever you're using). It's hard to tell, because I haven't seen this myself and don't have access to the tool itself.\r\n\r\n** NOTES:\r\nThree20 does have a category on UIViewController which adds the method \"-previousViewController\". However, Apple does not (as tested with -respondsToSelector:) have a private method called -previousViewController in UIViewController.\r\n\r\nThe closest I can find, which may be triggering the problem, is the private method -previousViewController defined for UINavigationController, a subclass of UIViewController.\r\n\r\nHowever, the private method on UINavigationController should override the category method defined by Three20, so the category method should not cause any problems in Apple code.\r\n\r\nSo, I believe whichever tool you're using to determine whether an app is using SPI is flawed and producing false positives.\r\n\r\n[*] I am, however, an interested party, in that I work on several apps which use Three20, and could thus be rejected for this reason.\r\n[0] http://blog.roguesheep.com/2009/11/19/warning-love-hurts/\r\n[1] http://github.com/facebook/three20"
