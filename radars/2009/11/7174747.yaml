    description: "27-Aug-2009 11:09 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThe iCal icon in the dock updated correctly on 10.5.8 when iCal is not open. It does not under Snow Leopard 10A432.\r\n\r\n28-Aug-2009 11:50 PM YVONNE  VILLA  :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\nTry dragging the iCal icon out of the dock.  Relaunching iCal and then selecting \"keep in dock\" from the pop-up dock menu.  This may have been caused by one of the SL seeds.\r\n\r\n29-Aug-2009 02:25 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThanks, that helped.\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\n29-Sep-2009 10:11 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nYour proposed solution fixes the issue only for the moment. The date doesn't update if the computer is sleeping at midnight. \r\nPlease see rdar://7260072 as well.\r\n\r\n17-Nov-2009 04:47 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThis issue is still existent in 10.6.2."
