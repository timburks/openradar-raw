    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf an progress indicator is set to hide when stopped, then started, then its window hidden in the same pass through the run loop, then stopped, when the window is shown again, the progress indicator is not hidden. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached sample project [see http://codesorcery.net/downloads/Snow%20Leopard%20Progress%20Indicator%20Demo.zip]. First test shows proper show/hide behavior, second shows problem. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe progress indicator should be hidden since it is stopped. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt is not hidden. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by starting the animation in the next pass of the run loop, e.g., by using performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: with a delay of 0.0 or greater."
