    description: "30-Aug-2009 01:28 AM Uli Kusterer:\r\nI occasionally have to interrupt my presentations to demonstrate how one does something on the Mac. So I exit the presentation using ESC  and switch to the other app.\r\n\r\nWhen I do that, the iPhone app goes back to the \"start presentation\" screen.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Keynote Remote for the iPhone kept showing the current slide notes, so I can refer back to my presenter's notes in the presentation to remind myself of the steps I want to do in the demo.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to fix this on the Keynote side: Add a way to \"pause\" a presentation, and make it the default when one switches the app out without stopping the presentation. The iPhone app would not have to know about this, but I could switch to another app and still read my notes on the phone display."
