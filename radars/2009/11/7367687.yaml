    description: "05-Nov-2009 03:37 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nthe sides of the magic mouse are so smooth that the user has to grip the mouse with considerable force (much more compared to the mighty mouse) and because the fingers slide along the sides so easily, the hand must be continually re-aligned so that the fore-fingers are properly positioned for clicking."
