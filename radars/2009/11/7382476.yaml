    description: "10-Nov-2009 02:35 PM Nicholas Sivo:\r\nSummary:\r\nUsers who have jailbroken their phones and taken action to break application compatibility are allowed to leave negative reviews for applications that don't properly handle, for example, asking for Helvetica and getting another font instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJailbreak your phone.\r\nDo something horrible to your phone (like replacing the system font, or a key library).\r\nDownload an app from the app store that relies on the functionality you broke.\r\nLeave a negative review about how the app crashes or doesn't work on your broken phone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers with jailbroken phones should not be able to leave reviews.  App developers can't possibly anticipate and account for all possible jailbroken phone configurations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsers with Jailbroken phones heavily alter their devices and leave negative reviews when apps through no fault of their own can't handle the modifications.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI work on Loopt Mix.  Many of our one star reviews are from users who replaced Helvetica with a larger font and broke our application.  We couldn't have known that asking for Helvetica by name would return a different font on some devices.\r\n\r\nI've included a screen shot sent in by a user demonstrating the font problem we've been having.  It could be argued that we should detect the font metrics at run time and adjust accordingly.  We do that now.  However, where do you draw the line? Should we assume nothing on the phone can be trusted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Helvetica Replaced.jpg' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Nov-2009 02:48 PM Nicholas Sivo:\r\nAdded a new image of what we expected the screen to look like.  In the altered version, the button is visible, but cannot be clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Correct.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
