    description: "Front Row 1.x on Tiger was reading a hidden preference (TrailerBypass) that could override the default url (http://www.apple.com/trailers/home/xml/current.xml) of xml file listing trailers served to Front Row.\r\n\r\nFront Row 2.x on Leopard and Snow Leopard does not provide such a preference. To achieve the same result, one must modify a protected system configuration file (/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackRow.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Trailers.plist)\r\n\r\nThis is rather inconvenient for my software, Front Row Trailers (http://0xced.blogspot.com/2007/02/bandes-annonces-front-row.html#english)\r\n\r\nPlease add the TrailerBypass preference to Front Row 2 so that it is not necessary to modify BackRow's Trailers.plist file."
