    description: "Summary: There is no public API for accessing the Bluetooth status.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A developer should be able to determine the Bluetooth status and presence in the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results: A developer cannot know if Bluetooth is active, so it can not instruct the user to turn it on or off if the application need it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe developer only has indirect access to Bluetooth through services that make use of Bluetooth, but there is no way to determine if Bluetooth is active or inactive (or present) in the device, and use or not those services.\r\n\r\nPlease, include an API for accessing the Bluetooth status and availability. This is NOT a request for being able to modify the user Bluetooth status, but to access that information.\r\n\r\nThank you very much."
