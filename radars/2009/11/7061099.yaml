    description: "15-Jul-2009 03:50 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt is still not possible to indent curly braces with their blocks of code \"properly\".\r\n\r\nI know it's not conventional, but its a style which I personally find to be the most readable while being consistent (ie: avoiding cuddling in all cases)\r\n\r\nIf the Indent width is set to 0 and the Indent solo \"{\" to 4, the first \"{\" in every block silently ignores it's indent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn XCode's Indentation preference panel, set the following:\r\n\r\n    Tab key inserts tab, not spaces => OFF\r\n    Tab width: 4\r\n    Indent width: 0\r\n    Syntax-aware indenting => ON\r\n    Tab indents: In leading white space\r\n    Indent solo \"{\" by: 4\r\n    Automatically insert closing \"}\" => ON\r\n    all remaining checkboxes are also ON (automatically indented characters and comments)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- (void)someMethod;\r\n    {\r\n    if( numberOfThingsToDo > 0 )\r\n        {\r\n        [myObject doStuff];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- (void)someMethod;\r\n{\r\nif( numberOfThingsToDo > 0 )\r\n    {\r\n    [myObject doStuff];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been the case for as long as I can remember.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
