    description: "04-Nov-2009 02:49 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nSummary: \r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define an AirPort network that uses WPA2 Enterprise. \r\n2. Attempt to connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEven if the Mac fails to connect using WPA2 Enterprise, it should not change the settings the user has specified in the defined AirPort network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the Mac fails to connect using WPA2 Enterprise, it appears to try WPA Enterprise automatically as a fallback security method. Furthermore, the Mac alters the settings the user has specified in the defined AirPort network, changing the security method from WPA2 Enterprise to WPA Enterprise.\r\n\r\nBoth the automatic trying of security methods the user has not selected, and the alteration of user-specified settings prevent effective troubleshooting of Wi-Fi connection problems.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been reproduced on a variety of MacBook Pro models."
