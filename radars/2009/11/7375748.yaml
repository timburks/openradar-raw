    description: "Summary:\r\nInconsistent page titles in Safari, depending on where it is displayed: the tab may display a different title than the window, both of which may itself be different from the title in the history menu. A screenshot will drive the point home (see attached file \"Bug Titles Safari.png\"), notice the tab title is different from the window title, and both of them are different from the history menu item title.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- 1: find a page which changes title from time to time ( www.penny-arcade.com is one, www.goblinscomic.com is another; www.vgcats.com too but the title is generated at random which may make reproduction a little less predictable).\r\n- 2: bookmark it in Firefox (or whichever other browser)\r\n- 3: import the bookmark in Safari after the title has changed since it was bookmarked in the original browser\r\n- 4: after the page title has changed again, load the page from (it's important) the bookmark.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe three places the title is used are, you know, consistent (crazy talk, I know).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInconsistency as seen in the screenshot\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe window title shows the current page title, while the tab shows the title as taken from the bookmark, so it's the title as it was when the page was bookmarked (including from another browser), and the history menu item seems to take the title from when the bookmark was imported in Safari or from when the page was first visited with Safari.\r\nNote that it does not matter very much that the bookmark keeps having the title from when the site was bookmarked, it's better it stays the same so as not to confuse users (especially for sites which don't have favicons); however these three locations (window title, tab title, and history menu item) which are dynamic ought to use the latest title (notice the history browser does use the latest title contrary to the menu item for the same entry in the history)."
