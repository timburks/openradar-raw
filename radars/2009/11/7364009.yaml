    description: "Summary: An application that uses a WiFi connection to obtain its data, perform considerably worse if Bluetooth is active.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The WiFi performance should not be dependent on the Bluetooth service being active or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Most of the time, the WiFi performance is seriously degraded if the Bluetooth service is on.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTested in 3GS and iPod touch 2nd generation. Seems to not happen in original iPhone or iPhone 3G.\r\n\r\nThe application do not need to use the Bluetooth service (no Game Kit, no accessory, no near other Bluetooth devices, no Bluetooth headset). The fact of Bluetooth being active is enough for the WiFi performance to drop. As far as we can measure, this drop in performance can cause waits for data to reach the phone as low as 2-3 times or as bad as 10 times (which makes the application look slow and broken).\r\n\r\nWe think that your users should not have to turn their Bluetooth off to use applications that made use of the WiFi connection, so a solution, or a improvement to this problem will be a good thing to have."
