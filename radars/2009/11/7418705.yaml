    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe have a project that has been building for the 3.0 sdk for some time. We tried building for the 3.1 sdk and got t the following error from the ARM linker.\r\n\r\nld: ldr 12-bit displacement out of range (4912 max +/-4096) in _ABAddressBookAddRecord$stub in _ABAddressBookAddRecord$stub from [PATH TO BINARY REDACTED]\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open our project in xcode\r\n2. change the build target to iPhone Device 3.1/release\r\n3. Build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode should emit a compiled version of our application, just like it did when building for 3.0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLinker dies with message: ld: ldr 12-bit displacement out of range (4912 max +/-4096) in _ABAddressBookAddRecord$stub in _ABAddressBookAddRecord$stub from [PATH TO BINARY REDACTED]\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDid some research and this seems to be a limit of the ARM LDR instruction. What isn't clear is why this only happens when building for 3.1. Seems like a bug in xcode's linker to me."
