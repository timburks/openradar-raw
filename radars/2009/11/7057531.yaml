    description: "It would be an excellent enhancement if one were able to reply to a text message in-place, without quitting the current app.\r\n\r\nThe scenario I'm imaging:\r\n\r\n1. You're using any iPhone app other than Text.\r\n2. A new text message comes in, and you're notified with the blue modal dialog.\r\n3. Hitting Reply would create a text field right in the blue modal dialog, in which you can type out a reply.\r\n4. Once sent, you're back in the app you were using, without having quit or lost your context."
