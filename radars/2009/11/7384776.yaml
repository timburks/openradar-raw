    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a two display system, the video window will not appear and remain off screen if the secondary display is removed between application launches. The video window is visible in the Window menu and can be seen when invoking Exposé via the iTunes dock icon, but not when invoking \"normal\" all-windows Exposé.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a MacBook Pro with a DisplayPort connector and attach a LED Cinema Display to it.\r\n2. In System Preferences, make the external display the main display by moving the menubar to it.\r\n3. Open iTunes, play a video and move the video window to the MacBook Pro's built-in display.\r\n4. Quit iTunes.\r\n5. Disconnect the LED Cinema Display from the MacBook Pro.\r\n6. Reopen iTunes and play a video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video window should become key and be made visible if outside the bounds of an active display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo window will become key (you can zoom it and it will appear), but it remains off screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
