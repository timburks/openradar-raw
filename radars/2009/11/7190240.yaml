    description: "02-Sep-2009 01:07 AM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen quicktime encounters an unsupported video format, it provides no help at identifying what needs to be done to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to play a video with an unsupported encoding. The contents of a mpeg file can be encoded in any number of ways. If quicktime doesn't support the codec, all you are given is an error message and a link to apple's online knowledge base. No information is provided about the video itself - which codec does the file use? Which codec might I need to install?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be great if quicktime included enough information to at least -identify- all of the obscure codecs known to man, without actually being able to play them.\r\nIf the error message said something like: \"The 'Sorenson Video 1' driver required to play this video has not been installed.\" the user would at least know that the required codec is called \"Sorenson Video 1\", something that they can use to search for solutions with.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe current message reads:\r\n\r\n    The document “4-1.mpg” could not be opened.\r\n    The movie is not in a format that QuickTime Player understands.\r\n    You may need to install additional software to open this type of file.\r\n\r\nClicking on \"Tell me more\" takes the user to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3775?viewlocale=en_US\r\nwhich has a general description of the standard quicktime capabilities, but nothing which might help the user find a driver for the video in question.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of Quicktime were never any better.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
