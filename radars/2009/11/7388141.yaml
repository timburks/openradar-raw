    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSetting IKImageBrowserView's backgroundLayer property causes extremely serious visual glitches when resizing the containing window.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached.  To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an application using IKImageBrowserView\r\n2. In code, create a CATextLayer and set it as the backgroundLayer property of the IKImageBrowserView\r\n3. Run the app and resize the window.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\nThat the window would resize cleanly with no visual glitches.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\nThe window resizes and the IKImageBrowserView is filled with screen dirt, including random parts of the video buffer (e.g. images of menu bar, window borders, desktop, etc.).  A screen capture video is included in the sample project to demonstrate the effect on my machine.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have tested on both machines I have available - a Rev. A Unibody 15\" MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini.  System Configuration reports for both machines are included with the sample project.\r\n\r\nThe bug was also present on Mac OS X 10.6.0.  I did not verify it on 10.6.1.\r\n\r\nOpenRadar: enclosure: http://fraserspeirs.s3.amazonaws.com/openradar/CoreAnimationImageKitSnowCrash.zip\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\n03-Dec-2009 01:47 AM  :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nWhen you set a background layer the imagebrowserview doesn't clears its background and let the layer to do this job (to avoid useless extra clearing that could impact signicantly the performance). So it is up to your \"containingLayer\" to clear the background. This can easily be done by adding this into your code:\r\n\r\ncontainingLayer.backgroundColor = CGColorGetConstantColor(kCGColorWhite);"
