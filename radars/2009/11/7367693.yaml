    description: "05-Nov-2009 03:43 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\na new kind of scroll was introduced with the magic mouse: scroll with momentum.\r\nThis is a WONDERFUL feature for long documents and there is no reason why the mighty mouse shouldn't also be able to be used in this way. A sudden lack of ball movement can easily be equated to the lifting of a finger from the magic mouse - it's just a lack of signal.\r\n\r\nPlease update the mouse drivers to afford this type of scrolling to other mice. Even though I have both a magic mouse and a mighty mouse - the lack of a third button on the magic mouse means that I strongly prefer the mighty mouse for web browsing."
