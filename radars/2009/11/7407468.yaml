    description: "Summary:\r\nIf Universal Access is used to increase the cursor size greater than 50% the large cursor will erase keynote slides while in play mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. System Preferences > Universal Access > Mouse, set Cursor Size greater than 50%.\r\n2. Keynote > Preferences > Slideshow, select show pointer when mouse moves\r\n3. Launch keynote presentation \r\n4. Move mouse over slide as you would a laser pointer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected cursor to work just be larger\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nChunks of slide are erased just like the eraser in photoshop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behavior is reproducible from 10.5.7 through 10.6.2 and in Keynote 5.0.2 (776) through 5.0.3 (791)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSelecting a cursor size of less than 50% does not exhibit this issue."
