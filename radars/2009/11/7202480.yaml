    description: "06-Sep-2009 04:20 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen accessing sites like https://cats.cacert.org (this is an online test for CACert assurers)\r\na certificate-login is technically optional, however, to actually proceed with the test, the browser must\r\nsupply a certificate.\r\nSafari ignores this completely and doesn't even provide the option of selecting a certificate to access the site with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a (free) certificate at https://www.cacert.org (an open CA, similar to Thawte).\r\n\r\nEnsure that the certificate works by using the \"certificate login\" at https://www.cacert.org/.\r\n\r\nTry to access https://cats.cacert.org with the same certificate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe certificate used to access https://www.cacert.org should also work for https://cats.cacert.org.\r\nSince access via certificate is optional, and since I have a valid certificate for the site, then at least a window\r\ninforming me of the possibility of access via certificate and providing the ability to select which certificate to use (if there are multiple).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe user is rejected from the site with no further information. Safari does not inform the user that a certificate might be appropriate, nor does it present the user with the option of selecting one.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo regression information is available, as I only recently encountered this problem\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHere is the response that I got from the CACert support team:\r\n\r\nThe problem is that requiring certificate auth generates an obscure handshake \r\nerror in firefox. Using optional certificate authentication makes it easy to \r\ngive  friendly error messages, however, as you've also discovered, Safari \r\ntreats the optional certificate authentication as truely optional and doesn't even \r\nask you if you want to use your keychain certificate.\r\n\r\nAs such https://cats.cacert.org/requirecert/ and \r\nhttps://lists.cacert.org/requirecert exist with required certificate \r\nauthentication. What I haven't worked out, and I need to by next week when \r\nI've got a paper due covering the topic, is how to do some nasty hacks that \r\nredirects Safari to this url seamlessly."
