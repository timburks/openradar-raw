    description: "The Voice Memo app that comes with iPhone 3GS can send the voice memo as an attachment to an MMS message. \r\n\r\nThere is no API support for 3rd party developers to do the same. This is a feature request for Apple to add the required support so 3rd party developers can send video, audio or photo attachments to MMS messages just like the Apple Photo, Messages and  Voice Memo apps."
