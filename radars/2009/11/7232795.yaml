    description: "17-Sep-2009 09:41 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe new embedded find/replace is a nice feature in XCode, however, \"find & replace in selection\" is no longer obviously available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a project in XCode 3.2\r\nSelect a block of text in which a replace should take place\r\nPress command-F to open the find banner\r\nClick on the find button to reveal Find & Replace\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nJust as Find / Find & Replace is a drop down menu, so should too should the \"replace all\" button be replaced with a toggle button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe only options indicated by the GUI are replace all, replace and replace and find.\r\nOnly by accident did I find out that pressing the option key WHILE clicking on the replace all button causes the replacement to be restricted to the selected text.\r\n\r\nThere is no menu option, no preference, and no visual indication that this feature is even present in XCode.\r\nThe documentation also doesn't mention the ability to replace within selected text only.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn XCode 3.1 and earlier, I often used the \"find in project\" panel for this sort of thing.\r\nThis has also changed: the panel now has a drop-down menu indicating \"In Project\" - however it is disabled, meaning that even this avenue has been cut off.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
