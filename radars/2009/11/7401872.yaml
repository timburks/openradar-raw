    description: "When scrolling through iPhoto items in NSOpenPanel's media brower, the panel will suddenly throw an NSInvalidArgumentException under 64-bit: \"-[NSKeyedArchiver encodeValueOfObjCType:at:]: this archiver cannot encode structs\"\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Have an active iPhoto library (the more photos, the less of a pain it is to trigger).\r\n2. Call [[NSOpenPanel openPanel] runModal] in code. See attached project.\r\n3. Scroll repeatedly up and down through the photos list in the open panel. Easiest to just hold the mouse on the scroller's down arrow.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nPictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scroll. Boredom ensues.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nPictures scroll, pictures scroll, pictures scr*EXPLOSION* In the attached project, the app will crash. In an actual app, the open panel will just disappear, along with whatever was on the stack above the main loop's exception handler."
