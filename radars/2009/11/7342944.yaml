    description: "28-Oct-2009 03:40 AM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the documentation for the CAMediaTiming repeatCount property, no mention is made that a value of 1e100f will cause the animation to loop forever. The ONLY place that this is documented is in the Timing, Timespaces, and CAAnimation guide.\r\n\r\nAlso, the use of a magic number like this should be replaced with a defined constant, for example kCARepeatCountUnlimited.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe special value to cause an infinite repetition should be documented with the property to which it applies."
