    description: "04-Sep-2009 06:28 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen searching for \"ways to solve a problem\", ie: something to do with \"image\"s, the API\r\nsearch results panel shows functions, properties, classes, typefes, methods, bindings, constants, ... etc.\r\ntogether in one huge list.\r\n\r\nI would like to filter the results to just show classes, methods, etc based on what I am searching for.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen XCode 3.2's \"Developer Documentation\" window via the help menu\r\nSearch for something which returns a lot of hits, for example: \"image\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nmore filtering options, perhaps a row of small toggle buttons at the top of the API Results panel.\r\nThe coloured letters currently used to indicate each hit-type would be fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA short list of the first few hits is shown, sorted alphabetically, and with a scroll-bar.\r\nAfter clicking on \"Show 1472 More\", all of the results are shown, with a scroll-bar,  but it takes a while to optically scan 1500 results which are only sorted by name. (ie: classes, methods, bindings etc are all mixed up in a very un-related way)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nno regression information, this is the new document browser from XCode 3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n15-Sep-2009 02:35 AM Stephen Riehm:\r\nAlmost - but not really.\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for the tip - I was unaware of that context menu (no visual indication and no alternative way of activating the sorting options).\r\n\r\nSorting by type does help, however, I would still prefer to be able to set a filter so that the results are more likely to be visible immediately after searching (I search through the documentation a lot, that's what the second screen is for).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nsearch\r\nperform a quick optical scan of the filtered results (hopefully there will not be more than 20-30, at least when searching for class dodumentation)\r\nclick to pull up desired document\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nsearch\r\nget 1500 results\r\nforced to click on \"Show 1500 More Results\" in order to get a scrollbar\r\n(re)activate sorting (see below)\r\nscroll quickly to the class definitions, but not so quickly that the human eye can't keep up\r\nperform a quick optical scan of class names\r\nclick to pull up desired document\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please note the following results when using the results sorting criteria context menu:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSet the criteria to \"Type\"\r\nResults of all subsequent searches should be automatically sorted by type.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSet the criteria to \"Type\"\r\nPerform a new search\r\nThe results are initially sorted by Name, although the context menu still indicates sorting by Type\r\nTo sort by Type:\r\n    change the context menu to a different sorting criteria\r\n    change the criteria back to \"Type\"\r\n\r\nThe setting of the context menu is, however, retained across XCode restarts.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nStephen Riehm"
