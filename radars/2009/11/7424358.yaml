    description: "In the inspector for a UIButton the Content Edge Inset can not be set by entering a value. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nCreate an empty NIB and drag a Round Rect Button from the Library into the document.\r\nOpen the Inspector for the button.\r\nEnter 50 in the Top field of the Content Edge Inset area.\r\nTry to switch to the Bottom field (either by the Tab key or by mouse)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n50 would be accepted in the Top field and the focus would now be in the Bottom field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Mac beeps and doesn't move the focus.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way to get out of the field is by removing the 50 in the field and clicking on the top arrow button.\r\nThe only way to specify 50 in the field is by clicking 50 times on the arrow-up button.\r\nThe issue is with all fields not just with the Top field."
