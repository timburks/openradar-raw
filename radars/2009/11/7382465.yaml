    description: "10-Nov-2009 11:57 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nClicking OK in the alert displayed after 50 minutes of idle time doesn't restart the user session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into Bug Reporter.\r\n2. Click the \"New Problem\" link to file a new bug report.\r\n3. Stay idle until the alert is displayed.\r\n4. Click the OK button.\r\n5. Wait for about 15/20 minutes.\r\n6. Click the \"My Originated Problems\" link.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour originated bugs should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe login page is displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've experienced this issue only while writing a bug report (that is, I was in the \"New Problem\" page) . I don't know if the alert actually works when the user is into another section of the Bug Reporter site.\r\nThe operating system and browser I used are Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a) and Safari 4.0.3 (5531.9).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I experienced this issue I lost the data already entered in the \"New Problem\" page because when I clicked the back button the browser reloaded the same login page.\r\n\r\n02-Dec-2009 12:57 AM Heather Boger :\r\nThank you for your feedback.  We are investigating the issue you have reported."
