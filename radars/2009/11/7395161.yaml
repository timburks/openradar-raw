    description: "14-Nov-2009 03:54 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nThe text fields in Interface Builder for entering key-value-paths (e.g. when specifying bindings) are completely freeform edit fields. Hence, it is easy to mis-type a property name. Since Xcode has already indexed my code, it would be beneficial if Interface Builder could access this information and perform auto-completion on the components of a key-value path.\r\n\r\nEven the simple, \"stupid\" ability to have IB auto-complete everything that is known to be a property (without regard to the actual target's type) would be a great improvement and help developers avoid hours of wasted time over a misspelled property name in a NIB.\r\n\r\nThank you."
