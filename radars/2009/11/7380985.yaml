    description: "10-Nov-2009 07:50 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's not possible to join the Apple Developer Connection without filling the \"Company/Organization\" field because some time in the past it became required. This requirement prevents users that aren't currently employed in any company or organization to join the ADC. Moreover, it prevents ADC members that aren't employed anymore to update their member information and prevents ADC members that didn't have a filled \"Company/Organization\" field prior to the requirement change to log into the ADC Member Site without typing some bogus information in the form that is displayed when they try to log in through <http://connect.apple.com/>.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to <http://connect.apple.com/>.\r\n2. Click the \"Join Now\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Company/Organization\" field should not be required.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Company/Organization\" field is required.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue also prevents ADC members that aren't employed anymore to update their member information and prevents ADC members that didn't have a filled \"Company/Organization\" field prior to the requirement change to log into the ADC Member Site without typing some bogus information in the form that is displayed when they try to log in through <http://connect.apple.com/>.\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2009 09:06 PM FRED GACUTAN :\r\nThank you for bringing this to our attention!\r\n\r\nFor Apple Developer Connection issues, please contact the Developer Programs Team for assistance.  You can contact them directly at <http://developer.apple.com/contact/>."
