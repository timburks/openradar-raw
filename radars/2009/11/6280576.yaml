    description: "09-Oct-2008 08:03 AM Michael Lowry:\r\nSummary: \r\nnmbd uses too much CPU if network is turned on but unavailable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYesterday morning, we had a problem with the network that prevented use from sending or receiving information beyond the local switch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nnmbd and other network services might have to increase their activity a little bit in such cases; however, they should not consume upwards of 90% of the CPU.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDuring the network outage, I was going about my business trying to get other things done. My MacBook Pro was acting sluggish though, and noticed that the fan was making a lot of noise too. These are usually signs that there's a hung process out there that's eating up all the CPU cycles. I looked in Activity monitor and saw that nmbd had a CPU usage over 80%.  I watched it for a while and it oscillated up and down. Most of the time it was using more than 30-40% of the CPU.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI opened Network Preferences and turned off the Ethernet interface. Immediately, nmbd's CPU usage dropped to under 1%. As soon as I turned the Ethernet interface back on, nmbd started consuming lots of CPU cycles again.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI sampled the nmbd process while it was running. I will include one of those samples. If you want more samples, just ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Sample of nmbdâ€”98% CPU.txt' and 'allesodernix.spx' were successfully uploaded"
