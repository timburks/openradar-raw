    description: "05-Nov-2009 03:30 PM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nEven when turned up to the highest speed, the magic mouse is fractionally but noticeably slower than the mighty mouse.\r\n\r\nEspecially on systems with large or multiple screens this becomes quite annoying.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have both a Bluetooth Mighty Mouse and a new Magic Mouse connected to the same computer at the same time - the mighty mouse reacts better than the magic mouse.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I would have preferred an extra notch of speed for the mighty mouse, so the magic mouse now needs two more notches."
