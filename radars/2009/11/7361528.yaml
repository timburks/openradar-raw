    description: "There is no way in Interface Builder to make buttons with images in navigational elements accessible. The root of the problem is that there are no accessibility attributes available for UIBarButtonItem. The only accessibility label available is the item's title, which does not exist when the button is an image.\r\n\r\nThe result is that a disabled user hears \"Button\" for each graphic button in a navigation bar or a toolbar.\r\n\r\nThis problem is related to rdar://7079944 <http://www.openradar.me/7079944>"
