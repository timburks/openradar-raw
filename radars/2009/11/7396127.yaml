    description: "15-Nov-2009 08:21 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nTargets should have build settings setup to use @rpath out of the box.  @rpath is a much more flexible way to use the dynamic linker on 10.5 and later.\r\n\r\nFrameworks and dynamic libraries should have the Installation Directory (INSTALL_PATH) set to \"@rpath\".  It is currently set to \"$(HOME)/Library/Frameworks\".\r\n\r\nBundle targets (apps, frameworks, plugins, etc.) should have the Runtime Search Paths (LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS) set to \"@loader_path/../Frameworks\".  Currently, it is empty.  To be compatible with the way it's currently setup, it could be set to \"$(HOME)/Library/Frameworks\", but in almost every case, frameworks are embedded into another bundle and not used from ~/Library/Frameworks."
