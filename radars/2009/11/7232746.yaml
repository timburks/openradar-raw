    description: "17-Sep-2009 09:27 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXCode 3.2 uses the system \"Recent Files\" setting for its Recent Projects list.\r\nIn my view this is wrong\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet the number of recent files for the system to 0\r\nOpen XCode 3.2\r\nThe Recent Projects menu will be empty\r\nOpening new projects has no effect on the Recent Project menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"open recent project\" menu should display recent projects, even if the system-wide recent files list has been turned off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nsee above in \"Steps to Reproduce\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUp to and including XCode 3.1 this was not the case.\r\nThe system-wide recent files setting could be set to 0 and XCode still managed its own list of recent projects.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe system-wide recent files list is, for me, completely useless. As a software developer I constantly move between a large number of files: reading and writing documentation, code files, log files, invoices, accounts, etc etc. The problem with the system-wide menu is that it is completely context free and covers all of my activities - it is almost guaranteed that the most recent files will not be what I am looking for.\r\n\r\nXCode, however, is a different ball game. It is a known context and I don't switch projects nearly as often.\r\n\r\nIt would be most useful to be able to specify how many recent projects XCode should maintain, irrespective of the system-wide recent files setting. Without an extra preference setting, I would suggest either 5 or 10 recent projects, and a clear-menu item."
