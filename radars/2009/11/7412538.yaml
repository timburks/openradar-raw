    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user interface is created with the UITabBarController, all its subordinate view controllers should have standalone views without useless buttons, as changing the current view is done purely via the tab bar icons.\r\nTo display the address book and let the user select entries, the AddressBookUI framework provides ABPeoplePickerNavigationController.\r\nUnfortunately, these two do not work together very well: The people picker always displays a Cancel button. The programmer should be allowed to remove this button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITabBarController instance\r\n2. Add a ABPeoplePickerNavigationController instance to its viewControllers list\r\n3. Try to remove the Cancel button that is displayed by the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a public API that lets the programmer disable this button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe public interface of ABPeoplePickerNavigationController contains only a very minimal set of methods, none of which is suitable to modify its appearance.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been an issue since the first release of the iPhone SDK.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile several developers have reverse engineered AddressBookUI.framework and found out Apple has in fact implemented properties to modify the appearance and behavior of ABPeoplePickerNavigationController, these were never exposed in the SDK.\r\nWith Apple's current stance towards usage of private APIs, developers are prohibited from providing a good user experience in their apps.\r\nThere is not a single good reason that Apple should hold these properties back for only their own internal use."
