    description: "Summary: Quartz Composer's Multiplexer and Demultiplexer patches allow the user to enter an arbitrary number for its number of inputs/outputs.  Internally, the number of ports for these patches is limited to 128 inputs/outputs, but that limit isn't documented anywhere.  When the user exceeds that limit, an unhelpful dialog is presented that informs them that they went over the limit, but it doesn't specify what that limit is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n   * Create a new composition\r\n   * Create a Multiplexer Patch\r\n   * Press cmd-2 to bring up the Settings panel\r\n   * Enter 129 in the \"Number of Multiplexer Inputs:\" field\r\n   * Press tab or enter\r\n   * Dialog is delivered\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n   * The dialog should inform the user of what that limit is so they don't have to resort to trial and error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n   * The dialog provides no useful information.\r\n\r\nRegression:   On 10.5, the warning is simply \"Maximum exceeded\", while on 10.6 it's \"Maximum exceeded     Please enter a valid value.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n   * Technically, there's no reason for this limit to exist (the index port controlling which input is capable of 2^31-1 unique integers, so that could be a limit).  Creating connections to that many ports would be very time consuming, of course."
