    description: "14-Nov-2009 03:44 PM Uli Kusterer:\r\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR WITH REGULAR MOUSE:\r\n\r\nWith a regular mouse, I have my index finger on the left mouse button, the middle finger on the scroll wheel. In a TextEdit document, I can start a selection by pressing the left mouse button and holding it, and then spin the scroll wheel with the other finger to select several pages' worth, and then finally precisely position the mouse to select up to the end of whatever sentence I want my selection to end on.\r\n\r\nThis also works fine in Apple Mail.app and Safari.\r\n\r\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR WITH MAGIC MOUSE:\r\n\r\nHowever, with my MacBook Pro's trackpad, as well as my brand new Magic Mouse, this *only* works in Safari and Mail.app. In TextEdit and any other application that uses NSTextFields, as soon as I hold down the mouse button for a left click, movements made with my middle finger are not forwarded as scroll wheel events.\r\n\r\nDESIRED BEHAVIOR:\r\n\r\nThe track pads and Magic Mouse should behave like they do over Safari's and Mail.app's text fields (which are presumably both implemented using WebViews), and notice the attempt to scroll during a click. In the case of a track pad, this only works when using the physical button (not tap to click), but at least it's a start."
