    description: "01-Nov-2009 03:31 PM Pierre Lebeaupin:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Safari one can get in a state where mouse hovering has no effect (that is, links don't change to hover state, title tags of images and links don't show up, one can not preview the destination of a link by hovering over it, etc.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRight click somewhere in the content view of Safari to bring up a contextual menu, then click either inside of the contextual menu (on a menu item or not, doesn't matter), or outside the Safari window (even in the menu bar or another Safari window).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne can keep hovering afterwards in the page where the right-click was made\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHovering no longer works\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug will affect only the tab where the right-click was made, the others are fine. The effect will persist even after switching to another tab and back, and to another window or even to another application and back. It will go off when one clicks inside the content of the tab while it is already active. The bug won't be triggered by right-clicking, then clicking inside the content outside of the contextual menu, or in some other part of the window."
