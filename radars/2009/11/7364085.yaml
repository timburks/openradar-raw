    description: "04-Nov-2009 02:43 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nSummary: \r\nIf you create two 802.1X profiles and disable one of them, the Mac will often try to use the disabled profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate two 802.1X profiles. E.g., one that uses TLS and an identity certificate, and a second that uses a LEAP ID and password. Disable one of them. Add a new Airport network, choose WPA Enterprise or WPA2 Enterprise for the security method, and select the 802.1X profile as the authentication method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe disabled profile is not used, even if the Mac fails to connect using the enabled/selected one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the Mac fails to connect using the enabled 802.1X profile, it appears to attempt to use the disabled one. This is very annoying because it prevents effective troubleshooting of one 802.1X profile at a time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have seen this on several models of MacBook Pro."
