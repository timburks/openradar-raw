    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a Quartz Composition that uses Quartz Composer Patch Plugins, a stream of unserialization error messages is displayed to the user.  These error messages are confusing to typical end-users, and could be displayed more intelligibly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a QC Patch Plugin on Workstation A.\r\n2. Create a composition using that QC Patch Plugin.\r\n3. Open the composition on Workstation B (which lacks the above QC Patch Plugin).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay an easy-to read summary of the missing plugins.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the composition is saved, note (in the Composition itself) which QC Patch Plugins and versions are used.  When restoring the composition, check the already-loaded plugins and versions against this list, and display a simple summary of missing plugins and mismatching versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA long stream of relatively-technical warnings is displayed.  No association between QC Patch Class and QC Plugin Bundle is stored within the Composition.\r\n\r\n"
