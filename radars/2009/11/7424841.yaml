    description: "* Summary:\r\n\r\nTo avoid a repeat of the \"Great Add Object If Absent\" disaster as described by bbum:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/objc-language/2009/Nov//msg00077.html\r\n\r\nand any similar debacle, all private methods (and functions, for that matter) implemented by Apple should start with an underscore. This, combined with a clearly-defined precedence for original versus category-defined methods, would make adding methods to framework classes by category or by subclass much safer.\r\n\r\n* Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nImplement a method in a category or subclass whose name happens to be the same as Apple-private API.\r\n\r\n* Expected results: \r\n\r\nNo selector name collisions.\r\n\r\n* Actual results:\r\n\r\nSelector name collisions.\r\n\r\n* Regression:\r\n\r\nEvery time a private method is added without an underscore prefix, the issue becomes more likely to surface.\r\n\r\n* Notes:\r\n\r\nThis would have the added benefit of making the case stronger that developers should avoid using underscores for their own private methods!"
