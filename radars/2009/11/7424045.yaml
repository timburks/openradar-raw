    description: "There is no way in both InterfaceBuilder and programmatically to make a UISegmentedControl with images instead of titles accessible. Title and image can not both be set. If a the control is created with images and then a title is set afterwards, the images are replaced by the textual title.\r\n\r\nThe result is that a disabled user hears \"Button\" for each graphic button in a UISegmentedControl.\r\n\r\nThis bug is related to rdar://7361528"
