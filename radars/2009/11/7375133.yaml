    description: "08-Nov-2009 03:07 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nA bug report origination date displayed by Apple Bug Reporter system when daylight saving time (DST) is enforced is different from the origination date displayed when DST is off. The change affects both the date in the \"Originated Date:\" field and all the timestamps in the \"Problem Description\" text area.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a note of the origination date of a bug report displayed by the Apple Bug Reporter system.\r\n2. Open System Preferences.app->Date & Time and:\r\n• if DST is on, set the computer date to a day of the year when DST is off;\r\n• if DST is off, set the computer date to a day of the year when DST is on.\r\n3. Logout from Apple Bug Reporter.\r\n4. Login to Apple Bug Reporter.\r\n5. Look at the origination date of the bug report on step 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe origination dates should be the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe origination dates are different and the difference between the date displayed on step 1 and the date displayed on step 5 is 1 hour. That is, it's the time that the DST setting add to or subtract from the current time.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think you should refine the method that the Apple Bug Reporter system uses to display the timestamps in the time zone of the current user.\r\nIt really doesn't make sense that if I file a bug report a given day at noon, after some time the Apple Bug Reporter system tells me that I filed that very same bug one hour later (or sooner).\r\n\r\n10-Sep-2010 01:38 AM Heather Boger :\r\nThank you for your feedback.
