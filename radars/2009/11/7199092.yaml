    description: "04-Sep-2009 06:11 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Brother MFC-9840CDW CUPS driver is unable to present any useful information regarding the toner supply levels.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect a Brother MFC-9840CDW (color laser) printer/copier/scanner/fax via ethernet.\r\nSetup a printer queue for the printer.\r\nClick on \"Options & Supplies\"\r\nClick on Supply Levels\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe printer has 4 colour toner cartridges.\r\nThe level of each individual cartridge should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Supply Levels sheet shows exactly the following text:\r\n\r\nBlack  Unknown\r\n\r\nSupply levels shown are approximate.\r\nLast updated today at 18:23\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn OS 10.5.x, 4 appropriately coloured bars were displayed, however, even then they always showed 100% full, even after the printer was asking for new cartridges.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: the new scanner interface is perfect for my needs (scanning documents for future reference)."
