    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the \"Expos√© and Spaces\" system preferences prefpane, there is an option titled \"when switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\". The Finder does not respect this setting when activating it using its dock icon. When switching to the Finder by clicking on its dock icon, regardless of the setting, we switch to a space with an open Finder window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Ensure that no windows are currently open on any space, that the above mentioned setting is unchecked, and that the Finder is not set to appear on any particular space (nor on \"every space\").\r\n1. Open a Finder window on space 1.\r\n2. Move to space 2.\r\n3. Switch to another application, like Safari.\r\n4. Single-click the Finder's dock icon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe stay on space 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe are moved back to space 1.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nClicking the dock icon causes the bug. Note that using the command-tab shortcut to switch to Finder does not trigger the bug; in this instance, Finder respects the setting.\r\n\r\nI have found no other applications with this problem."
