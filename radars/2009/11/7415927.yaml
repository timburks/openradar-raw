    description: "21-Nov-2009 05:05 PM Matthew Freedman:\r\nSummary:\r\nPDF's generated by iPhone sdk which include text produced by [NSString drawInRect] into a pdf context are not valid, and fonts are not being embedded. There is a writeup here:\r\nhttp://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/15505-pdf-font-problem-cant-get-cids-glyphs.html#post97854\r\n\r\nTo quote \"The font contains a valid ToUnicode entry, which makes the files searchable. It also contains a CIDToGIDMap, which maps the character IDs to GlyphIndexes which is used for rendering the fonts. In order to render the text, a viewer would first map from the character code to the glyph index using the CIDToGIDMap, then retrieve the glyph from the embedded font in order to render it. In this case, there is no embedded font, so in theory a viewer that follows the PDF specs will not view these files.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse standard Apple technique to open a pdf context, push it, the use [NSString drawInRect] to write text into the pdf.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see no error messages on the console, and pdf file should be produced that is viewable everywhere.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nYou will see errors in the console of the form:\r\n<Error>: CGFont/Freetype: The function `get_subset_format' is currently unimplemented.\r\n<Error>: can't get CIDs for glyphs for `Helvetica'.\r\n\r\nThe pdf will open fine on a Mac. But will be garbled, or the text will be invisible on some Windows programs. If you email it to a gmail account, and use the embedded gmail pdf viewer, no text will be visible in the pdf.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways occurs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the discussion mentioned above, and these discussions:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/138111\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/98327"
