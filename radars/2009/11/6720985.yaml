    description: "25-Mar-2009 03:52 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nSummary: \r\nIf one Option-clicks outside a Screen Sharing window to hide the Screen Sharing application, when one returns to the Screen Sharing VNC session, the Option key will be effectively locked in the down position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a VNC session to another Mac.\r\n2. Hold down the Option key, and click outside the Screen Sharing window.\r\n3. Bring Screen Sharing to the foreground again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Option key behaves normally in the Screen Sharing VNC session.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Option key behaves as though it is locked in the down position in the Screen Sharing VNC session. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOption-clicking outside the Screen Sharing window is a convenient way to hide the Screen Sharing application because Command-H does not work in this app.\r\n\r\nPressing and releasing the Option key fixes the problem in the Screen Sharing session."
