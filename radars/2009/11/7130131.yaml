    description: "10-Aug-2009 01:01 AM Michael Lowry:\r\nSummary: \r\nThe iPhone and iPod Touch do not automatically reconnect to WLANs with the hidden SSIDs.\r\n\r\nEach time the iPhone wakes from sleep, the user must connect manually to the private WLAN. The user must go into Settings and then Wi-Fi, wait for the private WLAN to appear in the list (there’s always a delay) and then tap on it. Also, if one opens Mail or Safari application before connecting manually, the the blue pop-up list of available networks will not include the private WLAN with the hidden SSID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to WLAN with hidden SSID, entering the network name and the necessary login details or certificate to use.\r\n2. Put the iPhone into suspend mode. Wait a couple of minutes.\r\n3. Turn on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone automatically connects to the previously-defined network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPhone does NOT connect automatically to the network with the hidden SSID. Instead, it pops up a window asking the user if he wants to connect to the other network that has SSID broadcast enabled. It is then necessary for the user to select the network manually from the list of Wi-Fi networks in Settings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem does not happen with networks whose SSIDs are broadcast. Other mobile devices have no difficulty connecting automatically to our WLAN.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI work in Infrastructure Services at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory.\r\n\r\nAcross IBM, there is a standard setup for wireless LAN access. There’s a public WLAN that provides access only to the internet; and there’s a private WLAN that provides access to both the internet and the corporate intranet. The private WLAN requires authentication via WPA/WPA2 Enterprise using LEAP or a certificate, and has a hidden SSID.\r\n\r\nBoth WLANs are served by the same access points.\r\n\r\nThis bug is a major inconvenience, because it adds half a minute or more to each operation that requires network access. Checking one’s email—something that should normally take no more than ten seconds—instead takes a minute or more, depending on how quickly one manages to connect.\r\n\r\nThis bug also results in needless expense, because network operations that should go over the local WLAN often go instead over the mobile phone network.\r\n\r\nThe inability of the iPhone/iPod Touch to reconnect automatically to networks with hidden SSID has been a problem since the original iPhone came out.\r\n\r\nThis problem is an obstacle preventing wider adoption of the iPhone within IBM. \r\n\r\n10-Aug-2009 01:07 AM Michael Lowry:\r\n'iPhone hidden SSID bug.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Aug-2009 09:30 AM Michael Lowry:\r\nThe device log is attached. I connected to the IBM network by manually selecting the network. The iPhone does not appear to go into suspend mode when the USB cable is connected. Therefore, in order to get it to go into suspend mode, I had to disconnect the cable for a while. When I woke the iPod, it did not reconnect to the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n'iPod fails to join hidden network ' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Aug-2009 12:12 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nI would like to add that the iPhone also fails to reconnect when one roams from one access point to another. The network name is the same across the whole site and the IP subnet for the wireless network spans all the access points. It should be possible to roam from the coverage area of one AP to another without the connection dropping. However, because of this bug, walking from one building to another means having to reconnect manually to the Wi-Fi network.\r\n\r\n04-Nov-2009 02:30 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nHi again, and sorry for the long delay in updating this bug. I have in the past had limited success getting the iPhone to connect when configured via Settings->WiFi, and was forced to provide configuration details via iPhone Configuration Utility. However, I have recently had more success in convincing the iPhone to connect to the WiFi network without needing to resort to iPCU.\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions you gave me. I am attaching the device log.\r\n\r\n\r\n'iPhone auto-join bug.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n04-Nov-2009 02:35 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nPlease note that we also see significant problems when connecting Macs to the \"IBM\" hidden/secured Wi-Fi network.  See rdar://7339693 for one particularly nasty bug that seems related. Common code (or common incorrect assumptions) may underlie problems on both the Mac and iPhone because neither plays well with our Wi-Fi setup. Our setup is standardized across all IBM locations worldwide. These bugs are hindering broader adoption of the Mac and iPhone within IBM.\r\n\r\n13-Nov-2009 02:58 PM Michael Lowry:\r\nPLEASE READ THE ENTIRE UPDATE.\r\nTHE BUG IS *NOT* FIXED.\r\n\r\nI convinced the network administrator to enable SSID broadcast on two of the access points here. When the iPhone is within range of one of these access points, it connects automatically to the IBM WiFi network. Additionally, roaming between these two access points works without network interruptions.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as the iPod is moved to another part of the site, within the range of access points that have SSID broadcast disabled, the problem returns.\r\n\r\nThis testing shows quite clearly that the bug rears its ugly head only when SSID broadcast is disabled.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of IBM sites have SSID broadcast disabled, so it is important that a fix be developed for this bug."
