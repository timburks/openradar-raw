    description: "10-Nov-2009 03:00 PM Loren Brichter:\r\nIt appears that whenever the iPhone simulator gets a scroll event, it does two things:\r\n\r\n1. Goes into a wacky \"let me try to pass these scroll events down to the simulated app!\" mode.  This results in totally weird scrolling, and is never what I want to happen.\r\n\r\n2. Subsequent clicks/taps while in \"wacky mode\" are totally ignored... effectively making the simulator useless.\r\n\r\nSometimes clicking back and forth between the simulator and the desktop makes the sim go back into \"normal\" mode, where clicks actually click, and you can actually test your software.  Otherwise you're hosed.\r\n\r\nNow combine this bug/feature with the new Magic Mouse... the most brilliant bit of hardware ever devised, super sensitive to your touch.  Accidentally nudge your finger a tenth of an inch while your pointer is over the iPhone simulator... and, well, you're boned.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those really, really, really annoying things."
