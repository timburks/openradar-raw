    description: "06-Sep-2009 05:19 PM Stephen Riehm:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe use of GPG to sign/encrypt email was never sanctioned by Apple, however, it was until 10.6 possible with a plugin called GPGMail.\r\n\r\nSince Apple did not make a suitable API available, GPGMail was forced to use undocumented APIs and as is to be expected, with the introduction of 10.6 the API's changed and the plugin was rendered useless.\r\nEntire correspondence histories have thus been rendered practically illegible on a permanent basis, even though they are using an open, well known and trusted encryption protocol.\r\n\r\nPlease either provide an API suitable for signing, encrypting, decrypting and verifying emails via plugins, or build GPG/PGP encryption support into Mail.app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nReceive an email which was encrypted with GPG or PGP.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to open and read the email, if the appropriate software is installed.\r\nIt should also be possible to reply to the email with the same encryption method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPGP encrypted emails are now just displayed as plain text and are completely unintelligible.\r\nThe only way to read them is via copy/paste to command line or similar tools.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAn open API has never existed in Mail.app to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
