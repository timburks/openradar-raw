    description: "10-Nov-2009 04:00 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes the Bug Reporter Search engine doesn't find all the relevant results. I've experienced this issue when searching for bug reports by problem ID or origination date.\r\n\r\nN.B.\r\nYou should already know the problem ID or the origination date of the bug you are searching for. If you go to the Archived section to gather this information prior to perform the search, you may fail to reproduce this issue (see the Notes section below). I knew the details of the bugs I was searching for because I filed some bug reports to <http://openradar.appspot.com/>, too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search for an archived bug report by problem ID or origination date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the relevant bug reports should be displayed in the search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, no bug or not all the relevant bugs are displayed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen the search results doesn't show a bug I know it's actually there, I go to the Archived section, do nothing, and go back to the Search section. After that, if I perform again the search, I get the right results. I don't know if this rule is always true but it worked the three or four times I experienced this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Screenshots.sitx' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n02-Dec-2009 12:59 AM Heather Boger :\r\nThank you for your feedback.  We are always looking for ways to improve our Bug Reporting process for developers.\r\n\r\n02-Dec-2009 01:00 AM Heather Boger :\r\nWe will investigate this issue you have reported further.\r\n\r\n25-Jun-2011 11:07 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nThis issue is still unresolved, please see the attached screenshots in the \"Screenshots #2.sitx\" archive.\r\nI took screenshot \"1 - Missing hit.png\" after the first attempt to search bug 6420849 and \"2 - Correct hit.png\" after going to the Archived section and switching back to Search.\r\n\r\n25-Jun-2011 11:08 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'Screenshots #2.sitx' was successfully uploaded"
