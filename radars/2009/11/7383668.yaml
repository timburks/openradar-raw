    description: "11-Nov-2009 03:03 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe \"Version/Build Number\" field should not be required when reporting bugs against the \"Bug Reporter\" product. It doesn't make sense to ask for the version and build number of the Bug Reporter software, cause users don't know them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to file a bug against the \"Bug Reporter\" product without filling the \"Version/Build Number\" field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to file the bug.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message states that the \"Version/Build Number\" field must be filled.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to fill the \"Version/Build Number\" field with the version and build number of the browser.\r\nHowever, I think that that field is not the right place for this kind of information since it clearly asks for the version and build number of the selected product.\r\n\r\n02-Dec-2009 12:58 AM Heather Boger :\r\nThank you for your feedback.  We will take this into consideration for future updates of Bug Reporter."
