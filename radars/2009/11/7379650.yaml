    description: "Keychain's Secure Notes feature is a useful place to store arbitrary encrypted text. In 10.6 the contents of Secure Notes after some time becomes blank, which is a severe data loss issue.\r\n\r\nHere's a thread showing multiple users experiencing data loss: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2163790&tstart=0\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: I don't know the specific step that causes the data loss. Just general use of your Mac and after a day or so you go to look at one of your Secure Notes and it's empty. It seems to work OK for a couple of views then the third or fourth time you open the note, it is blank. The note is still there, it just has no text in it."
