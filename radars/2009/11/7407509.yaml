    description: At the top of the NSRuleEditor.h header file in the AppKit framework, there is a very helpful and lengthy description of how NSRuleEditor is designed and how to use it. This information, however, does not appear anywhere in the actual documentation for the NSRuleEditor class, making it extremely difficult to figure out how to use the class in practice.  This information from the header file should be included at the top of the class reference for NSRuleEditor, where it would be much more useful and make learning how to use the class much easier.
