    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMy new Macmini3,1 suffers from an AirPort issue that renders the built-in AirPort useless until I restart the computer. If AirPort disassociates from my base station and attempts to reconnect too many times with \"No Ack\" as the MAC Auth result, the AirPortDriveBrcm43xx driver will fail and spew lines like this in kernel.log:\r\n\r\nNov 11 01:35:27 daringchild kernel[0]: Auth result for: 00:16:b6:49:3a:da No Ack\r\nNov 11 01:35:59 daringchild kernel[0]: Auth result for: 00:16:b6:49:3a:da No Ack\r\nNov 11 01:36:29: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\r\nNov 11 01:36:29 daringchild kernel[0]: Assertion failed: file \"/SourceCache/AirPortDriverBrcm4311/AirPortDriverBrcm4311-410.91.20/src/wl/sys/wlc_bmac.c\", line 3249: PHY_TYPE(R_REG(wlc_hw->osh, &wlc_hw->regs->phyversion)) == wlc->band->pi->phy_type\r\nNov 11 01:36:29: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\r\nNov 11 01:36:29 daringchild kernel[0]: Assertion failed: file \"/SourceCache/AirPortDriverBrcm4311/AirPortDriverBrcm4311-410.91.20/src/wl/sys/wlc_phy.c\", line 15546: (const char*)\"wlc_phy_init: Called with the MAC running!\" == NULL\r\nNov 11 01:36:30: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\r\n...cut...\r\nNov 11 01:36:31 daringchild kernel[0]: Assertion failed: file \"/SourceCache/AirPortDriverBrcm4311/AirPortDriverBrcm4311-410.91.20/src/wl/sys/wlc_bmac.c\", line 5332: !(mi & MI_MACSSPNDD)\r\nNov 11 01:37:01: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\r\n\r\nAttempting to reconnect by clicking the AirPort icon in the menu bar or trying to turn AirPort off and back on shows in the system and kernel logs:\r\n\r\nNov 11 08:49:10 daringchild Apple80211 framework[125]: Scan() error 82 (Device power is off)\r\nNov 11 08:49:10 daringchild Apple80211 framework[125]: __performScan() failed (82)\r\nNov 11 08:49:12 daringchild kernel[0]: en1: 802.11d country code set to 'X0'.\r\nNov 11 08:49:12 daringchild kernel[0]: en1: Supported channels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140 149 153 157 161 165\r\nNov 11 08:54:17 daringchild kernel[0]: Memory leak of bytes 178983\r\nNov 11 08:54:17 daringchild kernel[0]: Assertion failed: file \"/SourceCache/AirPortDriverBrcm4311/AirPortDriverBrcm4311-410.91.20/src/wl/sys/wl_macosx.cpp\", line 2465: 0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTrigger MAC Auth result No Ack. However, this can also be reproduced without No Ack with unknown cause.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect AirPort to recover from a communication problem without needing a system restart.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAirPort is inoperable until I restart the computer.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nApple Support talked me into trashing the networkconfiguration plists, PRAM reset, etc. -- nevertheless, the problem appears to be a serious problem in the AirPort driver and keeps coming back.\r\n\r\nI've attached my System Profiler report and excerpts from my system and kernel logs."
