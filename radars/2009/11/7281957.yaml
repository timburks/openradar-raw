    description: "07-Oct-2009 01:10 AM:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI just migrated from a large hard disk to a smaller SSD drive.\r\nThe new drive did not have enough space for all of the original data, the user can select which users to migrate, but it is not possible to select individual applications.\r\nAs a result, I migrated without any applications and was then forced to manually re-install iLife, iWork, XCode, Photoshop and a host of other apps which can't be simply dragged into the new Applications folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOn the original, large disk:\r\ninstall at least one large app in /Applications - my killer app was X-Plane with all screnery - just under 80GB.\r\nBackup with time machine.\r\n\r\nInstall a smaller drive (ie: a 64 GB SSD)\r\nInstall Snow Leopard and migrate existing data from time machine (or similar source)\r\nIndividual users can be selected for migration, for Applications its all or nothing. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be good to be able to select which applications should be migrated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Applications selection in Migration Assistant is a single check-box.\r\nNo detailed selection is possible.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
