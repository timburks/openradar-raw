    description: "It should be possible to retrieve the user's phone number like in the phone app.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful to pre-populate forms that require the user's phone number (for services that require phone number validation).\r\n\r\nAlso, using a lookup in AddressBook it could be used to find out the user's ABPerson record to also pre-populate  fields like name, email, address."
