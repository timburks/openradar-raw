    description: "12-Nov-2009 12:26 PM Steve Streza:\r\nNSRunLoop objects cannot be created via either alloc/init or new. The documentation does not make this obvious. The documentation states:\r\n\r\n\"In general, your application does not need to either create or explicitly manage NSRunLoop objects. Each NSThread object, including the application’s main thread, has an NSRunLoop object automatically created for it as needed. If you need to access the current thread’s run loop, you do so with the class method currentRunLoop.\"\r\n\r\nThis implies that NSRunLoop objects are able to be created. In practice, creating an NSRunLoop manually is not possible. The documentation should be updated to say something like:\r\n\r\n\"In general, your application does not need to explicitly manage NSRunLoop objects. Each NSThread object, including the application’s main thread, has an NSRunLoop object automatically created for it as needed. You will not be able to create a separate NSRunLoop object. If you need to access the current thread’s run loop, you do so with the class method currentRunLoop.\""
