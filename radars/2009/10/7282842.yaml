    description: "07-Oct-2009 11:33 AM Sanjay Samani:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen \"Replying All\" for a message that I sent myself, would be nice if Mail could be clever about To, Cc and From fields.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compose a mail from Mail.app, preferably with a From account different to the default\r\n2. Send the mail.\r\n3. Find the mail in Sent folder and click on \"Reply All\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhat I would like to see happen:\r\n1. To & Cc fields preserved as per original mail\r\n2. My sent account is not included in To field\r\n3. From field changed to appropriate account from which original mail was sent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. To field has my own email address in\r\n2. Cc field has all original To & Cc recipients\r\n3. From field is my default mail account, which may be different from the account I sent the original mail from\r\n\r\nSo if I send an email, realise I forgot something, or need to chase it up, I hit reply all to include the original mail, and I need to use the following steps:\r\n1. Delete myself from the To field\r\n2. Move the recipients in the Cc field to the To field, splitting out Cc recipients from original mail\r\n3. Change From account.  I often forget to do this step and send the mail from the wrong account.\r\n\r\nWould make the Mail Reply All function smart."
