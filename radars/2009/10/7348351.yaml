    description: "Tunes Connect allows developers to set the availability date for an application. This controls the day that an application appears on iTunes worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis date is not used for sorting new releases, however. The date that is used is the one that application was approved. If there is any significant amount of time between approval and availability, the application will not appear in the new releases on iTunes.\r\n\r\nAn example is Pickin' Time: it was approved on October 9th and available on October 26th:\r\n\r\n<http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=327232889&mt=8>\r\n\r\niTunes shows \"Released Oct 09, 2009\". It should show \"Released Oct 26, 2009\"."
