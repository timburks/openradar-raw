    description: "Summary: \r\nThe built-in Help application (for Mac OS or any app that uses it) doesn't show any status while loading content - only a blank white panel, sometimes for as long as 5 or 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClick Help menu, then <AppName> Help, in any application that uses the built-in Help system in OS X.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'm expecting some kind of help content to appear, as soon as the panel appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Help panel appears with the title in the title bar as expected, but there is merely a white content area while the HTML content loads, with no indication that there is content on the way. If there is a delay (as there often can be), this is confusing.\r\n\r\nThe wait is fine (usually doesn't go much longer than a few seconds, even on an older machine), but as a user I get confused or even a bit frustrated: where is it? (Help is often where I go when I'm already frustrated, so this can make me a bit more frustrated). A simple \"spinner\" indeterminate progress indicator is most likely all that would be needed to tell me to wait a few seconds more, and assure me that all is well. If a progress bar is possible, even better! This can help make the UI feel more responsive."
