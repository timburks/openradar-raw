    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\nIt's most noticeable with the BBEdit icon, so download BBEdit's dmg and start a drag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Opacity is reduced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* Opacity is reduced but icon also turns purplish.\r\n\r\nDemo pic:\r\n<https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/14209/purple_snowy_finder.jpg>\r\n\r\nDemo movie:\r\n<http://s3.amazonaws.com/rentzsch/purple_snowy_finder.mov>\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this started in 10.6. Others don't seem to be experiencing this, however:\r\n<https://twitter.com/nriley/statuses/4699480695>\r\n<https://twitter.com/sdegutis/statuses/4699515715>\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI run two displays: 30\" primary and 17\" MacBook Pro internal secondary. Perhaps the 17\"'s color profile is getting used when it shouldn't be?\r\n\r\n\r\n'mbp sysprofile.txt' was successfully uploaded"
