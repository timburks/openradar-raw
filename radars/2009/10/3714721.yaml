    description: "WWDC introduced the WebArchive format, which, when serialized onto disk, is an XML file (I think they said plist). However, there is an existing standard called MHTML (RFC 2557) which should be available for loading and saving.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it would be nice if the standard format were the default."
