    description: "Summary:\r\nI develop a Java application that must run on Java 1.5+.  I compile the app against JDK 1.5 to make sure that I do not accidentally use new APIs introduced in 1.6.  I cannot upgrade to Snow Leopard on my work machine because Snow Leopard does not support JDK 1.5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write Java code that calls a method introduced in JDK 1.6 (e.g. java.lang.String.isEmpty()).\r\n2. Compile against JDK 1.5\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompilation should fail, because the method is not present in JDK 1.5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompilation succeeds, but when the app is tested on JDK 1.5 it fails at runtime with a java.lang.NoSuchMethodException\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorks on OS X 10.5.8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone"
