    description: "SUMMARY\r\nXCode's method list menu for a file doesn't show the file's complete contexts as soon as unbalanced brackets are contained in the file.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCE\r\nOpen a long Objective-C source code file. \r\nClick the method list menu.\r\nâ†’ It will display all methods in the file.\r\nType \"[self\" inside one of the methods at the top file. \r\nClick the method list menu again.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED\r\nThe menu listing all methods in the file. \r\n\r\nACTUAL \r\nThe menu listing all methods above the one you are editing.\r\n(see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\nThis is obviously rather inconvenient as it renders the menu useless while you are editing. In particular it means that you always have to balance all your brackets before you can easily navigate the file again (e.g. to look up the exact name of the method you want to us)."
