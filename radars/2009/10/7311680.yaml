    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a .zip file to a target in Xcode, by default Xcode adds the .zip file to the \"Link Binaries With Libraries\" build phase rather than the \"Copy Bundle Resources\" build phase\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up an Xcode project that contains an application target\r\n2. Choose \"Add to Project...\" from the Project menu\r\n3. In the open panel that comes up, select any file with a .zip extension and click \"Add\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe .zip file should be added to the target under the \"Copy Bundle Resources\" build phase, so that it is included in the application bundle when the target is built\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode instead places the .zip file into the \"Link Binaries with Libraries\" build phase\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe behavior is the same when adding using either \"Add to Project\" or by drag and drop into the groups and files list, or by checking the checkbox in the \"Target Membership\" column next to a .zip file that is already in the project.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe .zip file is presumably added to the link phase because precompiled Java classes can sometimes be stored in zip files, so the behavior would make sense when building a Java application.  However, this behavior is very confusing when dealing with a non-Java target and makes for a very time consuming debugging process when trying to figure out why the zip file can't be found in your application bundle. \r\n\r\nIf possible, the best behavior would be for Xcode to be able to detect what type of target the zip file is being added to, and only add to the link phase if the target is Java based.  If that is difficult or impossible to do, then I would suggest switching the default behavior to add to the \"Copy Bundle Resources\" phase instead.  Given how little Xcode is used for Java development these days relative to other languages, this would make a much better default behavior for the vast majority of Xcode users."
