    description: "24-Oct-2009 12:37 PM Wim Leers:\r\nSummary:\r\nMy MBP had been running nicely for multiple days. It had been into sleep mode multiple times without any problems. It also successfully entered sleep mode when connected to a FW800 HD, a Wireless Apple Keyboard (BlueTooth), an external monitor and a USB hub to which a mouse and my iPhone were connected.\r\nBut then I wanted to put my MBP into sleep mode once more, and it simply wouldn't. I tried about 10 times. Then I disabled \"allow BT devices to wake up my computer\". No difference. Then I disconnected the FW800 HD, the screen and the USB hub. I.e. everything. The problem persisted.\r\nI had to shut down my MBP.\r\nMovie attached. The sound quality isn't great, but you can clearly hear the typical (annoying!) noise of the DVD drive when upon booting, it checks if it has a disc it should pull in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA MBP that is able/willing to enter sleep mode at all times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA MBP that in rare cases won't enter sleep mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis never happened in OS X 10.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'sleepless MBP.zip' was successfully uploaded"
