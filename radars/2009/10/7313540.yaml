    description: "18-Oct-2009 09:33 AM Christopher Wright:\r\nSummary: The QCCompositionParameterView does not provide a Color Chooser panel that exposes a color's Alpha (opacity) component.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n   * Create a composition with a published color input.\r\n   * Create a QCCompositionParameterView, set its compositionRenderer to the above.\r\n   * Click the color well from the view to edit it.\r\n   * Note the lack of an Alpha slider.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The alpha component should be exposed along with the rest of the color components (red, green, blue, or CMYK, etc.)\r\n\r\nActual Results: Alpha is not editable.\r\n\r\nRegression: This happens on Leopard and Snow Leopard (QC3 and QC4).\r\n\r\nNotes: It's possible to work around this by using an RGB Color patch, and publishing the alpha value separately -- it then becomes a slider in the parameter view.  This isn't very consistent (the colors are in a different panel from the color's alpha component).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'QCCPVRGBA Parameter.zip' was successfully uploaded"
