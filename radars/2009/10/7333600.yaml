    description: "24-Oct-2009 10:30 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nOCUnit has the ability to run a subset of tests of the unit test bundle by changing the command line of otest to:\r\n\r\n  -SenTest <TestCaseClassName/testMethodName>\r\n\r\nBecause the Run Script phase runs RunUnitTests, and not otest directly, there's no way to change the command line arguments to otest and no way to run a subset of tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice if there's a way to set up the subset of tests via the GUI.  In the simplest case, I would like to specify the test class and method to run without having to edit a Run Script phase.\r\n\r\nAn even better example is integration into the Build Results window.  Say  a particular test method fails, it would be great if there were a way (contextual menu?) for re-running only this particular test method or class again.  Thus, if I were concentrating on a single test method or test class, I could easily run that in isolation, without having to run all other tests.  Couple this with <rdar://problem/7333564>, and have it remember the subset of tests across runs, and I could just keep hitting Command-R to run the same subset of tests over and over again."
