    description: "14-Oct-2009 04:32 PM Andre Berg:\r\nWhen for example in any application I click on the Apple menu's Services entry (\"Dienste\" in German, which is correct), sometimes when I just wrote a new service with an Automator workflow, it will take a second or two to update the services menu and then there is some text visible to inform the user that the services menu is \"building...\". \r\n\r\nIn German the word that appears is \"Gebäude...\" which is completely wrong and a result of direct word-to-word translation. A building in English is correctly translated with \"Gebäude\" (\"Gebäude\" == \"a house, a tower, a construction (small or large) of some sorts\") but in this case the \"building...\" is the gerund of \"to build\" as a verb so it should better be translated to something like \"Lade...\"  (translates best to \"loading...\") or a more direct translation to \"building...\" could be \"Wird aufgebaut...\"."
