    description: "16-Oct-2009 04:23 PM Wim Leers:\r\nSummary: \r\nSince 10.4, I've added the following lines to my .bash_profile file:\r\n\r\n# Show line numbers for Qt function calls in stack traces.\r\nexport DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug\r\n\r\nI've been developing using the Qt framework (for cross-platform C++ applications) and adding this line allowed me to see the line numbers of Qt function calls in stack traces. Extremely handy.\r\nWorked flawlessly throughout 10.4 and 10.5, but causes problems on 10.6.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Edit .bash_profile.\r\n2) Add this line:\r\nexport DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug\r\n3) Start new terminal\r\nNow, do either (or both) of these:\r\n4a) Type the following to open the current directory in the Finder:\r\nopen .\r\n4b) Change to the directory where qJulia1024.zip has been extracted and type:\r\n./qjulia \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\na) The current directory opened in the Finder.\r\nb) A working OpenCL demo.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\na) Crash. Every single time.\r\nb) The same.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs on both 10.6 and 10.6.1. Removing the line and starting a new Terminal makes it all work again.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSomebody else whom I discussed this with, reported this:\r\n\"using _profile for also crashes qjulia but strangely allows \"open .\" to work .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n'qJulia1024.zip' and 'MacBook Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded"
