    description: "We just got a customer crash report for our application (see attached crashlog). From the crashlog, it looks like none of our code is involved. Of course, we might trash memory somewhere, but googling for \"10.6.1 crash save panel\" brought up the following link to an Apple Discussions group which describes a similar crash with the exact same backtrace and this time, the application was Safari:\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2195481&tstart=0\r\n\r\nThis makes me think it's actually not a problem in the application as two completely different applications produced the same crash inside the DesktopServices code without any indication of application code involved, but it's rather a problem in the OS libraries."
