    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nAPI required to allow pulling of iTunes Connect Product details via HTTP rather than just through the iPhone SDK.\r\n\r\nWe are in the progress of uploading a large number of In-App Purchase product descriptions, complete with country-sepcific localizations. We need to keep track of these descriptions and localizations on a catalogue page on our website. It makes no sense to duplicate the data in two places. Manual errors are probable and the process is tedious.\r\n\r\nThe ProductRequest part of the the StoreKit API allows the pulling of these descriptions. In the same way as the receipt verification can be run over HTTP, it would be great if ProductRequest could do likewise. Obviously, the app certificate would be needed to prevent insecure access to other developers' products.\r\n\r\nThis would save us a lot of time and effort.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDonovan Hide."
