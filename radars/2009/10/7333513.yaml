    description: "24-Oct-2009 08:54 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nAdding a unit test bundle to a project that is dependent on another target requires setting up a dependency to the target along with setting a couple build settings.  While this is documented in the Xcode Unit Testing Guide, it's not a process that's performed often and I have to look it up every time.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the New Target wizard ask if it's independent/dependent and if dependent, which target is it dependent on.  With this information, the wizard should automatically setup the target dependency and the build settings, if needed."
