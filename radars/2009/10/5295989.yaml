    description: "Xcode has lots of checkboxes for lots of warnings.  This is great.  gcc has even more warning options available that Xcode does not expose in its GUI.  Developers like me may want to activate these warnings anyway.  This is possible with Xcode by adding them to \"Other Warning Flags\" (aka WARNING_CFLAGS).\r\n\r\nBut here's the problem: gcc warns if a warning that applies to one language is used when compiling a source file of another language!  Ex: -Wbad-function-cast applies only to C, so if I add it to WARNING_CFLAGS then Xcode warns:\r\n\r\ncc1plus: warning: command line option \"-Wbad-function-cast\" is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++\r\n\r\nwhenever it builds a .cpp or .mm file that's in my project.\r\n\r\nMany projects these days consist of a mix of .c, .cpp, .m, and .mm files.  All of my projects have at least one of each of those!\r\n\r\nAfter talking to several people at WWDC07, we thought of two good solutions:\r\n\r\n1) for Xcode to have something like \"Other C Warning Flags\", \"Other C++ Warning Flags\", \"Other Obj-C Warning Flags\", \"Other Obj-C++ Warning Flags\".  This allows me to examine the gcc man page, and separate warning flags appropriately.\r\n\r\n2) for Xcode to examine \"Other Warning Flags\" and intelligently pass flags to gcc, instead of always passing them all, for all languages.  This intelligence seems to already exist somewhere in Xcode, for example, if I put -Weffc++ in WARNING_CFLAGS then any .m files in my project will get this message: \"warning: command line option \"-Weffc++\" is valid for C++/ObjC++ but not for ObjC\".  If I instead set GCC_WARN_EFFECTIVE_CPLUSPLUS_VIOLATIONS = YES then Xcode is smart behind my back.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I prefer option 2.\r\n\r\nYes, I know that warnings flags could be set _per file_ in the Xcode project, but this is unwieldy and error-prone."
