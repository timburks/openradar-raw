    description: "According to CLLocationManagerDelegate's locationManager:didUpdateToLocation:fromLocation: documentation \"The newLocation parameter may contain the data that was cached from a previous usage of the location service.\"\r\n\r\nI think this method should only be responsible for up to date information, and not cached locations. Otherwise, issues like rdar://7272938 (Camera app can attach incorrect GPS coordinates to pictures) can pop up.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Maps application and locate yourself\r\n2. Wait until you have a fairly accurate and up to date location\r\n3. Physically change to a new location\r\n4. Launch an app that gets a location through locationmanager's startUpdatingLocation method\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nLocation should be an up to date location and not potentially and old cached location.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nLocation will be in old location from step 1."
