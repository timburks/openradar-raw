    description: "In Leopard, Safari could display HP's Java-based iLO 2 (v1.61 08/31/2008) Remote Console. In Snow Leopard, it fails.\r\n\r\nI vaguely think I got a Java security authorization dialog (since iLO uses self-signed certs), but now it just tells me the Remote Console opened in another window, but there is no such window.\r\n\r\nStill works in Firefox."
