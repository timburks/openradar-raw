    description: "Summary:\r\nin Mac OS X 10.6, gamma information in PNG files (in the gAMA chunk) is ignored and the images do not display as intended.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/all_seven.html (and download the PNGs and open them with Preview to confirm it's not just in Safari)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test images looks like the correct result\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test images look like the incorrect result\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNew in Mac OS X 10.6, confirmed as behaving correctly in 10.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFirefox always behaves correctly even on 10.6, probably because it uses its own embedded libpng.\r\niPhoneOS 3.0 seems affected as well, but regression unknown for that platform.\r\nPNG files with a full icc or other color matching profile seem to work, only PNG files having only the gAMA information seem affected.\r\nConfirmed on two completely different machines with two different monitors, and occurs regardless of calibration."
