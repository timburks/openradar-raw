    description: "14-Oct-2009 09:01 PM Christopher Wright:\r\nSummary: QCCompositionParameterView controls get deformed when the containing view is resized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a QCCompositionParameterView that is set to resize with the containing view (struts/springs, or whatever they're called now).\r\n\r\nResize the view, and watch some of the controls get stretched improperly (this is especially apparent with QCNumberPorts that have a max and min set -- a slider is generated that often slides under the value textbox).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  The controls should all scale properly, and absolutely never overlap/underlap.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  The controls sometimes under/overlap (especially sliders)\r\n\r\nRegression:  This happens on Leopard (10.5.8 and earlier) through 10.6.2.\r\n\r\nNotes: This makes QCCPV completely useless in contexts where it needs to resize dynamically -- it looks very bad.\r\n\r\nAttached is an XIB that exhibits the problem -- open it in IB, start the simulation (cmd-R), and then resize the window.  Eventually the slider's right end ends up under the text box.\r\n\r\n\r\n'QCCompositionParameterView.xib' was successfully uploaded"
