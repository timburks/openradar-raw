    description: "When building Mac OS X binaries, it is possible to build and link against dynamic framework bundles rather than only static libraries.  Linking with static libraries can present a lot of issues when you need to share code between various parts and keep them all separated.\r\n\r\nScenario where this would be useful:\r\n- Framework 1 depends on symbols in Framework 2\r\n- App Project depends on symbols in Framework 1 and Framework 2\r\n\r\nAs it is right now, separating out code into this structure would be more difficult since Framework 1 can't compile and link in the symbols it needs in Framework 2 because App project is also pulling in symbols from Framework 2, resulting in duplicate symbols at link time."
