    description: "08-Oct-2009 01:30 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nI use 'open -a Console', and it shows up in the Dock, but never gets the fully-launched triangle. Everything else slows down and stalls. The Force Quit dialog shows Console is (not responding).\r\n\r\nHere's a report I wrote for a NetNewsWire beta, before I'd confirmed the problem was Console.app:\r\n\r\n    Tonight, I unplugged my MBP from Ethernet & power (AirPort remained available) and a while later noticed it was unresponsive.\r\n    I plugged back in to power and Ethernet.\r\n    I noticed the system was very slow -- the clock still read 11:40 at 12:03, and I could see Twitterrific opening and closing on its own, with the cursor tracking (SPoD), but no visible response to clicks.\r\n    The menu bar said NetNewsWire, but Safari windows were in front. I don't close NNW's main window, as a rule, so it should have been visible if NNW was in front.\r\n    I was able to get an ssh hostkey on a remote machine, but and enter my password when prompted, but instead of getting a shell I actually got disconnected.\r\n\r\n    After rebooting and relaunching Console, video in Safari was slow and jittery (unusual).\r\n\r\n    FWIW, 'open -a Console' bounced Console, but it failed to actually display (twice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Console_2009-10-08-012025_prowler.hang' and 'reppep.prowler.10B504.2009-10-08.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Oct-2009 01:32 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nHere's a sample from immediately after I tried to launch Console.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Console_1042.PD28qX.sample-1.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Oct-2009 01:43 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nAnd here's the second Console sample, from a little bit later.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Console_1042.C7KTc4.sample-2.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Oct-2009 01:46 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nFYI: After 2 more reboots, things got slow when I tried to launch Console, and fast when I force quit."
