    description: "Summary:  There are cases where closing an edited document in Quartz Composer will not prompt the user to save their changes before closing.  The user is still prompted before the application Quits, so data is not lost;  however, it's somewhat confusing, unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n   * From the template chooser, choose the default (it'll plop a clear patch in the center).  Make sure the visualizer is visible as well.\r\n   * From the patch creator, select a Sprite, and add it to the composition.  You'll now have a white box in the visualizer.\r\n   * Close the visualizer with cmd-w.\r\n   * Close the editor with cmd-w.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the final window for the Composition document is closed, the user should be prompted to save or discard their changes, or cancel the window close (continue editing).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window is closed without any prompt.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis does not occur for documents opened from the Desktop, nor does it happen on Leopard (QC3).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nnone"
