    description: "15-Oct-2009 11:24 PM Dan Wood:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe desktop variation of Core Location APIs do not actually work at all when there is no Airport/Wifi connection\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set yourself up on a desktop Mac without AirPort.  (I'm connected to the Internet over DSL, for instance)\r\n2. Build and run a sample application that uses core location, for instance http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/09/whereismymac-snow-leopard-corelocation.html\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should get some kind of indication of your location based on your IP address of your internet provider.  (I've seen GeoLocation websites that give me my location, accurate to half a mile or so.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is *no* data at all, the lookup just times out with no locaton information at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems obvious to me that IP geolocation would be an obvious fallback of there is no SkyHook WiFi lookup available."
