    description: "The back button on a navigation bar is only announced as \"*title*, Button\" to VoiceOver users. This deprives a non-sighted user of the visual hint available to sighted users that this button is a back button.\r\n\r\nConsider enriching VoiceOver so that the button is announced as \"Back to *title*, Button\" or \"*title*, Back button\"."
