    description: When people are looking over my shoulder at my code -- whether it's coworkers or people at an NSCoders gathering -- I often want to temporarily increase the font size in Xcode.  Something like the keyboard shortcuts for larger and smaller fonts in Safari and Terminal would be very nice to have.  This would also help during CocoaHeads presentations.
