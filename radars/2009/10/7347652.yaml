    description: "Summary:   \r\n\r\nWhen migrating an SQLite data store, the application hangs in -[NSMigrationManager migrateStoreFromURL:type:options:withMappingModel:toDestinationURL:destinationType:destinationOptions:error:] with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\n  Steps to Reproduce:  \r\n\r\n1. Open the included sample project in Xcode on Mac OS X 10.6.x and run it. Observe the results. \r\n2. Open the included sample project in Xcode on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and run it. Observe the results. \r\n3. There's no step three! \r\n\r\n Expected Results: \r\n\r\nThe migration to succeed (or fail gracefully).  \r\n\r\nActual Results:  On all versions of Mac OS X 10.6, the application hangs with EXC_BAD_ACCESS when migrating the store.   \r\n\r\nRegression:  \r\n\r\nThis operation (and the included sample project) works as expected in Mac OS X 10.5.8.  \r\n\r\nSample project available here: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1399296/CoreDataCrashTest.zip"
