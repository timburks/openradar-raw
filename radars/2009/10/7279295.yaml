    description: "Summary: \r\nMap links using the q and ll parameters don't respect the ll parameter under iPhone OS 3.1 anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen these links under iPhone OS 3.1\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=restaurant&ll=48,11\r\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=restaurant&ll=48,11&sll=48,11\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps.app should initiate a search for restaurants at the given latitude/longitude.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search is done but with the map covering the whole world. The results are spread around the whole world, too.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked as expected until iPhone OS 3.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe did not find any workaround to create a link that shows the expected behavior under iPhone OS 3.1. This effectively breaks the functionality of Where To? 1.x completely. While our new Where To 2.x is not affected because it uses MapKit, the old version is still around and can't be upgraded free of charge to the new version.\r\n\r\nThe issue also has been reported at: https://devforums.apple.com/message/126126#126126"
