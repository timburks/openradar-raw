    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing IKSlideshow will cause your application to hang if run with garbage collection enabled\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode, then click Build and Run.\r\n2. Click the \"play\" button in the upper right corner of the window of the running application to start a slideshow\r\n3. Once the slideshow is running, click the \"X\" button to stop the slideshow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe slideshow should stop and return to the application, where you should then be able to perform other actions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application hangs indefinitely and requires being force quit\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behavior only appears if garbage collection is enabled for the application. Everything works fine if you build the same application with GC off.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe included project is a modified version of step 8 from the ImageKitDemo available on Apple's website at <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/samplecode/ImageKitDemo/>.  The only change that was made was to enable garbage collection in the build settings for the application target in the project."
