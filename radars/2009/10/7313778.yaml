    description: "18-Oct-2009 07:23 PM Wim Leers:\r\nSummary: \r\nAfter upgrading to Snow Leopard from Leopard and connecting the volume that contains Time Machine back-ups, Time Machine starts calculating how much has changed and thus how much space it needs. For some reason, it thinks it needs to back-up *everything* all over again. In my case, it requires 33.89 GB, whereas a few gigabytes have changed at the most (only new e-mails, documents and a few updated applications for Snow Leopard compatibility).\r\nBy itself, that's not a bad thing. The consequence is that it has erased all back-ups except for the latest. *That* is bad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a Leopard system with Time Machine back-ups.\r\n2. Disconnect Time Machine back-up disk.\r\n3. Upgrade to Snow Leopard.\r\n4. Reconnect Time Machine back-up disk.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Machine happily continues to back-up, erasing only the oldest one or two back-ups.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime Machine erases *all* back-ups (except for the last one before the upgrade).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded"
