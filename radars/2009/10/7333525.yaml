    description: "24-Oct-2009 09:16 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nOCUnit was originally released as an open source project by Sen:te:\r\n\r\n  <http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit/>\r\n\r\nOCUnit started being bundled with Xcode as of 2.1.  Changes that Apple has made to OCUnit since then have not be re-released as open source.  I would like to see OCUnit, as used and compiled with Xcode, re-released as open source along with the developer tools on http://opensource.apple.com."
