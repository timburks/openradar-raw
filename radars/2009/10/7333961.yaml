    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an IKImageView has no image, it will display whatever bits happen to be in its backing store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load from a nib a window with an IKImageView (not bound to a value URL).\r\n2. Don't attempt to give the IKImageView an image in any way.\r\n3. Order the window in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see a blank image viewâ€”either not displayed at all (showing superview/window background), or showing only its own background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou see random garbage.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNSImageView didn't do this, but that probably doesn't count.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm enclosing a test app.\r\n\r\n[Test app: http://boredzo.org/radar-attachments/7333961/EmptyImageViewTest-r0.tbz ]"
