    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOpenGL renders incorrectly in certain cases using glPushAttrib/glPopAttrib.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project archive on a machine with a GeForce 7300 GT graphics cards and Snow Leopard 10.6.1.\r\n2. Run the application in the build/Debug subfolder.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nYou see a window containing two swatches of bright green.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nThe window has a dark green swatch and a bright green swatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce the bug when the same machine was booted into Leopard 10.5.8.  Nor was I able to reproduce it on a MacBook Pro running 10.6.1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis code was laboriously condensed from code in a shipping application.\r\n\r\nIn the method -[MyOpenGLView drawRect], you'll see the lines glPushAttrib( GL_VIEWPORT_BIT ); and glPopAttrib();.  These are the lines that, when executed, cause the color to be dark green when it should be bright green."
