    description: "06-Oct-2009 11:51 AM Daniel Rodríguez Troitiño:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIAlertView seem to choose the layout of the buttons (vertical or horizontal) only based on the number of buttons, not in the longitude of the text of the buttons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIAlertView with two buttons, with labels \"Cancel\" and \"More Information\", the alert view chooses the horizontal layout, causing the second label to be clipped as \"More Inform...\" and to not have nearly margins.\r\nCreate another UIAlertView with three buttons, with labels \"Yes\", \"No\", \"3\" (which will probably fit into the horizontal layout), the alert view chooses the vertical layout, leaving very big buttons with a lot of whitespace.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIAlertView should choose more suitable layout trying to size the text of the buttons, or at least leave the programmer influence which layout should be used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe programmer has no control over the UIAlertView chosen layout, beside specifying more or less buttons.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI include a test project to show the problem described.\r\n\r\n\r\n'UIAlertViewProblem.zip' was successfully uploaded"
