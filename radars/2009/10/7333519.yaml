    description: "24-Oct-2009 09:07 AM Dave Dribin:\r\nOne of the nice things Ruby on Rails does to help encourage unit testing is to automatically create the unit test target when a new project is created.  Also, when a new model is created, Rails creates a stub unit test class for the model.\r\n\r\nI would like to see something similar for Xcode.  When creating an application, framework, dylib, or static lib target, it would be nice to have Xcode automatically create a corresponding dependent unit test target, properly configured and ready to run.  This way, a user can just start adding unit test classes to the test target and start testing without any configuration hacking."
