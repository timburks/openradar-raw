    description: "12-Oct-2009 10:49 AM David Phillip Oster:\r\nSummary:\r\nCan't use gcc -Wundeclared-selector in a mixed Obj-C and C project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd -Wall -Werror -Wundeclared-selector to the WARNING_CFLAGS build setting of Xcode. Attempt to compile an Xcode  project that contains both .c and .m files. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ngcc should complain about undeclared selectors, if they are present in the objective-c sources. Since undeclared selectors can never occur in .c files, the warning about Obj-C only is extraneous.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ngcc complains that -Wundeclared-selector is inapplicable to .c files. Since we've set \"treat warnings as errors\" this stops the compilation. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDidn't try.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* It should be possible to use -Wundeclared-selector in a mixed C and Obj-C program.\r\n\r\n* It should not be necessary to specify -Wundeclared-selector is you've already specified -Wall   \"-Wall\" should MEAN all.\r\n\r\n----- \r\nApple closed this as: Works as Intended, saying:\r\n\r\n\"What you should do here is to enable the GCC_WARN_UNDECLARED_SELECTOR build setting (which is defined to pass -Wundeclared-selector only for C/ObjC) rather than putting -Wundeclared-selector in WARNING_CFLAGS.\""
