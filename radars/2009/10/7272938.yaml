    description: "When you take pictures on your iPhone, you've the option to tag a photo with a GPS location at the time the photo was taken. This feature is very handy, except many of my photos appear to have incorrect coordinates. This is probably because CoreLocation gives cached locations from previous uses of CoreLocation according to the documentation on CLLocationManagerDelegate: \"The newLocation parameter may contain the data that was cached from a previous usage of the location service.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Maps application and locate yourself\r\n2. Wait until you have a fairly accurate and up to date location\r\n3. Physically change to a new location\r\n4. Open up Camera.app, quickly take a photo, then leave the app\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nAttached GPS coordinates reflect actual location that's up to date, and not potentially a cached and incorrect location (or at least no location at all rather than a wrong one).\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nLocation attached could sometimes be an old cached location rather than where you actually are.\r\n\r\n02-Oct-2009 05:08 PM Tristan O'Tierney:\r\nUnderlying issue is rdar://7273019"
