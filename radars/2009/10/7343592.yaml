    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIncluding ABPeoplePickerView.h in a Cocoa project causes the private GoogleContactSync.framework to load.  This framework conflicts with the publicly available GData.framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a new Cocoa project\r\n2) Include GData.framework from http://code.google.com/p/gdata-objectivec-client/\r\n3) Include ABPeoplePickerView.h and instantiate an ABPeoplePickerView\r\n4) Build and run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should run normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFor every class within the GData framework there is the following error message on application launch:\r\n\r\nobjc[67590]: Class GDataAttribute is implemented in both /Users/jeff/Workspace/gdata-objectivec-client-1.8.0/Examples/ContactsSample/build/Debug/GData.framework/Versions/A/GData and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GoogleContactSync.framework/Versions/A/GoogleContactSync. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is new to 10.6 Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI guess it's obvious that an application using GData.framework would potentially want to also make use of ABPeoplePickerView."
