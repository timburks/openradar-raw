    description: "SUMMARY\r\nThe movement of a Bluetooth mouse on a MacBook Pro can be very sluggish, adding a noticeable lag to the movement of the mouse cursor. That's a rather poor user experience.\r\n\r\nThis isn't my machine so I didn't have time for extensive tests, but it seems that the mouse works fine as long as it's the only Bluetooth device, but once an Apple Bluetooth Keyboard is also connected, the lagging begins.\r\n\r\nI attach a system profile of the setup in which the lagging happened. In case you need more information about the setup, let me know and I'll try to figure it out.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nSince: reproduced on my own MacBook with a Logitech mouse which works fine until an Apple BT keyboard is turned on. Also reproduced on my friend's MacBook Pro with a Mighty Mouse vs Apple Keyboard.\r\n\r\nI sent in a file recorded with the Bluetooth Packet Logger."
