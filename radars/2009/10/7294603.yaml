    description: "Summary:\r\nkFSEventStreamCreateFlagIgnoreSelf is not documented either in the documentation (generated from the FSEvents header) or in the header.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look up kFSEventStreamCreateFlagIgnoreSelf in the documentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou find an entry for kFSEventStreamCreateFlagIgnoreSelf in the FSEventStreamCreateFlags section, describing exactly what effects this flag will have when passed to FSEvents functions. You also find a comment in the FSEvents header containing the exact same information, since that's where the description in the documentation would come from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou find nothing but an acknowledgement in the Reference Update.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSort of. Previously, all create flags were documented; now, not all create flags are documented.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe name alone is only the vaguest hint, and Google doesn't help because all three results are the Reference Update."
