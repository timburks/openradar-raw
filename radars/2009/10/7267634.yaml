    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nI've got a Core Data managed object that has an attribute with a \"Boolean\" type.\r\n \r\nHeader file:\r\n@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber * includeInHistory;\r\nImplementation file:\r\n@dynamic includeInHistory;\r\n \r\nThe attribute is set as mandatory with a default boolean value of YES. Before saving the context, newly created object seem to behave correctly (the NSNumber is backed by NSCFBoolean). After saving the context and later retrieving the data, the attribute has been mapped to an integer NSNumber. I'm relying on the fact that it is an actual boolean NSNumber because I'm using the JSON framework to serialize those values and it maps to true / false in JSON. Instead, it maps to favorite: 1 / 0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate Core Data model with an entity containing an Boolean attribute. The attribute is set to mandatory (non optional) with a default value of YES. Create an instance of this entity, leave the attribute with the default value, save the entity to a context and later retrieve the instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe attribute of the instance MUST be of NSNumber --> NSCFBoolean\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe attribute of the instance will not be of Boolean type (NSNumber --> NSCFBoolean)."
