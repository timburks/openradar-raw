    description: "10-Apr-2009 11:49 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nI sync my 16gb iPhone 3G with iTunes on my MBP. Tonight, I'm moving music off and videos on, and iTunes keeps telling me I need more space than I have available (or than the selected video files take up on disk), and refusing to sync.\r\n\r\nI quit & relaunched iTunes, but it's still doing the same thing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n1. iTunes reports 1.57gb free on the iPhone (Picture 1.png).\r\n2. I change my Smart Playlist \"4+ iPhone\" from Limit to 4 GB to 5 GB.\r\n3. I click cPhone and Sync.\r\n4. iTunes crunches for a bit, then reports 2.04 GB required, 1.71 GB available (Picture 1.png). I don't know where either of those numbers comes from.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 1.png' and 'reppep.prowler.9G55.2009-04-10.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Apr-2009 11:50 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nPicture 2.png\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 2.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Apr-2009 11:59 PM Chris Pepper:\r\n5. I set 4+ iPhone back to 4 GB and Sync successfully. iTunes still reports 1.57 GB free.\r\n6. I add BeautifulMind-(1|2).iPhone and Sync.\r\n462M\t6Degrees.iPhone.m4v\r\n7. iTunes reports 1.12 GB free, which is okay.\r\n8. I add BeautifulMind and sync.\r\n601M\tBeautifulMind-1.iPhone.m4v\r\n128M\tBeautifulMind-2.iPhone.m4v\r\n9. iTunes should be able to add this 729mb with almost 500mb free, but instead tells me 1.75 GB required, 1.26 GB available. Again, neither number looks right (Picture 3.png).\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 3.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Apr-2009 12:07 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nFWIW, I had the same problem with several other video files tonight. I haven't seen this issue before."
