    description: It is currently not unusual for modo to have maybe 64 + threads on a new 16core/HT Xeon but in the debugger, allw e have is a popup selector with thread numbers.  Ideally, that menus could be hierarchical with the stack traces for each thread or at the very least show where the PC is for each thread.  As it is, I have to select each thread to see if it's the one I'm looking for.
