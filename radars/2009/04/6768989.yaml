    description: "Summary:\r\niChat does not correctly \"linkify\" a URL if it contains ()'s. This is particularly noticeable with Wikipedia links, because they often have ()'s in them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSay, \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_(disambiguation)\r\nin an iChat conversation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text will be made a clickable link that directs to the URL disambiguation page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_\" is made into a clickable link. The link points to the URL article, not the URL (disambiguation) page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI often send/receive links to wikipedia.  I have never sent a link to another website that had a () in it. As far as I know, the ()'s are always matched in wikipedia links."
