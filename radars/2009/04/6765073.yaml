    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to build a package from a PackageMaker document by invoking PackageMaker from the command-line, PackageMaker crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unpack the Growl source code: http://growl.info/hg/growl-development/archive/2e72fc363066.zip\r\n2. Change your working directory to the Release subdirectory of the source tree.\r\n3. /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker --doc Growl/Growl\\ Installer.pmdoc --out Growl.mpkg --version 1.1.5 -v            \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2009-04-07 07:09:47.708 PackageMaker[4351:807] Setting to : 0 (null)\r\n2009-04-07 07:09:47.711 PackageMaker[4351:807] Setting to : 0 com.growl.growl.pkg\r\n2009-04-07 07:09:47.712 PackageMaker[4351:807] Setting to : 0 com.growl.growl.pkg\r\n2009-04-07 07:09:47.717 PackageMaker[4351:807] relocate: (null) 0\r\nPreverifying Growl\r\n  Preverifying Growl\r\n[yada, yada, yada]\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.173 PackageMaker[4940:10b] Setting to : 0 (null)\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.176 PackageMaker[4940:10b] Setting to : 0 com.growl.growl.pkg\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.220 PackageMaker[4940:10b] Setting to : 0 com.growl.growl.pkg\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.226 PackageMaker[4940:10b] relocate: (null) 0\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.226 PackageMaker[4940:10b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSXMLDocument initWithXMLString:options:error:]: nil argument'\r\n2009-04-07 08:03:49.227 PackageMaker[4940:10b] Stack: (\r\n    2450276619,\r\n    2464607803,\r\n    2450276075,\r\n    2450276138,\r\n    2473814452,\r\n    453371,\r\n    447720,\r\n    436209,\r\n    435510,\r\n    9986,\r\n    9918\r\n)\r\nzsh: trace trap  /Developer/Applications/Utilities/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMake\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNew in 3.0.3, as far as I know. I was able to build Growl 1.1.4 just fine with some earlier version of the tools.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nSpecify an explicit identifier for the metapackage using the --id option.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBuilding the package from the GUI works fine, but obviously does not work from a Makefile.\r\n\r\nI'd set the identifier in the PackageMaker document, but there's no identifier field for distribution items.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this with the GrowlMail package document as well as with the Growl prefpane package document. I didn't try any others."
