    description: "While profiling modo, Shark revealed that dtrace sometimes takes as much as 50% or so of my apps sample time.  From the profile, it looks like dtrace contending with our mutex's and semaphores.  Regardless, I was under the impression that dtrace would not have impact on any apps, especially since, to my knowledge, you can't block it.\r\n\r\nAttached is a Shark trace showing dtrace_get_cpu_int_stack_top using 35% of the samples."
