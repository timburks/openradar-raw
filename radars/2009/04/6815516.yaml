    description: "Bluetooth on Nokia Symbian 60 handphone pairs and syncs AddressBook.app's contacts and iCal.app's calendars data successfully with iSync on Mac running OS X 10.4. Used Migration Assistant to migrate user from OS X 10.4 on old Mac to new Mac running OS X 10.5.\r\nBlueTooth and iSync on newly purchased MacBookPro 15\" 2.66GHz running OS X 10.5 don't recognize Nokia units (see screen captures). Checked Nokia support website (which indicated model requires no additional plugin software) and Apple support & forum website.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure Bluetooth is discoverable on Nokia N series handphone running Symbian 60.\r\n2. Enable Bluetooth on MBP and set it to discoverable.\r\n3. With a new MBP that isn't paired with the handphone, run the Bluetooth Setup Assistant and follow the steps. Note that the Bluetooth Setup Assistant will be in an \"infinite loop\" at the last window (just before confirmation of successful pairing had it been successful) thus requiring a Command-Quit to quit Bluetooth Setup Assistant.\r\n4) Open the Bluetooth Preference Pane (in System Preferences) and notice it lists the (\"uncompleted?\") Nokia handphone. \r\nAssuming that Bluetooth Setup Assistant completed the setup before the \"infinite loop\", start iSync.app and click on the Scan button to detect the handphone.\r\n5) iSync.app will scan and after a few seconds report it cannot connect to the handphone (see attached screen capture).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo regression. Handphone should be sync'able as in OS X 10.4 since Migration Assistant was used to migrate user from previous Mac (running OS X 10.4) to current new Mac (running OS X 10.5).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Handphone is listed in Bluetooth Preference Pane. However, it is unclear if Bluetooth Setup Assistant not completing normally resulted in a corrupt profile for handphone.\r\n2. iSync doesn't recognize the handphone despite handphone being listed in Bluetooth Preference Pane.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProblem is reproducible every time. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1.The Bluetooth hardware on the new MBP is working normally. Successfully paired it with Apple wireless keyboard.\r\n2.Bluetooth hardware on handphone works normally and is detectable by other handphone.\r\n3. I've even hardware reset different Nokia N-series handphones to eliminate possibility of corrupted Symbian software on these handphones."
