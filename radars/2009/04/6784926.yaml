    description: "Many existing iPhone applications would benefit from access to the built-in Calendar and Clock apps. APIs for these should be provided to allow richer apps and integration.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- A medication-tracking application could create a schedule of dosing and alert the user via the built-in Clock alarms or Calendar alerts.\r\n- An event finder app (for music, political events, showtimes) could offer the ability to add the event to the user's calendar right from the app.\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases, using the Push Notification service would be overkill, it would require Internet access, and it would fail to clearly disclose to the user that a notification is scheduled. By using the standard Clock and Calendar apps, this would allow the user to see and manage the scheduled events right in those apps.\r\n\r\nThe API could work one-way (allow adding of events and alarms only) or both ways (allow user-initiated reading of the user's calendar). For maximum security, the user could just be presented with the standard alarm/event-adding sheets. This would make it clear where the events are going to be added.\r\n\r\nThe alarm/event should also store an event ID or other identifier that could be passed to the app when the user is alerted. Example: the medication alert would provide a \"View in MedicalApp\" button which would open the originating app and let it load the specific event."
