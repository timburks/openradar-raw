    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a frame opens a HTTPS page with an invalid certificate, Safari pops a certificate warning box.  Clicking 'Continue' on this box dismisses it but causes the HTTPS page in question to jump out of the frame replacing the page in the window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLoad a page with a frame that has a HTTP source page with an invalid certificate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe warning box appears, clicking continue loads the framed page as though the certificate had been valid.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter dismissing the warning box the HTTPS page with invalid certificate pops out of its frame and replaces the topmost page in the window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUntested.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem can be reproduced consistently by opening the following test page:\r\nhttp://www.faelia.com/test.php\r\n\r\nOnce the certificate warning has been dismissed, reloading the test page results in expected behaviour: the HTTPS page loads inside the iframe; however, since the warning had been dismissed earlier, no warning box appears.  Restart your browser to reproduce again."
