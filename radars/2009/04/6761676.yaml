    description: "i would like a refresh button in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen in mobile safari, perhaps between the last/next page buttons. on long pages it is inconvenient to scroll back to the top in order to refresh, especially when trying to refresh the page in order to see updated content in the middle or at the bottom.\r\n\r\nan alternative would be to show the address bar when the page is tapped on, without scrolling to the top."
