    description: "Summary: \r\nThe NSXMLElement method \"elementsForName:\" fails to return the correct results in certain situations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Create (or otherwise obtain) an NSXMLElement similar in form to the following element:\r\n    <a xmlns=\"ns1\">\r\n      <b xmlns=\"ns2\">\r\n      </b>\r\n    </a>\r\n2. Attempt to get \"b\" from \"a\" using the NSXMLElement method elementsForName:\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nOnce would expect to get an array containing \"b\".\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nAn array that does NOT contain \"b\".\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nThis problem occurs every time.\r\nHowever, it will work properly if:\r\n1. \"a\" does not contain an xmlns.\r\n2. \"b\" does not contain an xmlns.\r\n3. \"a\" and \"b\" contain the same xmlns.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nNote that using the method elementsForLocalName:URI: method works properly.\r\nHowever, this is certainly not a proper workaround.  There are situations where the xmlns is not known in advance.  This is the situation I have run into while working with some Jabber code.  I know the name of the element, but it's the xmlns information I'm trying to get!"
