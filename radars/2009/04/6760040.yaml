    description: "06-Apr-2009 11:49 AM Roman Busyghin:\r\nCurrently there is no ability to delete unused application identifiers in iPhone Developer portal (http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/bundles/index.action). After a year of development I have a lot of similar application identifiers that I'm not using currently. They looks almost identical and it's hard to distinguish which one to use during provisioning profile generation process."
