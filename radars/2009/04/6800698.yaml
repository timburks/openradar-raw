    description: The iPhone keyboard does not currently include a backtick character. That's ridiculous. It's been standard on keyboards for years and is used in passwords, on the web (as markup) and everywhere else non-alphanumeric characters are welcome. Don't say there's no place for it, just slide it in with tilde. This has got to be a duplicate bug report, so please mark it as such and for goodness' sake include it in 3.0.x and put an end to the confused Discussions posts.
