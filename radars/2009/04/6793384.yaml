    description: "15-Apr-2009 11:40 AM Michael Akers:\r\nApple's decision to create the dev forums where we can discuss software that's still under NDA has been a great service for the iPhone dev community. I think apple should host a wiki server that's editable by iPhone developers in good standing where information about released and unreleased versions of the SDK can be collected and shared.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this request is that I've seen some threads in the 3.0 section of the dev forum that are trying to maintain lists of 3rd party apps that are broken in various betas of the SDK. A forum thread isn't the ideal place to maintain a list like this, but we're forced to make due because there's no other place where we can collect this kind of NDA'd data without breaking our agreements with Apple. A wiki would really be much better.\r\n\r\nThis is one example, but I'm sure there are many other uses for a wiki that would help both apple and the iPhone development community."
