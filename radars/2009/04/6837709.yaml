    description: "29-Apr-2009 08:39 AM Yann Bizeul:\r\nIn Xcode, I go in Organizer window, then pick one of my apps in the applications list under \"Summary\"\r\nDrag & drop the \"Application Data\" on my desktop, I get \"Invalid Argument\"\r\nThe backup folder is created, I have Library, tmp and Documents but the last one is empty. Which is unfortunate because my app completely rely on data history to be fully tested.\r\n\r\nMac Console says :\r\n\r\n29/04/09 29/04 08:35:07 Xcode[197] Result for '/SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-46.1/DTDKApplication.m' at 796 : 0x0000000B \r\n29/04/09 29/04 08:35:07 Xcode[197] Result for '/SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-46.1/DTDKApplication.m' at 51 : 0x00000007 \r\n\r\niPhone Console says :\r\n\r\nWed Apr 29 08:35:06 unknown mobile_house_arrest[140] <Error>: check_freshness: sb.st_mtime = 1240818086 reference_mtime = 1240818085\r\nWed Apr 29 08:35:06 unknown mobile_house_arrest[140] <Error>: MobileInstallationLookup: /private/var/mobile/Applications appears stale\r\nWed Apr 29 08:35:06 unknown mobile_house_arrest[140] <Error>: fatal connection error: 10\r\n\r\nWith previous version of the beta 3.0 SDK, I was able to backup data, but not to restore them ( rdar://problem/6746792)\r\n\r\niPhone OS is 2.2.1\r\n\r\n01-May-2009 02:51 AM Yann Bizeul:\r\nI mentioned the iPhone OS installed was 2.2.1, that was the problem.\r\n \r\nIn every previous releases of iPhone SDK, I had an issue with recovering application's data backup to the iPhone.\r\n \r\nWith beta 4, I was not even able to get application's data.\r\n \r\nSo I installed 2.2.1 SDK side by side with 3.0b4, and made the backup from Xcode in 2.2.1 SDK.\r\n \r\nThen installed iPhone OS 3.0b4, and was able to restore my backup just fine.\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
