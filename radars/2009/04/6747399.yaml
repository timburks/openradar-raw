    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAll WiFi-capable devices sold by Apple now support IPv6 and use it in preference to IPv4 where available. iPhone OS, used by the iPhone and iPod touch, appears to contain no support for IPv6 at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect an iPhone or iPod touch to an 802.11b/g network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe device should perform stateless autoconfiguration and generate a link-local (fe80::/64) address. If an IPv6 router is advertising itself on the local network, the device should do the same for a global address within the advertised prefix. The device would then be able to communicate via IPv6 with other devices on the local network (and, if applicable, globally).\r\n\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo IPv6 connectivity is available. No IPv6 addresses are configured for the WiFi interface.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone. No public release of iPhone OS has ever supported IPv6."
