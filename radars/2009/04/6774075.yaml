    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nThis bug pertains to the new CaptiveNetworkSupport (Wi-Fi login) feature in 3.0. Upon connecting to a Wi-Fi network that requires login, the device overlays a WebKit view that attempts to connect to www.apple.com, allowing the user to enter login credentials.\r\n\r\nCertain guest wireless networks (such as the visitor network on the Rice University campus) use self-signed SSL certificates.  It appears that the login feature can't handle this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a wi-fi network that (a) requires Web-based login and (b) uses a self-signed SSL cert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• The \"Log In\" panel appears, which attempts to load www.apple.com but is redirected to the login page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• The \"Log In\" panel appears but is blank. www.apple.com remains in the title-bar area. Login is not possible. The user is never prompted to accept a self-signed certificate (as would be the case if simply using MobileSafari to visit such a page).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhone OS 2.x does not have CaptiveNetworkSupport, nor therefore this problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n(1) rdar://6746373 prevents me from snapping a picture of the blank login panel.\r\n\r\n(2) Here is the pertinent bit of Console output; unfortunately, no error is reported, which is why I conclude that the problem is to do with the self-signed certificate.\r\n\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:46 unknown kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleMRVL868x Joined AP:        BSSID = 00:17:df:ab:97:70, adjRssi =  21, rssi = -69, rate = 54 (100%), channel = 11, encryption = 0x1, ap = 1, hidden = 0, directed = 0, failures =   0, age = 1, ssid = \"Rice Visitor\"\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:46 unknown kernel[0] <Debug>: AirPort: Link Up on en0\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:46 unknown Preferences[738] <Warning>: WiFi: Joined Rice Visitor\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:48 unknown SCHelper[737] <Error>: no command\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:53 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: network configuration changed.\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:53 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: CaptiveNetworkSupport:CaptiveStartDetect:1710 starting probe\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:58 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: CaptiveNetworkSupport:CaptiveHandleRedirect:1478 Redirect detected on en0 (Rice Visitor)\r\nThu Apr  9 09:07:58 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: CaptiveNetworkSupport:CaptiveInteract:1351 Launching web sheet to http://www.apple.com/\r\nThu Apr  9 09:08:28 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: CaptiveNetworkSupport:CaptiveWebsheetDone:1291 Webhsheet complete: Offline\r\nThu Apr  9 09:08:28 unknown configd[20] <Notice>: CaptiveNetworkSupport:CaptiveTakeWiFiOffline:726 Disabling Rice Visitor\r\nThu Apr  9 09:08:28 unknown kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleMRVL868x::setDISASSOCIATE() [configd]:\r\nThu Apr  9 09:08:28 unknown kernel[0] <Debug>: AppleMRVL868x Deauth'ed AP:     BSSID = 00:17:df:ab:97:70, adjRssi =  28, rssi = -62, rate = 54 (100%), channel = 11, encryption = 0x1, ap = 1, hidden = 0, directed = 0, failures =   0, age = 43, ssid = \"Rice Visitor\"\r\nThu Apr  9 09:08:28 unknown kernel[0] <Debug>: AirPort: Link Down on en0"
