    description: "25-Mar-2008 04:44 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nSummary: \r\nNSCollectionView does not property redraw the background when alternating colors are used and the view is resized.  The background for the containing scroll view shows through.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa application.\r\n2. Add an NSCollectionView to the main window.\r\n3. Set the background color of the NSScrollView to red (to highlight the effect)\r\n4. Set the NSScrollView to autosize horizontally and vertically.\r\n5. Check \"Use Alternating Colors\" on the NSCollectionView\r\n6. Run the application.\r\n7. Resize the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the window is resized, I would expect that the NSCollectionView should never allow the scroll view's background to be painted.  Thus, the red background should never be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe red background of the scroll view can be seen to the right and bottom of the collection view when the window is resized.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis only seems to be an issue when alternating colors are used.  With this unchecked, the red background never shows through.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching a sample project that demonstrates this behavior.  The redraw issue isn't quite so bad when the prototype view is set to autosize horizontally.  It does eventually redraw properly, but you can still see red during the resize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'CollectionView.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-Mar-2008 04:45 PM Dave Dribin:\r\nAlso attaching a quick screen cast showing the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n'CollectionView.mov' was successfully uploaded"
