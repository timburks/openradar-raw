    description: I have an issue raised in Radar that was subsequently marked as a duplicate. It is woefully inadequate that this marks the end of the originator's trail of information regarding the bug, and consequently the originator cannot track the progress of the issue which is being logged in the bug reporter. Please consider making an issue accessible to all people who have raised a duplicate, so that they can get an idea of progress.
