    description: "The \"tap to top\" feature where the status bar can be used to scroll a UITableView to the first row (top of table) is very useful in many apps.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this gesture extended to scroll to the last row (bottom of table). If the user double taps on the status bar, it would be handy to scroll to the end. This would facilitate loading additional information (\"Load more...\"), determining the oldest item in a list, etc."
