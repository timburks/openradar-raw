    description: "21-Apr-2009 01:17 PM Tom Saxton:\r\nThis bug report is another vote for the importance of solving this problem, as documented in bugs rdar://6393973 and rdar://6069285\r\n\r\nThe iTunes App Store creates an impenetrable wall between app vendors and our customers.\r\n\r\nThe review system offers no opportunity for developers to respond to user reviews, even when the reviewer misunderstands a feature or otherwise makes an demonstrably incorrect statement about the product. There's no way to gather more information about valid complaints or otherwise work with the customer to resolve issues.\r\n\r\nI recently received a review on one of my apps where the title of the review was \"Awesome\" and the comments were positive, but the reviewer gave the app a one star rating. Clearly this was just a user error, but there's no way to communicate with the user to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nWe really need a way to respond to reviews and communicate with our customers."
