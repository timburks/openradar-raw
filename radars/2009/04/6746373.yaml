    description: "Summary: \r\nThe new \"Log In\" dialog (to facilitate on-the-fly connection to wireless networks that require login) cannot be captured using the Home+Lock key chord.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a WLAN that corrals new clients into a special login page.\r\n2. Wait for the \"Log In\" window to appear, first to www.apple.com and then redirecting to the WLAN's login landing page.\r\n3. Press Home+Lock together.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA PNG of this exact screen should be added to the Camera Roll.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The Log In page is dismissed and the screenshot is taken after it disappears (or almost after, sometimes including part of the top of the login window as it animates out of view; see attached).\r\n2. As a side effect of cancelling the log in, the wireless network is disconnected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone (the Log In is new in 3.0, right?)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis occurred in 3.0b1 as well.  Additionally, this feature is not quite self-explanatory yet---perhaps a title such as \"Wireless Network Log In\" would help explain to the user why a MobileSafari window, apparently, is appearing in the middle of MobileMail.\r\n\r\n\r\n'photo.jpg' was successfully uploaded"
