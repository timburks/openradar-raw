    description: "21-Apr-2009 04:49 PM Julian Romero:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is no way for developers to reply to reviews of his iPhone applications on iTunes. \r\nIn some cases this is required because the review points to a misunderstanding or a feature that the user hasn't found.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register as iPhone Program developer, write and publish an app\r\n2. Upload your app to iTunes Connect\r\n3. Wait for app to be approved\r\n4. Wait a little more\r\n5. Once the app is approved wait until someone ask you something in a review\r\n6. Click the 'Reply' link to answer that specific comment to solve customer doubt\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected such 'Reply' link exists and I can interact directly with my indirect customer. I expect also the reviewer get a notification by e-mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe customer think you are unresponsive and talk badly about your app, even if there is a simple and fair explanation to his or her problem, and recommend all friends to not buy.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is bigger if you don't have an account on US iTunes store. You can't even add an additional unrelated review commenting the issues.\r\n\r\nIf you use a separate review to solve the issue (in your country, where you sell 1 or 2 apps a week) the user won't know because your independent review has nothing to do with him. Additionally, whatever rating you use in your own review, you'll be criticized.\r\n\r\nThe review system is obviously modeled after the one used for music. However, there is one key difference: people don't have functional problems with music.\r\n\r\nThey do with software and we need a way to address this fundamental difference.\r\n\r\nMaybe related with rdar://6069285"
