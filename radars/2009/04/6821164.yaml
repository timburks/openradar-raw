    description: "Summary\r\nUser, who authenticates against an Active Directory domain, attempts to connect to an AFP server, depending on how that user connects to the server, single sign on will fail. If user uses the Connect To Server feature of the Finder, the connection will be made automatically. If the users has that same server listed as a login item, as a link in the Dock or as an alias on their Desktop, when acted on, the server will prompt for a name and password.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not that users can not connect, because they can, but that most methods of connection regress to asking for a user name and password rather than the preferred single sign on/Kerberos ticket method.\r\n\r\nHave duplicated the issue with multiple users and with multiple machines running 10.5.6. Have duplicated the issue with a machine, a Mac Pro, taken from straight from the box and updated to 10.5.6 and all other applicable Apple OS and application updates.\r\n\r\nProblem occurs both with native AFP server and Windows/ExtremeZ-IP AFP Server share.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\nMac OS X Server running OS 10.5.6 sharing share via AFP\r\nWindows Server running Windows Server 2003 and ExtremeZ-IP 5.3.2\r\nMac running OS 10.5.6 and updated with all updates from Apple as of 4/23/09. Mac is bound to Active Directory domain.\r\nUser with Active Directory credentials. User is a standard user and not a machine or network administrator\r\nUser with Active Directory credentials. User has been upgrade to be an administrator on machine.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\nOn machine running Mac OS X 10.5.6, bind machine to Active Directory domain hosted by on a Windows Server 2003 server. Sign into machine as Active Directory user. In Finder, use Connect to Server to mount a share via AFP. The share should mount on the Desktop (Finder preferences might need to be altered to show server on Desktop). Make an alias of the server on the Desktop, and add same server share to Dock. Log out of account. Now log back into account as same user. Double click on alias or link in Dock. Single sign on should use existing kerberos ticket, generated at login, to automatically sign onto server. In this case, single sign on will fail and user will be presented with standard login and password authentication dialog.\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n1. Confirmed both forward and reverse lookups of Domain Controller happen successfully\r\n2. Confirmed on multiple machines with multiple user accounts\r\n3. Confirmed problem happens with both standard and admin users\r\n4. That problem occurs after breaking bind, removing all Directory Service preferences, all caches, restart and rebind.\r\n5. That mydomain.tld is set in Network System Preferences “Search Domains”\r\n6. Time is set correctly, and KDC is network time server"
