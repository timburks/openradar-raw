    description: "While the Xcode project file is a text file, it does not play well with  version control systems (VCS) that use optimistic locking.  If you modify the project file before checking in, and sync up with the central repository (e.g 'svn up'), the VCS will merge files that have local and remote changes.  This also happens in distributed VCSs when merging branches.  The VCSs tries to merge all text files, including the the project file.  While this automatic merging generally works well for code and text files, it can cause problems for project files.\r\n\r\nFor example, it's hard to verify that the merge completed successfully just by inspecting the diff or patch file.  Worse, is when the merge results in a conflict and you have to fix the conflict by hand.  Us external developers don't have intricate knowledge of the project file format, so it's hard to be sure we're modifying it correctly.  I could certainly make guesses, but often I just revert my changes and redo them on top the version that was in the repository.\r\n\r\nA couple possible solutions: 1) Apple could provide a merge tool, or 2) document the Xcode project file format.\r\n\r\nIf Apple created a merge tool, it should show what changes have been made at the user level (files or build target settings), preferably in a side-by-side widow.  The merge tool should also handle conflicts, so the user could resolve merge conflicts easily.\r\n\r\nDocumenting the file format would, at the least, allow people to inspect merges and conflicts and make changes.  Or a 3rd party could create the merge tool.  It would also open the door for other useful tools, such as other tools generating or modifying the project file in ways that the GUI does not allow or is slow at performing."
