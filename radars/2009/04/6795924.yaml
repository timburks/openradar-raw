    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you try to use Applescript to retrieve the path of a photo that was imported into iPhoto as an alias, and the photo to which the alias refers cannot be found, iPhoto will put up a UI panel asking the user to locate the file.  This prevents scripts that use this property from being fully automated, as the user must manually dismiss the panel before iPhoto will respond to any more Apple events. The photo locating panel only makes sense in the context where the user is manually interacting with iPhoto.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In the Advanced section of iPhoto's preferences window, uncheck the \"Copy items to the iPhoto library\" checkbox.\r\n2. Import a new photo into iPhoto. With the checkbox unchecked, iPhoto will create an alias internally that it uses to refer to that photo in its present location.\r\n3. Move that photo to the trash, then empty the trash.\r\n4. Run the following Applescript in Script Editor:\r\n\r\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\r\n    get image path of every photo\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe script should return a list containing the path of each photo in the library, with a \"missing value\" marker returned for the photo that was imported and then deleted.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nA dialog appears in iPhoto saying 'The photo \"foo.jpg\" could not be opened, because the original item cannot be found.\", with \"Cancel\" and \"Find Photo...\" buttons. If no user intervention is performed, the script eventually halts with a timeout error."
