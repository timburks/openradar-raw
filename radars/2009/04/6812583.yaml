    description: "Currently, web apps added to the home screen launch with the image of the app's last state. This is confusing to the user for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It shows a screen that may get replaced with a completely different view as soon as the page loads,\r\n2. It shows a screen which looks interactive and isn't.\r\n\r\nDevelopers of native iPhone apps are advised to provide \"background-like\" default.png images which serve as a loading indicator and guarantee an elegant transition to the app view when the app is ready. Web apps should be able to provide the same functionality."
