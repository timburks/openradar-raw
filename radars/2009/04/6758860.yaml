    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen MobileMe Preferences syncing is enabled, the Dock will pop up and become visible at random intervals (likely when a sync runs) when viewing anything in fullscreen (such as a QuickTime movie or a PDF document).  The Dock remains visible with no way to hide it again except by exiting and re-initiating fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable MobileMe syncing of Preferences.\r\n2. Set the sync interval to Automatic (to trigger the Dock popup as quickly and often as possible).\r\n3. Begin watching a QuickTime movie in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie plays back uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt some point during the movie (exact time intervals are unpredictable), the Dock will pop up.  Moving the mouse down to the Dock and then moving it back away does not cause the Dock to go away.  The only way to hide it again is to leave fullscreen mode entirely and return to it, which is very disruptive.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known.  As far as I am aware, this issue happens on every machine running Mac OS X 10.5 (any version) with the .Mac/MobileMe configuration described above.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany others have been experiencing the same problem.  The notes and information they have gathered is available in this thread on Apple Discussions: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1482669"
