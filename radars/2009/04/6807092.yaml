    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nIn iPhone OS many applications switch to landscape mode when the iPhone is turned on its side. While this is great for using the widescreen keyboard for those who need it, it is an absolute pain for anyone trying to use the iPhone while not sitting or standing up. When lying down, the iPhone can't determine that having the y axis parallel to the ground is actually 'up' to your position; i.e. the user would prefer the device to stay in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nThis problem is exacerbated now by iPhone OS 3.0, where landscape mode has been added to even more bundled applications.\r\n\r\nThere should be a systemwide way to stop the UIViewController orientation notifications being called; to allow users use the iPhone in relaxed positions or to simply disable landscape mode altogether in standard applications (not including games).\r\n\r\nEven if deemed unnecessary for current iPhone models, future hardware (e.g. magnetometers) should be used to allow the iPhone to determine the correct orientation by itself."
