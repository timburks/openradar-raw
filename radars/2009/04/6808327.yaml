    description: "f you have setup a custom event handler for \"open\" in your sdef, it does not get called if your app is opened with an odoc event. It does get called once your app has launched though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Build attached project but do not launch it\r\n2) Open up the TestScript.scpt file in Script Editor\r\n3) Play the script\r\n4) Play it again\r\n5) Check the console logs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn both cases I would expect to see handleOpenScriptCommand called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 3 I see _handleAEOpenDocuments\r\nAfter step 4 I see handleOpenScriptCommand\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf you continue to play the script you will get handleOpenScriptCommand until you quit ScriptingOpen."
