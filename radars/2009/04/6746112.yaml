    description: "Summary: \r\nNo audio application can play audio in the background, except iPod/Music.app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open an audio app that isn't iPod/Music.app, such as Pandora Radio or Radioshift Touch.\r\n2) Play audio.\r\n3) Return to the home screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDESIRED results, really: Audio should continue playing in the background, just as it does if you're using the iPod/Music apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio stops instantly. Background applications aren't allowed, so no audio applications can play their audio when not in the foreground.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOn all iPhone OSes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsers badly want this ability. Ask the developers of most any audio application (Pandora, AOL Radio, our own Radioshift Touch, WunderRadio, and on and on) - one of the very top feature requests is certain to be \"playing audio in the background\". We developers simply can't do this - we need Apple to make it possible for us. \r\n\r\nIf a user is listening to the iPod/Music.app, he can also use notes, surf the web, read mail, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf a user is listening to any other audio app, he can't do this, and he gets frustrated. So do we."
