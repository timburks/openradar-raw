    description: "Xcode 3 introduced excellent refactoring support for Objective-C. Since Xcode also supports Python and there are many projects in native Python and based on PyObjC it would be fantastic to extend that refactoring support to the Python language.\r\n\r\nOf the refactoring transformations available in Objective-C the rename, create superclass, and move up are potentially the most useful in Python."
