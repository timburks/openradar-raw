    description: "19-Jun-2008 04:09 PM Jason Boehle:\r\nSummary:\r\nMy specific problem is that I cannot figure out a way to change the text of the Search button on the keyboard when using a UISearchBar.  According to the UITextInputTraits documentation: \"All objects that support keyboard input must adopt this protocol.\"  Since UISearchBar supports keyboard input, it seems that it should adopt the UITextInputTraits protocol.  That would solve my problem, as I could then set the return key type."
