    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen viewing an SVG image that is larger than the current browser window, there are no scroll bars, making it difficult or impossible to view the entire image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Using a regular-sized browser window, view a large SVG image. For example:\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Giant_planes_comparison.svg\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBecause the image is larger than can be displayed in the browser window, I expect to see a scroll bar that lets me view the entire image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere are no scroll bars and I am unable to view the bottom part of the image.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to highlight part of the image by holding the mouse down, and scroll down. Note that the highlight is not displayed by Safari -- possibly another bug."
