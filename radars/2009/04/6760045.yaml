    description: "06-Apr-2009 12:07 PM Roman Busyghin:\r\nAll of my certificates has expired recently. So, I went through certificate generation procedure and I generated two new certificates: one for development and other for distribution. Then I went to create new provisioning profile for my new certificate (http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/provisioningprofiles/create.action?type=1). And there was two certificates offered for profile with the same names. I'm confused and I don't know which one to use. I expect to see only one certificate in this section."
