    description: "01-Apr-2009 09:29 PM Yann Bizeul:\r\nI tried with two applications to restore a backup of application's data.\r\nThoses backups were made just before upgrading the device to iPhoneOS 3.0 beta 2.\r\nOne of these backups went great to the device, but the other just bounces back to the finder with this message in Console :\r\n\r\n01/04/09 01/04 19:45:45 Xcode[399] *** Assertion failure in -[DTDKApplication uploadFile:error:], /SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-33/DTDKApplication.m:168 \r\n01/04/09 01/04 19:45:45 Xcode[399] *** Canceling drag because exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException' (reason 'DTDKApplicationItemBase is an abstract class. uploadFile:error: must be implemented by a subclass.') was raised during a dragging session \r\n01/04/09 01/04 19:46:00 Xcode[399] *** Assertion failure in -[DTDKApplication uploadFile:error:], /SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-33/DTDKApplication.m:168 \r\n01/04/09 01/04 19:46:00 Xcode[399] *** Canceling drag because exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException' (reason 'DTDKApplicationItemBase is an abstract class. uploadFile:error: must be implemented by a subclass.') was raised during a dragging session \r\n\r\n02-Apr-2009 11:45 AM Yann Bizeul:\r\nAdditional informations : my backup files have strange privileges : every file is ---------x or ----------\r\n \r\n24-Jun-2009 09:05 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nPlease verify with iPhone 3.0GM. (7A341)\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether or not you continue to experience this issue with the newly released software by updating this bug report.\r\nBut changing the privileges to 644 does not make the problem go away.\r\n\r\n02-Apr-2009 02:38 AM Yann Bizeul:\r\nUninstalling Developer Tools using /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools and reinstalling 9m2717 did fix this issue, so this is definitively a 9m2725 bug.\r\nSide note : 9m2717 did crash when trying to restore backups that had files with mode ---------x or ----------, I had to chmod manually before.\r\n\r\n24-Jun-2009 09:05 PM Patrick Collins :\r\nPlease verify with iPhone 3.0GM.
