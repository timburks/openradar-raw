    description: "01-Apr-2009 09:34 AM Michael Rowe:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using \"Relocate masters...\" to move referenced masters to a new volume, copies of the master files for any non-top images in stacks are left in the old location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect a stack of images that have referenced masters.\r\nChoose File/Relocate master from the menu.\r\nOpen Finder in the old location\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll master images should be on the new volume and no longer on the old volume.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll images are in the new location, but all except the top-of-the-stack image are still on the old volume also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n09-Apr-2009 09:22 AM Michael Rowe:\r\n- is stack open or closed when selecting it?\r\n\r\nI was relocating about 16,000 masters, so I'm sure there were instances of both. I didn't try to determine whether the state of the stack made any difference, sorry.\r\n\r\n- if opened, are all items in it selected?\r\n\r\nI don't believe any items were selected, in stacks or otherwise, as I was relocating all masters from the \"Library\" view.\r\n\r\n- relocating a local volume on machine or external one?\r\n\r\nI was relocating from an internal local volume to one on a USB-attached external drive (local not network).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27-Apr-2009 09:16 AM Michael Rowe:\r\nClosed by Apple as \"could not reproduce\"."
