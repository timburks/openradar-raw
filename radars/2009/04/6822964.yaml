    description: "23-Apr-2009 06:28 PM Kyle McKay:\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nApple provides an adjusted postfix configuration file to increase security.\r\n\r\nThis file, /etc/postfix/main.cf, contains the line:\r\n\r\n  inet_interfaces = localhost\r\n\r\nwhich is intended to reduce exposure and improve security.  Unfortunately, that prevents postfix from offering both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on localhost.\r\n\r\nInstead the following lines should be used:\r\n\r\n  inet_protocols = all\r\n  inet_interfaces = loopback-only\r\n\r\nWhich also only binds to the localhost loopback interface, but WILL provide both IPv4 AND IPv6 connections.\r\n\r\nEXPECTATION:\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mac OS X is shipped pretty-much IPv6 enabled/ready.  The expectation is that postfix will ship with a similar IPv6 enabled/ready configuration and it currently does not.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND:\r\n\r\nManually edit the configuration file."
