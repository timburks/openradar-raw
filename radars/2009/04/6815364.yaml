    description: "22-Apr-2009 12:19 AM Jason Boehle:\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently it appears that Apple's license for Mac OS X Leopard (non-Server) does not allow the OS to be virtualized (ie installed as a guest OS in VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop).\r\n\r\nThis is asinine.  As an iPhone developer, I have a need to install Mac OS X in VMWare to be able to keep previous versions of the iPhone SDK installed and working without being corrupted by later updates.\r\n\r\nI also have a need to install the iPhone 3.0 beta SDK into a virtualized instance of OS X, so as to keep that install from corrupting my main 2.2 SDK install that I use to build updates for my iPhone app.\r\n\r\nIf Apple can allow virtualization of OS X Leopard Server, there is absolutely no reason why OS X Leopard Client should not be allowed as well (only on Apple hardware, obviously!)."
