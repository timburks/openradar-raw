    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I open an encrypted PDF in Preview.app, I have to reenter the password because it doesn't seem to save it into Keychain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an encrypted PDF, such as an Apress eBook (http://apress.com/book/view/9781430216261)\r\n2. Enter password in the Preview prompt to access the PDF.\r\n3. Close PDF.\r\n4. Reopen PDF to find blank password prompt again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected that when I reopened the PDF, my previously entered password would have been saved in Keychain so that that I would bypass the password prompt and be able to view the PDF automatically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, Preview always asks for the password again."
