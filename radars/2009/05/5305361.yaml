    description: "30-Jun-2007 08:46 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nAfter I edit a photo in Graphic Converter (currently 5.9.5 PPC, although this predates 5.9.5PPC) and return to iPhoto, the thumbnails are not updated. On the other hand, if I Edit the image within iPhoto I see the current edited version.\r\n\r\n\r\n20-Apr-2008 04:18 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nI cropped. I have verified this remains wrong in iPhoto 7.1.3 (364) with GC 6.1 (current), and yes, it was launched through Edit in external editor.\r\n\r\n08-Jun-2008 12:20 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nThis is still quite broken. I crop in GC 6.1, and when I return to iPhoto the thumbnails haven't changed. I maually rebuilt thumbnails (more difficult than it should be, because iPhoto tends to ask about finding another Library, which I don't want, and the keys to rebuild aren't in the docs where they should be).\r\n\r\nAfter rebuilding, one of the photos is still screwed up. When I hit Enter for the onscreen editor, I get the cropped/zoomed version I saved from GC, then iPhoto spontaneously (and consistently) switches to the uncropped version. See capture -- I just hit Enter, Esc, Enter, Esc.\r\n\r\n\r\n'reppep-iphoto-20080608.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jun-2008 12:49 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nOh, and the 640*480 resolution with 5mbyte size is another tipoff that things are scrambled.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 2.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Jun-2008 12:51 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nAlso, iPhoto seems to send the original to GC, which breaks Revert to Original.\r\n\r\n11-May-2009 12:18 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nIt's still broken. I sent 4 7mb photos to GC from iPhoto 8.0.2 (402), cropped them (only) in GC, and when I returned to iPhoto, 3 were cropped but 1 was still the original. I Saved As to the Desktop in GC, and imported that into iPhoto. That got the cropped photo (properly recognized) into my library.\r\n\r\n11-May-2009 12:18 AM Chris Pepper:\r\nOh, and this time it wasn't just thumbnails in the listing view, but Edit in Window showed the original too."
