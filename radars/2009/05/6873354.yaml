    description: "Summary: \r\nA subset of my apps have no icon after being restored immediately after installing iPhone OS 3.0 beta 5.\r\n\r\nThe apps can be launched, but holding down on them to make them \"jiggle\", or attempting to move them in any other way (e.g. by \"jiggle-ifying\" another app) crashes Springboard. It also appears that performing a swipe gesture over them occasionally crashes Springboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnable to reproduce at this time\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll apps should have icons\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome apps do not have icons, and attempts to move/delete result in a Springboard crash\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n3G with 3.0 beta 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have tried re-synching and rebooting the device, but the problem persists."
