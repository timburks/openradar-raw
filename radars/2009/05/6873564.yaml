    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like some way to add comments to attributes, relationships, fetched properties, fetch requests, and entities in Xcode’s data modeller.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an existing .xcdatamodel file which contains entities, attributes, relationships, fetched properties, and fetch requests.\r\n2. Select an entity.\r\n3. Select an attribute.\r\n4. Select a relationship.\r\n5. Select a fetched property.\r\n6. Select a fetch request.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSteps #2 through #6 should cause the UI to show a text field labelled Comments.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such comment field, unless you abuse one of the existing fields for the purpose (a terrible idea) or use separate documentation (perhaps in the headers for the entities’ classes—which, sadly, does not make them available in the data modeller).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther tools which use .xcdatamodel files—I’m thinking of Jonathan “Wolf” Rentzsch’s excellent mogenerator here—could copy the comments out to generated .h files for added glee."
