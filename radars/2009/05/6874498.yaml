    description: "When renaming a file via one of the many mechanisms available to a Cocoa programmer (NSFileManager, BSD rename(), FSRenameUnicode()), the Finder seems to think it needs to reposition the icon for the file.  While in list view, this isn't much of a problem but for users who rely on icons remaining in the same place, it's not the best user experience.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n1) Compile this short, horribly unsafe, C program:\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\nint main( int argc, char *argv[] )\r\n{\r\n\treturn( rename( argv[1], argv[2] ) );\r\n}\r\n\r\n2) Set a Finder window to Icon view, stick a \"test.txt\" file in there.\r\n3) cd to that same directory and run \"rename test.txt test2.txt\"\r\n4) Watch as the Finder repositions the icon to some other location\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRenaming a file programmatically should not reposition the file's icon in the Finder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRenaming a file programmatically repositions the file's icon in the Finder.  Renaming it again causes it to jump to yet another new location, and so on.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nRenaming the file back to what it was puts the file back into it's original location but that doesn't help much as the file is then not renamed."
