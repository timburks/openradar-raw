    description: "03-May-2009 10:17 AM Kyle McKay:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe ps utility is supposed to indicate stopped jobs with a 'T' in the state column.  It does not do this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1. Execute the following at a bash shell prompt:\r\n\r\n  yes& sleep 0.1; killall -STOP yes\r\n\r\n2. You now have a stopped process.  Execute the following at a shell prompt:\r\n\r\n  ps -o state,command | grep [y]es\r\n\r\n3. Notice how the state is 'S' instead of 'T' for the stopped yes process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that ps will show stopped jobs.  It does this with a 'T' indicator (see man ps) on other systems and functions properly prior to 10.5.x on Mac OS X systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\n\r\nThis used to work properly on 10.4.x and prior versions of Mac OS X.  It has been broken since 10.5.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nWorks correctly on 10.4.x and earlier and Linux as well as pretty much every other unix-like system out there.\r\n\r\n03-May-2009 11:13 AM Kyle McKay:\r\nCORRECTION:  Doesn't work properly on 10.4.11 either.  Known to work properly on much older versions of Mac OS X though which I no longer have installed anywhere to test with.\r\n\r\n06-May-2009 07:53 AM KIT CHEUNG :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate. We are tracking this known issue under the Bug ID listed above in the bug State (Duplicate/XXXX)."
