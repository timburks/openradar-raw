    description: "31-Mar-2009 11:07 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe attached file is a program with many individual codecs; these have different functions which happen to have the same name as each other. When opened in Shark static analysis, it sorts these functions to the top and gives everything else Self/Total 0.0%.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug; it assigns each function frequency 1 then merges all the different functions with the same name. There are two problems here:\r\n\r\n1. the Self field isn't being used for anything useful. I would like to see it use function size, since there isn't any convenient way to view this (without writing scripts to get it out of nm) and it's certainly useful for optimizing binary size.\r\n2. every function in a linked binary is different, even if they have the same name. The linker should already have merged identical functions. If it doesn't, that's an ld bug, surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n'shark-static-analysis-totals.tar.bz2' was successfully uploaded"
