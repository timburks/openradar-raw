    description: "A common problem when sending emails with attachments is that the sender writes about the attachment in the email, but forgets to actually attach the file. In this case Mail should warn the user when clicking the send button.\r\n\r\nSuch a system could work by recognizing specific words in the email body, and alerting the user when such words are present but an attachment is missing. A Mail plugin doing exactly this has been published here:\r\nhttp://home.cc.gatech.edu/eaganj/MailApp\r\n\r\nA more complex system could use a classifier to detect a missing attachment. The paper '“Sorry, I Forgot the Attachment:” Email Attachment Prediction' by Dredze et al describes such a system:\r\nhttp://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/publications/attachment_ceas06.pdf\r\n\r\nMillions of unnecessary \"you forgot to attach the file\" email could be spared!"
