    description: "I've posted about this on the iPhone 3.0 SDK section of the Developer Forums:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/16000?tstart=15\r\n\r\nEssentially, at some point during my use of OS 3.0 beta 4, Xcode started to claim I had no development certificates. The Xcode build from the current shipping (2.2.1) release is still fine, however. All my certificates and private keys are located in the login keychain. Screenshots are attached to the posts in the forum, for those who have access to the 3.0 beta SDK forums."
