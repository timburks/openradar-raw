    description: "31-Mar-2009 11:21 AM Alexander Strange:\r\nSummary:\r\nDuplicating a built-in config (and possibly other ways of creating new configs) in Shark gives a warning about how modifying built-in configs won't be saved, when I haven't changed any of them.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Shark.\r\n2. Open the configuration editor (Config -> Editâ€¦)\r\n3. Click on \"L2 Cache Miss Profile (Intel Core 2)\".\r\n4. Click Duplicate.\r\n5. Click OK.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nNo warning.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\"You have modified a built-in config. Changes to built-in configs are not saved to disk.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nnone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. I thought I remembered some other problems with the editor (changes not working, configuration entries coming up with the wrong color, and once the UI text all turned green for no apparent reason) but I can't reproduce it.\r\n2. If there were L1 cache miss/branch misprediction profiles I wouldn't have to go making them; those are some reasonable next steps after dealing with bigger problems.\r\n3. It's very hard to figure out what CPU counters to use, without looking in the VTune manual for everything."
