    description: "This is a duplicate of #6361509 which was closed as Behaves Correctly, but I'd like to bring the issue up again.\r\n\r\nThe Cocoa exception handler is designed to let common bugs like out-of-bounds array reads and putting nil objects in arrays and dictionaries fail in a non-catastrophic manner: the thread jumps back to the run loop and the application continues. Sometimes the action that was interrupted is critical and the app \"jumps the rails\", but more often than not these kind of bugs manifest themselves as \"I clicked the button and nothing happened\". That's a lot more user-friendly than crashing, especially when the trigger might not be as obvious to the user (or the programmer, for that matter) as clicking a certain button. I feel that the runtime's tolerance for these types of bugs is an important part of what makes Cocoa a joy for developers and helps them make applications that are pleasant to use.\r\n\r\nSo, back to the original bug: When an exception is thrown inside a CoreAnimation transaction, the transaction is never closed. This can happen not only inside an explicit CATransaction that my code has invoked, but in any of the various delegate callbacks or subclassed methods I might be using. The end result is that all CoreAnimation content freezes--the app becomes completely useless. Compare that to the same situation using an AppKit UI, where more often than not the app has a small hiccup and continues as before.\r\n\r\nYes, of course we shouldn't trigger exceptions, and we should always ship entirely bug-free software, always. But bugs do happen, and one of the many great things about Cocoa is that it can often cope gracefully when they do."
