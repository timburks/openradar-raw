    description: "10-May-2009 05:36 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nTime Capsule has been complaining for a few days that it cannot connect to the backup drive. I cannot mount it manually with \"open afp://rtc.rep.dom/pepper/\" either -- I get an error that no additional connections are allowed, but it's a private server, at most used by TM on 3 Macs.\r\n\r\nThe log (attached) shows entries like this:\r\n\r\nMay 10 17:26:29\tSeverity:3\tAFP login failed from pepper@10.0.104.216.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'rtc Log.txt' and 'reppep.prowler.9G55.2009-05-10.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-May-2009 05:40 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nHere's the error window.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Picture 1.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-May-2009 05:56 PM Chris Pepper:\r\nAfter reboot, TM was able to reconnect & back up."
