    description: "Summary:\r\nNSSpeechPitchBaseProperty and NSSpeechPitchModProperty are listed, but they are not defined in the current documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load up http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSSpeechSynthesizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Speech_Synthesizer_Property_Keys.\r\n2. Hit ⌘F and search for “pitch”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind NSSpeechPitchBaseProperty and NSSpeechPitchModProperty, along with definitions explaining the purpose, type, and (if applicable) range of these properties.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind a list of property names, including NSSpeechPitchBaseProperty and NSSpeechPitchModProperty, but no definitions.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly to the extent that NSSpeechSynthesizer is now the only recommended speech-synthesis API. Previously, it was a peer to the Speech Synthesis Manager, which was (at the time) the only API that supported these properties, and which does define them. Now, Speech Synthesis Manager and its documentation are deprecated, and NSSpeechSynthesizer does not offer its own definitions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSpeech Synthesis Manager defines pitch base and modulation in Inside Macintosh: Sound (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/Sound/Sound-190.html#MARKER-2-95). There is no matching definition either in the NSSpeechSynthesizer class reference or in the Speech programming guide."
