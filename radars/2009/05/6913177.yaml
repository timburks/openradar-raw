    description: "21-May-2009 05:02 PM Preston Holmes:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nthe 10.5.7 installer installs:\r\n\r\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.su.startup.plist\r\n\r\nwhich calls the installed:\r\n\r\n/private/etc/com.apple.su.startup/su.startup shell script\r\n\r\nwhich checks for securityd and then runs the tool\r\n\r\n/private/etc/com.apple.su.startup/authsysprintadmin_\r\n\r\nwhich, I’m assuming, is what makes the edits on first boot to /etc/authorization\r\n\r\nhowever that tool seems to be intel only…\r\n\r\nbash-3.2# /usr/bin/lipo -info /Volumes/OS-Build-09-05-15/etc/com.apple.su.startup/authsysprintadmin\r\n\r\nNon-fat file: /Volumes/OS-Build-09-05-15/etc/com.apple.su.startup/authsysprintadmin is architecture: i386\r\n\r\nI checked and it is intel only regardless of the architecture of the machine the updater runs on and changes to /etc/authorization are not made on PPC machines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install 10.5.7 updater to a < 10.5.7 PPC machine\r\n2. Reboot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanges to /etc/authorization should have been made to support parental control of printer management and for managed network users\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBecause the tool was intel only, no changes were made on PPC hardware\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs on any PPC hardware and is most notable in situations where there are MCX managed printers because it causes an authorization dialog for managedpreferences app to appear over the login window - which makes logins impossible\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA complete write up is here:\r\nhttp://ptone.com/dablog/2009/05/1057-fails-to-update-ppc-machines-properly/\r\n\r\nnote the attached config information is from an unaffected macbook, but was required for bug submission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'element.spx' was successfully uploaded"
