    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding a new bookmark in Mobile Safari on the iPhone, the bookmark URL field cannot be edited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open MobileSafari\r\n2. Browse to an arbitrary page\r\n3. Click the add-bookmark button (+)\r\n4. Tap, swipe, or otherwise gesture over the URL field in the sheet that appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat field should become editable, just as the Title field above it is\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would go a long way toward being able to save bookmarklets and such, on-device. Note that solving this does not offer a penultimate solution for a user-friendly way to solve this problem, only that it improves the situation incrementally.\r\n\r\nRelated bugs: <rdar://5935641> <rdar://6589436>"
