    description: "Summary: \r\nAn NSURL created with -[NSURL initWithScheme:host:path:] where the path is \"/\" returns *double* slashes at the end when you ask for its absoluteURL.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In code, create an NSURL like this:\r\nNSURL *theURL = [[NSURL alloc] initWithScheme:@\"http\" host:@\"www.apple.com\" path:@\"/\"];\r\n\r\n2. Ask the URL for its absoluteString\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe URL should look like this:\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks like this -- note the double /\r\nhttp://www.apple.com//\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've tried passing in NULL or @\"\" to the path parameter but those are illegal and trigger an exception.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterestingly, when I query the URL for its path, it returns \"/\" - just as a URL created from a string with -[NSURL initWithString:@\"http://www.apple.com/\" does.  So why is it showing the extra slash when I ask for its absolute URL?  Is there a work-around to create the URL properly so that its absolute string only shows the single trailing slash?"
