    description: "Summary:\r\nMac OS X's public APIs for obtaining processor-usage information returns the counts in centiseconds; it does not have a public API for obtaining the same information at a higher resolution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search the headers in /usr/include/mach and the xnu source code for a function or selector to the existing functions that can return higher-resolution processor-usage numbers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind such a function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFind none.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I know, Mac OS X has never had such a function in public API.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooking in the xnu-1228.12.14 source, I see that the kernel has the numbers in absolute time internally, but does not give them up to user processes. You could simply expose those numbers, and let user processes perform any appropriate conversions to real units (e.g., nanoseconds) if necessary.\r\n\r\nMy application is a CPU-usage monitor, so I wouldn't even need to do that: division works regardless of units, and would be most precise with the absolute-time numbers. That said, even milliseconds would be a tenfold improvement, allowing me to show accurate numbers at much higher update frequencies, or to show tenths of a percent at the existing frequency."
