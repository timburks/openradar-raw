    description: "06-May-2008 08:07 PM Alexander Strange:\r\n* SUMMARY\r\nThe attached .o shows the right source line, but the wrong file, when opened in static analysis.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Open h264.o in Static Analysis.\r\n2. Show \"decode_cabac_residual\".\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe first instruction should have Source: 'h264.c:5393'.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nIt shows 'cabac.h:5393'.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is some inline asm in this function, so it has to interpret some instructions with missing debug info.\r\n\r\nAttached are:\r\n- h264.i - Preprocessed source\r\n- source/* - original two files, probably not interesting\r\n- h264.o - compiled\r\n- staticanalysis.mshark - copy of the static analysis profile\r\n\r\nIt was compiled with:\r\ngcc -g -fomit-frame-pointer -mdynamic-no-pic -O3 -fno-math-errno -c h264.i\r\nusing\r\ngcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5480)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'shark-dwarf2-wrongfilename.zip' and 'asmbook.spx' were successfully uploaded"
