    description: "Although Spain has a localized Spanish App Store, the latin american countries such as Mexico have not. All Spanish speaking countries should display the iTunes Store in Spanish instead of English.\r\n\r\nWe have a localized Spanish version of our iPhone app and our experience is that most Mexican users are not aware of this because the description is displayed in English. A localized version of the App Store for these countries would generate additional mutual sales."
