    description: "Summary: \r\n\tI am working on InstaDMG, and have just completed adding a chroot jail for installs. However, I am finding that distribution scripts in flat-packages are executing outside the chroot jail, and so are testing things in the host filesystem (rather than the one they are supposed to be chrooted into). This is posing a problem as updates are not getting installed into the target OS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n0. Make sure that your booted OS (10.5.7) has  the iLifeSupport9.0.2.pkg installed on it already.\r\n\r\n1. Mount a target filesystem that is a new install + the 10.5.7 update at /Volumes/TARGET\r\n\r\n2. Copy the iLifeSupport9.0.2.pkg package into the target at /Volumes/TARGET/tmp/iLifeSupport9.0.2.pkg\r\n\r\n3. Execute the following command:\r\n\r\nchroot /Volumes/TARGET /usr/sbin/installer -pkg /tmp/iLifeSupport9.0.2.pkg -target /\r\n\r\n4. After the install completes look in /Volumes/TARGET/Library/Receipts/iLifeMediaBrowser_v2.pkg\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\tI would expect the install to have looked inside the chroot and noticed that the package was not installed, and to have installed it. Packages without version checking in their Distribution scripts work just fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\tThe versions on the host OS are examined (reaching outside the chroot jail, and regardless of target), and so nothing is installed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\tNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\tAn increasing number of institutions are starting to use InstaDMG to produce their images to put on large numbers of systems, and this negatively impacts they sys-admins that need to produce these images. A short list of institutions that I know use this and are stuck with bad work-arounds: Stanford, Yale, Adobe, PennState. I know there are many others."
