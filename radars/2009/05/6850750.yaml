    description: "02-May-2009 08:11 PM Kyle McKay:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe __thread keyword as described in:\r\n\r\n  http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/DeveloperTools/gcc-4.0.1/gcc/Thread_002dLocal.html\r\n\r\ndoes not work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1. Do the following from a shell prompt:\r\n\r\n  echo '__thread int x;' | gcc -c -x c -\r\n\r\n2. Notice the error message \"thread-local storage not supported for this target\"\r\n\r\n3. It doesn't matter what \"-arch\" value is used, any supported \"-arch\" value or MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET value produces the same error message.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULT:\r\n\r\nWorks great on other platforms (especially Linux).  The expectation is that it will work on Darwin/Mac OS X as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n__thread is a very convenient programming tool when using threads.  Porting applications that make use of __thread to Darwin/Mac OS X is greatly complicated by lack of support for __thread.\r\n\r\nAlthough the following message:\r\n\r\n  http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2006/Jun/msg00550.html\r\n\r\nsuggests that the specification of thread-local storage (tls) is ELF specific, it really isn't.  In fact the document referred to by the gcc page referenced in \"SUMMARY:\" describes the required implementation details and they are easily implemented on Darwin/Mac OS X without any need for ELF.  The document is here:\r\n\r\n  http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf\r\n\r\n06-May-2009 07:53 AM KIT CHEUNG :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
