    description: "28-May-2009 08:53 AM Daniel Pasco:\r\nI'm working on an application that uses OpenAL as well as microphone input for a customer.  I've been ripping my hair out for a few days, because the play and record mode necessary to get microphone input is playing hell with the OpenAL audio.\r\n \r\nHere's the basic outline\r\n \r\n1.  I have some audio subunit code that listens for incoming microphone data.\r\n2.  I do analysis of the data in a rendering callback method.\r\n3.  I don't want the microphone audio playing through the speakers, so the last thing that I do in the render method is clear all of the audio buffer data I've been given.\r\n \r\nIf I'm doing this using the AudioFX class from the SDK samples, everything works fine (in fact, this audio code is at least four months old and has worked great in other applications).\r\n \r\nOn the other hand, using OpenAL for audio playback with this code produces wide variety of interesting effects\r\n \r\n  Under OS 2.2.1\r\n     Clearing the microphone data buffer appears to have no effect, and so the playback is full of echos and choppy.\r\n \r\nUnder 3.0\r\n     With data buffer cleared:\r\n          The application becomes TOTALLY silent (no audio of any kind)\r\n \r\n     With data buffer left intact:\r\n          The application simply generates a profuse amount of white noise and scratchy static.\r\n \r\nI'm thinking that this might be an Apple bug, but I guess I'm wondering if you've ever seen anything like this.  Maybe there's something that I could be doing to make this a little nicer with OpenAL?\r\n\r\n28-May-2009 08:59 AM Daniel Pasco:\r\n'oalTouchPlayRecord.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-May-2009 09:06 AM Daniel Pasco:\r\n'SystemServicesAudioTest.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n28-May-2009 09:10 AM Daniel Pasco:\r\nI have uploaded two projects, 'oalTouchPlayRecord,' which demonstrates the issue with OpenAL, and 'systemServicesAudioTest,' which demonstrates the expected lack of passthrough when using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound.\r\n\r\nI'm open to the idea that I may not be handling the output of the microphone correctly, somehow, and will continue to troubleshoot this, but I would very much appreciate having someone else take a look at this and see if they can reproduce the problem or not.\r\n\r\nMost of this code is derived from the aurioTouch sample code.  The parts that I believe are relevant to this report are: \r\n\r\n  SetupRemoteIO() in aurio_helper.cpp\r\n\r\n  setup() in AudioMonitor.mm\r\n  renderAudio() in AudioMonitor.mm\r\n\r\n-Daniel"
