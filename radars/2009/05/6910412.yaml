    description: "Summary: \r\nMac OS X’s calculators, Calculator.app and the Dashboard calculator widget, do not follow the widespread calculator convention of allowing double presses of operator keys to repeat calculations where only one operand changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Calculator.app.\r\n2. Press the following sequence of keys: 5 * * 5 = 1 0 =\r\n3. Repeat in Dashboard calculator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n50.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n10. (The calculator does not consider any operation to be in progress.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested in other versions, but likely to have occurred in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis works with the +, -, * and / operators on every physical calculator I’ve been able to test on, although the meaning with / varies by make (some treat the first number as the divisor rather than the dividend). On some calculators, it also works with other binary operators such as y^x. It also works with the iPhone calculator."
