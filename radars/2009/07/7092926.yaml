    description: "25-Jul-2009 10:07 PM Victor Costan:\r\nSummary:\r\nWildcard provisioning profiles are convenient. I only need one profile for all my apps, and I like that. Unfortunately, the wildcard profiles don't come with an aps-environment entitlement, so they can't be used for applications with Push Notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the iPhone Developer Program site to generate a wildcard development provisioning profile.\r\n2. Print the profile's content, look at the Entitlements section in the embedded plist. Notice that there's no aps-environment setting.\r\n3. Install the profile into Xcode.\r\n5. Create a sample iPhone application, with an entitlements file specifying aps-environment: development.\r\n6. Notice that the application cannot be run on a device because its entitlements don't match the provisioning profile.\r\n\r\n(proof that the entitlements are correct)\r\n7. Use the iPhone Developer Program site to generate an app-id for the application, enable push notifications, and generate a development provisioning profile for the application.\r\n8. Install the profile into Xcode, and now the application will run on a device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMost importantly, I wanted to be able to run the application at step 6. For that to happen, I think the wildcard provisioning profile generated at step 2 should have an aps-environment setting. Development certificates should have the \"development\" value, and distribution certificates should have the appropriate value for the production server (haven't checked that yet).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot run an application with push notifications entitlements using a wildcard provisioning profile, because wildcard profiles don't have an aps-environment entitlement. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo notes."
