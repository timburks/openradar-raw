    description: "10-Jul-2009 11:08 AM Yann Bizeul:\r\nTwo minor releases after, the same bug persists. I reported it using Safari bug report tool, looks like it had no effects, I may be lucky here.\r\n\r\nTo reporduce : \r\n- Enable Spaces\r\n- Assign Safari to a specific Space\r\n- Close all Safari windows or open a brand new one\r\n- Switch to another desktop\r\n- Click Safari icon in the Dock\r\n\r\nThen, the current space is switched to where Safari lies, Safari URL text field *seem* to be enabled, but typing text just beeps\r\n\r\nThis is really annoying, we must disable/enable Safari window to get it right\r\n\r\n10-Jul-2009 12:41 PM Yann Bizeul:\r\nIt happens only if your default page is \"Top SItes\""
