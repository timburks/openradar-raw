    description: "20-Jul-2009 06:36 PM Tom Harrington:\r\niPhone OS 3.0 has been displaying incorrect icons on third-party apps.\r\n\r\nTwo screenshots are attached:\r\n- One shows the \"GV Mobile Free\" app with the icon of the app \"Where\"\r\n- One shows the \"Public Radio\" app with the icon of the app \"MusicID\".  In addition to having the wrong icon, the icon is darkened as though it was being pressed.\r\n\r\nIn both cases all apps continue to operate normally.  Rebooting the phone did not change the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n20-Jul-2009 09:56 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nIncorrect icons are still displayed after syncing the device with iTunes.\r\n\r\n[For Openradar: screenshots available on request.]"
