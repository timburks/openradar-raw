    description: "The documentation says a MKAnnotationCalloutInfoDidChangeNotification should be posted in order when updating the content of mapview annotations.\r\n\r\nIt seems this is not needed because MapView uses Key-Value Observing to find out if annotation.title or annotation.subtitle has changed. The selected callout view updates just fine without sending the notification.\r\n\r\nIf the notification is needed for specific cases, the documentation should state that.\r\n\r\nFurthermore \r\n\r\n\"If your application changes the title or subtitle information for one of its notifications…\"\r\n\r\nshould be corrected to:\r\n\r\n\"If your application changes the title or subtitle information for one of its annotations…\""
