    description: "Summary:  While the organization of media in iTunes and iPhoto once made sense in the early days of the iPod, it is now totally confusing and failing Apples normal standards.\r\n\r\n1. Audio files of all sorts are generally stored in iTunes. There are three sections for audio files Music, Audiobooks and Podcasts however the type of audio files stored greatly exceeds this.\r\nAudio files include\r\n    a) Music (e.g. songs purchased from iTunes or ripped from a CD or produced in Garageband, Logic, etc.)\r\n    b) Actual Audiobooks purchased from iTunes/Audible.com\r\n    c) Audio-only podcasts\r\n    d) Voice memos synced from the iPhone\r\n    e) Audio chat recordings from iChat\r\n    f) Audio-only albumed programs downloaded from iTunes ADC,  iTunes U, etc.  These aren't really podcasts and have a fixed duration but consist of multiple associated files.  They tend to be very big so often it is desirable to separate these from other media synced to an iPhone or iPod. Additionally the concept of \"most recent episodes\", etc. does not apply here.)\r\n\r\n2. Photographs are generally generated by a camera or possible modification in Photoshop, etc. They are stored in iPhoto and the organization mostly makes sense. iTunes controls the syncing to the device but iPhoto stores the library. However,\r\n\r\n3. Videos. Now that the iPhone has video creation ability (and other cameras have for some time) Organization of videos makes absolutely no sense.  I will first describe the iPhone/camera generated videos and then discuss videos in general.\r\n\r\n3.1 iPhone created videos.  Videos recorded on the iPhone end up in the \"Camera Roll\" section of the Photos app. This is a little odd (videos in a photos app) but is generally consistent. However, iPhoto, not iTunes is the application which syncs the videos (and photos) and stores them in the iPhoto library.  iPhoto (as of 08 at least) is not capable of playing videos, resulting in a strange situation where the videos are synced to an app that can not play them. Additionally iTunes will not sync the videos from iPhoto back to the iPhone, they must manually be moved the iTunes library prior to sync. This is completely unintuitive and a bad experience, as the act of syncing removes videos from the iPhone with no obvious way of getting them back.\r\n\r\n3.2 As for video as a whole, we have multiple sources of video creation on the Mac (iMovie, Final Cut, etc.) in addition to videos purchased from iTunes, videos downloaded from the internet, videos generated from optical media (e.g. ripping of DVDs and so on) as well as videos created from still cameras and iPhones. Videos are organized in iTunes in 4 locations. Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts and somewhat strangely Music Videos in the Music section. However, the following classes of video exist.\r\n\r\na) Movies (e.g. Hollywood) purchased from iTunes or possibly ripped from the users DVD or other source material\r\nb) TV Shows purchased from iTunes or possibly  ripped from other material owned by the user\r\nc) Video podcasts obtained through iTunes or other channels\r\nd) Music Videos bought through iTunes or other channels (These are stored in Music, but they end up being very large relative to the size of other files in Music)\r\ne) iChat video recordings\r\nf) ADC, iTunes U and WWDC content which just as described for the audio section above has an \"album\" nature to it but is not really a video podcast, certainly is not a movie(!) (Even though they frequently show up there, but the Movies section does not display things in an Album format) and are not TV Shows\r\ng) User created video which does not really fall into any of the above categories (And indeed some of which is counterintuitively stored (unusably) in iPhoto)\r\n\r\n4. Documents. PDFs such as \"album bonus content\" and WWDC slides are synced into iTunes but get lost in all the other sections (Music or Movies or whatever) and don't really seem to belong anywhere. Additionally this content can not be synced to an iPhone or AppleTV.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand this does not entirely conform to the problem description format, however there is no precise problem other than the fact that the entire organization system is a mess. Additionally if desired I can break this up into several bugs, however the problem is really a systemic global problem to Apple's current media organization approach and I believe it deserves a systemic solution."
