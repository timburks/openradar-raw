    description: "* SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe HTML Tidy version, that is shipped with MacOSX 10.5.x is rather outdated.\r\nOn MacOSX 10.5.7, the shell command 'tidy --version' outputs a \"TML Tidy for Mac OS X released on 31 October 2006 - Apple Inc. build 13\".\r\n\r\nPlease update HTML Tidy and its core, TidyLib, to the latest official version (as time of this writing, this means version 25 March 2009) because of better functionality and several fixed bugs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the developers of Tidy, there do not exist official tagged release builds of Tidy/LibTidy but only the CVS HEAD source. Following that, the latest official release always means (is equivalent to) the latest CVS trunk/HEAD snapshot. The version string of Tidy is placed in tidy/src/version.h, at time of this writing, this is \"25 March 2009\".\r\n\r\nIn particular, many web developers rely on Tidy and its TidyLib and rely on its up-to-dateness to some degree.\r\nI would appreciate, if Apple's HTML Tidy would keep up to some degree with the latest official (meaning: CVS HEAD) version of the HTML Tidy project. Therefore, it should be updated/synced with the official sources more often than so far.\r\n\r\n* NOTES\r\nFor details, see http://tidy.sourceforge.net/"
