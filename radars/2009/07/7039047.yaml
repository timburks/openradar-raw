    description: "It's currently a big hassle to download sales and trend info from iTunes connect. The web interface is slow, awkward and annoying. Daily sales reports are up for only seven days, so we have to log in manually at least once every seven days to manually download data, or we lose that information. There's not even a next/previous navigation methods, so to download data for several days requires going back to the sales page, selecting the next date from the dropdown, then submitting.\r\n\r\nIt would be much nicer if there were an API that would allow us to develop better, automated, methods for collecting and aggregating our sales data.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice if the API would allow access to crash reports and the associated info from those pages as well.\r\n\r\nSee bug 6807195."
