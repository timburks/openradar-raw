    description: "Note: Apple has replied that this is a duplicate of: radar://6062932\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n\tIt seems that the PluginDestroy in AuthorizationPlugins used in the loginwindow does not get called. This would normally be used to free() memory malloced and to release plugin-wide resources. For most code this is not a big deal, as the the authorizationhost exists shortly after it taking the malloc'ed memory with it. But code could need to release external resources.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Download and install a plugin that logs when the PluginDestroy is called. I have included sample code.\r\n\r\nThe AuthenticationPluginTemplate code, compiled in \"debug\" mode, will log all of the events to the syslog. Remember to put the code in place, and then create the appropriate entry in /etc/authorization.\r\n\r\n2) Log into the computer so that the plugin runs. Check /var/log/system.log, filtering for \"authorizationhost\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\tThe code should log the \"Plugin finishing\" and \"Plugin finished\" messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\tAll of the other start and end messages for the other methods are logged, but not the PluginDestroy messages.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\tUnknown, but this is also in the current seeding version of 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\tOthers on the apple-cdsa@lists.apple.com list have verified seeing this bug."
