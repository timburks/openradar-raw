    description: "I can't edit alarms on events to which I've been invited in iCal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Accept an event invitation in iCal\r\n2) Double click the event to bring up the inspector\r\n3) Click edit\r\n4) Edit/specify your alarm as needed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI set an alarm, so now I'm less likely to forget a meeting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no edit button, so you fail at step 3.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked fine in 10.4 to my recollection. I don't have a box to test that on. I see things around the internet that suggest it's a regression in some version of 10.5, but I can't prove that either.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can almost work around this by specifying a default alarm - however, you still have to *know* what the alarm settings need to be for a given event before it's imported. Heaven forbid you change your mind."
