    description: "Occasionally the iPhone's battery indicator will remain on full charge for a long period after charging has occurred. There are no indicators that the battery is being used. No 20% or 10% remaining warning dialogs appear. One time the iPhone seemingly shut down spontaneously. The next time I noticed the battery suspiciously full after nearly two days of use I powered it off.  When I powered it back on I got the 10% warning dialog and the battery indicator looked correct.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the cause or exactly how to reproduce this issue yet, but I suspect it might have to do with charging from my MacBook with iTunes running. In a hurry I have unplugged the iPhone without clicking the eject button in iTunes, but I'm not sure that's the cause."
