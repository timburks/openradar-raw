    description: "--Information covers details released during the WWDC 09 Keynote--\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSnow Leopard Exchange support requires the Exchange Server to be version 2007, while the iPhone on the other hand does not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Don't know what Exchange Server version your company is running, or don't know that Snow Leopard requires 2007, or know and just not care and try anyways.\r\n2. Setup your iPhone to an Exchange Server not running Exchange Server 2007 and the connection works.\r\n3. Setup Mail under Snow Leopard to the same Exchange Server (not version 2007) and the connection does not work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSnow Leopard should allow the same Exchange Server support as the iPhone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSnow Leopard can not handle older Exchange Servers older than 2007 yet the older released iPhone firmware can handle older exchange servers, therefore causing a disconnection and a very bad usability situation for the user.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happens with Snow Leopard and iPhone firmwares that support Exchange, such as 3.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
