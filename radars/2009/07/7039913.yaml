    description: "Summary:\r\nCode to do pinch to zoom on an image will only work on 3.0 if compiled for 3.0 only.\r\nIf compiled for say 2.1 (or anything less than 3) then the code works on a device running 2.2.1 but not on 3.0.\r\nIf that exact same code is compiled for 3.0 then it will work fine on 3.0, but of course the older firmwares are left out.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious bug as it makes it impossible to target 3.0 and older firmwares without releasing two separate apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile included sample project for a SDK less than 3.0 (IE: Device - 2.2.1)\r\n2. Install app on a DEVICE running a firmware less than 3.0 using Xcode\r\n3. Run app and try pinch and zoom. (notice that it works)\r\n4. Close app and return to Xcode\r\n5. Change the device to install onto, to a device running firmware 3.0\r\n6. Install app on the device running firmware 3.0\r\n7. Run app and try pinch and zoom. (notice that it does NOT work)\r\n8. Close app and return to Xcode\r\n9. Change the SDK to compile as, to 3.0, leaving the device selected as the same 3.0 device.\r\n10. Recompile and install on 3.0 device\r\n11. Run app and try pinch and zoom. (notice that now it works with NO code changes!)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should still work on 3.0 devices when compiled for a non-3.0 sdk, as all of the API methods are the same, therefore allowing for a single build to work on 2.x firmwares as well as 3.0 firmwares.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are forced to compile and release 2 separate apps to be able to target both 2.x and 3.x firmwares when not using any 3.0 API's.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have tested this on the following:\r\n* 1st Gen iPhone running 2.2.1\r\n* 2nd Gen iPod Touch running 3.0\r\n* iPhone 3GS running 3.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have included a sample project that shows this bug.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n08-Jul-2009 11:01 AM Dallas Brown:\r\nThis bug is invalid as brought to my attention by jhs in the dev forums, the sample has a UIView set to a UIScrollView which is causing the issue.\r\n\r\nOnce changed to a real UIScrollView it works on both devices when compiled for 2.1.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
