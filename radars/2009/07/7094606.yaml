    description: "Workflow for producing our publications depends heavily on multiple systems accessing an AFP-mounted volume.\r\n\r\n10.5.6 and 10.5.7 break our applications:\r\n\r\n- After some time, clients no longer see new files added to the AFP volume\r\n- After some time, clients no longer see modifications to files on the AFP volume, old (apparently cached) data is presented to the applications\r\n\r\nI can not stress enough what a serious problem this is. OS X versions after 10.5.5 (which works flawlessly) have been entirely useless to us.\r\n\r\nThe behavior in 10.5.7 seems slightly improved vs 10.5.6, meaning it takes longer for the problem to show. But it still does. Rebooting is the only way for clients to see new data.\r\n\r\nThe above systems are clean installs/updates, the only software installed are our applications which are clean Cocoa Apps that do nothing unusual.\r\n\r\nThe behavior appears independent of the server system used (OS X server 10.4, 10.5, Solaris, Linux)."
