    description: "IKImageBrowserView wants an object implementing IKImageBrowserDataSource, which gives it objects implementing IKImageBrowserItem, which gives it an NSImage.\r\n\r\nI wrote a simple application using the browser view, but I only had an NSArray of NSImage. This meant that I had to implement IKImageBrowserDataSource, passing it through to the nearly-identical calls to NSArray. This could be added easily as a category of NSArray, or it could just accept one directly.\r\n\r\nMore noticeably, I had to write a category for NSImage implementing IKImageBrowserItem. This is trivial, of course, it just has to return itself as its imageRepresentation. Since I don't see any mention of this in the documentation (well, and my app doesn't print duplicate category warnings), it would be great if this could be added at some point, since it'd make writing very low-complexity browser view uses even simpler."
