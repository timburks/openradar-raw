    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a user first uses the geolocation feature of an app, the iPhone OS displays a dialog asking the user if they want to allow the app to use their current location.  Normally this displays the name of the application.  However, when JavaScript in an hybrid application accesses navigator.geolocation, the alert gives the Unix path of the containing HTML file.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an iPhone application that uses UIWebView to display HTML.\r\nCreate an HTML file for embedding within the app bundle.\r\nAdd a button to the HTML that calls navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition().\r\nLaunch the app on the phone for the first time.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nAn alert appears: \r\n\"Have2P\" would like to use your current location \r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\nAn alert appears: \r\n\"/var/mobile/Applications/C4B961D6-E388-4BAC-99AD-D22022723FD30/Have2PG.app/www/index.html\" would like to use your current location\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis occurs in both the iPhone Simulator and an iPhone running OS 3.0."
