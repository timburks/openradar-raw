    description: "29-Jul-2009 11:51 PM Justin Williams:\r\nSummary: \r\nWhen an action is attached to an NSSegmentedControl, the menu attached to a specific segment cell is not accessible via a single click, only click & hold.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Run attached sample project. \r\n2. Click on Segment 1.  It will output to the log.\r\n2. Click on segment 2.  It won't do anything.\r\n2. Click and hold on segment 2.  The menu will drop down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I have a menu attached to a segment, it should drop down the menu no matter if I single click or click & hold, regardless of whether there is an action attached to the segment control or not.  \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu only appears when clicking & holding on the menu item.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only work around sucks.  I'm presently working around it by using some code to get the origin point of the segment control and popping up the context menu using NSMenu's popUpContextMenu:withEvent:forView but this is pretty hacktastic and looks bad compared to the standard behavior of having the menu drop down below the segmented control cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'SegmentSample.zip' was successfully uploaded"
