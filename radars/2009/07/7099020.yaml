    description: "Summary: \r\nThe CLLocation class contains not only the phone's current three-dimensional location but also course and speed information. However, while the location data includes altitude, the speed location is purely two-dimensional. I would like to see a verticalSpeed property added to CLLocation so that vertical speed can also be obtained.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen CLLocation.h, look at the list of properties.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA property declaration such as this should be seen:\r\n\r\n@property(readonly, nonatomic) CLLocationSpeed verticalSpeed;\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such property currently exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis property has never been available.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGPS inherently provides not only precise positioning data within three dimensional space but also precise three-dimensional velocity data. This velocity data is significantly more accurate than would be obtained by subtracting successive fixes, so simply subtracting altitudes from different fixes is not an adequate substitute.\r\n\r\nMy intended purpose is to use this velocity data to map the vertical movement of a sailplane in flight. However I'm sure there are many other applications. Since the hardware can provide it, the API should too."
