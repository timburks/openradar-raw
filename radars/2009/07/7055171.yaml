    description: "When selecting white text for copy and paste the text is imposible to see again the white background of the selection loupe. What I expected to see was the text presenting in a black colour for clear definition when using the loupe.\r\n\r\nTo recreate this bug 1) create a UITextBox with white coloured content, 2) then attempt to select this content.\r\n\r\nTim Davies."
