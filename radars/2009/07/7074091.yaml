    description: "Right now, the settings pane of 3rd party apps are complicated to access for the user. Especially, they require quitting the app, waiting until the 3rd party panes load in the settings app, navigating to the pane, changing a setting, then launching the app again.\r\n\r\nMore and more developers choose to integrate the settings right into the app to make it more comfortable for the user to change a setting. This leads to differently accessible settings in every second app. Not very user-friendly.\r\n\r\nWe propose the following ideas to help maintaining a uniform settings system:\r\n\r\n1. URL Handler\r\nAn URL Scheme like prefs://<app name> would directly launch the app's settings pane. This saves the user a few taps.\r\n\r\n2. Back Link\r\nIt should be possible to go back to the app from the settings pane. This could be solved by making the navigation title (that has the name of the app) hot. This would require no UI change whatsoever. On the other hand, it'd be a somewhat surprising UX. So perhaps better have one table row at the end with the App Icon and the title \"Launch <App Name\". Alternatively a \"Link Element\" (with title and URL) would allow the developer to specify such a link by himself.\r\n\r\n3. SettingsController\r\nTo avoid the app switch altogether, the settings could be accessible through a specialized modal view controller, similar to the AddressBookUI contact picker. This would allow the user to change settings using the same UI as in the settings app but without leaving the application. A delegate method could inform the app whether settings have been changed."
