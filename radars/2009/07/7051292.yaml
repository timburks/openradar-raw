    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Core Data version of the Navigation-based application template in iPhone SDK 3.0 contains a bug that will cause a crash if the user adds some entities and then deletes them all. I know this is supposed to be just a template, but it would be a big help for the Core Data newbie if the template didn't crash like this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Navigation-based application from the template. Be sure to select the \"Use Core Data for storage\" checkbox.\r\n\r\n2. Build and run the project\r\n\r\n3. Hit the + button to add a few entities\r\n\r\n4. Hit the edit button to put the list in edit mode\r\n\r\n5. delete all the entities\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should allow the user to delete all the entities. I expected the template to not contain a bug like this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nwhen the user deletes the last entity, the application crashes. Since the template is a starting point for new developers, it would be better if it contained a fix for this bug with some comments describing why the fix is needed and how it works.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe fix is described in the NSFetchedResultsController class reference documentation's typical use section."
