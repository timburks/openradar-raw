    description: "21-Jul-2009 02:32 PM Ben Stanfield:\r\nSummary: There is no way to control the number of podcasts I'd like on my device on a podcast-by-podcast basis. \r\n\r\nFor example, for large video podcasts like TED Talks, I may only want 1 or 2 unplayed episodes, while I might want the 20 most recent unplayed 1-minute Onion News audio casts, and for reference, I might want to keep all of the Lullabot podcasts both played and unplayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
