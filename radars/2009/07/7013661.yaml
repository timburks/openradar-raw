    description: "ummary:\r\nAn Apple Remote Desktop administrator has to manually change the keyboard settings on a remote machine, before being able to type with his preferred keyboard layout. A transparent keyboard layout translation would allow foreign administrators and Dvorak-aficionados to save time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure that the administratorâ€™s Mac has a different keyboard layout.\r\n2. Open a control connection to another Mac using Apple Remote Desktop.\r\n3. Type some text and special characters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe characters on the remote screen match the keys pressed with the local keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe characters do not match."
