    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nApplications which use UIImagePickerController to capture video for the user will typically want to have some graphical representation of that video for display in the user interface.\r\n\r\nCurrently, UIImagePickerController does not automatically generate a thumbnail for the delegate, and it is difficult to extract a frame using iPhone OS APIs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Implement UIImagePickerControllerDelegate\r\n2. Invoke UIImagePickerController to capture video.\r\n3. Observe, in -imagePickerController:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo: that there is no UIImage available in the info dictionary.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be a significant improvement if, in -imagePickerController:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:, the UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage key provided a representative video frame from the info dictionary as a UIImage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe value for UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage is nil when a video has been captured.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nTested on iPhone OS 3.0 and 3.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe main 3rd party libraries for decoding H.264 (x264 and xvid) are GPL-licensed and not suitable for use in commercial iPhone applications."
