    description: "21-Jul-2009 02:34 AM Jaka Jancar:\r\nI'm using UIScrollView + CATiledView on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nWhen I zoom in:\r\n - the low-res tiles are enlarged\r\n - in a fraction of a second, the higher-res tiles are loaded and\r\nfade-in over the low-res tiles\r\n\r\nThis looks super-cool.\r\n\r\nWhen I zoom out, I would expect the opposite:\r\n - the high-res tiles to be shrunk (borders would now be all jagged)\r\n - the lower-res tiles to fade in over them.\r\n\r\nHigh-res tiles shrink just fine until a lower-res level of detail is\r\navailable (or if there is none). But once there is, they are *wiped\r\nclean* (painted white) instead of staying there, like they do when\r\nzooming in.\r\n\r\nThis causes a momentary blanking of the screen between the wipe and\r\nwhen the new lower-res tiles are loaded, which is confusing to the\r\nuser."
