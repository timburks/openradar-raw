Flames shooting out of the dock connector would be nice.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. I must admit I was disappointed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis feature is new to 3.0 SDK. You've brought a little joy into the lives of many iPhone developers with the addition of this category on UIViewController. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHow can I break my code with your code if your code doesn't do anything that can break my code? I demand a refund."
