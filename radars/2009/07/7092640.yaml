    description: "Summary:   Creating a Certificate authority signing request (Keychain Access, Certificate Assistant: \"Request Certificate from Certificate Authority\") generates a public/private key pair. If you export the public key (.pem format) and the private key (.p12 format) and then you delete them both from the keychain.  If you then try to import the exported versions (via drag and drop or import menu item) the public key cannot be imported and Keychain Access gives the following error:  \"An error has occurred.  Unable to import an item.  The contents of this item cannot be retrieved.\"\r\n\r\nIf you import the .p12 file you get a password prompt (no prompt text though) and then you get the same error, but it does actually seem to have successfully imported the private key (appears in the list and seems correct).\r\n\r\nswitching the order of importing the two files does not seem to change the behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is a _serious_ problem as I now have certificates I can't get back into my keychain and use."
