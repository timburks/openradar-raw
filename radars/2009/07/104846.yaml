    description: "Summary:\r\nTiger machines that use a Leopard server for managed client settings are not able to be added to multiple ComputerGroups, or nested ComputerGroups. This is a feature request to add this functionality to Tiger. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd Tiger machine to multiple computerGroups or a ComputerGroup which is nested. Settings from each ComputerGroup do not apply. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis is expected behavior because it is documented as such. But I expect Apple to release a patch for Tiger to enable this ability. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf Microsoft can make XP work with Win Server 2008's new Group Policy Preferences feature, surely Apple can add Tiger support for ComputerGroups. We still have half of our Macs on Tiger."
