    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a phone call ends while an application is running, the green double height status bar shrinks and the UIViewController adjusts the views' heights accordingly. However, there is no callback for if I need to programmatically react to this event (e g adjust an OpenGL view), even though there is [UIApplicationDelegate application:willChangeStatusBarFrame:], which sounds right but isn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement [NSApplicationDelegate application:willChangeStatusBarFrame:] or [UIApplicationDelegate application:didChangeStatusBarFrame:] in the app delegate\r\n2. Take a call\r\n3. During the call, start your app\r\n4. Have the other side hang up\r\n5. The green status bar shrinks\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. The callback is called, either before or after step 5, depending on which callback is implemented\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. The callback isn't called, because it's only related to frame changes due to orientation changes, and not all instances of status bar frame changes such as due to an incoming call.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLogging this in reference to http://openradar.appspot.com/6475681"
