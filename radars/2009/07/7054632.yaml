    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSuggest that notifications arriving via Push notification be saved in the Messages application, much like SMS. \r\n\r\nWhen many notifications arrive sometimes it's not convenient to attend to them immediately. Having them saved in Messages allows users to ignore incoming messages and attend to them in one sitting later.\r\n\r\nAnother common scenario is if interrupted in middle of handling push notification, badge and notification are no longer available. Having it saved in Messages makes it so users can go back and restart handling the push request at a later time.\r\n\r\nThis would also be useful for keeping a log/audit-trail of incoming push notifications for archiving/tracking purposes."
