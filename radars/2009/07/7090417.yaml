    description: "As a developer, I normally work past midnight each day.  I would really like it if iCal had a preference to set the time of the start of the day for Week and Day views, i.e. so the day column started at a specified time, instead of midnight, and finished just before that time.\r\n\r\nKinda similar to the \"Start week on\" preference, but as a \"Start day at\" for times.\r\n\r\nI know there's a \"Day starts at\" preference, but that just controls highlighting, and doesn't change the actual display of the day rows.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is to be able to set it to have some early time like 05:00 as the first time on the day column, and proceed past midnight to 04:59 at the bottom of the column.\r\n\r\nThat way, I would have a continuous display of my events throughout my day, without a seemingly arbitrary jump to the next column at midnight.  I know it makes sense from an actual date point of view, but it is disruptive to actual usage."
