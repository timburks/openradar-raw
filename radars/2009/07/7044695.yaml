    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you reopen a closed window in Safari using the History menu (Reopen Last Closed Window and Reopen All Windows from Last Session), the Back/Forward buttons don't operate; however, when the window was closed, there was important user information in the Back/Forward stack.\r\n\r\nThe Back/Forward stack is important user context. Often, a reopened window is useless for me without the Back stack.\r\n\r\nThis is especially jarring when you reopen a window after accidentally closing it. Losing the Back stack often feels like harsh punishment that makes the Reopen Last Close Window feature seem cruel and half-hearted. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit apple.com.\r\n2. Use a link on the page to navigate.\r\n3. Close the window.\r\n4. Select History > Reopen Last Closed Window.\r\n5. Notice that the Back button doesn't work.\r\n6. Cry, because now you have to go digging in your history to find the post that sent you to the reopened page that had other important information in it that you wanted to check out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Back/Forward buttons have the same stack of pages as when you closed the window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Back/Forward buttons suffered from amnesia.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has never worked correctly in Safari.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis feature has been in Firefox for several releases.\r\nI consider forgetting the navigation path to a page as user data loss.\r\nKeep up the awesome work on Safari, my browser of choice."
