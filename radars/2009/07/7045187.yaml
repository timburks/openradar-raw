    description: "Summary:\r\nIf CRL is set to \"Best Attempt\" in Keychain Access > Preferences > Certificates, codesign will not be able to find code signing identities that are not self-signed (such as those signed by Thawte Code Signing CA).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Keychain Access.\r\n2. In Preferences, selected the Certificates tab.\r\n3. Set \"Certificate Revocation List (CRL):\" to \"Best Attempt\"\r\n4. Close the Preferences.\r\n5. Import a code signing identity that is sign by a third party CA into your login.keychain.\r\n6. If necessary, also import the CA's certificate.\r\n7. Open Xcode.\r\n8. Create a new Cocoa Application project.\r\n9. In the build settings for the project, set the code signing identity to the one imported in step 5.\r\n10. Build the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n<name of identity>: no identity found\r\nCommand /usr/bin/codesign failed with exit code 1"
