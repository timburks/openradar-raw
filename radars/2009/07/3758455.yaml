    description: "11-Aug-2004 09:09 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nWhen I enter a birthday in Addressbook, in addition to the wrong date format (see my reported bug #3758439), the birthday is always one day later than the day I enter.\r\n\r\nFor example: if I enter 9-3-1968 I get as Birthday: 4 September 1968\r\n\r\n(If a birthday date is entered as 4 September 1968 the date stays correct)\r\n\r\nI once imported a number of vcards and all the birthdays were screwed up in the same way.\r\n\r\nI live in New Zealand (Timezone NZST) on the other side of the date line of you guys so I suspect that has something to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18-May-2006 09:13 PM Patrick Lemmens:\r\nAlmost two years on and I can confirm that addressbook in OS X 10.4.6 stil has the same problem....\r\n\r\nHope something will be done about it. It is just a relatively minor annoyance but stil...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Feb-2008 05:19 AM Stoney Gamble:\r\nPlease know that the subsystems for NSCalendarDate or CFGregorianDate algorithms are obsolescent.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to submit bugs.  We sincerely appreciate your input."
