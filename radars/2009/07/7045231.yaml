    description: "pursuant to the closing of radr://6853527, radr://7006473 and radr://6910628\r\n\r\nI'd like to request an enhancement to the way Xcode and codesign do their Code Signing Identity searches. The current behavior of Xcode as it pertains to searching for named CSI's entirely sucks if you've got multiple CSI's that have the same or similar names (not to mention the fact that littering the login keychain with all the public, private and certificates lends itself to a mess of same/similarly named keys sitting in the login keychain, a mess that is tedious and annoying to filter through every time you have to generate a new cert for iPhone development).  I currently have a need to code sign Mac and iPhone apps for distribution, as a result Xcode proceeds to spew a warning since the code signing identity names result in a potential match under whatever searching/matching criteria is being used. \r\n\r\n[BWARN]Code Sign warning: code-signing identity 'Ambrosia Software, Inc.' matches multiple identities : 'Ambrosia Software, Inc.', 'iPhone Distribution: Ambrosia Software, Inc.' -- 'Ambrosia Software, Inc.' will be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would much rather see a pop-up in Xcode's codesigning section that lets me pick which keychain it should do its code signing identity matching on than get warned every time i build because I've got multiple CSI's with similar names.  As it stands you cannot pass --keychain as an other code signing flag, it fails out before it reaches that point.  either would be an acceptable solution to the problem of the lack of a unique identifying characteristic to these code signing identities since its clearly that the automatic approach isn't working."
