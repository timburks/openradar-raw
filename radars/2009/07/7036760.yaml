    description: "Using a Supertalent FTM56GX25H with firmware 1571 in a MBP 15\" Early 2008 with SMC version 1.27f2 sometimes the drive is not recognized after wakeup from sleep.\r\n\r\nThe symptom is a black screen with just the cursor (using screenlock at sleep). No logs are written. After restart, the drive is recognized fine.\r\n\r\nMore people are complaining about this problem on the Supertalent forums with different Mac notebook models:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.supertalent.com/home/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=329\r\nhttp://www.supertalent.com/home/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=150\r\nhttp://www.supertalent.com/home/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=153\r\nhttp://www.supertalent.com/home/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=123\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm running Snow Leopard 10A380 (not yet updated to 10A394) but the problem also occurred on 10.5.7.\r\n\r\n\r\n'MacBook Pro.spx' was successfully uploaded"
