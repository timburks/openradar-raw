    description: "Normally Omni shares its framework source at <http://www.github.com/omnigroup>, but we cannot share our work on progress on Snow Leopard enhancements and cleanups since 10.6 is still under NDA.  This means that our sharing doesn't benefit those that would like to ship 10.6 applications sooner than later.  Under the current system, we can't easily share source with other developers until the day 10.6 ships, at which point they've missed out on the benefit of such sharing.  This hurts the whole community, Apple included.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be for Apple to run an instance of github.fi <http://fi.github.com/> with login credentials only enabled if the developer has an active seed key.  This would let us share framework source without violating the NDA and then on the day 10.6 ships, we could migrate our changes from the NDA'd tree to the public tree."
