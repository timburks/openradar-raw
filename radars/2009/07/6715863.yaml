    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nfor some applications, it is important that the asynchronous alert functionality in iPhone SDK 3.0 is also made available as timed reminder, which can be set-up from the application and is delivered on time even in situations without network connectivity (off line). \r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n\r\nAll applications that need to remind of a point in time, including alarm clocks, medical prescription reminder, calendars, astronomic event reminder etc.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe request is *not* about *calling* a third party app on time, it's only about doing the same push can do: popping up an alert message and/or playing an alert sound, at a time determined by the application (rather than by the server).\r\n\r\nPush could be used to achieve timed reminder functionality, but only with severely degraded realiability and creating a silly waste of ressources for a timer server and using the entire push infrastructure. And reliability is an issue for reminder-type applications - a reminder must also be delivered without network coverage.\r\n \r\n\r\nAPI suggestion (to clarify the request):\r\n \r\n1) Set up a timed notification\r\n\r\n- (BOOL) queueNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification forDeliveryAt:(NSDate *)date;\r\n\r\n- (BOOL) queueNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification forDeliveryAt:(NSDate *)date withSnoozeInterval:(NSTimeInterval)snooze maxRepeat:(NSInteger)repeat;\r\n \r\nThe format of the notification dictionary would be the same as  already defined in \"The Notification Payload\" of the \"Apple Push Notification Service Programming Guide\".\r\n \r\n2) cancel pending notifications:\r\n \r\n- (BOOL) cancelNotificationQueuedforDeliveryAt:(NSDate *)date;\r\n- (BOOL) cancelAllTimedNotifications;"
