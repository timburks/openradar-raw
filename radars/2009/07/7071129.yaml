    description: "ABCreateStringWithAddressDictionary returns a formatted address depending on the current system locale. It should instead format the address depending on the country of the address.\r\n\r\nIf the country is not specified, it would be OK to default to the system locale. Alternatively it would be great to specify the desired locale as a 3rd parameter to ABCreateStringWithAddressDictionary.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nThis is how the address is formatted using the de_DE locale:\r\n\r\nXYZ Street 13\r\n12345 City\r\nGermany\r\n\r\nAfter switching to the US locale, the address is formatted:\r\n\r\nXYZ Street 13\r\nCity 12345\r\nGermany\r\n\r\nwhich is definitely wrong for addresses in Germany."
