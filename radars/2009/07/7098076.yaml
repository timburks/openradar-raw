    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to increase scrolling performance, developers often flatten the view hierarchy under UITableViewCells by drawing text and images directly into a background view.  It would be more efficient to use Interface Builder to lay out the table cell (using UIViews such as UILabel and UIImageView) and let a build phase flatten the hierarchy automatically."
