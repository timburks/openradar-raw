    description: "Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard adds great support for Collada 3D model files in Preview, QuickLook and QuartzComposer. It would be REALLY (REALLY) fantastic if Apple could move MeshKit out of private frameworks and make it a public framework (with you know, headers).\r\n\r\nAt the moment we can only embed Collada files in our Mac OS X applications by embedding them in Quartz Composer compositions and then either using QCViews or QCCompositionLayers. This is great! But does add a lot of overhead. It would be great if we had a \"MeshView\" class or even functions/classes to generate relevent OpenGL objects from Collada files."
