    description: "It would be desirable to differentiate movements that were initiated by the user (by flicking, pinching, double tapping etc.) from movements that were initiated by setRegion and setCenterCoordinate.\r\n\r\nThis could be done using one more (BOOL) parameter to mapView:regionWillChangeAnimated: and mapView:regionDidChangeAnimated:\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for apps that want to react on user initiated map movements (by reloading results) and move the map programmatically (to zoom to the bounding rect of a set of locations) at the same time."
