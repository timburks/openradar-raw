    description: "13-Jul-2009 03:56 PM David Spector:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nIf you have several developer identities (for example you are a consultant working for several companies), and the identities are all similar (For example \"iPhone Developer: David Spector\" and \"iPhone Developer: David Spector (A7DV6TNB22)\"; when trying to build code to run on an iPhoneOS device, XCode cannot distinguish between the developer identities even though the  mobile provision profile fully specifies the developer ID,  and XCode fails to sign the code.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install two similarly named developer certificates\r\n2. create a  mobile provision file for an ap using one of the IDs\r\n3. build for the device\r\n4. XCode will fail with an error similar to:\r\n      iPhone Developer: David Spector: ambiguous (matches \"iPhone Developer: David Spector (A7DV6TNB22)\" and \"iPhone Developer: David Spector\" in /Users/spector/Library/Keychains/login.keychain)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXCode should be smart enough to do an exact match on the developer identity string.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCode signing fails since XCode can't figure out which ID to use, even though it is fully-specified in the mobile provisioning file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A - happens all the time. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOf course the only way around this bug is to delete whichever developer identities you ware not using from your keychain.  Of course this would get quite tedious very quickly if you were working on a number of projects."
