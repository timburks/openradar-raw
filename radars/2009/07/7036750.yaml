    description: "MKMapViewDelegate has no method to be notified when a callout is shown or hidden. This would be useful for various purposes:\r\n\r\n- preloading detail content for a subsequent tap on one of the accessory buttons\r\n- centering the map (there are situations where the automated centering of the mapView upon selecting callouts doesn't work as expected)\r\n- changing the callout view itself programmatically\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the following delegate methods:\r\n\r\nmapView:willSelectAnnotationView:\r\nmapView:didSelectAnnotationView:\r\nmapView:willDeselectAnnotationView:\r\nmapView:didDeselectAnnotationView:\r\n\r\nOf course this can be accomplished by subclassing MKAnnotationView and overriding setSelected:animated. However it is more complicated and doesn't let us be notified when the userlocation callout is (de)selected."
