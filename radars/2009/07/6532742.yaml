    description: "Summary\r\nWhen a remote Mac, that is being controlled or observed, goes offline, the Remote Desktop admin application should not bring the window forward by default. Doing so possibly interrupts work that is being done on another remotely controlled Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open at least two ARD connections to remote Macs.\r\n2. Restart one remote Mac and immediately switch over to the other.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nThe control window belonging to the restarted Mac will remain in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nThe control window belonging to the restarted Mac comes to the foreground as soon as the Remote Desktop admin application loses the connection."
