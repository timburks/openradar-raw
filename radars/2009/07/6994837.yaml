    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen importing mail from Microsoft Entourage 2008, Mail.app has trouble with folders with large numbers of items.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Microsoft Entourage folder/mailbox with over 10,000 messages.\r\n\r\n2. Use the File -> Import command to select the large Entourage mailbox (and other mailboxes, if you choose).\r\n\r\n3. Start the import.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll messages imported.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe importer churns away importing messages for several minutes, then all of a sudden starts zipping through them in the UI.\r\n\r\nWhen the import is finished, only 9200-9300 messages from the large mailbox have been imported. All messages after that, including messages in other mailboxes and folders, are not imported.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas happened with MacOS X 10.6 WWDC seed and Microsoft Entourage 12.1.9, with several different large mailboxes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI ran the Microsoft Database Utility and rebuilt the database prior to importing to rule out db corruption as the cause."
