    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApplications that were previously accepted for the App Store are having their updates rejected because the internal view structure of the camera view is undocumented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Submit application that inserts an overlay view into the camera view in January.\r\n2. Have it (and two companion volumes!) accepted, listed in the App Store, and sell marvelously.\r\n3. Attempt to submit an update now.\r\n4. Have it rejected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat previously accepted applications could be updated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLeft hanging in the wind with hordes of angry users bringing out the torches and pitchforks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs over multiple submissions and a DTS query, so regression appears to be trivial.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nA tech note that documented the internal structure of the camera picker in sufficient detail for adding one simple overlay view would be quite sufficient. For instance, like this code:\r\n\r\n\r\n- (void)customizeCameraOnOS3x:(UIViewController *)viewController\r\n{\r\n   UIView* controllerViewHolder = viewController.view;\r\n   if (!controllerViewHolder.subviews.count)\r\n      return;\r\n   UIView* controllerCameraView = [[controllerViewHolder subviews]  \r\nobjectAtIndex:0];\r\n   if (!controllerViewHolder.subviews.count)\r\n      return;\r\n   UIView* controllerPreview = [[controllerCameraView subviews]  \r\nobjectAtIndex:0];\r\n\r\n   [[[poseImageView retain] autorelease] removeFromSuperview];\r\n   poseImageView.alpha = 0.5;\r\n   [controllerCameraView insertSubview:poseImageView  \r\naboveSubview:controllerPreview];\r\n}"
