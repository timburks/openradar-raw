        Summary:
        When my 27" Led Cinema Display monitor is connected to my Retina MacBook Pro 13" Mid 2014,white noise continuously comes out of the Led Cinema Displayâ€™s speakers, resulting in a low buzzing noise.

        Unloading AppleHDA.kext stops the constant buzzing sound after about 30 seconds, until sound is outputed:
        sudo kextunload /System/with kextunload Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Hook up a 27" Led Cinema Display to a rMBP 13" Mid 2014
        2. Listen closely to the displays speakers

        Expected Results:
        A white noise can be clearly heard!

        Actual Results:
        A very irritating white sound!
