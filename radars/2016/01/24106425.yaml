    description: "Summary:\r\nIn application with asynchronous code, while debugging, LLDB can't print contents of variables (evaluate expression). It fails to resolve expression when typing \"po variableName\" or \"p variableName\".\r\nInstead of evaluating expression lldb returns error:\r\n\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x81000).\r\nThe process has been returned to the state before expression evaluation.\r\n\r\nNote that in such cases lldb command \"fr v\" still working properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open LLDBDemo project from https://github.com/vgorloff/Radar24106425.\r\n2. Disable breakpoints (there should be shared breakpoints)\r\n3. Launch application with iPhone 6s simulator.\r\n4. Enable breakpoints (there should be shared breakpoints. Other vise set breakpoint \"po someValue\" on every line where Swift \"print\" function is used).\r\n5. Launch application with iPhone 6s simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Xcode console there should be output produced by application (using print statements) and output produced by breakpoint evaluation.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n\"A\"\r\nA\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B\"\r\nA+B\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B\"\r\nA+B\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B+C\"\r\nA+B+C\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B+C\"\r\nA+B+C\r\n-----\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn Xcode console there is an output produced by application (using print statements) and output produced by breakpoint evaluation. But some breakpoints can't evaluate expression and fail with message:\r\n\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x81000).\r\nThe process has been returned to the state before expression evaluation.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x81000).\r\nThe process has been returned to the state before expression evaluation.\r\nA\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\"A+B\"\r\nA+B\r\n\r\n-----\r\nerror: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x81000).\r\nThe process has been returned to the state before expression evaluation.\r\nA+B\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B+C\"\r\nA+B+C\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\"A+B+C\"\r\nA+B+C\r\n-----"
