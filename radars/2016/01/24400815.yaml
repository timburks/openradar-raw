    description: "Summary:\r\nI use Exchange contact groups to simplify sending an email to multiple contacts. In Mac OS X Yosemite, I was able to select an Exchange contact group in Mail and have the email sent to everyone in the group. With Mac OS X El Capitan, I'm no longer given the option to select an Exchange contact group.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a contact group in Exchange.\r\n2. Open Mail.\r\n3. File -> New Message\r\n4. Click the plus sign to the right of \"To:\"\r\n5. Notice that the Exchange contact group is not given as an option. The contact group will be listed in Contacts but not in Mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Mail to allow sending an email to a group of contacts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe contact group I created in Exchange is not given as an option when I select who to send an email to.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail 9.2 (3112)\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
