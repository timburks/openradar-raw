    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen calculating the height of a view with `systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:` the height calculation is wrong if the height of the view depends on the result of auto layout width of a child view of the receiver.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- See the attached sample project.\r\n- Run it on an iPhone 5 / 5s. (the screen size is the important factor here)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The cell has the correct height, so that the left label isn’t rendering out of the cell’s bounds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The cell is too small so that the label with the text does render outside of the cell’s bounds.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n—\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue does not occur as soon as you give the button (right view) the final text already in the xib file. The issue only occurs when the right view needs to change its width because of a text change."
