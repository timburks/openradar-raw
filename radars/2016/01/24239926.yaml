    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 9.3 b1, if you ask it to speak out the sentence, \"We have approximately 16 min remaining\", it pronounces it as \"We have approximately miles remaining\". On iOS 9.2, it says it properly as \"We have approximately sixteen minutes remaining\". I experience this issue in our app first, but reproduced the same results in the Notes app with voiceover on to test.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open notes app.\r\n2. Type in \"We have approximately 16 min remaining\"\r\n3. Turn voiceover on and open the notes app and listen to the string typed in step 2.\r\n4. Hear results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should say/pronounce it as \"We have approximately sixteen minutes remaining\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt says \"We have approximately miles remaining\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E5181f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S, 64 GB, Verizon"
