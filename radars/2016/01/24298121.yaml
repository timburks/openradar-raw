    description: "When dividing a project up into multiple projects, or using open source components in source form, there is often a need to specify build settings for subprojects. It is generally desirable for the subprojects to be unaware of the parent project and its configuration files, especially when a subproject is shared between multiple parent projects.\r\n\r\nI imagine the simplest approach would be to allow an xcconfig file to be specified for each target in the Target Dependencies build phase. Settings from this xcconfig would override the settings in the target and project in the same manner as the -xcconfig to xcodebuild, but with one step lower priority."
