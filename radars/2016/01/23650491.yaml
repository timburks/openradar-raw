    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen enabling Reduce Transparency, the entire iOS 9 interface becomes much more snappy and responsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap Settings\r\n2. Tap General\r\n3. Tap Accessibility\r\n4. Tap Increase Contrast\r\n5. Tap Reduce Transparency\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI was expecting to enable Reduce Transparency and only gain a little more performance, but instead I received a large performance jump!\r\n\r\nMy request for this bug report is that iOS 9 function as well with the transparency enabled as it does when it's disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI is much more fluid now with the transparency disabled.  Activating Spotlight by swiping down in the middle of the screen doesn't lag, swiping to the left for search doesn't hang up for 15 seconds before I can swipe back to the right, the App Switcher is smooth and very responsive regardless of how many apps are open and the overall User Interface is so much more responsive.  I was seeing quite a bit of slow down, but no more.  Many of the visual glitches I've seen and reported are also gone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI like the way the transparency looks for sure!  But if it's going to cause such a drop in system performance, I'd rather the iOS User Interface be opaque and function well than it have the transparency effects and not function as well.\r\n\r\nI haven't said this often enough when I've submitted reports:  Thank you very much for your consideration on this matter, and have a great day!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone, iPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
