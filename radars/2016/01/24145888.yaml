    description: "Summary:\nIn previous versions of Xcode Server (with Xcode 6) prior to App Thinning, build scripts could access the built product by using the environment variables “${XCS_OUTPUT_DIR}/${XCS_PRODUCT}”. With App Thinning, multiple build products are generated for the different classes of device, so the “product” is now a directory of files. \n\nXcode Server should provide us with environment variables that allow post-build scripts to locate these files (for example for uploading to an enterprise distribution service). \n\nLooking at Xcode Server’s directory structure, build products look like they should appear in:\n“/Library/Developer/XcodeServer/IntegrationAssets/${XCS_BOT_ID}-${XCS_BOT_NAME}/${XCS_INTEGRATION_NUMBER}/“, however at the time the build script runs, they reside in “${XCS_OUTPUT_DIR}/ExportedProduct/Apps/“, and are then later moved to the IntegrationAssets directory.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSet up an after integration trigger to access the built products directory without hard coding directory names.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe trigger should be provided with enough information to locate the file(s), as per Xcode 6.\n\nActual Results:\nLocating the files requires us to hardcode undocumented folder structures into our triggers.\n\nRegression:\nThis happens on Xcode Server 7.2, previous versions of Xcode Server provided triggers with adequate environment variables."
