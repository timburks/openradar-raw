    description: "When launching a new beta of Xcode from the Finder, Gatekeeper verification is triggered. Given the recent scares with dubious versions of Xcode, I prefer to leave Gatekeeper to do its thing, instead of manually removing the quarantine xattr via Terminal (even though I only ever download Xcode betas from the Apple Developer website).\r\n\r\nWhen the progress bar completes, the OS X window asking me to confirm whether I want to open Xcode is shown. I choose “Open”, at which the beachball is shown and CoreServicesUIAgent is shown to be non-responsive for ~3 minutes. The confirmation dialogue remains onscreen during the beachball.\r\n\r\nForce-quitting CoreServicesUIAgent and re-launching Xcode (rightly) forces a new Gatekeeper verification."
