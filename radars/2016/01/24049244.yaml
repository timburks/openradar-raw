    description: "Summary:\nSFSafariViewController doesn’t provide delegate for when controller did finish dismissing.\nSFSafariViewController is a great tool for in-app authentication, however if you want to react to dismissing of SFSafariViewController when user taps Done or dismisses controller through gesture with presenting an Alert controller or any other controller, you are forced to use timers to wait till SFSafariViewController dismissed.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Present SFSafariViewController\n2. Set delegate to self\n3. implement SFSafariViewControllerDelegate’s -safariViewControllerDidFinish:\n4. From this method there is no way to know if controller did finish dismissing \n\nExpected Results:\ndelegate should provider transitionCoordinator so consumer can attach to the completion block.\n\nActual Results:\nsafariViewControllerDidFinish: doesn’t allow to detect end on the dismissal."
