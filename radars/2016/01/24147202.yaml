        Summary:
        In some cases the arrow of a UIPopover does not point to the center of the given sourceRect. I could not clearly identify what causes this behavior or in which cases it occures. What I found out is that the bug only occurs if the source rect is 40pt in width or less.
        when changing the source rect slightly, the result looks fine. Please see the attached sample project.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Open attached example project
        - Tap on red button
        - look at the position of the popoverâ€™s arrow

        Expected Results:
        a popover appears with the arrow pointing to the horizontal center of the button

        Actual Results:
        a popover appears with the arrow pointing to right side of the button

        Notes:
        Workaround: move the button one point to the left, then the popover origin is correct. (c.f. the green button in the example project)
