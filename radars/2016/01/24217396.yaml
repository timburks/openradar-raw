        Summary:
        After the steps below are followed, NSUserDefaults will not set or read any values.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Run the sample app at least once.
        2. Close the sample app.
        3. Run “defaults delete com.brittonmobile.Preferences-Test” in Terminal.
        4. Delete the folder at ~/Library/Containers/com.brittonmobile.Preferences-Test
        5. Re-launch the sample app.
        6. Try either the set or read buttons. They should not function.
        7. Close the sample app.
        8. Run “killall cfprefsd” in Terminal or reboot.
        9. Re-launch the sample app.
        10. The set and read buttons should now function correctly.

        Expected Results:
        At step 6 the app should be reset to its original state and the buttons should function correctly.

        Actual Results:
        NSUserDefaults stops functioning.

        Regression:
        This occurs on both OS X 10.10.5 and OS X 10.11.2

        Notes:
        A sample program is attached that sets and reads a random number from NSUserDefaults.
