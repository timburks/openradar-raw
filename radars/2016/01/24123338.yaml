        I download TV shows on my media center Mac mini in the living room, but often watch them on my MacBook via home sharing.

        Often, iTunes just randomly beachballs, never to come back.

        Usually, that is:

        a) While or right after playing video. Video and audio will still be going, but the black, emoty video window won't close, and all UI ignores clicks
        b) After selecting the shared library. It will say it's loading the library, but never finish.

        Spin logs attached.
