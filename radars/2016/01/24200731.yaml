    description: "Summary:\r\nAs an iOS app developer, implementing proper keyboard presentation and dismissal handling in a UIViewController subclass requires listening and handling multiple keyboard notifications and is prone to repetition and error.\r\n\r\nIt would be very handy to have a property on UIViewController similar to bottomLayoutGuide that represented the lowest vertical extent for content that is intended to appear above a presented keyboard, when a keyboard is presented. This would allow for simple and consistent constraint setup and reduce the likelihood of a poor user experience when keyboard presentation is not correctly or fully handled by the app.\r\n\r\nA possible name for such a property could be bottomKeyboardGuide or keyboardLayoutGuide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs an example of how we are currently attempting to handle keyboard presentation and dismissal, see http://effortlesscode.com/auto-layout-keyboard-shown-hidden/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
