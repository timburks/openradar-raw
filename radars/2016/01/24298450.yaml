        Summary:
        Using US English, with the American Female voice, Siri pronounces “says” rhyming with maze, which stands out as odd

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect iPhone to car bluetooth
        2. Activate Siri by holding down iPhone home button
        3. Say “Tell Christine hello”

        Expected Results:
        Siri reads out “Your message to Christine Frankel says ‘Hello’”

        Actual Results:
        Siri reads out “Your message to Christine Frankel saze ‘Hello’”

        Regression:
        This suddenly started within the last couple of weeks. I’ve been dictating messages with Siri this way for years.
