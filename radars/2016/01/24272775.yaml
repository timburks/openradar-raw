        Summary:
        When creating an IBOutlet Collection of UIButtons using Swift, it creates a constant leak in memory. Every access leaks memory I believe due to the forced bridge to ObjectiveC.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create new single view swift project.
        2. Add multiple UIButtons in Interface Builder.
        3. Connect them to an IBOutletCollection in the ViewController.swift file.
        4. Hit Command+i to run Instruments.
        5. Select Leaks as the profiling template.
        6. Hit the record button.
        7. Leaks!

        Expected Results:
        No leaks.

        Actual Results:
        Leaks.

        Notes:
        Workaround is to replace [UIButton]! with an NSArray! and use your own logic to cast the objects to UIButtons or your subclass.
