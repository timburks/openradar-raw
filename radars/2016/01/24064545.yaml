    description: "Summary:\r\nEFI lags when it scales down partition icons in order to fit all of them on the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Insert portable hard drive with multiple bootable partitions into the USB or Thuderbolt Ports.  (In my setup, I have a total of 8 partitions.)\r\n2. Power on the machine.  (In my setup, I have a MacBook Pro with Retina Display.)\r\n3. Hold down the alt/option key.\r\n4. EFI lags when it has to scale down the partition icons in order to fit all 8 of them on the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn machines that use the gray style EFI, there is no lag when scaling down partition icons.  On machines that use the black style EFI, there is always a lag when it scales down partition icons.  I would expect the black style EFI to function as fluidly as the gray style EFI does.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe black style EFI always lags when it scales down partition icons.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI'm not sure where to check the EFI version.  If you could tell me how to get that information, I will add it to this report.  :)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
