    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading to Xcode 7.3 beta 1, the UI Testing output from XCTRunner is no longer being printed to stdout. There is no information from the UI Tests indicating which test cases/suites passed or failed, nor is there the usual XCTRunner log of the UI steps being taken during the tests.\r\n\r\nIf this was an intentional change, there needs to be a way to export test results so that UI Testing is able to be integrated with CI systems.\r\n\r\nRelated: rdar://24184959\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTerminal: xcodebuild -workspace 'MyApp.xcworkspace' -scheme 'MyApp Debug' -destination 'id=${id}' clean test\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe full xcodebuild stdout: Clean, then stderr output (below), Build, Codesign, and the Test output (XCTRunner log of the Test Suites, Test Cases, and the individual steps taken in each Test Case).\r\n\r\nstderr: xcodebuild[...] [MT] IDETestOperationsObserverDebug: (...) Beginning test session ... with Xcode 7D111g on target <DVTiOSDevice: ...> {}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo XCTRunner output in Terminal. stdout output ends with codesigning of MyAppUITests-Runner.app. stderr does display **TEST FAILED**, that is the last statement. \r\n\r\nPrior to that stderr also prints some MDMCreateDeltaDirectory and __MDMDirectoryDiff_block_invoke37 commands while the tests are running, and xcodebuild prints some iPhoneConnect statements.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 beta (7D111g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyApp-{...}/Logs/Test does contain new TestSummaries.plist files, and the Attachments also contains new screenshots and other test files. So logging is getting written somewhere, just not in a form that's easily exportable."
