        Summary:
        While Apple TV apps have been out since October 2015, it is still not possible to retrieve information about Apple TV apps using the iTunes Search API (https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html).

        For example, one can search for an iOS App (e.g. Yelp) like so: https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=284910350

        But searching for a tvOS app in the same way yields no results.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Lookup the App id for an Apple TV app
        2. Type in the search in a browser like so: https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=[appletv_app_id]

        Expected Results:
        You should be able to view the Apple TV apps in a JSON format, like you can with iOS and Mac apps.

        Actual Results:
        The request completes with no results returned.

        Notes:
        When searching for Mac software, you have to add &entity=macSoftware (similarly, iPadSoftware for iPad-only apps). It would be great if you could have &entity=tvSoftware, or something similar to find AppleTV apps.

        We (LaunchKit) offer simple tools to allow developers build websites for their apps, or generate pretty app store screenshots. A lot of our tools start with a simple “Look up your app” step, which uses the Search API to find information about the app and pre-populate a lot of information that the developer would otherwise have to enter manually.
