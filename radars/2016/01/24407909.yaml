        Summary:
        If I enter "Foo/3.0" (with quotes) in the Safari search field, instead of the Google (or whatever search engine is set) search I get an about:blank page.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Enter "Foo/3.0" (with quotes) in the Safari search/address bar
        2. Hit enter

        Expected Results:
        The configured search provider should open with the search results for my query

        Actual Results:
        A blank pages shows and the address bar changes to about:blank
