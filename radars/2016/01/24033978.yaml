        Summary:
        Allow changing the Tab Cell used by an NSTabView, that way it would become a lot easier to customize it.
        Currently this is only possible using the private method _setTabsCell or by reimplementing most of the NSTabView, which is
        a lot of work for if one only wants custom Tabs.
