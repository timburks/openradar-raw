    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider a website example.com, where your profile page is at example.com/user, and where visiting example.com/user/logout will log you out and redirect you to the home page.\r\n\r\nIf the logout page gets added to Top Hit suggestions, Safari will suggest it and preload it any time you try to visit the profile page URL. But because the logout page performs a redirect, it does not appear in Safari's history, and therefore seemingly cannot ever be deleted from the suggestions without turning off the feature entirely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a page that performs a redirect added to Safari's possible Top Hit suggestions\r\n\r\n2. Be annoyed that Safari tries to autocomplete and preload that page whenever you visit a prefix of that URL, and go looking for a way to stop this behavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can delete the redirect URL from your History or some other list, thereby making Safari forget about it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe redirect URL appears nowhere, remaining in Top Hit suggestions indefinitely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 (11601.3.9)\r\nOS X 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also http://openradar.appspot.com/24213676 , where the redirect link you can't delete performs some destructive action and is preloaded.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2\r\n1.7 GHz Core i7\r\n8 GB RAM"
