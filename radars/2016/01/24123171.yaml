    description: "Summary:\n\nPaste (⌘V) destroys the formatting of code where braces are on their own lines. (I use this style because I can quickly scan my code to for indentation-related issues and missing braces by mentally drawing lines between opening and closing braces in my code.) \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Write the following function:\n\n        func forwardTo(callback:() -> Void)\n        {\n            callback()\n        }\n        forwardTo()\n        {\n            print(\"Hello\");\n        }\n\n2. Copy it\n3. Paste it with ⌘V\n4. Paste is with ⌘⌥⇧V\n\nExpected Results:\n\nBoth should result in:\n\n        func forwardTo(callback:() -> Void)\n        {\n            callback()\n        }\n        forwardTo()\n        {\n            print(\"Hello\");\n        }\n\nActual Results:\n\n#3 results in broken formatting:\n\n        func forwardTo(callback:() -> Void)\n        {\n            callback()\n        }\n        forwardTo()\n            {\n                print(\"Hello\");\n        }\n\n#4 works (thanks Joe, for the heads-up on Twitter) :)\n\nNotes:\n\nI would expect ⌘V to behave like Paste and Preserve Formatting when I’ve copied from Xcode and I’m pasting into Xcode. The current behaviour is a bug. If anything, the option to paste and run some magic on it should be the more convoluted shortcut :)"
