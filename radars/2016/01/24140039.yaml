    description: "When SFSafariViewControllerDelegate provides custom activities using\r\n\r\n-safariViewController:activityItemsForURL:title:\r\n\r\nthose custom UIActivity objects aren't queried using -canPerformWithActivityItems: when the user selects the activity.\r\n\r\nSince the usual (and documented) pattern is to implement -canPerformWithActivityItems: to notify the system which activities can actually be performed, SFSafariViewController will display activities that aren't supported on the device.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to manually filter the list of activities in -safariViewController:activityItemsForURL:title: by querying -canPerformWithActivityItems: for each activity in the list. However, this breaks the documented pattern and makes it more complicated than necessary to support custom activities in SafariViewController.\r\n\r\nsee also: rdar://24138390 / http://openradar.appspot.com/24138390"
