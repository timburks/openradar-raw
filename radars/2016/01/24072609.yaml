        Summary:
        It would be great if the Security framework would support RSA-PSS for signatures, since itâ€™s a more modern signature scheme.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use SecKeyRawSign or SecKeyRawSignature and try to use RSA-PSS

        Expected Results:
        The Security framework support modern, up-to-date signature schemes, such as RSA-PSS.

        Actual Results:
        No RSA-PSS support. A 3rd party library is needed :-(

        Regression:
