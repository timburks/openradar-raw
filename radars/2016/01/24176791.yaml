        Summary:
        iOS has a wealth of builtin debugging tools to simulate various conditions, such as the network link conditioner and location simulator. Unfortunately, these tools must be activated manually. It would be much easier to integrate these things into UI tests if they could be activated with XCUIApplication. In this way, tests can have a reliable environment to test against.

        Even more useful would be the ability to provide mock system libraries with tests, such as known images and contacts.
