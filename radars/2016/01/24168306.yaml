        Summary:
        Sometimes t.co links from Twitters url shortener don’t work in Safari. When pasting the same url into Chrome it always works and I’m redirected to the target url immediately.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Open a t.co url in Safari, e.g https://t.co/AN7cVsrU1n

        Expected Results:
        * redirected to target url

        Actual Results:
        * page loads indefinitely, redirect to target url never happens

        Regression:
        The behavior is rather new, but I can’t pinpoint when it started happening

        Notes:
        I’ve seen occasional reports from other Safari users on twitter complaining about the same issue

        Workaround seem to be to close the tab in which the url is loading, open a new tab an paste the url there. But this doesn’t always solve the issue.

        Attaching a sysdiagnose after just having the problem.
