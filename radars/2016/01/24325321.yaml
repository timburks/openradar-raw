    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting with Xcode 7.3 7D111g, attempts to type x86_64 register names such as $rdi or $rdx are stymied by the Xcode's efforts to helpfully complete the typing with a symbolic name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Break while debugging some x86_64 Mac targeting Cocoa app.\r\n2. Attempt to inspect the value of $rdi as a Cocoa object by typing:\r\n\r\npo $rdi (and then pressing return)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe value of $rdi should be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, completion has intervened and substituted the results of the first item in the popup which was picked up by the quick pressing of return:\r\n\r\n(lldb) po $CGRectDivide(<#CGRect rect#>, CGRect * _Nonnull slice, <#CGRect * _Nonnull remainder#>, <#CGFloat amount#>, <#CGRectEdge edge#>)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 7D111g\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Ugh.png' was successfully uploaded."
