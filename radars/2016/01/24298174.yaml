        We were using [UIReferenceLibraryViewController dictionaryHasDefinitionForTerm:] in PSPDFKit to decide if we should show a Definition menu item for text selection in PDF. However, we had to disable this because the lookup does a synchronous XPC and sometimes blocks the main thread for multiple seconds. It’s very unpredictable how long it does take.

        Do you have any tips around usage? It seems like especially first use is very expensive and slow, but subsequent calls can also be very slow and we had situations where this blocked our app for 10 or more seconds, especially when our app itself also caused high load.

        I don’t think a sample is needed here, it’s not really a bug, more an unfortunate design decision.

        Could we call this from a background thread? The documentation doesn’t say anything about that.
