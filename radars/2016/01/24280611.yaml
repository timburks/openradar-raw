    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter selecting to the end of a line, Shift-Left should shrink the selection from the end. Instead, it extends it from the beginning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click anywhere in the middle of a line in a source code document.\r\n2. Hit Shift-Command-Right to select from the insertion point to the end of the line.\r\n3. Hit Shift-Left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selection should shrink by one character from the end.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe selection grows by one character from the beginning.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNew bug in 7.3 beta, and this behavior is contrary to the standard text editing behavior on OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe wrong thing also happens when extending to the beginning of a line via Shift-Command-Left and then hitting Shift-Right, though this is a far less common operation (at least for me).\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, the correct behavior is restored if you perform step 2 twice before performing step 3."
