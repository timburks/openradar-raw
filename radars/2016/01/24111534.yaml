        Summary:
        The percentage is unnecessarily truncated and cannot be seen in the German printing status window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Print something and watch how the percentages go up.

        Expected Results:
        As this Window is really wide enough (this time, German isn’t THAT long ;-) ), it shouldn’t truncate

        Actual Results:
        At some percentage numbers, they are getting truncated.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        You see two attachments, one screenshot of a percentage which didn’t get truncated and one which got truncated (it’s like switching from 58 % to 59 % got it truncated)
