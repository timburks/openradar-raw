    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the on-screen keyboard caps lock is activated, using the shift key to shift a key to another symbol (such as inserting an exclamation mark) causes caps lock to disengage - the user is therefore not able to use the shift key to insert the desired symbol. This behaviour does not follow real world keyboard behaviour.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Notes\r\n2. Create a new note.\r\n3. Engage caps lock mode by pressing caps lock.\r\n4. Start typing a word\r\n5. Press the shift key to change key character (i.e. try inserting an exclamation mark).\r\n6. Press the desired shifted key\r\n7...\r\n8. Profit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should remain in caps lock mode, and the desired shifted key character should be inserted into the text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe use of shift key in caps lock mode breaks out of caps lock. You must then press the shift key again in order to insert the desired shifted key character.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behaviour is can be replicated in any app that takes text input using the new iPad Pro on-screen keyboard with the numbers row.\r\nIt appears the older iOS on-screen keyboard sans numbers row is not affected, as it does not have a caps lock mode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 128GB Cellular+WiFi"
