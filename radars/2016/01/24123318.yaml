        1) Select a shared iTunes library from another Mac by choosing it from the popup in the upper right
        2) Watch 3 or so TV show episodes
        3) When the TV window closes, the TV show list is empty, and iTunes says the library had no TV show episodes (I *just* watched one!)

        Workaround:
        "Eject" the shared library, then select it again, and all shows come back.
