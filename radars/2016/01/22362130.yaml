    description: "Summary:\r\nI have something like 1000 Nine Inch Nails songs in my library, with every album, various live recordings, etc (if you pass Trent in the halls, say hi for me). I have every Rage Against the Machine album, every Interpol album, and every Kanye West album. So why am I getting “Intro to…” playlists for these artists in Apple Music’s “For You” feature? I have had Genius enabled since it was launched, and it probably knows more about my music library than I do. Wouldn’t it make sense to use this data to inform Apple Music suggestions?"
