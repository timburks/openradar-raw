    description: "Summary:\r\nIf one swipes the Camera Icon up more than halfway on the Lock Screen and then back down in the same motion, and then immediately unlocks the device, the Camera app opens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Press the Lock or Home buttons to wake up the device.\r\n2. Swipe up on the Camera Icon more than half the length of the screen without letting go of the Camera Icon.\r\n3. Continue to hold finger on the Camera Icon for 1 second above the halfway point on the screen\r\n4. While still holding finger on the Camera Icon, swipe back down.\r\n5. Swipe to unlock the device before the screen turns back off and the Camera app opens.  (If one waits until the screen goes back to sleep, then presses the Lock or Home buttons, and then unlocks the device, this bug doesn't occur.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf one swipes the Camera Icon up any amount and then back down in the same motion on the lock screen, the Camera app shouldn't open.  The Camera app should only open if one slides the Camera Icon up all the way on the Lock Screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwiping the Camera Icon up more than halfway on the Lock Screen and then back down in the same motion, and then immediately unlocking the device causes the Camera app to open.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 Beta 4 (13C75) is where I first noticed this, but it does exist on earlier versions of iOS 9 as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Device.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
