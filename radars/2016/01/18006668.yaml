    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Dock, when hidden, doesn't immediately show when hovered over.  OS X 10.9.4 (13E28) and 10.9.5 (13F12)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0.  The \"Automatically hide and show the Dock\" option is checked inside the System Preferences.  The Dock is located on the bottom of the screen.\r\n1.  Start up Mac Pro 5,1; MacBook Pro 7,1; iMac 12,2 and iMac 14,3\r\n2.  After the desktop background and Apple logo cross fade, I move the cursor to the bottom of the screen to unhide the Dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Mac OS X 10.6.8, I could immediately move my mouse to the bottom of the screen, and the Dock would unhide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn OS X 10.9.4 and 10.9.5, I have to move my mouse down to the bottom of the screen twice, or use Mission Control to make the Dock unhide.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.4 Build 13E28 and OS X 10.9.5 Build 13F12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe only time the Dock will unhide correctly, is if an app, other than the Finder, opens at boot time.  E.G.  System Preferences.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
