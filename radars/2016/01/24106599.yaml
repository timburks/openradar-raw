    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 8 Apple has added the functionality to scan a credit card using the phone camera (http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/11/ios-8-how-to-use-camera-to-enter-in-credit-card-info/).\r\n\r\nThe only way to provide card scanning currently is by using CardIO's SDK (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK) which sits at around 300MB and is very old and maintained by the community.\r\n\r\nPlease, please if we could use Apple's scanner it would be a game changer for countless developers using CardIO.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Look for Credit Card Scanning API provided by Apple Framework\r\n* Notice it doesn't exist\r\n* Fallback to installing CardIO via cocoapods\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Find a great credit card scanning controller in Apple Framework\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo Credit Card Scanner\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 and higher\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll Camera enabled iOS devices supporting iOS 8"
