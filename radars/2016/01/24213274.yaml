        Summary:
        As of Xcode 7, bot builds can gather code coverage data, and you can manually inspect it, but thereâ€™s no way to take automated action based on it. I would like to be able to specify one of a couple options for my bots, depending on the project. Fail the integration if either (a) code coverage is less than 100%, or (b) if code coverage of any class decreases from a previous integration.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        n/a

        Actual Results:
        n/a
