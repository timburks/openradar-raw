    description: "Stephen Tramer18-Jan-2016 01:07 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nExiting an application via -[UIApplication openURL:] or other means breaks the ability of the UI tests to drive the UI of an application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample.\r\n\r\n1. Create UI element linked to an action which calls -[UIApplocation openURL:] in a valid manner.\r\n2. Record a test in which you:\r\na. Click the element\r\nb. Click the 'Return to application' button in the status bar\r\nc. Click the element again (or a separate element)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUI driver functions correctly even after external app is loaded; the test completes correctly by performing step 2b. and recognizing the element in step 2c. existing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTest continues to run, but cannot interact with the simulator. Step 2b is never run and test fails at step 2c.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached minimal reproducible test case.\r\n\r\nNote that you may still *record* these interactions, as demonstrated in the attached sample, even though they do not function correctly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
