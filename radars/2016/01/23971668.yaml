    description: "Summary:\r\nThe CNContactViewController in the Unknown Contact version hides the navigation bar when the user chooses one from create new, add to existing or add to 'known'. Pressing the Cancel button dismisses the editor but the navigation bar remains hidden. Moreover the bar hides without any animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Push the CNContactViewController forUnknownContact with a dummy CNContact.\r\n2. Grant access if requested.\r\n3. You are shown the partial contact, in our navigation interface (note the Back button at the top).\r\n4. Tap Add to Existing Contact. The contact picker appears.\r\n5. Tap Cancel. It doesn't actually matter what you do from here, but tapping Cancel is simplest and is the fastest way to reach the bug.\r\n6. We are now back at the partial contact, but the navigation interface is gone. The user has no way to escape from this interface. The app is locked.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe step 6 should be:\r\n6. We are now back at the partial contact and the navigation interface is again available. The user can tap the back button and the interface is fully functional.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe navigation bar is hidden. No way to go back.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is linked with the new XPC interface of the Contacts UI. The new interface wants to stay in fullscreen, but it is added as a navigation bar subview. Thats the needs to hide the bar."
