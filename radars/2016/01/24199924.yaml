    description: "Summary:\r\nMy sandboxed app can no longer launch tasks from its Application Support directory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI’ve included (in the Apple Bug Report)  a very simple project that demonstrates our results.\r\n\r\nFirst, you’ll need to perform some quick setup:\r\n\r\n1. Compile and run the sample project. You should see a window like this:\r\n\r\n[Launch from Applications]\r\n[Launch from App Support]\r\n\r\n2. Press the Launch from App Support button. You will see an expected error dialog (we’re doing this to construct the expected Application Support directory). The error dialog should tell you that it couldn't launch the task.\r\n\r\n3. Create a simple shell script in /Applications/launch-me. For example, here’s what I did:\r\n\r\n[breton] ~ $ cat > /Applications/launch-me << EOL\r\n> #!/bin/sh\r\n> echo \"Launched Successfully!\"\r\n> EOL\r\n\r\n4. Make the shell script executable:\r\n\r\n[breton] ~ $ chmod +x /Applications/launch-me \r\n\r\n5. Copy the shell script to the Application Support directory:\r\n\r\n[breton] ~ $ cp /Applications/launch-me ~/Library/Containers/co.180g.SandboxTaskBug/Data/Library/Application\\ Support/SandboxTaskBug/\r\n\r\n6. Now, your setup is complete. When you run the SandboxTaskBug application on OS X versions prior to 10.11.2, you will see the following output in Xcode’s console when you press the first and then the second button:\r\n\r\nLaunched Successfully!\r\nLaunched Successfully!\r\n\r\nIf, however, you run it on OS X 10.11.2, you’ll get the following error when you try to Launch from App Support:\r\n\r\nEXCEPTION:\r\nlaunch path not accessible\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to launch the task.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get an exception.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7 and 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI contacted Apple Developer Technical Support, which confirmed my results.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBA 13\" mid-2012"
