    description: "When I received a cryptographically signed email with Mail.pp, I don't have the \"signed\" icon on the email.\r\nThe process runs correctly (the certificate is downloaded and stored in the Keyring, in address book I can the checkmark next to the address of the contact) but I can't see in Mail that email is signed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask someone to send you a signed email \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see in the mail that it's signed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't distinguish the email from a normal (=not signed) one.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf I search for old email, received using 10.8 before the upgrade to 10.10, I do see the signed checkmark on the email."
