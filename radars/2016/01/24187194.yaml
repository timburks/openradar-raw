        Summary:
        I found by accident that hovering with the mouse over the completely white right side of an address lets a (IU guessed that then, but not obvious either) location pinner. This pinner should always be available and not only if a user by accident hovers his mouse over the area

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a contact with an address in Contacts 9.0 on 10.11.2 and mouse over the right portion of it - a blue location pinner should appear (it does on my system).

        Expected Results:
        This pinner should always be visible as people usually search with their eyes and not with their mouse flying around for stuff. By merely looking, one has no chance of discovering that.

        Actual Results:
        Only when „mousing over“ the right region, a button to jump to Maps.app appears.

        Regression:
        If I remember correctly, in previous versions of Contacts (née Address book), the button was always visible.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
