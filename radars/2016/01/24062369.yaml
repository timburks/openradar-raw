    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a website set as a \"home screen\" app open.\r\n\r\nIf I start Guided Access, then enable the Sleep/Wake button under the Hardware Buttons section, then put the device to sleep with the Sleep/Wake button, I cannot wake the device.\r\n\r\nThe Sleep/Wake button does nothing. The Home button does nothing.\r\n\r\nThere are only two ways I've found to wake the device up: 1) press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for several seconds or 2) plug in and unplug the device 1-2 times.\r\n\r\nA simplified page is attached that demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a \"home screen\" web app. An example is attached here.\r\n2. Start Guided Access.\r\n3. Change the Guided Access settings for Hardware Buttons to enable the Sleep/Wake button.\r\n4. Resume Guided Access.\r\n5. Press the Sleep/Wake button to put the device to sleep.\r\n6. Press the Sleep/Wake button to try to wake the device. It will not wake. Press the Home button to try to wake the device. It will not wake.\r\n\r\nI've tried this perhaps 20-25 times and it happened every time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the Home button or the Sleep/Wake button to wake the device up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device will not wake up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 [13C75]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing Safari by itself, not with a home screen web app, seemed to be fine. Using standard Apple apps, like Contacts, seemed to be fine. This seems to be a problem only with home screen web apps.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 Model MGL12LL/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'index.html' was successfully uploaded."
