    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be great if the iOS SDK allowed apps to include extensions capable of presenting UI to handle streaming audio data much like how the photos extension allows applications to present a UI to modify image data.\r\n\r\nThe ideal use case would be for something like the Sonos app. The Sonos app supports Apple Music but the UI isn’t as good as the iOS Music app. Instead of being forced to use the Sonos app to play music on some or all of my speakers, it would be great if I could select a song in Music.app and share it with Sonos. The Sonos extension could show a modal that lets me choose on which speakers to play the music.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose a sick jam in Music.app.\r\n2. Decide this sick jam needs to be played everywhere in your house because it’s Fleet Week and everybody’s getting turnt.\r\n3. Realize you can’t do this and you need to open Sonos and find the same sick jam in their sub-par UI.\r\n4. Fumble around for 2 minutes instead of being an amazing host with sick jams.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to be able to send music directly from Music to my Sonos speakers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLooked like a dork during the lapse of sick jams.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas always occurred. This is a problem that has plagued man since the beginning of time."
