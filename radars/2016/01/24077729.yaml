    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen first getting started with Apple Pay, merchants sometimes make a mistake registering for a certificate from Apple â€“ for example, they might use a self-generated CSR, rather than downloading a CSR from Stripe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even after they fix this by creating a new certificate, Xcode will often incorrectly cache the old certificate if they're using the same Apple Merchant ID. The only real workaround here is to start from scratch, creating a brand-new Apple Merchant ID and certificate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new Apple Merchant ID.\r\n* Create a CSR in Keychain Access (rather than downloading it from Stripe).\r\n* Use the CSR to create a (bad) certificate for the merchant ID.\r\n* Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apple_pay and upload the bad certificate to Stripe.\r\n* Create a token using Apple Pay, following the instructions at https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios#applepay.\r\n* As expected, Stripe returns an invalid certificate error.\r\n\r\n* Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apple_pay and delete the bad certificate.\r\n* Revoke the bad certificate on https://developer.apple.com.\r\n* Download a CSR from Stripe and create a new certificate for the merchant ID.\r\n* Upload the good certificate to Stripe.\r\n* Create a token using Apple Pay.\r\n* Due to what appears to be Xcode caching the old certificate, Stripe will still return an invalid certificate error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\nOSX 10.11.2 (15C50)"
