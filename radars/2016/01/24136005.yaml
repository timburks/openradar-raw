        Summary:
        The text in a UITextField jumps when switching to another responder that displays the keyboard. It seems the UITextField responds to the keyboard hiding and showing directly by performing some sort of unnecessary animation.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create two UITextFields
        2. set the focus to the first
        3. type some text
        4. make the second textfield first responder

        Expected Results:
        The text stays as is in the first textfield.

        Actual Results:
        The text in the first textfield jumps around. See attached movie.

        Regression:
        This has been happening since the first IOS 9 betas and hasn’t been fixed in any iOS 9 version. This bug was not present in iOS8.

        Notes:
        The attached movie shows how switching between a UITextField and a first responder shows the textfield’s content jump. This only happens on the first switch. Switching responders a second time does not trigger this issue.
