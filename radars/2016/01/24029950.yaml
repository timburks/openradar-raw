        Summary:
        Sometimes you need an NSLengthFormatter that only uses a subset of the included units. It’d be nice to have an option to provide an allowed list of units.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use NSLengthFormatter for short (< 1 mile) distances.

        Expected Results:
        You can make the formatter output “0.1 mi.”

        Actual Results:
        You get a value in yards.

        Notes:
        What I want is something like this in NSLengthFormatter:

        - (void)setAllowedUnits:(NSLengthFormatterUnit)unitMask;

        Where unitMask is an option set of NSLengthFormatterUnits.
