    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently (to my knowledge) there  is no easy way to change default input source (keyboard layout) for loginwindow. \r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice for users to have option for this (maybe along with setting language) in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Options?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne method for chaning input source is running SetupAssistant again by deleting /var/db/.AppleSetupDone (which is not optimal since it creates another admin account).  Other methods require Shell skills or enabling root login.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
