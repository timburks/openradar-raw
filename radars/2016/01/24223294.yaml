    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the mood for some Paul Simon, I asked Siri: \"Play me and Julio down by the schoolyard.\" Although the request was interpreted perfectly, and the words are an exact match that exists in both my library and on Apple Music, Siri leaps to playing Jello Biafra and DOA's \"That's Progress\" instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Arrange to have Jello Biafra and DOA's \"That's Progress\" in your library.\r\n2. Arrange to have Paul Simon's \"Me and Julio down by the schoolyard\" in your library.\r\n3. Invoke Siri and request \"Play me and Julio down by the schoolyard\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA 1970s chill folk vibe should commence.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn aggressive punk vibe prevails.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S, Verizon.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_4039.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
