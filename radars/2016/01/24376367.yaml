Pick an app with a folder in Application Support\r\n2. Delete the application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected system to ask me if I want to delete the Application's support folder e.g. Like Hazel system preferences panel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFolder is left in Applications Folder to rot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nany/all\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
