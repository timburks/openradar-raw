    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scheduling a large number of local notification with a fire date in the past (e.g. due to a bug), not only does the app that does this crash but also the SpringBoard. This results in the white Apple logo showing while SpringBoard is restarting.\r\n\r\nSometimes also an Apple Watch that is attached to the device does crash as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached sample project and run on an iPhone\r\n- Respond to the question if the app can show local notifications with ‘allow’\r\n- Wait 30 seconds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Nothing happens or maybe the app itself crashes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The white Apple Logo is shown and SpringBoard restarts\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample Project: https://github.com/michaelochs/radars/tree/master/24056370%20-%20SpringBoardCrash"
