    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I switch between 2 projects, each having a coredata xcdatamodel , Xcode & xcodebuild hangs on momc. Xcode doesn't even hint this.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only solution is to logout and log back in and it magically fixes this issue. It repeats if I try to switch over to another project.\r\n\r\nI can duplicate this in 2 of my projects and nowhere else.  I tried this with couple of sample apps from developer.apple.com and couldn't duplicate the issue.\r\n\r\nI tried capturing what momc is doing via dtruss , have attached the log here. Letting momc run results in a bunch of kevent_qos() and workq_kernreturn() calls."
