        Summary:
        A single method takes 75+ seconds to compile

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the provided project and build. Check the log for build times which have been enabled via `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -Xfrontend -debug-time-function-bodies`

        Expected Results:
        Expression is too complex warning or faster compilation? I don’t know, actually. If there is something horrible that I am doing, I would like a diagnostic to tell me as much.

        Actual Results:
        Stultifying compilation times.

        Regression:
        It has been this way for months, I only just found a flag to locate the problem method.

        Notes:
