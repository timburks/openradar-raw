    description: "When an application other than Music, eg Youtube, is playing audio, on a phone that is connected to my car audio system via the USB interface, when a call is answered Youtube is paused but the Music app starts playing, over the call. This happens when the phone is connected via USB, not when it is playing via Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to car via USB\r\n2. Select iPhone in car entertainment system\r\n3. Music always starts playing\r\n4. Open Youtube and start playing a video\r\n5. Music stops, Youtube starts playing via audio\r\n6. Answer a call via Bluetooth\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nYoutube is paused and call can go on via Bluetooth\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nYoutube is paused, call starts via Bluetooth, music starts playing so music is heard mixed together with call\r\n\r\nThis happens on earlier iOS versions as well."
