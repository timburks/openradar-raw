    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a long text in a text field, you select it and dismiss without the contextual menu and after that you try to tap the clear button the conextual menu appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou can reproduce it in Safari. To reproduce it there:\r\n\r\n1. Write a long text\r\n2. Move to cursor to the end of the text and select all.\r\n3. Dismiss the contextual menu keeping the text selected. You can do it by clicking close to Cancel button (not on it). (At this moment, we have the scenario we have in our app.)\r\n3. Try to tap the clear button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text field should be cleared if you hit the clear button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContextual menu is shown instead of deleting the text"
