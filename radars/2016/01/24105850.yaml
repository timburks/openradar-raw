        When writing a switch statement in Swift, Xcode defaults to indenting the cases as such:

        let vegetable = "kale"
        switch vegetable {

        case "chocolate":
        	return "Not a vegetable at all."

        case "banana":
        	return "That's a fruit…"

        default:
        	return "Yes \(vegetable) is clearly a vegetable!"
        }



        While it seems like this style does have some past usage, Xcode has classically indented C code such that the cases are indented one level. This should be applied to Swift as well, which would give the following style:

        switch vegetable {

            case "chocolate":
                return "Not a vegetable at all."

            case "banana":
                return "That's a fruit…"

            default:
                return "Yes \(vegetable) is clearly a vegetable!"
        }



        I have also attached an image of The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, which shows their preference for the latter method of indenting the case statements.
