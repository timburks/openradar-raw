    description: "Summary:\r\nMy understanding is that Obj-C source files that are placed into DerivedSources (i.e. DERIVED_FILE_DIR) are automatically compiled into the target executable (i.e. the app). However, this does not seem to occur for Swift source files placed into that directory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Run Script Build Phase that copies a .swift file into DERIVED_FILE_DIR. Note that it does not appear to be built (intermediate object files are not present in the build directory, and the contained class is not available at runtime).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use a Build Rule to manually copy one of your Swift files into DERIVED_FILE_DIR instead of being compiled normally.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe copied Swift source file should be complied into the executable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe copied Swift file is apparently ignored by the compiler."
