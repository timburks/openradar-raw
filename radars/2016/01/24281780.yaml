    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Watch can connect to wifi networks when not connected to an iPhone, as specified here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204562. Unfortunately, if the iPhone connects to a network using 5GHz 802.11ac, the Apple Watch will not attempt to connect to the same network SSID even if 2.4GHz 802.11n is also supported.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an iPhone and Apple Watch.\r\n2. Connect the iPhone to a wifi network that supports 802.11ac, but also 802.11n and satisfies the requirements of the previously-linked page.\r\n3. Turn off the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Apple Watch connects to the network using 802.11n and the Settings glance displays a green cloud.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Apple Watch does not connect to the wifi network—presumably because it only “knows” about support for 802.11ac on the network, which the watch does not support.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2.1 (13S661) and iOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch (42mm)\r\niPhone 6s Plus"
