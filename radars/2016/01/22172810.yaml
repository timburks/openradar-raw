    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to update an app, iOS doesn't prompt for a username or password when not signed in.  The app can only be updated by first signing into iTunes and the App Store under Settings then iTunes & App Store then returning to the App Store and updating.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpdate Fails:\r\n0.  Be signed out of iTunes and the App Store.\r\n1.  Open the App Store and switch to the Updates tab.\r\n2.  Select Update.\r\n3.  The update indicator infinitely spins.\r\n\r\nUpdate Succeeds:\r\n0.  Sign into the iTunes and the App Store under Settings.\r\n1.  Open the App Store and switch to the Updates tab.\r\n2.  Select Update.\r\n3.  The update begins downloading.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf I'm not logged into iTunes and the App Store it should prompt me for my username and password, then begin downloading the app update after I log in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf I'm not first logged into iTunes and the App Store the app fails to update and the update indicator spins infinitely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 (12H143).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese are some side note regarding the overall password prompt in iOS.  The password prompt seems to repeatedly want me to enter my password at different times after I've already signed in, even when I'm not doing anything that requires me to sign in (changing settings).  The password prompt will keep asking me to sign in even after I've tapped Cancel.  Also, I've changed my password settings to Require every 15 minutes, but it hasn't remembered this setting; I have to set it every time I log in.  Do I need to submit these notes as a separate bug report, or can they just stay in this one?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 16GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
