    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I open the Photos app on iCloud.com, it shows the \"preparing your library\" progress bar for a few minutes (see attached). This might be because I don't log in very often, although I actively use the native apps on my Mac and iPhone. \r\n\r\nI don't think it should show this screen after initial setup. Whatever updating/indexing it needs to do should be done incrementally as new photos are uploaded, not when the user logs in. Although I have 50 GB of photos, the rate of photos being added is relatively slow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niCloud Apple ID: kevin@kevinchen.co\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2015-12-24 at 6.26.53 PM.png' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttp://cl.ly/471F1k3E3i2b/content"
