    description: "When using IBDesignable views with IBInspectable string attributes, you can choose to make them of the type \"Localized String\" which works well with base internationalization. That way, the runtime attributes end up in the strings files when using ibtool to generate them.\r\n\r\nUsing the Interface Builder preview assistant editor, the correctly localized strings show for each localized language. But when running on an iOS device (or simulator), only the development language is loaded while other localized attributes (which are not user defined) work correctly."
