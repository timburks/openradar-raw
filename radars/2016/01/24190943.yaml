        Summary:
        Sometimes, seemingly randomly, I’ll get a build failure with the message (for one or more of my 150+ tests) “Lost connection to test manager service”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I’m not sure what causes this, but I’ve attached a full log download. The server is running OS X 10.10.5 (Build 14F1509) and Server 5.0.15 (Build 15S4033)

        Expected Results:
        Tests should always yield a meaningful, actionable failure when running incorrectly

        Actual Results:
        The failure seems to be on the part of Server, not my tests. If it’s some sort of timeout (my tests become unresponsive past a particular threshold, or something of the sort), they should fail with a message indicating that
