    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a way to produce zombie-records in your database of push-ids what results in receiving push messages in one app via two push ids.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an app with push-notifications enabled. \r\n- do an ad-hoc-distribution onto a device. let the app register the device at your APNS. write down the push-id.\r\n- remove the app and install an App-Store-Build of the same app with the same app-id.\r\n- register the app and the devuce at your APNS and write down this push-id. \r\n\r\nsend a push to both of the push-ids\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nonly the push message of the currently installed app should be delivered (in this case: the app store-version). the push message with the ad-hoc-build-pushId should not be delivered, because the app is not installed anymore\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth messages are delivered. I guess the iOS just checks for app-id. It does not check if the push-id is still valid.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 13C75\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9, iPhone 6,\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
