        Summary:
        When attempting to save an NSManagedObjectContext using its own queue, but calling performBlock from a global queue, the save call never returns

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the attached playground

        Expected Results:
        Either the “save” call throws, or it prints:

        a
        b

        Actual Results:
        It prints:

        a

        Notes:
        I first experienced this in the context of my actual code under development, from within a unit test. I condensed it into this reproducible playground
