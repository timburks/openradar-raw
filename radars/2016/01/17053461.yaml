    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Dock, when hidden, doesn't immediately show when hovered over.  OS X 10.9.3\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0.  The \"Automatically hide and show the Dock\" option is checked inside the System Preferences.  The Dock is located on the bottom of the screen.\r\n1.  Start up Mac Pro 5,1\r\n2.  After the desktop background and Apple logo cross fade, I move the cursor to the bottom of the screen to unhide the Dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Mac OS X 10.6.8, I could immediately move my mouse to the bottom of the screen, and the Dock would unhide.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn OS X 10.9.3, I have to move my mouse down to the bottom of the screen twice, or use Mission Control to make the Dock unhide.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.3 Build 13D65\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe only time the Dock will unhide correctly, is if an app, other than the Finder, opens at boot time.  E.G.  System Preferences.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
