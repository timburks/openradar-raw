    description: "Live photos in Photos app are initially displayed in high sharpness. A short strong press causes sharp photo to be replaced with a low-resolution one. The short press has to be no longer than 0.5s so not to trigger the movie. But it appears to be enough to replace the original photo with a low-sharpness one. I guess a frame form a \"live\" view is shown instead the original photo. Now the photo for sliding/zooming appears to be blurry. The original photo is only restored upon triggering movie play (strong long press).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a photo with live view in Photos on the phone to display it full screen\r\n2. Short, strong press (not enough to trigger the movie, but enough to blur the photo)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe original sharp photo should be shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo is blurred (see attached files)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S"
