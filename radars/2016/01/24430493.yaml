        Summary:
        Whenever I'm connected to my home network, I find myself disconnected from said home network. I have disabled Wifi Assist.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect to my home network (we have two great cats and decent coffee!)
        2. Do some idle browsing
        3. Look up at the menubar on your Glorious Future of Computing Device
        4. 4G instead of wifi bars
        5. Frown like you've never frowned before! http://45.media.tumblr.com/cd2369e6b75349290d4addcb3594ded8/tumblr_nxt634tytr1qe0eclo5_r1_500.gif

        Expected Results:
        I just want to like, use my wifi man.

        Actual Results:
        Wifi keeps dropping

        Regression:

        Notes:
        I know about the internet, I did some extensive research (3 minutes of googling, during which, yes you've guessed it I got bumped off of wifi and was on 4G instead) and may have stumbled upon a solution:

        1. Join wifi network
        2. Enable Wi-Fi Assist
        3. Disable Wi-Fi Assist
        4. Profit!

        This seems to have helped since I've now been on my own Wi-Fi for over 5 minutes! A brave new world! I haven't been this excited since Wi-Fi was released as an in app purchase!
