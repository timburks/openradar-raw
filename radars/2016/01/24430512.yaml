        Summary:
        Searching for 'Wi-Fi' doesn't show where Wi-Fi assist should be.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Settings
        2. Pull down for search menu
        3. Type 'Wi-Fi'

        Expected Results:
        It tells me Wi-Fi Assist is in the Cellular menu (because putting it in 'Wi-Fi' would be like totally confusing)

        Actual Results:
        No Wi-Fi Assist listed in the search results

        Regression:
        I've used a computering system once that displayed it's settings in a spatial layout with multiple rows and icons, at the top right it had a search box and when I typed stuff into it it would highlight where I could find it in the menu. If I recall correctly it was pronounced OS Ten, and it was glorious right up to the Snow Leopard one. It was a simpler time.

        Notes:
        Now I realise there are only two hard things in computer science, naming things and searching a UITableView, unfortunately because the 'Naming Things' didn't go really well and 'Wi-Fi Assist' was put under Cellular, you'll also need to solve the other hard thing.

        Godspeed, brave engineer!
