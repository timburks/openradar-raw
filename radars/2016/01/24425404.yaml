    description: "Summary:\r\n- App crashes when calling presentScene:withTransition:incomingPointOfView:completionHandler: with an SKTransition created with transitionWithCIFilter:duration:\r\n- Works fine with the other, predefined, SKTransitions\r\n- I verified that there is no problem with the CIFilter by creating a small prototype app that applies the filter on a UIImage\r\n\r\n- It seems to only crash with Metal rendering, not OpenGL. OpenGL doesn't animate the transition, though, i.e. it is broken, too\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project with the Game template\r\n2. In the GameViewController import CoreImage and SpriteKit\r\n3. Change scnView.scene = scene to scnView.presentScene(scene, withTransition: SKTransition(CIFilter: CIFilter(name: \"CIDissolveTransition\")!, duration: 2.0), incomingPointOfView: cameraNode, completionHandler: nil)\r\n4. Compile and run on a device that supports Metal rendering\r\n5. App crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS in jet_context::set_fragment_texture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to see the scene presented with an animated transition\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- On Metal: A crash (see attached .log file)\r\n- On OpenGL: No crash, but no animation either\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64GB / iPad Air 2 64GB"
