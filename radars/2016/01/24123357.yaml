        I have a reasonably large iTunes library (~ 250 TV shows, some with only the pilot, some with up to 12 seasons so far), plus 56 movies, plus a little under 10'000 songs, and in excess of 200 playlists. The library has accumulated over years, so there are ~5 different iTunes accounts from different countries involved.

        If I pick the via the Home Sharing popup in the upper left of the window, in a fast case, it takes 15 seconds to load the first page of the music section, and *then* I have to switch to TV shows to be able to actually watch TV. Usually, it takes closer to half a minute or a whole minute (on a MacBook 12" via an 802.11ac wireless connection).

        On an iPad 3 it is factor 3 to 5 slower. I don't even bother trying to use that anymore. Oddly, iTunes on a Windows PC never takes more than 10 seconds.

        Would be nice if you could speed that up. Maybe not load the entire library up front, but rather just what needs to be shown right now? And let me jump directly to TV shows instead of having to go through 10'000 songs of music every time that I won't play.
