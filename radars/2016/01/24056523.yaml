    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to use the +imageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection: method of UIImage on a NSBundle containing a plain compiled asset catalog (\"Assets.car\"), it always returns nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a bundle, separate from the main bundle, in an iOS project\r\n2. Place a compiled asset catalog in the bundle (\"Assets.car\")\r\n3. In the application code, load an image contained in the compiled asset catalog with +imageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe +imageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection: should return an UIImage with the image data of the image file contained in the asset catalog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnil is returned\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample project. Some notes:\r\n• There is a \"Sample.xcassets\" image asset catalog that is not part of the main application bundle (and thus not the Xcode application target).\r\n• There is a custom bundle \"Custom.bundle\" included in the Xcode application target via a folder reference.\r\n• There is an image, \"candle.png\" in both the main application asset catalog, and in the sample asset catalog.\r\n• Using a custom build script (see \"Run Script\" build phase), the \"Sample.xcassets\" is compiled into \"Assets.car\" inside the \"Custom.bundle\" bundle, using actool shell command.\r\n• The UI contains two image views, +imageNamed:inBundle:compatibleWithTraitCollection: is used with the image name \"candle\" for each of the bundles to one image view each. As you can see in the application, only the first image view displays the image as intended.\r\n• Problem is mentioned on the developer forums as well: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/99742\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Bundle Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded.
