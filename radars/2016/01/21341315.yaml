    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen starting into OS X El Capitan, the Dock will sometimes fail to unhide when bumped once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start El Capitan.\r\n2. Bump hidden Dock.\r\n3. Dock fails to unhide.\r\n4. Bump Dock a second time and the Dock unhides.\r\n\r\nRun the Terminal command killall Dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Dock should unhide after being bumped once consistently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Dock must be bumped twice in most cases to unhide it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 (15A178w) MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditionally, when using the Terminal command killall Dock, the Dock must always be bumped twice to restore.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but when running killall Dock, the desktop background goes black temporarily.  In Snow Leopard, the background would stay the same and the Dock would always unhide with one bump.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoing a safe boot will always cause the Dock to unhide first bump.  After doing a safe boot and returning to a normal boot, the Dock will inconsistently unhide on the first bump for several subsequent boots, but will ultimately return to requiring two bumps to unhide.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
