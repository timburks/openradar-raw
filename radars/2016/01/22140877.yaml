    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen first enabling \"Show fast user switching menu as [Full Name, Account Name, or Icon]\" the space allocated to this option is blank; the name or icon doesn't appear.  However, the space where the name or icon would appear is expanded in the menu bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open System Preferences.\r\n2.  Left-click Users & Groups.\r\n3.  Left-click Login Options.\r\n4.  Click the lock to make changes.\r\n5.  Left-click Show fast user switching menu as [Full Name, Account Name, or Icon].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe fast user switching menu should immediately appear when selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe fast user switching menu appears blank when it's first enabled, but appears correctly after the system time is updated.  In addition, clicking the menu bar space allocation doesn't cause the user name or icon to appear (tried this as a workaround).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 Beta 6 (15A244d).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug can be reproduced consistently by turning the fast user switching on and off in the System Preferences.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
