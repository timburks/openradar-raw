    description: "The activity rings in watchOS are superb motivators. I have become totally obsessed with closing my rings every day.I find myself going t the gym late at night just to complete my rings. Unfortunately, I am disappointed that I'm not allowed to enter activity manually.\r\n\r\nWhy should I be allowed to enter activity manually? Frankly, it should be none of you business as this is a truly personal matter. Never the less, here are a couple of scenarios:\r\n1) Halfway into my 5K walk with my dog, I realize that I failed to put my watch on. \r\n2) I wake up in the morning and realize that a pillow I dropped unplugged the the watch, which is now into power savings mode. This means I can't take it during my morning walk.\r\n3) The ï£¿ WATCH is not rated to be water proof. Sure, I've heard several reports that it actually quite safe to take it out for a swim, but frankly, it is an expensive enough device, that I don't want to take any risks. This means that during my 8 month move steak, I have not been able to do any swimming. There are many tools available to calculate calories burnt for a swimming routine. Allowing me to enter those work outs manually, would allow to add swimming back to my routine."
