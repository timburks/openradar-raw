    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a code is marked with an @available attribute, and the code is also made available in Objective-C, the auto-generated Objective-C \"bridge\" does not mark its code as deprecated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple Swift type and mark it deprecated, for example: @available(iOS, introduced=8.0, deprecated=9.0, message=\"Stop using this.\")\r\n2. Make sure the type is available in Objective-C.\r\n3. Use the deprecated type in some Swift code.\r\n4. Use the deprecated type in some Objective-C code.\r\n5. Build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeprecation warnings appear in both Swift and Objective-C code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeprecation warnings appear only in Swift code.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was observed on a Swift class extension on NSObject, but the problem likely carries over elsewhere.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNot Applicable"
