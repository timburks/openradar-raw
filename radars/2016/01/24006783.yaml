    description: "Summary:\r\niOS application [Xcode target UITestingDemo] (see https://github.com/vgorloff/Radar24006783) contains UI Tests [UITestingDemoUITests] and Logic Tests [UITestingDemoTests]. iOS application also uses Shared Framework [UITestingDemoKit] with reusable code.\r\n\r\nAfter running UI Tests and Logic Tests within target, the CodeCoverage report contain the following statistics:\r\n\r\n- Code usage from Application Bundle (produced by UI Tests)\r\n- Code usage from Shared Framework (produced by Logic Tests)\r\n\r\nBut the CodeCoverage report does not contains the following statistics:\r\n\r\n- Code usage from Shared Framework (produced by UI Tests)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached project in Xcode. Select iPhone 6s as destination. Select shared build schema \"UITestingDemo\" and run tests (press cmd+U).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCodeCoverage report should show statistics about MyView class usage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCodeCoverage report show that MyView class usage is zero (0) which is not truth because this class and it's methods used during UI Tests.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68), iOS 9.2 Simulator (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne more issue:\r\nDisabling Logic Tests [Xcode target UITestingDemoTests] from build schema cause cause CodeCoverage report show zero statistics for all classes (zero code usage).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\nMac OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50)"
