    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you focus on a UIBarButtonItem that is an icon, even a system provided one such as Compose, the white icon disappears into the white background of the button. This is in contrast to text based UIBarButtonItems where the text changes colour to black on focus. Sample project attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIBarButtonItem from an image or a system provided button item that uses an icon (e.g. Compose).\r\n2. Run the app and focus on the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon should change colour to black to continue to be visible against the white background on focus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe icon stays white and is no longer visible to the user.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTV Simulator tvOS 9.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Foo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
