    description: "Summary:\r\nEach time I've updated El Capitan (10.11.0 -> 10.11.1, 10.11.1 -> 10.11.2, & 10.11.2 -> 10.11.3), I've been presented with a login screen for a \"Setup User\" after a certain point in the update process. No passwords will be accepted at this point and there are no options to select a different user or restart gracefully. The only option is to perform a forced restart/shutdown. After rebooting, the normal login window (username and password fields) appears and I can login as a regular user.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis Mac is bound to AD and \"Display login window as:\" is set to \"Name and password\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nModel Name:\tMac mini\r\nModel Identifier:\tMacmini7,1\r\nProcessor Name:\tIntel Core i7\r\nProcessor Speed:\t3 GHz\r\nNumber of Processors:\t1\r\nTotal Number of Cores:\t2\r\nL2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\nL3 Cache:\t4 MB\r\nMemory:\t16 GB\r\nBoot ROM Version:\tMM71.0220.B06\r\nSMC Version (system):\t2.24f32\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2016.01.20_13-03-20-0500_795.tar.gz' and 'IMG_1124.JPG' were successfully uploaded."
