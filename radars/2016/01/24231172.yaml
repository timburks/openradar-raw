    description: "Summary:\r\nSome use of iPads in education, like for example large scale examinations require high network reliability and high bandwidth (like displaying high resolution video or using screen capture and camera live video streaming for proctoring), so it would be helpful to have an alternative to WiFi in some situations and locations. Not all places like large rooms/halls used for e-assessment for hundreds of examinees can be equipped with WiFi which is highly reliable even when used with high bandwidth. Also all WiFi networks are vulnerable to sabotage using maliciously configured and strategically placed mobile WiFi hotspots. This could lead to exams which would fail or need to be canceled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- A Lightning to Ethernet adapter might look similar as the Thunderbolt (or USB) to Ethernet adapter for Mac Books.\r\n- As Ethernet adapters usually consume a lot of energy, such a Lightning to Ethernet adapter could have a Lightning socket where a regular iPad charger could be connected. \r\n- The Lightning to Ethernet adapter should at the same time allow charging the iPad (when the adapter is connected to an iPad charger).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA Lightning to Ethernet adapter is available which can be used to connect iPads to a LAN and provides wired internet connection without having to use WiFi or cellular data networks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPads can only be connected to the internet using WiFi or cellular data networks.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iPad models running all iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iPads running all iOS versions."
