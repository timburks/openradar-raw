        Summary:

        -[NSLayoutManager boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer:] should return the rectangle used to contain the glyphs, but this is not true in all circumstances, for example with calligraphic fonts such as Zapfino or Snell Roundhand

        From the NSLayoutManager documentation
        - (NSRect)boundingRectForGlyphRange:(NSRange)glyphRange inTextContainer:(NSTextContainer *)container

        “This method can be used to translate glyph ranges into display rectangles for invalidation and redrawing when a range of glyphs changes.”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Typeset a line using the string “Oh Zapfino!” in Zapfino 100pt, and use -[NSLayoutManager boundingRectForGlyphRange:inTextContainer:] to query the glyph bounds.

        Expected Results:
        The returned rectangle should contain the glyphs.

        Actual Results:
        The returned rectangle is too small to contain the glyphs by some margin.

        Regression:
        I have not seen this succeed in any configuration.

        Notes:
        I recognise APIs do exist at the CoreText level to accurately measure the bounds, but this problematic when used with a custom NSTypesetter subclass.
