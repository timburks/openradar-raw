        Summary:
        Triggers rely on environment variables set by Xcode to perform actions based on built products / integration numbers / failure or success statuses. These environment variables are undocumented, and have changed between Xcode Server 6 and 7. Ideally these should be documented.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Attempt to locate documentation for what features are available via build triggers. Find none, resort to printenv and StackOverflow.

        Expected Results:
        There should be documentation on developer.apple.com stating what environment variables are available as part of the API.

        Actual Results:
        No documentation is available
