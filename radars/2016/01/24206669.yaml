    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode is my favorite IDE by far, but when it comes to JSON editing, there's room for improvement. Features that I get for free when editing Objective-C and Swift are simply not there.\r\n\r\nThe features I'm looking for are code folding, and indentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new file in Xcode.\r\n2. Save it with the .json extension.\r\n3. Write some JSON.\r\n4. Select all, then autoindent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should indent each object a little more than its parent. Code folding in the sidebar should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe autoindented code is almost entirely unindented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
