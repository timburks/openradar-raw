    description: "Summary:\r\nMy team and I write a lot of tests, and we always have a CI server running that will run our tests after each commit. Lately, as the team has grown, we've been seeing more EXC_BAD_ACCESS kernel exceptions, and we've been trying to track them down.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's hard to find the cause, because when this happens the xcodebuild command line stops writing to STDOUT and appears to hang indefinitely. This is quite frustrating because we then need to reset our xcode build server and identify what happened.\r\n\r\nNote: this occurs regardless of whether \"Debug executable\" is selected for the application under test, or the test bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 7.2 (possibly earlier builds)\r\n2. git clone https://github.com/tjarratt/DemonstrateXcodeHang\r\n3. cd DemonstrateXcodeHang\r\n4. xcodebuild test -scheme DemonstrateXcodeHang -destination platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6,OS=9.1\r\n5. Wait for the one test to finish\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test should finish and indicate something horrible happened.\r\n\r\nI do not expect the entire test suite to finish, or even explain exactly what did occur, just for it to halt at some point. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe xcodebuild process hangs forever.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nOS X 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor an example of this, please see this github repository\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tjarratt/DemonstrateXcodeHang\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on all hardware I've tested this on, with Xcode 7.2. Earlier releases of Xcode may be affected as well."
