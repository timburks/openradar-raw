    description: "Summary:\r\nRendering an image in a collection view cell in template mode results in wrong color when the same image is also used inside the cell template in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the attached sample project\r\n- Notice that all images in the asset catalog are set to template rendering mode, so they should render in the default blue color.\r\n- Run the project on a device or on a simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll images are drawn in template mode and appear blue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo images are rendered in blue, the third one however (the one that was used in the storyboard as the image for lay outing the cell) is not drawn in template mode but instead in regular mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNotice that as soon as you tap the image that is drawn in red, it immediately switches to blue as well.\r\n\r\nThere is also a video attached, showing this problem, where you see me launching the sample and after a few seconds tapping the red cell.\r\n\r\nSample:\r\nhttps://github.com/michaelochs/radars/tree/master/24169057%20-%20CollectionViewTintColor"
