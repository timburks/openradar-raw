        Summary:
        Despite the option 'Show Apple Music' being turned off it regulargly prompts me to join it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try out Apple Music
        2. Sign out and stop the trial (because reasons)
        3. Open the Music app
        4. Be greeted with a launch screen prompting you to join Apple Music [0]

        Expected Results:
        I'd like to be able to see my own music on my glorious Apple device.

        Actual Results:
        I need to dismiss a commercial before being able to see my own music on my glorious Apple device.

        Regression:

        In the olden days, when iOS was still a glorious hack and iTunes only acted as a great music player and a decent syncer of devices, I used to be able to open iTunes on the phone and there would be my music.

        These days, Apple Music wanted to make money and keeps prompting me to join them. The undeletable Apple Watch app was poor, this is just sad. You used to be cool man.
