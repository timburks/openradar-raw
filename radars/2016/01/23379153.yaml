    description: "Summary:\r\nWe've built 1Password for Teams (https://teams.1password.com), a new way of using 1Password with groups of people. It includes an admin console as well as a full web client. Using the admin console and web client currently requires Chrome, or Firefox on the Mac due to Safari's lack of full support for WebCrypto. We'd love for this to also work in Safari, but without WebCrypto we really can't do it. \r\n\r\nHere are the specific methods we're using:\r\n\r\nsubtle.generateKey\r\nsubtle.exportKey\r\nsubtle.importKey\r\nsubtle.deriveBits\r\nsubtle.encrypt\r\nsubtle.decrypt\r\nsubtle.digest\r\n\r\nHere's a list of the algorithms we're making use of:\r\n\r\nSHA-256\r\nAES-GCM\r\nRSA_OAEP_256\r\nPBKDF-2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X, Safari 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
