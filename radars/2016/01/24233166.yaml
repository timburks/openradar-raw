    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter waking from sleep, user is presented with a login window showing only their Full Name, the password field, and a cancel button. There are no options to switch users or shutdown. User will attempt to enter his/her password, but it will not be accepted (after a 2 minute timeout). Repeated login attempts will all fail. The user's only option is to force restart/shutdown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can't reliability reproduce this behavior. It seems to happen at least once a month.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt has occurred twice recently which should be captured in the sysdiagnose file attached. The first occurrence was on January 17th at ~ 8:08 PM. The second occurrence was on January 18th at ~ 9:07 PM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n  Model Name:\tMacBook Pro\r\n  Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro5,2\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core 2 Duo\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.93 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t2\r\n  L2 Cache:\t6 MB\r\n  Memory:\t8 GB\r\n  Bus Speed:\t1.07 GHz\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tMBP52.008E.B05\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.42f4\r\n  Sudden Motion Sensor:\r\n  State:\tEnabled\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2016.01.18_21-25-57-0500_98.tar.gz' was successfully uploaded."
