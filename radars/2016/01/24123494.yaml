    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I select a folder in the Mailboxes list, I cannot see the reveal triangle very well. Its grey color is too close to the selected grey color.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a Mail.app folder with subfolders\r\n2. Try to spot the reveal triangle.\r\n3. Be sure to try on a low-res screen like a MacBook Air.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe highlight color should not mask out the reveal triangle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI often cannot see the reveal triangle unless I move my head around. The greys are way too close in color.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-01-10 at 11.53.59 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
