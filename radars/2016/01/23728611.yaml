    description: "Summary:\r\nA UICollectionView with a UICollectionViewFlowLayout should allow autolayout to allow for self-sizing cells. This works for static layouts, but when items are inserted or removed the cells resize to the estimated size before expanding again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee sample project attached.\r\n\r\nCreate a UICollectionView whose cells use autolayout to describe their size. Enable self-sizing cells by setting an estimatedItemSize on the UICollectionViewFlowLayout, e.g. layout.estimatedItemSize = CGSizeMake(10.0, 10.0);\r\n\r\nInsert items into the UICollectionView, e.g.\r\n\r\n[self.collectionView performBatchUpdates:^{\r\n    [self.collectionView insertItemsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]];\r\n} completion:nil];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen inserting/removing items, the cells maintain their size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCells reset to their estimated size before expanding to their actual size.\r\n\r\nNote: if the estimatedItemSize is larger than the actual size, the app will crash. That's for another radar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBroken since iOS 8.0"
