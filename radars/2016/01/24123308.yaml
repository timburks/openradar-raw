        1) Open a shared iTunes library using the "Home Sharing" popup in the upper left of the window
        2) My view is set to "TV Shows" and the popup on the right is set to "TV Shows", Sort by: Title, [X] Show recently added [Last 6 Months]
        3) Play a TV show. In my case, it is an episode from Season 8 of Grey's Anatomy (I have all 12 seasons, so my list has 2 columns and is quite long) My player window is set to float above all other windows
        4) Watch the entire episode (or scrub to close to the end), so the episode registers as played, not unplayed.

        Expected:
        5) When the window closes, I should see Season 8 and the episode should still be selected.

        Actual behaviour:
        5) I'm scrolled to the bottom of the list (Season 12) and have to scroll 4 seasons' worth whenever I finish an episode to watch the next one.
