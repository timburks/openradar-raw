    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are using the builtin-mechanism of collectionviews to make cells reorderable by the user. While it is quite easy to use, it is also broken as soon as the collectionview gets scrolled while the user drags the cell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Execute the program at https://github.com/nshintio/uicollectionview-reordering on an iPhone-simulator\r\n2. Drag a cell, move it to the bottom of the simulator so that the automatic scrolling of collectionview starts, but without triggering any reordering\r\n3. When the original place of the dragged cell is no longer visible, drop the cell\r\n4. The cell will stay where it is, no matter if the collectionview gets reloaded or scrolled\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached video for an example of this behaviour\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe position of the cell should be changed to the position where it will be moved at (even though it will be offscreen).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell just stays where it is and will never be deleted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UICollectionViewReorderingBug.mov' was successfully uploaded."
