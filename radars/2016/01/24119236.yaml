        Summary:
        Objective-C in Xcode has support for both autocomplete with selectors and for checking whether or not a selector exists, warning if it doesnâ€™t. This same support would be very welcome in Swift.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        Behavior similar to how Xcode treats selectors in Objective-C source code.

        Actual Results:
        No warning if a selector does not exist or any form of autocomplete.
