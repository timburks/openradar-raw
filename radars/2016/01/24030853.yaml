    description: "Summary:\r\nDescendants of a position:fixed element are sometimes rendered incorrectly (with a rectangular chunk clipped out of them and replaced with whiteness) in Safari on an iPad Pro when the device is in Landscape orientation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get an iPad Pro (or open the Xcode Simulator for iPad Pro).\r\n2. Rotate the device (or use the \"Rotate Right\" in the Simulator) so that it is in a landscape orientation.\r\n3. Open https://output.jsbin.com/sicula/1 in Safari\r\n4. If using the simulator, ensure that the virtual device has actually remained in a landscape orientation.\r\n     (Opening Safari appears to reset the orientation to Portrait in some circumstances.)\r\n5. Tap the green \"Setup\" link on the webpage.\r\n6. Observe that a menu is displayed below the link.\r\n7. Tap the cyan \"Tools\" link on the webpage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA menu should be properly displayed below the \"Tools\" link, like it was for the \"Setup\" link.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu displayed below the \"Tools\" link is missing a rectangular chunk on its left side.\r\nSee attached screenshot and GIF video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152637\r\nOriginal Bootstrap bug report: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18738\r\n\r\nThis bug only occurs on iPad Pro and not on other iPad models.\r\nThis bug only occurs when the iPad Pro is in Landscape orientation, not when in Portrait orientation.\r\nThis bug only occurs when the navbar is styled as `position: fixed`.\r\nThis bug is visually very similar to (and thus presumably related to) https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138162 , although that bug involves zooming and applies to a wider range of iOS hardware models.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro, in landscape orientation\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ipadprorepro.gif' and 'screenshot.png' were successfully uploaded."
