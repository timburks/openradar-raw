    description: "Summary:\r\nURLHostAllowedCharacterSet should only include these characters: \"0-9a-zA-Z-.:[]\" Specifically, it should not include the & character.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(lldb) po [[NSCharacterSet URLHostAllowedCharacterSet] characterIsMember:[@\"&\" characterAtIndex:0]]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNO\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYES\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm having a hard time finding an appropriate character set in order to URL-encode a complete URL. (I want to send a complete URL as a query parameter). In absence of a character set that includes just the \"Unreserved Characters\" according to RFC3986 (2.3), I thought URLHostAllowedCharacterSet would be the most suitable."
