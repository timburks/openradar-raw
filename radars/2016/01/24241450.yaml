    description: "If an app starts music with the systemMusicPlayer, that music will stop playing when the app is backgrounded. Previously, the music would continue playing until the user paused it with the Music app or Control Center.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to widgets. If you have a widget start music using the systemMusicPlayer, it will start playing, but then pause when the notification center is closed. Again, this is new, incorrect behavior as previously the music continued until the user paused it manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the attached project on a device with some music.\r\n2. Open the app and tap the \"Play Music\" button. Music will start playing.\r\n3. Hit the home button to background the app. The music will pause when it should continue playing as it did prior to iOS 9.3 beta 1.\r\n4. Open the Notification Center. Add the PlayMusicTestWidget from the attached project to the list of NC widgets. Tap Done.\r\n5. Tap the Play Music button in the PlayMusicTestWidget. Music will being playing.\r\n6. Close the Notification Center. Note that the music pauses when it used to continue playing prior to iOS 9.3 beta 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the music to continue playing even when the app that started the music is backgrounded as this was the behavior for iOS prior to iOS 9.3 beta 1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe music is paused when the app that started playing the music is backgrounded or when the Notification Center is closed and a widget started playing the music.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 beta 1"
