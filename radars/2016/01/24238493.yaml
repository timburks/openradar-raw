    description: "Summary:\r\nWatchOS 2.2 (13V5098e) activity achievements are not updating even when goals are met.\r\n\r\nAfter updating to WatchOS 2.2  (13V5098e), \"Longest Move Streak\" no longer updates. None of the \"Perfect Week\" achievements update.\r\n\r\nThere are no updates during the day. No notifications when you've made your Move, Exercise, or Stand goals.\r\n\r\nThe data is there. The notifications stopped, and the achievements are stuck to the date from before the WatchOS update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Meet all goals every day, for a week\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Longest Move Streak notification and achievement update when move goal is reached each day\r\n2. Individual notifications for each day: Move, Exercise, and Stand goals met.\r\n3. End-of week achievements reported correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThese all fail. Most disappointing. Especially having the Longest Move Streak fail on the day of the update despite the data showing it's still continuing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatchOS 2.2 (13V5098e) with iOS 9.3 (13E5181f) \r\nYes, these are betas\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHoping this resolves with a future WatchOS or iPhone update, or the watch is going into a drawer. Move streak was the only thing keeping me wearing the watch 12 hours a day for the past 200 days :("
