        Summary:
        Storyboard scenes have gotten bigger in the last few years. With iOS 8 and size classes, they grew to be a default of 600x600. That was acceptable, but now that tvOS scenes are rendered using 1920x1080 scenes, it means we definitely don’t have enough visual space to manage these scenes very well. It’s like staring at a wall of art, but your face can only be 4 inches from the surface.

        One way to see your scenes is to zoom out by right-clicking the IB canvas and choosing a zoom level. However, when zoomed out, you can hardly perform useful functions before having to zoom back in.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a tvOS single view app
        2. Open Main.storyboard
        3. Zoom to 25%
        4. Try to drag a button onto the scene

        Expected Results:
        You should be able to add the button to the scene, while zoomed out.

        Actual Results:
        You cannot add a button onto the scene, and you cannot select or manipulate existing UI elements using your mouse.

        Notes:
        Now, I’m sure you folks see the problem with 1:1 zoom Apple TV scenes. Perhaps another workaround is to let your canvas be at 100%, but make the scenes themselves be scaled down. That’d probably be weird. The bottom line is that whenever I open an Apple TV storyboard, I sigh, and my heart feels heavy and I am dejected. Halp.
