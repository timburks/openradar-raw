    description: "Summary:\r\nMy time machine is making a full backup for no good reason at all every single time. It links 0 items and backup logs always show that  supposedly every file needs backup. But tmutil compare shows the correct amount of changes. It is making a deep traversal every single time. I attached a sample syslog extract during such a backup as a reference.\r\n\r\nWhat I want is to try to lay out what I tried and hopefully have some engineer notice it, say it’s an edge case or fix it (you can call me if that helps - #number - I am fluent in English) so no other person hits that, as this situation is rather frustrating. I included everything I tried so far in the Notes section.\r\n\r\nIf it should turn out that you see that it is related to me using openzfsonosx, please, please tell me what’s causing it so I can file a github bug and work with ilovezfs and lundman to get it fixed!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt all started with me deleting the unnamed 263 Byte file on „/„, which turned out to be a mobile time machine created UUID thing. I have no idea why I see it in Finder (I don’t show invisible stuff) and I can delete it but it gets recreated when I switch on time machine or rather specifically the mobile time machine component. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime machine should, as tmutil compare shows, correctly link previous stuff and transfer incremental stuff and not fully backup every single time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTime machine makes a full backup every single time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI noticed the unnamed file on previous versions but never ran into the problem of having always full backups. This is new in 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere is a rundown of what i tried so far (as also publicly documented in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7399904:\r\n\r\nWhat I tried so far:\r\n \r\n- every single trick from pondini.org's http://pondini.org/TM/D7.html (every backup is a full backup...). The thing is, it doesn't depend on what I exclude, I can include everything so only 300MB of /usr/local etc are backed up and still it's a full backup every single time\r\n- I tried doing inherit backups, associate disks etc (I didn't change my system at all)\r\n- I tried running it to a fresh external hard drive\r\n- I tried running it to a network time machine destination\r\n- I tried booting into safe mode\r\n- I tried deleting .fsevents and .dbfsevents on the Fusion volume in question\r\n- I tried installing OS X over it (an install on top of the existing one)\r\n- I tried running a backup from a clone\r\n- I tried disabling/enabling local time machine snapshots\r\n- I tried checking my startup volume with disk utility and even rebuilt the B-Tree with fsck-hfs -Race\r\n- Look into a SMART Monitoring tool, but both of the disks (source is a Fusion drive) work as expected\r\n- I looked into the created backups with TimeTracker to confirm these were really full backups, and yes, they were\r\n- I tried running the backup to an unencrypted destination disk\r\n- Deleting a specific folder in /var/folders as described in https://discussions.apple.com/message/29551937#29551937\r\n\r\nIf you have any idea what is going on - especially why tmutil compare shows a correct amount of changes and then running a backup doesn’t seem to get the info, please help me."
