    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nIt would help significantly to be able to point Safari to a particular device and say \"attach to any WebView instance as soon as it becomes available.\" Without this feature, it's nearly impossible to debug the initial 2â€“3 seconds of a webpage loading in a remote WebView, since you need to instantiate the WebView and then quickly select the target from the Safari menu bar.\r\n\r\nIt would also be quite helpful to have an option to 'attach and pause' so that the very first moments of the remote WebView is inspectable. This would help to debug responses from URL shorteners and other short-lived HTTP connections in a normal mobile web browsing experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 (10601.3.9)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5"
