    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I run my Mac app’s unit tests in Xcode, the GCDA and GCNO files for all of the system frameworks I link against (e.g. Foundation, CoreData) get placed in my project’s root directory. When I run my tests, an exception is thrown after the tests run, and the following message is spit out too many times to count: “profiling: <source dir>/CoreData.gcda: cannot merge previous GCDA file: corrupt arc tag (0x00000000)”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and test my project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests run and produce coverage results\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGCDA and GCNO files end up in the project directory, and the tests fail to report success or failure\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis never happened for the same project under Xcode 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
