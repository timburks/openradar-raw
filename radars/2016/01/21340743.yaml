    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter using OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, I've noticed that keeping the system transparency enabled is leading to multiple graphical glitches in various windows across the entire operating system (like those in the Finder list and Cover Flow views, the quick view scroll bar, the Help button blue overlay in the menu bar, the Applications folder in grid view when closed, the initial selection in the Notifications System Preference panel and others) as well as slower/choppier window renderings.  Window animations, like those seen on the System Preferences panel are more choppy with the transparency enabled, but are more fluid with the transparency disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince El Capitan is focusing on a better user experience and performance, I'm hoping for a fluid and crisp User Interface like that of Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhenever I use OS X Yosemite or El Capitan, especially with the transparency enabled, I'm finding myself thinking, what visual glitches I'm going to see next.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11 (15A178w) MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThese glitches don't occur when, Reduce transparency in Accessibility is enabled or you press the shift key to render windows in slow-motion.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
