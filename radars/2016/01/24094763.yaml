    description: "We are an online video platform supplying premium (Hollywood) content encoding and DRM services. Some of our customers are in places where cellular networks are expensive or unreliable, and need to be able to let a user download all chunks of a chosen variant, acquire a license, and then play back at a later date, possibly in places where networks are unavailable.  Example might be a wifi kiosk where the user can purchase and download for later consumption. We're currently using Playready DRM for this usecase, since licenses can be persisted locally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload variants for the content, acquire license attempt to playback while offline.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLicense can  be acquired and used for offline playback\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nofflline playback not allowed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.x, iOS 9.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis functionality is provided by PlayReady and Widevine DRM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nall hardware platforms\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
