        Summary:
        SecKeyRawSign currently only supports PKCS1 padding, while there are more modern padding schemes such as OAEP.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Try to use OAEP padding with SecKeyRawSign

        Expected Results:
        - Itâ€™s there. No 3rd party library needed.

        Actual Results:
        - Not available. Needs to include a 3rd party library :-(

        Regression:
