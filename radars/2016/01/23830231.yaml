    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the Reduce Transparency option is enabled, the transparency or drop shadow around the Now Playing down arrow in the Music app becomes a semi-opaque box.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the Music app; select a song and then go to the Now Playing screen.\r\n1. Open Settings\r\n2. Tap General\r\n3. Tap Accessibility\r\n4. Tap Increase Contrast\r\n5. Tap Reduce Transparency\r\n6. Return to the Music app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith the Reduced Transparency enabled I would expect there to be no transparency effect on the arrow, nor a drop shadow or mask layer visible underneath the Down Arrow; just an opaque, round Down Arrow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWith the Reduced Transparency enabled, the Down Arrow's Transparency effect/the Down Arrow's drop shadow, inside the Now Playing window, becomes a semi-opaque box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug doesn't show up after a device restart, but the arrow will revert to behaving incorrectly if the Reduce Transparency setting is changed; i.e turning it on if it's off, or turning it off and then back on again.\r\n\r\nI have attached two screenshots; the first shows incorrect behavior and the second shows correct behavior.\r\n\r\nThis bug didn't occur on iOS 9.1 as far as I remember.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n2"
