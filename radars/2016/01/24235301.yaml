    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS Safari, tapping into an <input> which is within a position:fixed element has the side-effect of causing the page to scroll to the top, regardless of the current scroll position. This is annoying e.g. when using position:fixed modal dialogs for forms, since this scrolling causes the user to lose their scroll position in the underlying page after the modal dialog has been closed (unless additional hacky iOS-specific JS was also added to manually restore the old scroll position that this bug trashed).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open http://output.jsbin.com/qicigu/1 in iOS Safari.\r\n2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.\r\n3. Tap the \"Open modal\" button.\r\n4. A yellow overlay appears.\r\n5. Tap on the <input> that has the text \"Click here\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input should become focused and the on-screen keyboard should appear.\r\nThe scroll position of the page should not change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page scrolls to the top, the input becomes focused, and the on-screen keyboard appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo such scrolling occurs in Android Chrome or OS X Safari.\r\nWebKit bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153224\r\nOriginal Bootstrap bug report: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17497\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
