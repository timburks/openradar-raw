    description: "I have a project that targets iOS 8.0, but has been using respondsToSelector: to use newer methods on iOS 8.2 classes (specifically `[UIFont systemFontOfSize:… weight:…]`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately under Xcode 7.3b1 this doesn't prevent the warning \"'systemFontOfSize:weight:\" is partial: introduced in iOS 8.2\" from showing.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project demonstrating the issue — of note are the customised WARNING_CFLAGS for the project.\r\n\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/153352/Radars/24141126/Availability%20Demo.zip"
