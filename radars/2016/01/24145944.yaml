        Summary:
        When Xcode Server generates the App Thinned build products as part of an integration, it should also provide the manifest plist that maps the device type to a specific ipa, so if the products are uploaded to an enterprise distribution service this file can be attached.

        Currently generating this manifest file from CI requires running xcodebuild again manually to generate (doubling up on compile time).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Set up a bot to build an app that supports App Thinning. Navigate to “${XCS_OUTPUT_DIR}/ExportedProduct/Apps/“, notice there are a number of ipa’s, but no manifest.

        Open Xcode, archive a build and export it for enterprise distribution. Notice that alongside the app thinned products there is a “manifest.plist” that maps the IPA’s to devices.

        Expected Results:
        There should either be an option to generate this file within Xcode Server, or it should be generated automatically.

        Actual Results:
        No file is generated.
