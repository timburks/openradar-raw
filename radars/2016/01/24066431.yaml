    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use the Safari Web Inspector to truly and completely test my mobile websites. Responsive Design Mode helps to debug layout issues, but I'm not able to manipulate the responses from various sensor APIs, nor am I able to emulate touch events.\r\n\r\nI know that I could use an iOS emulator for this, but as a web developer, I'm not very familiar with how to acquire, use, or attach to these emulators. Also, Chrome provides all of these features in its Web Inspector, making it a suitable one-stop shop for mobile web development and debugging.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 (10601.3.9)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5"
