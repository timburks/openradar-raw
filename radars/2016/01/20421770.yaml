    description: "Summary:\r\nCorrelation between Process Faults and overall system performance and stability.  While comparing the overall performance and stability between OS X Snow Leopard, OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks and OS X Yosemite, I noticed a correlation between the number of Process faults present inside the Activity Monitor.app and how smoothly and efficiently each Operating System was running.  In Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion, there were no faults listed in the Activity Monitor.app and the system ran very well.  In Mavericks and Yosemite, there are a very high number of faults for each process, and each system runs with difficulty.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Activity Monitor\r\n2. Inspect any running process in either OS X Mavericks or OS X Yosemite; the fault counter is not 0.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn OS X Snow Leopard and OS X Mountain Lion, there were 0 faults inside each process inspection window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn OS X Mavericks and OS X Yosemite, each time an action is performed regarding each process, e.g. Dock, launchd, Finder, etc. there is an increase in the faults count on the process inspection window.  In addition, a process's fault counter will increase until the CPU % drops to 0.00.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (10K549); OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 (12F2501) compared to OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 (13F1066); OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D130a).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn all Operating Systems, there is always available RAM that the system can use to page data from the hard drive.  I would expect to see page faults if the Operating System was thrashing due to insufficient RAM or disk space, but instead I see page faults when there is RAM and disk space available to the Operating System.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThere were no fault counts on OS X Snow Leopard and OS X Mountain Lion; there are increasing fault counts on every process on OS X Mavericks and OS X Yosemite.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
