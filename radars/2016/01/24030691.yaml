    description: Currently, Photos.app extensions present either the initial RAW file (if the extension is the first called) or the rendered JPEG containing the previous edits. So that photographers can work with 12-14 bit data from their cameras, Photos should provide the option to operate on TIFF files rather than 8-bit JPEG within the extensions framework.
