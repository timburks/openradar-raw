    description: "Summary:\r\nDisk Utility was a perfectly usable and functional piece of software for the few of us who needed it to deal with Hard Disk problems, Disk Images and the like. Then someone decided it needs to be fixed. Now, it looks like the iPhone Window in iTunes, misses most of the essential features and is basically broken beyond belief. \r\n\r\n* Essential Info (Disk First Aid) is only displayed in a mini-sheet that slides down and is hardly useful\r\n* The window isn't resizable\r\n* You can't configure a RAID anymore\r\n* and much more\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Disk Utility on El Capitan\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet a usable piece of software like it used to be pre El Capitan\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA Window which looks like the iPhone-Window in iTunes for no apparent reason, offering no benefit over the version pre El Capitan. In fact, it's the opposite.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac Book Air Mid 2012, 8GB/500GB SSD"
