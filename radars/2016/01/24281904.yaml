    description: "Summary:\r\nA sample Xcode project is provided to reproduce the issue. As mentioned in title, WKWebView seems unable to access local video files after granting read access. Weirder – it does work if ​*any*​ video has first been played in UIWebView\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Run the attached project on an iPad in landscape. \r\n2) The top half is a WKWebView and bottom half is UIWebview.  If you scroll the top web view you will see a few videos.  Trying playing them and they will fail and have a strike through even though read access has been given in code. \r\n3) kill the app and run it again,\r\n4) now tap one of the upper videos to get the failed play, then tap one of the videos on the bottom UIWebview which will play.  \r\n5) after playing a video in the UIWebView then go back up to the WKWebview and tap the second video which will now play.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKWebView should be able to access local video files and not have to use UIWebView as a workaround\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn instance of WKWebView was unable to access a local video file"
