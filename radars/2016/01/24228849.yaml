    description: "Summary:\r\nopening a xib file in the xcode/interfacebuilder editor will produce warnings that are **not** produced during a regular build of the application.\r\n\r\nthis is marked as \"data loss\" because as a user i don't see the warnings i asked xcode to produce. we use continuous integration to find and fix all warnings, but now i cannot fully trust this workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create an application that uses a xib file\r\n2. create a situation that emit a warning: different frames for autolayout constraints, ambiguous layouts, etc..\r\n3. note the issues in the xcode ui.\r\n4. close the xib file from the file menu\r\n5. clean the project with cmd-K\r\n6. build the project with cmd-B or run it with cmd-R\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIB warnings are shown as issues, and the build acts accordingly to \"treat warning as errors\" and/or \"continue building if failures\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe IB warnings are lost, and we ended up shipping a sub-par application to our customers, because xcode lied to us\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nosx: 10.10.5 (14F27)\r\nxcode: Version 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
