    description: "Summary:\r\nIt should be possible to implement features like custom HTTP request headers, content filtering, customized certificates for authentication and temporary custom proxy settings when using WKWebView. Some of these features would require using a custom NSURLProtocol with  WKWebView. Some of these features would also be possible if WKWebView would support delegate methods as WebResourceLoadDelegate does with the classic WebView on OS X, for example:\r\n\r\n- (NSURLRequest *)webView:(WebView *)sender resource:(id)identifier willSendRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request redirectResponse:(NSURLResponse *)redirectResponse fromDataSource:(WebDataSource *)dataSource\r\n\r\n(to filter content and to add a custom header to a http request)\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically the same things as with UIWebView should be possible with WKWebView. This would allow all developers of web browsers and embedded browser features using WKWebView to move from UIWebView to WKWebView, but for that the same UIWebView possibilities should be provided in WKWebView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse WKWebView.\r\nTry to modify a header in a HTTP request.\r\nTry to filter HTTP requests using the URL of the request.\r\nTry to authenticate a secure (https) server using a self-signed server certificate by embedding this certificate into an iOS app.\r\nTry to implement a support for custom proxy settings inside an app, which are different than the global iOS proxy settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA custom NSURLProtocol can be registered so that all loading of data from the internet by a WKWebView is routed through (controlled by) that NSURLProtocol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWKWebView doesn't allow to use a custom NSURLProtocol.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS version.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices"
