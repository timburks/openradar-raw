    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen attempting to call PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController's canMakePaymentsUsingNetworks method on an iPad running iOS 9, the call hangs forever.\r\n\r\nThis appears to only affect iPads (iPhones behave correctly).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project. Key lines are:\r\n\r\nlet networks = [PKPaymentNetworkVisa, PKPaymentNetworkMasterCard]\r\nlet capabilities: PKMerchantCapability = [.Capability3DS, .CapabilityDebit]        PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController.canMakePaymentsUsingNetworks(networks, capabilities: capabilities)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConsole should print:\r\n\r\n> Prints when app launches\r\n> Never prints because app has hung\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConsole prints:\r\n\r\n> Prints when app launches\r\n\r\nPausing the app in the debugger shows it stuck at PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController.canMakePaymentsUsingNetworks. It hangs here forever.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niPad did not have any payment methods configured.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 5th Gen (other iPads also behave in the same manner)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Apple Pay Hangs.zip' was successfully uploaded."
