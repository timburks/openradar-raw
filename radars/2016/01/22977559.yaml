    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Closing any Folder that is kept in the Dock:  Applications, Documents, Downloads, etc.; using Fan or Grid view, the transparency is temporarily lost.  This can more easily be seen by closing the Folder in slow-motion with the shift key.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Add the Applications folder to the Dock from Hard Drive folder; change Display as to Folder and View content as Grid.  (This is to mimic my current set up.)\r\n1. Open the Applications folder.\r\n2. Close the Applications folder and the transparency temporarily goes away.  (This can be more easily seen by having no other folders or windows open, and holding the shift key then closing the Applications folder.)\r\n3. This same behavior can be seen with the Fan view as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe transparency should behave the same way throughout the entire closing animation.  OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 contains the expected results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folder transparency is temporarily lost when closing folders on the Dock.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis bug occurs on every version of El Capitan I've tested, beginning with the first Beta.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
