    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen entering Time Machine from any other folder other than the default (home) folder, the folder changes abruptly to the home folder, without any smooth animation.\r\n\r\nSee video to understand better.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to any other folder on your computer, other than the main (~) home folder.\r\n2. Enter Time Machine.\r\n3. See what happens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current folder I am in and entering TM from to persist and stay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folder abruptly changes to the (~) folder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.0 (build 15A284)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happened with Mavericks (10.9.0 - 10.9.5) in 2013 - I reported this; you can see an active report under my username. This was not fixed in Mavericks - BUT Yosemite (10.10.0 - 10.10.5) fixed this, and it worked perfectly. Now, the problem is back.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n13\" i7 2.8gHz, 10GB of RAM, 750gb Momentus XT 7200RPM HD (customized)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'timemachinebug.mov' was successfully uploaded."
