    description: "Summary:\r\nUnchecking the Enable HiDPI display modes inside Quartz Debug doesn't disable HiDPI display modes after logging out on Retina Display Macs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Quartz Debug.\r\n2. If it's not already open, go to Window in the Menu Bar and select UI Resolution.\r\n3. Click the Enable HiDPI display modes checkbox.\r\n4. A prompt comes up, saying the Display modes have been changed and that I should Logout to make the changes take effect.\r\n5. Click Logout.\r\n6. Log back in and return to UI Resolution.\r\n7. The checkbox has become checked automatically and there are no additional display modes available.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI was expecting to disable the Retina Display modes so that I could run my Retina MacBook Pro in Low Resolution mode.  I figured that disabling HiDPI would display the system in either 2560 X 1600, making the text really small, or it would display at 1280 X 800 equivalency but make the screen look very pixelated; therefore the Mac would be running in system-wide low resolution mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRight now, unchecking the Enable HiDPI display modes doesn't do anything on Retina Display Macs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 & OS X El Capitan 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
