    description: "Once in a while(maybe once per week) SafariViewController stops working. I mean systematically, not just in my app, or any one specific app. It stops working in all app using it. And it's only just me, quite some users of my apps reported the same issue to me.\r\n\r\nThe symptom:\r\n1. It just shows a blank page and seems doing nothing at all to load the content when presented.\r\n2. After tapping the refresh icon it nudges its progress bar a little then stops doing any work.\r\n3. Safari button works properly. Safari loads the web page properly.\r\n4. Share button works properly. The URL can be shared, even with a proper thumbnail image of the web page content.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n1. The only solution I found is to restart system.\r\n\r\nMy debugging efforts:\r\n1. I thought maybe I could see some relevant logs when using SafariViewController in this odd state. So I build a sample app while my iPhone is still in this state. Unfortunately I didn't see any logs in Xcode.\r\n2. I also tried reading device logs but neither found anything interesting.\r\n\r\nThis issue exists since the very beginning when SafariViewController was introduced in iOS 9.0, till at least iOS 9.2.1. Since I haven't been using iOS 9.3 beta on my everyday devices I cannot say about iOS 9.3.\r\n\r\nAttachment is a bundle of screenshots depicting the symptoms: http://cl.ly/1D1H3F2B2w45"
