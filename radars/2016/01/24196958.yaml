    description: "Summary:\r\nToday on iOS 9.2 and below, the position of placeholder text in a UISearchBar is not configurable. One can configure where the actual search text is placed with the `searchTextPositionAdjustment` property but this property does not affect the placeholder text.  App developers should be able to configure placeholder text offset either with the existing `searchTextPositionAdjustment` property or with it's own property, perhaps named `placeholderPositionAdjustment`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a UISearchBar with some non-empty placeholder text\r\n2. set the searchTextPositionAdjustment to some nonzero offset (or set the as of yet nonexistent placeholderPositionAdjustment property to a nonzero offset).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlaceholder text is offset by the defined offset.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlaceholder text is not offset, but the searchText is.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs on iOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
