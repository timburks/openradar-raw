    description: "[Want to discuss? Get in touch with me @jamesreggio.]\r\n\r\nI often need to test my mobile website on both iOS and Android form-factors, but there are no Android phones listed in the Responsive Design Mode presets. A couple of these would help immensely, especially since the Chrome Web Inspector has presets for both iOS and Android devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be great if I could load more presets from a JSON file. I imagine that some folks would probably compile a large number of presets, which I could happily load to resolve this need quickly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 (10601.3.9)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSafari 9.0.2 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5"
