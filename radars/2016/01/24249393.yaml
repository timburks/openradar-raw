        Summary:
        After accidentally clicking ‘tvOS’ under my app’s (+) Version or Platform button, I now have a ‘tvOS App 1.0’ entry in the “Prepare for Submission” state. But I cannot figure out how to delete this entry. I may make a tvOS app in the future, but it is not now.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In iTunes Connect, click on an existing iOS App
        2. Click the “(+) Version or Platform” button in the left sidebar
        3. Click ‘tvOS’
        4. Try to delete the ‘tvOS’ entry

        Expected Results:
        I should see a [Delete Platform] button or something under the tvOS app.

        Actual Results:
        I cannot figure out how to delete this tvOS app entry.

        Note:
        Yes, this is in some ways “harmless”, except that I hadn’t yet decided whether to make a tvOS app as part of the Universal Purchase program, or whether it would be its own separate app (and a different price). If I were to make a separate tvOS app, this husk of a version would just continue to exist, in perpetuity, like an alternate future that never came to pass.
