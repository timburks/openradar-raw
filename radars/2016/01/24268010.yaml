    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I attach an email inside another email (dragging&dropping or right-click and then \"forward as attachment\") the attachment is not in .eml format.\r\nTo be sure that it can be properly viewed by Mail and Windows Outlook I have to save the attachment, add .eml extension and add it as attachment deleting the previous one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an email from a mailbox\r\n2. Drag and drop into a draft email\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe email is attached with an envelop icon; if I save the attachment, it's .eml.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email is attached but the icon is a blank icon (white file); if I save the attachment, it has no extension.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail: Versione 9.2 (3112)\r\nOS X : Version 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn 10.8 I didn't have this problem."
