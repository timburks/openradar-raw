        Summary:
        I love using Apple Pay and the other features of wallet, and look forward to a future in which I don’t need to carry my physical wallet around with me at all.

        One thing I still need my wallet for though, even while using Apple Pay in-store, is to store receipts, which I do for each purchase I make over any payment method. It would be great if there were a way for Apple Pay transactions to automatically send some form of receipt with each transaction, whether that’s a PDF dropped into a folder on iCloud Drive, or an email sent to an address I configure in my Apple Pay settings
