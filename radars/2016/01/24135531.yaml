    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a text field in a form sheet becomes or resigns first responder in `viewWillAppear:`, the initial view layout is caught in the animation block that moves the form sheet up or down. \r\n\r\nA sample project is attached that demonstrates the problem when becoming first responder (keyboard appearing). The case of resigning first responder is possibly worse because this is handled automatically by UIKit when a view disappears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project full screen on iPad (regular or Pro, simulator or device) on iOS 9.\r\n\r\nPage one (a cyan view) is presented in a form sheet.\r\n\r\nTap the cyan view to push page two, which has a text field that becomes first responder in `viewWillAppear:`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe initial view layout should not be animated. Page two should be laid out as soon as it appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe elements on page two animate when they appear, popping from the top of the view. A dark grey view is provided to make this easier to see.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression: does not happen on iOS 8.3, so appears to have been introduced in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nDoes not happen in compact widths where the form sheet is full screen.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Become first responder in a `dispatch_async` block. Yuck. Maybe something similar can be done for resigning first responder when disappear but I have not tried yet.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LayoutAnimation.zip' was successfully uploaded."
