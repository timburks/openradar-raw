    description: "Summary:\r\nNight Shift is great, but there are some apps that require more precise color rendering. For those apps, it would be great to allow the user to opt out of Night Shift while the app is open.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Settings and find Night Shift.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can add an app to a list of apps for which Night Shift is disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNight Shift applies to all apps equally.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3 [13E5181f]"
