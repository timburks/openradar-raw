    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you’re using AirPlay on Safari, “mute this tab” shows up and does nothing when clicked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page with a video that supports AirPlay.\r\n2. Start playing the video on an Apple TV.\r\n3. Notice that the “mute this tab” button appears in the address bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the tab is not playing audio on my Mac, the button should not appear. But if it does appear, and I click it, the audio should stop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button appears, and when tapped, the audio continues to play."
