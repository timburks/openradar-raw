    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Disable 2D Acceleration checkbox doesn't consistently check and when it doesn't it causes the entire OS UI to freeze until the box is clicked again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Quartz Debug.\r\n2. Click Window in the Menu Bar and select Quartz Debug Settings.\r\n3. Click the Disable 2D Acceleration checkbox.\r\n4. Approximately 1 out of 5 tries results in the intended behavior, where the box is checked and the 2D Acceleration is disabled.  Approximately 4 out of 5 tries doesn't check the box; instead it becomes outlined and the entire OS UI freezes until one clicks the checkbox again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking the Disable 2D Acceleration checkbox would disable the 2D Acceleration rather than freezing the entire UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking the Disable 2D Acceleration checkbox causes the entire UI to freeze until one clicks the checkbox again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 & OS X El Capitan 10.11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNONE\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm using a 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nNONE"
