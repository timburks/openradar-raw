    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you drag an NSTableView around in IB, you get a white placeholder, that's cool.\r\n\r\nIf you have \"Headers\" turned off, the placeholder cells draw upside down at the bottom of the frame like a (1, -1) scale transform has been set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drop an NSTableView into a window\r\n2. Open the attributes inspector and turn off \"headers\"\r\n3. Drag the tableview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Tableview drags without weirdness\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. The world is turned upside down. Dogs and cats living together.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore it and don't think about software quality, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'flippa-da-bits.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
