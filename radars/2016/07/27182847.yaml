    description: "I've tested the same project with Xcode 8 beta 2 and I can't reproduce the crash. Great job. \U0001F44D\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI am using your method called photoLibraryDidChange in my iOS 9 app. This makes it crash all the time when Photos Library is updated. Because your sample is iOS 10 only, I had to refactor it. Code attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Delete one photo in Simulator\r\n2. Open sample app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew photo appear\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n I have crash message: \"attempt to delete and reload the same index path\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nExample app using Photos framework\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/UsingPhotosFramework/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am attaching my app project so you can run it yourself. My app displays screenshots from Screenshots album in a collection view. Press command + S to make a screenshot and drag it into Simulator. It should appear in the Altershot.\r\n\r\nI am attaching my refactored iOS 9 sample code. Related pre iOS 10 question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29337765/crash-attempt-to-delete-and-reload-the-same-index-path#29370012\r\n\r\nI will keep you updated. I will try to run your code as it is in iOS 10. Maybe this is bug in UIKit which you fixed in iOS 10.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 \r\niOS 9 iPhone 5s Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Altershot.zip' and 'update.swift' were successfully uploaded."
