    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile in the Siri/Wishlist/Previews view of the iTunes app — when it’s accessed from the Movies or TV Shows section of the Store — the title bar takes on the dark appearance of the section, which makes the contents of the title bar very difficult to see due to the low contrast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up the iTunes app\r\n2. Tap on Movies or TV Shows in the tab bar\r\n3. Tap the “lists” icon in the title bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe title bar is white, with a regular, blue segmented controller and buttons.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe title bar is dark, with blue segmented controller and buttons, making them extremely difficult to see.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs far as I’m aware, this issue is also present in iOS 10 Beta 2, however, I am unable to verify this.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1P3f0V2e0Z351H2E2C16/IMG_0750.PNG.png"
