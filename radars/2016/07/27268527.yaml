    description: "Summary:\r\nI was browsing the IndexSet docs to see what returned an array (I had need to flattening an IndexSet to an array, and was wondering if there was something less noisy than a flatmap).\r\n\r\nThe \"Symbols\" overview doesn't show any return types.  Those are kind of important to know :-)  So I'm asking that you show return types in the overview.\r\n\r\nThe attached image shows what I was seeing in the overview, and then a drill-down in to a particular method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'return-types.png' was successfully uploaded."
