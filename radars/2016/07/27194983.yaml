        Summary:
        If you select the ‘Use Scalar Type’ check box for a Date attribute in Core Data, the generated code is of type ’NSTimeInterval’ which does not compile. Since it is generated code, it can not be modified.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a scalar Date attribute, attempt to build

        Expected Results:
        The project builds

        Actual Results:
        Build fails with:  'NSTimeInterval' has been renamed to 'TimeInterval'

        Regression:
        This does not occur if ’Use Scalar Type’ is not selected.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
