    description: "Summary:\r\nConforming a class to a protocol prevents Interface Builder connecting an instance of that class to an outlet for a different protocol conformed to by its superclass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Main.storyboard in attached project.\r\n2. Attempt to connect the UILabel to ViewController's backgroundColorable property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to connect the UILabel to ViewController's backgroundColorable property, as UIView (UILabel's superclass) conforms to BackgroundColorable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to connect the UILabel to ViewController's backgroundColorable property. However, performing the following steps will resolve the issue:\r\n\r\n4. Roll back latest commit (or comment out UILabel's conformance to TextColorable, an unrelated protocol).\r\n5. Reattempt steps reproduce, observing that it is now possible.\r\n\r\nUILabel's conformance to TextColorable should not prevent Interface Builder recognising UILabel's inherited conformance to BackgroundColorable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175) and 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\nOSX 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (27-inch, Late 2013)\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ProtocolOutletTest2.zip' was successfully uploaded."
