    description: "I'd like to start an interactive iMessage conversation from the app itself, using MFMessageComposeViewController.\r\nThis would allow me to share content from the app in a way that allows the recipient to open the content in the iMessage extension and from there, potentially switch to the app itself.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an interactive iMessage conversation has to start from an iMessage extension. Why not send an MSMessage object using MFMessageComposeViewController?"
