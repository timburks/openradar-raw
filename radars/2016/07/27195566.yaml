        Summary:
        ‘Code Generation’ ‘Language’ drop down does not appear to change the generated code.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        If I create a swift project, the core data code generation generates swift files.
        If I create an obj-c project, the core data generation generates objective-c files

        If I switch the ‘Code Generation’ ‘Language’ drop down, the generated files don’t change. Swift project still generates swift files with obj-c selected, and obj-c projects generate obj-c files event with swift selected. I’m not sure why the language the project was created with matters, but it appears to.

        Expected Results:
        The generated code should match the drop down regardless of the other configuration settings in the project.

        Actual Results:
        The generated code should match the drop down regardless of the other configuration settings in the project.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
