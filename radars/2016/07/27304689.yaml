    description: "Summary:\nThe accessibilityElementsHidden property on MKMapView appears to have no effect. Setting it to true still results in VoiceOver navigating over the various elements within the map view.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create an instance of MKMapView and attach it to a view hierarchy\n2. Set accessibilityElementsHidden to true on the MKMapView instance\n3. Load some coordinate (somewhere with roads)\n4. While the view is visible, enable VoiceOver and tap within the bounds of the map view\n\nExpected Results:\nVoiceOver cursor should not navigate the map elements, the map view should be skipped entirely. \n\nActual Results:\nThe various elements (roads and landmarks) of the map view are navigable via VoiceOver."
