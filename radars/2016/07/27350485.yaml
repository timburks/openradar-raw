    description: "Summary:\r\nsee attached git-what.mp4.  I have a small project (~20 files) that's in a sub-sub directory of a fairly large git repo (12k files)  I check stuff in to git from the terminal, and Xcode doesn't reflect the status change until I close and re-openthe file. Then it updates quickly.\r\n\r\nTurns out if I wait about 3-4 minutes, Xcode eventually refreshes itself.  This is way slower than my fellow coworkers are seeing, so they said go ahead and radar this one, so here it is.\r\n\r\nLemme know if there's any info I can give about where the slowdown may be happening.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'git-what.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
