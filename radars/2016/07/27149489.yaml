    description: "Summary:\non an iPhone running iOS9 or iOS10, the Apple ID my iPhone is logged into for iCloud is NOT the Apple ID I want to use for setting the privacy of disclosing my location via Find My Friends.\n\nI own two different iOS devices (one work phone and one personal phone). I use the same iCloud Apple IDs for these two different devices. I am able to use a different (work vs personal) Apple ID for sending iMessages. But I am _unable_ to use a different (work versus personal) Apple ID for setting the privacy of disclosing my location.\n\nPre iOS7, I used to be able to set a specific Apple ID that was used for Find My Friends which was different from my iCloud Apple ID that I use for everything else. I need this functionality due to the fact that I am a dedicated Apple ecosystem user and I wish to manage and sync all of my devices with the same iCloud data, however, my persona for my location while travelling/in motion and communicating with others needs to be able to change.\n\nNow, in the current and forthcoming versions of iOS, an error dialog is presented that disallows you from doing this. Because of this, I am unable to set my preferences for privacy for sharing my location on Find My Friends differently from sharing my location from iMessage. \n\nThis is simply described as me having one work iPhone and one home iPhone. I wish to have all my personal information management data (contacts, calendars, reminders, etc) synced from the _same_ iCloud account to both my work iPhone and my home iPhone. In contrast, my work iPhone persona for iMessage & my ability to control the privacy of my work hours location, quite obviously transparently and undeniably, needs to be uniquely _different_ and separate from my home iPhone personaâ€™s iMessage & ability to control the privacy of my outside work-hours location. (ie., my Boss has neither the need or requirement, nor do I wish to grant her the permission to know where I am when she is not paying me). \n\nI should be given the ability to control my location privacy in the fashion in this setup below:  \n\nwork phone (Black iPhone 6s Plus with additional Mophie Juice Pack battery booster pack)\n- iCloud (allmyPIMdata@icloud.com)\n- iMessage (firstinitial.lastname@bigco.com)\n- Find My Friends (firstinitial.lastname@bigco.com)\n\npersonal phone (Blue iPhone 5c with cracked screen sheathed in Lime Green Otterbox)\n- iCloud (allmyPIMdata@icloud.com)\n- iMessage (partyhardy@hotmail.com)\n- Find My Friends (partyhardy@hotmail.com)\n\nIF I were able to\b configure the settings as they are above this would allow me to Control the privacy when sharing my location! However I can NOT!\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. on iOS device go to:\nSettings -> iCloud. Login using account: allmyPIMdata@icloud.com\nSettings -> Messages -> Send & Receive -> Sign out of allmyPIMdata account and sign in as firstinitial.lastname@bigco.com\n2. launch Find Friends.app. Note that the Find My Friends app will use the iCloud account (allmyPIMdata@icloud.com). The user is unable to change this to use the same Apple ID as used for Messages.\n\nExpected Results:\nI should be given the ability to control my location privacy in the fashion in this setup below:\n1. My work phone (Black iPhone 6s Plus with additional Mophie Juice Pack battery booster pack)\n- iCloud (allmyPIMdata@icloud.com)\n- iMessage (firstinitial.lastname@bigco.com)\n- Find My Friends (firstinitial.lastname@bigco.com)\n\n2. My personal phone (Blue iPhone 5c with cracked screen sheathed in Lime Green Otterbox)\n- iCloud (allmyPIMdata@icloud.com)\n- iMessage (partyhardy@hotmail.com)\n- Find My Friends (partyhardy@hotmail.com)\n\nActual Results:\nThe user is unable to set the Find My Friends Apple ID to use the same appleId as iMessage, and distinct from iCloud. A dialog box is presented with a message explaining that it is disallowing this from happening.\n\nRegression:\nThis exact functionality worked consistently in all versions of iOS that included Find My Friends pre-iOS7\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
