    description: "DUPLICATE OF RADAR 24193438\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently, UI testing is limited in its ability to verify the actual visual state of any given application. This severely limits its use for certain types of application testing where visual validation beyond frame positioning is required - i.e., dynamic loading of content into consistently-sized elements.\r\n\r\nThis feature is especially important for SDK or tooling development, and will lead to more robust tools for the community at large. Snapshotting allows comparing visual state of live tests against a recorded \"known correct\" image that provides additional verification and additionally has implications for computer vision or accessibility research (not that this is the responsibility of Apple; these tools would be produced by developers.)\r\n\r\nThus it would be useful to have a -(UIImage*)snapshot method (or similar) on XCUIElement (to capture view state; presumably XCUIApplication would capture the entire view state).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome way to produce a -(UIImage*) or other image/bitmap snapshot of a live test run from an XCUIElement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFeature is not present in Xcode 7.2 (7C68)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
