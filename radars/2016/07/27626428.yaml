    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I go to the iTunes Store and scroll down there is a super helpful \"New From Your Artists\" section. If I click \"Show All\", it takes me to this page: https://se.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStoreElements.woa/wa/newFromArtistsSeeAll?allowExplicit=true (Note that this link only seems to work on Mac, though the section does exist on iOS as well.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this page is showing me every single album by \"Various Artists\". Here's one example: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ncco-national-conference-2016/id1126376611 This \"Various Artists\" album is all songs by \"The Portland State University Man Choir\". I have never bought an album by these men before.\r\n\r\nThis is just one of many examples. I can only assume it is showing me these albums because I previously purchased an album by \"Various Artists\", assuming any new album by \"Various Artists\" is by the same people.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iTunes Store on Mac or iOS\r\n2. Go to the main page of the music section\r\n3. Scroll down to \"New From Your Artists\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis section should only show albums from artists I have previously bought music from. If a \"Various Artists\" album is included, that album should have at least one song from an artist I have previously bought music by.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Various Artists\" albums are shown where every single song is by an artist I have never purchased music from.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes for Mac 12.4.2.4\r\niTunes for Mac 12.5.0.61\r\niTunes Store on iOS 9.3.3 (13G34)"
