    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I play a media on Apple TV using Airplay, the metadata displayed on the TV (title, artwork) is incorrect if Airplay was enabled *before* playback starts. \r\n\r\nThe information is correct if Airplay is enabled *after* playback was started.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue related to the application I used since information displayed in the control center panel is correct at all times. Note that I used official Apple applications which should probably implement Airplay support correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a wifi network for which an Apple TV is available\r\n2. Open an application with audio / video content (and for which media information is displayed in the control center). A good example is the Apple WWDC application\r\n3. Launch a video without Airplay. After the video has started, enable Airplay from the control center. The metadata displayed by the Apple TV is correct\r\n4. Close the video and open another video while letting Airplay enabled. The metadata displayed by the Apple TV is incorrect (the previous media metadata is displayed).\r\n5. Try switching Airplay off and on again while the second video is still playing, you will see that the metadata is now correct\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe metadata displayed by the Apple TV when using Airplay is correct at all times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe metadata displayed by the Apple TV is correct only when Airplay is enabled after media playback has started\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.2.1, iOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 3rd generation, iPhone 6"
