        Summary:
        I opened a powerpoint file in Keynote and got the message that literally "The sequence of animations was changed in one or two slides" - seriously? "one or two"? See the attached screenshot ;-)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have n obviously somewhat peculiar power-point file.

        Expected Results:
        Keynote should know whether it changed one or two slides…

        Actual Results:
        Keynote plays a Schrödinger on me. „You never know whether it was one or two slides until you checked“ ;-)

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
