    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an application written for OS X Mavericks and later which displays two windows. The windows' titles are specified in the storyboard. On Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan, the windows are displayed with those titles. However, on Sierra, the windows appear with \"Untitled\" as the titles.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Xcode, create a new project of type OS X > Application > Cocoa Application. Enter \"TestProject\" as the Product Name, enter an organization identifier, check \"Use Storyboard\", and uncheck \"Create Document-Based Application\".\r\n\r\nOpen the Storyboard, select Window Controller Scene > Window Controller > Window. In the Attributes Inspector, change the window's title to \"My Window\".\r\n\r\nBuild and run the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should display a window with the title \"My Window\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn Mavericks, Yosemite, and El Capitan, the application displays a window with the title \"My Window\".\r\n\r\nHowever on 10.12 Beta (16A201w), the application displays a window with the title \"Untitled\".\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 Beta (16A201w)"
