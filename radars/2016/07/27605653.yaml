        Summary:
        In iOS 10 beta 3 (and also at least in beta 2), I do see the News Today widget even though for my country (Germany) the news app is not available. The today widget shows news in my language and works as I would expect it to work, so I would really love to see the news app appearing instead of the today widget disappearing. But currently with the one being there and the other’s not it is a bit irritating.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Set device’s location to Germany
        - Open the notification center
        - Go to the today widgets

        Expected Results:
        - News is not showing up there or news is also showing up as an app

        Actual Results:
        - News is showing up in the today widget but not as an app on Springboard (searching for it in spotlight also doesn’t show the app)

        Regression:


        Notes:
        If this is a feature, I simply don’t get it, I guess. To me it makes no sense that the widget is available but the app isn’t. It looks like a bug.
