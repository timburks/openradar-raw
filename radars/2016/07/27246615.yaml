    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use MPMoviePlayerController to play video attachments in our messaging app. The first time someone plays a video attachment, they are met with a permissions dialog: \"<my app>\" would like to Access Apple Music, followed by a customizable message.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it will certainly confuse our users that we are requesting access to \"Apple Music\" to play a video. If you want to request permission to play media, it should be clearer to the users, \"<my app> Would like Access to play media\" or something.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even before the user accepts the permission, the video plays behind the alert (with working audio). Even if the user declines permission, they can continue to play videos with working audio.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Tap on button to play media\r\n- Media player launches and begins play media as expected\r\n- simulatenously, \"Apple Music\" permission alert pops up\r\n- User can Accept, Reject, or ignore permission dialog\r\n- Media continues to play regardless\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither remove the permissions request for playing videos entirely\r\n\r\n-or-\r\n\r\nChange the language of the alert to be about playing media (or accessing speakers, or whatever the concern is), and do not perform playback until permission has been granted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlaying video prompts confusing alert about \"Apple Music\", but otherwise plays before and regardless of alert.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhoneSE iOS10 Simulator"
