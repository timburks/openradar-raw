        Summary:
        The new unified API documentation in Xcode is great. However, I strongly feel it should not only contain API docs, but also language reference for Apple's languages (Swift and Objective-C, possibly also C and C++).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Documentation and API Reference in Xcode 8 (Cmd + Shift + 0).
        2. Search for a Swift language keyword, such as "associatedtype"

        Expected Results:
        A reference doc explaining the keyword shows up in the search results, ideally as the first item in the live search results list.

        Actual Results:
        If you look at all search results and switch to "Tools Guides", references to "The Swift Programming Language" show up that eventually explain the keyword if you browse the book long enough. This is better than nothing, but it's very often not easy to find what you're looking for. A concise reference documentation for all language keywords etc. would go a long way.
