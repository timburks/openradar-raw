    description: "Summary:\r\nAs of iOS 10, the user-scalable=no flag in the meta viewport tag is ignored in favour of always enabling pinch zooming for web content accessibility.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a big win for users of websites that frequently abuse the viewport tag, there is currently no public API to disable this behaviour in WKWebView in native apps combined with other native UI elements.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a native app that uses a WKWebView to display content for a portion of the screen. Pinch zoom in the area of the WKWebView.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe content should not zoom, because the rest of the app (using native controls) does not zoom when pinching.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe content of the WKWebView (but not the rest of the app) is zoomed in, breaking user expectations."
