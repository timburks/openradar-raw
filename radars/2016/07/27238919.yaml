    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently there are 8 preset timers in the upcoming Timer app, and they are all hard coded so everyone has the same timers. This is inefficient because people have different needs, and different presets would be helpful to more people. For example, I use 4, 27, 46, 65, and 90 minute timers all the time, but none of those can be presets, so I have to do a custom timer every time\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Timer app on watchOS 3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to modify the preset timers from the Apple Watch app on iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPreset timers are hard coded and can not be changed for each user's needs."
