    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie.  I edited some code. It was correct.  Did a build. Xcode reported an error flag on the line I edited. Then it reported an error up in the status LED.  And then it took the errors away after a couple of seconds. \r\n\r\n\"oh no you have an error!\" \"oh crap what did I do wrong this time\"  \"ha ha just a joke\"  \">:-(\"\r\n\r\nAttached is the project - a brand new Xcode8b3 created project, FWIW.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just burn some time and wait for mysterious errors to go away, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MyFatnessPal.zip' and 'lies-all-lies.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
