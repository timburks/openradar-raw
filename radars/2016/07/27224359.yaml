    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for MSMessage.shouldExpire is not very clear. In particular:\r\n\r\n* Define what it means for a message to be considered having been read.\r\n* Is this property supported for all message types (text, attachment, sticker, message, audio, video, etc), or only some?\r\n* Is there a different definition of being read depending on the type of message?\r\n* Can a Messages extension override the definition of being read so that a message lives until at least a certain custom condition is met (likely the user somehow interacting with the message)?\r\n* What is considered a \"short time\"? (just providing a rough estimate would be useful -- is it minutes, hours, days, etc)\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/messages/msmessage/1649741-shouldexpire?language=objc"
