    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWistia (a video hosting company) provides an embeddable player with a JavaScript API. We use this API to play a preroll video and then automatically play a main video after it finishes. We specifically use the API to fade out the preroll as it finishes and play the main video underneath, so they seamlessly transition.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 10b3, the preroll plays, but does not fade out or start the main video. This works correctly in Safari on OS X/macOS, and on iOS 9. I have not been able to test on iOS 10 betas 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a video on the Realm site on an iPad running iOS 10 beta 3. (Sample: https://realm.io/news/slug-russ-bishop-contributing-open-source-swift-proposal/)\r\n2. Press play on the video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe preroll video (short ad for Realm, then the meetup name, Swift Language User Group) should play, then disappear. The main video (Russ Bishop speaking) should then automatically play.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe preroll video plays, but never disappears. It remains frozen on the last frame. The main video never plays.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2, using WiFi"
