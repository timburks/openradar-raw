    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshotNotification notification is not posted in a Messages extension.\r\n\r\nOur app (Confide) is a secure, confidential, ephemeral, screenshot-protected messaging app. We are planning on building a Messages extension to allow users to send ephemeral and screenshot-protected messages from within the Messages app. However, a very important part of our app is being able to detect screenshots when they occur so we can close the message and prevent the user from taking further screenshots.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Messages extension\r\n2. In the MSMessagesAppViewController subclass, register to observe the UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshotNotification notification\r\n3. Run the messages extension\r\n4. Take a screenshot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe target/selector for the notification IS called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe target/selector for the notification is NOT called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5297c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAt a minimum, this notification should be called when the Messages app is in the Expanded MSMessagesAppPresentationStyle, as it takes over the entire screen. But it would also be nice to have for Compact as well."
