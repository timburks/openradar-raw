    description: "Summary:\r\nCommon at public places such as hotels and airports, some WiFi networks don't have a WPA password set, but require you to type in a password in a modal web view that gets presented.\r\n\r\nIn the iOS 10 beta, when trying to open the keyboard to type in the password, instead of the keyboard opening, the web view gets dismissed, and the WiFi network is disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Hotel with WiFi that requires password\r\n2. Connect to WiFi that has no WPA or WEP password\r\n3. See the password web view appear\r\n4. Try to type in password\r\n5. Watch as the password input view disappears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard to appear, so I can type in the password and use wifi\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe entire web view disappears in an instant, even with no animation or anything, and I get disconnected from the network completely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64GB, using WiFi"
