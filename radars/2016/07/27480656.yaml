    description: "Summary:\r\nUniversal across 12.9\" iPad Pro: If I'm typing fast and I type \"IF\" but what I really meant \"If\" just using the backspace for the \"F\" doesn't then allow me to type a lowercase \"f\". In order to fix my original typo, I have to backspace twice so that I can change that \"F\" to an \"f\". This only happens when I use my Smart Keyboard (there is not a problem when I use the on-screen keyboard). The backspacing twice just seems to \"reset\" the capitalization for the character space, which seems to be the only way to do what a single backspace should accomplish.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have auto-capitalization on.\r\n2. Use any iOS app (Notes will suffice). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect when I use the backspace, that the character space over which I delete would reset entirely. This is the way it works on my Macbook Pro, my iPhone, and even the iPad Pro when I'm only using the on-screen keyboard. But with the SmartKeyboard, I have to use the delete key twice to reset the capitalization of a character space. I know this has been happening since at least iOS 9.2 (and the issue still exists in 9.3.3).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen I delete, whatever letter I type, stays in uppercase, no matter how many times I type a letter and then press delete. I have to hit \"Delete\" twice in order for the character space to reset to the default lower case. The caps lock is not on and I'm not accidentally hitting \"Shift.\" I don't know if this will help, but what is peculiar is that it does behave more like the caps-lock is on than if I'm pressing \"Shift\" because it does not effect if I were to hit any of the numbers and cause the alternate key to occur (e.g., \"7\" does not produce \"&\" when I do this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" in iOS 9.3.3 (13G34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAuto-Capitalization is off\r\nAuto-Correction is off.\r\nEnable Caps Lock is on.\r\nShortcuts are on.\r\n\".\" Shortcut is off.\r\n\r\nCheck spelling is on.\r\nPredictive is on.\r\n\r\nI currently have the English and Emoji keyboards as active."
