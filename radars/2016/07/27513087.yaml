    description: "Summary:\r\nBeing able to colorize your log messages in the Xcode console is a very powerful feature. We've been using the XcodeColors plugin for years along with Willow and CocoaLumberjack to make our logs easier to debug in Xcode. \r\n\r\n* XcodeColors - https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors\r\n* Willow - https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow\r\n* CocoaLumberjack - https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack\r\n\r\nWith the new addition of Xcode extensions in Xcode 8, we were extremely excited to build a proper Xcode extension that replicated the XcodeColors plugin functionality. Unfortunately, this is not possible because you currently only modify the source code through source code extensions. We would like to officially request support for being able to modify each log message written to the Xcode console to make it easier to debug our applications.\r\n\r\nThe new logging APIs are an awesome addition when using the Console app, but do not help us when using the Xcode console directly. By coloring your log messages, you are able to visually scan them and identify which parts of your codebase are printing which types of messages. You can use color to separate framework messages, log level messages, different threads, etc. The amount of customization is endless.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for considering this feature request.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Colored Logging Output.png' was successfully uploaded."
