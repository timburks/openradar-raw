    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I allow my Apple Watch charge to be depleted, then charge it overnight, in the morning my watch faces are reset to the system defaults. This has happened the 2 mornings in a row Iâ€™ve had watchOS 3 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Allow the battery to run down on the watch to the point where it won't turn on.\r\n2. Charge the watch until full overnight.\r\n3. Put on the watch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour saved watch faces are visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe stock watch faces are restored, though the Watch app on iPhone shows your saved watch faces. Additionally, some complications fail to load data.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S5278d)\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5297c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems to help if I have the Watch app open on my iPhone and reboot the watch. Then, my watch faces are restored.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus (AT&T, 64GB)\r\nApple Watch 42mm"
