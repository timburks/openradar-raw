    description: "Summary:\r\nOh yay, a brand new \"new project\" template chooser.\r\n\r\nWhile the template chooser opens, the icons are spaced pretty nicely.\r\n\r\nOnce the thing opens, the icons suddenly space themselves out.  It's visually jarring, and looks amateurish. \r\n\r\nSee attached video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTBH, I'd love to see actual bugs fixed, like the 49 individual radars I referenced in rdar://22524679, which was total shooting fish in a barrel as far as ease of discovering things wrong with Xcode.\r\n\r\nBut now we have a more annoying new project chooser, where the old one worked fine.  And also, now everyone who does Xcode training materials and tutorials are going to have to update their \"how to create a new project\" instructions - that's a whole lot of re-shot video and re-shot screen grabs sucking away people's time that could be used for actually creating new, useful content.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'icon-reflow.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
