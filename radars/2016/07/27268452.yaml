    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached video - I have two NSTableViews in a window, and the constraints are set such that they have the same top and bottom. The left-hand tableview also has constraints that attach it to the side of the window.\r\n\r\nNo runtime alerts of badness.  No IB complaints about bad constraints.\r\n\r\nWhen I run, the right-side tableview has the IB positioning, not the constraint positioning.\r\n\r\nif I resize the window just one pixel (it's only wafer-thin) then the constraints kick in and everything is sized correctly\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached pr√∂ject\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. table views are the same size\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. They're different size until the first resize, then they're where I want them to be.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDon't know if this is a Cocoa problem, or an Xcode problem setting up the constraints.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'tablesizing.mp4' and 'ClassMaker.zip' were successfully uploaded."
