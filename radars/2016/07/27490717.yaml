        Summary:
        If the URL field has focus, a web page should not be able to steal it

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Start a web page loading (I just noticed it with fatcatsoftware.com)
        2. Select the URL field, to type a URL
        3. Wait for the page to load

        Expected Results:
        The URL field should always remain focussed

        Actual Results:
        Sometimes, when the page loads, the URL field loses focus despite me being half way through typing something.

        Notes:
        I usually notice this when I type something I think will autocomplete (e.g. 'fa' for facebook), hit return by accident, then notice my mistake, hit command-L, and begin typing the proper address. When the first page loads, it often interrupts my typing of the second URL.
