    description: "If I have UITableViewController that presents a modal form that contains UITextField instances, when the user makes one of the fields the first responder the UITableViewController still attempts to change the content inset of its tableview as if it were trying to move out of the way of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nThis test guess is simplified, but the basic scenario is the same as my app and the content insets changing is triggering other unwanted behaviors.\r\n\r\nApple reports this as \"working as designed\" and closed my ticket."
