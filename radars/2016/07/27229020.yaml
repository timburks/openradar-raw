    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a watch app with complications that specify CLKComplicationPrivacyBehaviorHideOnLockScreen. It took me weeks to figure out why my placeholder templates weren't displayed when the watch is locked. There's no documentation on what's actually displayed (the \"Complications Group\", see rdar://27227802) and all of the built-in Apple complications DO seem to display the placeholder templates.\r\n\r\nNow that I understand how it works, I still don't understand why. Simply using the placeholder templates generated in getPlaceholderTemplateForComplication:withHandler: would make for a far nicer transition to the unlocked state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a watchOS app.\r\n2. In getPrivacyBehaviorForComplication:withHandler: specify CLKComplicationPrivacyBehaviorHideOnLockScreen\r\n3. Provide placeholders using getPlaceholderTemplateForComplication:withHandler:\r\n4. Install the app on an Apple Watch\r\n5. Lock the watch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne might reasonably expect the watch to display the placeholder templates when it is locked, because that's exactly how all of the built in complications appear to behave. (The documentation on CLKComplicationPrivacyBehaviorHideOnLockScreen does suggest otherwise, but it's not clear what \"complication icon\" might be referring to. See rdar://27227802 for that separate issue.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe images specified in the \"Complications Group\" are displayed rather than the placeholder templates.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2 through watchOS 3 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
