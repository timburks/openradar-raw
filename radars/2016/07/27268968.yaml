    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCore data prefetching does not work from iOS8 for child managed object contexts. It only works for the Contexts directly above persistence store coordinator. But for the child contexts it does not work. I've already discussed this with Melissa Turner of core data team at WWDC core data lab and I was asked to create this radar.`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've provided a sample project \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncore data setRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching should work even for child contexts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncore data setRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching does not work for child contexts\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS8 and later\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS8 and later\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Coredata prefetching sample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
