    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I'm correcting an error, the place where the formerly-erroneous code still has darker red colorization.  The code is gone, and this highlighting serves no purpose outside of making things harder to read.\r\n\r\nMovie and screenshot attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make an error.  Build\r\n2. Start fixing the error\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The error sigil goes away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Parts of the code are light red, parts are dark red, based on where the original error was.  After 10 seconds of fixing, I no longer really care where the original error was, but I still have to deal with the visual cacophony.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore the patchwork colorization, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'non-useful-highlighting.mp4' and 'bad-highlighting.png' were successfully uploaded."
