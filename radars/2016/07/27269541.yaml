    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen transmitting data via the Messages app, we’re limited to a single URL. This URL is visible to the user in certain cases, so it’s difficult to store ‘private’ data in there. An example is a 2 person game played out in Messages; game state cannot be store in the URL, as the user could get access to i (and, if it contained ‘hidden’ information, such as each players hand in a card game, they could cheat).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nattempt to store data in a Messages message, session, or conversation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\na data property on any of these classes to contain actual data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nno data property"
