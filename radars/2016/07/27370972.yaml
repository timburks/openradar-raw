    description: "Summary:\n\nThe new unified API reference documentation in Xcode 8 works very well (thank you!). However, on Swift class/struct documentation pages, methods are listed with simplified signatures that include the type of every parameter, but not their return type. I find this misleading and surprising; I think showing the return type would be much clearer.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Open the API reference page for String, and browse it to find a method that looks like what you need, say, range(of:options:range:locale:).\n\n\thttps://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/string\n\n2. Find the following info:\n\n    func range(of: String, options: CompareOptions, range: Range<Index>?, locale: Locale?)\n        Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given string within a given range of the String, subject to given options, using the specified locale, if any.\n        [Beta]\n\n3. Become confused because the method seems to have no return value, even though the documentation extract talks about it.\n\nExpected Results:\nIâ€™d expect to see the type of the return value in the simplified method signature that is shown in the method list.\n\nActual Results:\nThe return type is elided.\n\nRegression:\nI believe this is new with Xcode 8.\n\nNotes:\n\nThese simplified signatures in Swift method lists also do not \n- mark parameters with a default value\n- include the actual argument name used in the definition\n- include type constraints of generic functions.\n\nI am OK with not having these; I agree with the desire to extract only the most essential info.\n\nIn Objective-C docs, only selector names are displayed, which I think is also fine, in the context of Objective-C. (It would be less so in Swift.)"
