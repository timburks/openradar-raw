    description: "24-Jul-2016 09:37 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nNight Shift\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI've enabled Night Shift for my wife's iPad and iPhone. I've choose Sunset to Sunrise option. I have enabled Night Shift as soon as I could win release of iOS 9.3. Periodically she complained that her iPad screen still looks yellow in the morning. After this happened more than 5 times she disabled Night Shift completely.\r\nLater when 9.3.2 was released I've re-enabled Night Shift and now she has exactly same problem with her iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set Night Shift from Sunset to Sunrise.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNight Shift is off in the morning.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNight Shift keeps working even in the morning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS  9.3 - 9.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe live in UK. Now I've changed Night Shift to work with time option from 22:00 until 7:00.\r\nThe issue was occurring not at every morning but only during some mornings.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, iPad mini 2 (first retina model).\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
