    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\nMy busiest projects typically grow twins in Xcode's recents lists - in the welcome window and the Recent lists.  It's been happening for a long time.\r\n\r\nThis time I managed to catch evidence of it happening as Xcode went to displaying a project twice in the recent lists to displaying three of them. \r\n\r\nI haven't found a sure-fire way to duplicate the problem.  Hopefully the attached logs from Console.app filtering on Xcode can show something useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just squint to make sure this project the one I want before opening, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xcode-console.log' and 'quadro-tripletcalie.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
