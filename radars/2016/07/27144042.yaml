    description: "Summary:\r\nI had an error with an ambiguous subscript (I don't understand the error, but hey, I'm new at Swift)\r\n\r\nXcode had a list of candidates for the ambiguity.  But clicking on them gave no information.  I had to go to the build log to actually get useful information.\r\n\r\nvideo attached.\r\nproject attached.\r\nscreenshot attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave an ambiguous array index error.  Get a dozen candidates.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can browse the candidates in the issue navigator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking on the candidates does nothing. Double-clicking opens an empty editor window. I have to go to the build log to get any clue what's going on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just check out the build log when items in the issue navigator are inert, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ambugious-subscript-error.png', 'ambugious-subscript-error.mp4' and 'ClassMaker.zip' were successfully uploaded."
