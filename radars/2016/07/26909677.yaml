    description: "I believe it is inherently confusing that the watch does not measure heart rate data when the user is active, but not engaging in a workout. Unless there is a technological reason this can't be done, I am suggesting that the watch always record heart rate.\r\n\r\nThere are certain situations where a \"workout\" is not appropriate, but which are active enough the watch will fail to record heart rates. Currently the best option is to run a workout, then discard it when you are done to prevent a workout entry. This has other ramifications, but is mainly just clunky."
