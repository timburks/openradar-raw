    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm building a UI framework to drive the semi-formulaic layout of our forms and informational pages. Some screens necessitate changing the layout margins of a cell, but otherwise showing the same content. Thus, I am driven to desire the toggle \"Follow Readable Width\" in IB, which changes the effective application of layoutMargins. This checkbox persists at runtime, i.e., if I manually use the layoutMargins property during layout.\r\n\r\nTurns out, you folks already have this! You're so good to me.\r\n\r\nExcept it's SPI. Sad panda.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to bind constraints to the readableContentGuide without editing the constraints, like you can in IB.\r\n2. Feel distraught.\r\n3. Open an IB document as XML.\r\n4. Use class-dump.\r\n5. Feel even more distraught.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can use the layoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth attribute (like IB sets!).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such property is available in the header.\r\n\r\nI'm forced to setValueForKey(_:) to achieve the desired API without rearchitecting, which makes me want to take a shower.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIB sets this value via its encoded properties, so the requested property is already a matter of ABI. You'd make me really happy if you gave it a retconned availability attribute to iOS 9, too.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB T-Mobile, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
