    description: "Area:\r\nNotification Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 10, the Notification Center seems to forget which tab it's on. When you open the Notification Center and slide to show widgets, close the Notification Center, and open it again, it will show your notifications rather than widgets.\r\n\r\nThis worked properly in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iOS 10, open Notification Center\r\n2. Slide left to show your widgets\r\n3. Close Notification Center\r\n4. Open Notification Center again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe widgets should still be shown, since that's where you were last.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe widgets aren't there anymore; Notification Center has reverted you back to the notifications page. This is confusing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached videos which show the correct iOS 9 behavior and the incorrect iOS 10 behavior.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS 9 Behavior.mov' and 'iOS 10 Behavior.mov' were successfully uploaded."
