    description: "Summary:\r\nI often clean my build folder (option-click on the menu item) to get Xcode's head back in to a good place.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then I get bizarre errors.\r\n\r\nvideo showing the problem is attached\r\nThe project in question is attached.  This follows close on the heels of rdar://27163150 , trying to figure out ways of getting it to work.\r\nalso attached is a screen shot of the errors from the log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. purge build folder\r\n2. rebuild with new clean slate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. build happens normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. bizarre errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore new build errors and try rebuilding again , but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ObjCInterop.zip', 'Screen Shot 2016-07-04 at 5.53.01 PM.png' and 'bizarro-world.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
