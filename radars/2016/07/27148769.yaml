    description: "Summary:\r\nWorking along, run the app in the simulator, and nothing happens.\r\nClick the stop button in Xcode, and nothing happens.\r\nTry to quit xcode, and it hangs.\r\n\r\nI usually end up having to force-quit it.\r\n\r\nattached is a screen recording showing the problem\r\nattached are all the xcode console log messages before and after the problem (filtering by 'xcode' in the console search bar thing)\r\nattached is a system diagnostic taken when Xcode SPODed trying to quit.  \r\n\r\nSo far it's been SPODing the entire time to edit down the video and filing this bug (> 20 minutes). Quitting the simulator directly doesn't affect Xcode's SPOD status.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just force-quit Xcode and maybe reboot, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens fairly frequently, a couple of times a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'it-wont-die.mp4', 'xcode-log-messages.log' and 'sysdiagnose_2016.07.02_16-01-42-0400_1622.tar.gz' were successfully uploaded."
