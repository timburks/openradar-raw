        Summary:
        Magic Mouse horizontal scroll in a PDF should not perform 'back' gesture unless the PDF is scrolled fully to the left

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a PDF in Safari
        2. Zoom in, and scroll so that the viewport is in the middle of the PDF
        3. Try to scroll (using a Magic Mouse) so as to see the left hand side of the document

        Expected Results:
        The PDF scrolls.

        Actual Results:
        A swipe-to-go-back starts

        Notes:
        The swipe-to-go-back gesture should only be active when the PDF is scrolled fully to the left.
