        Summary:
        If you use the automatic code generation for your model objects, you can not use ‘Open Quickly’ to access the definition of the class. This is pretty painful as it’s a quick way to find any code definitions (System or project). Looking up the generated code for your core data files becomes a multi step process of finding a user of the class and jumping to the definition


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use the generated core data source and type apple-shift-o and type the name of the model file

        Expected Results:
        A result should appear that jumps to the definition of the model file

        Actual Results:
        No result appears

        Regression:
        This is not a regression

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
