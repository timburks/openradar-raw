    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes when I open a project, the little circles that show whether an IBAction or outlet is connected always draw empty, even if there's a connection.  Cleaning the build folder and running the app don't fix it.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing the problem - the circles are empty for two IBActions.  I purge and build, still empty.  Set breakpoints in the \"unattached\" methods.  Run the app, and stop there. Still empty. Double-check the storyboard, and they're connected.  Come back to the source file and they're now filled in correctly.\r\n\r\nDoesn't happen all the time, but often enough where I don't trust an empty circle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just don't trust the connection-state bubble, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'liar-liar.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
