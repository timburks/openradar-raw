    description: "Summary:\r\nEmbedded frameworks set up using an Xcode workspace require the “Signing” section of the framework target to be completed. This causes issues when the libraries are third-party or non-readwrite, because the team name and ID is explicitly set within the project, and can mean that these details need to be worked around when updating the projects.\r\n\r\nThe previous behaviour was that embedded frameworks set up this way were signed using the details of the app or app extension they were bundled in, which meant that they did not require explicit signing details to be set up. The new behaviour is a regression, and is a significant hinderance to using third-party code and libraries within an app.\r\n\r\nIf a framework is embedded as a sub-project of the app’s project (not using a workspace), it is built and signed as expected, inheriting the signing certificate from the parent target. It does, however, display an error on the target’s General tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the included sample code, open the `StaticTables.xcworkspace` file in the Xcode beta.\r\n2. In the linked `StaticTablesExample` project, on the `StaticTablesExample` target, select the development team in the General tab.\r\n2. In the linked `StaticTables` project, on the `StaticTables` target, ensure the development team is set to “None” in the General tab.\r\n4. Build and run on a development device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe framework should inherit the signing certificate from the app it is being embedded into, build successfully, resulting in the app being run on device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build will not complete, because the team has not been selected for the framework.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy developer ID is linked to multiple teams, which may or may not have relevance to this issue."
