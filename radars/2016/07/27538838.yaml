    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe fields of a user's contact card is increasingly important. It's always been important to sync, and AutoFill, QuickType Intelligence, and Siri all prioritize results based on the order in the card according to the Contacts database. With unified cards, and now third-party social profiles, this order is even less under my control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be told a friend has a new email address; for example, they just got a new job as the Screener for the Contacts team.\r\n2. Open the friend's contact card\r\n3. Add the new email address\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to re-order the new address as the \"preferred\" address at the top of the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI must delete the other entries first.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5309d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUITableView, y'all. You know it well. <3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB Version, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
