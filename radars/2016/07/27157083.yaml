    description: "Summary:\r\nI noticed that when you open .xib files with Xcode they get marked as modified before you even touch them. So i used my versioning tool to look at the diffs and found that Xcode did modify the files. Not only is it annoying that files get changed by looking at them, this is an actual problem when you work in teams with more than one person, because it is a common cause for merge conflicts (hence the classification \"serious bug\" instead of \"usability\").\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Your local repository should be in a state with no changes.\r\n2. Now click on a .xib file in the project navigator.\r\n3. Observe the file getting marked as dirty without having made any changes.\r\n4. Look at the diff to see the changes Xcode made to your file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFiles shouldn't change when you look at them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.xib files change when you look at them."
