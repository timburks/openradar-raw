    description: It's claimed that Maps is available for Belarus. But there are only pair of highways on the map. I know, maybe there is some obstacles for gathering data, but I'm sure there is a way, even if it means help of volunteers. Otherwise some functionality and services of iOS look quite poor and useless.
