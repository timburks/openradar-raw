    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a thriving plugin community for Xcode (http://alcatraz.io/) which produced many plugins that make everyone's lives better.\r\n\r\nThat thriving community is in danger of dying out due to Xcode 8's refusal to run 3rd party plugins.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that there is a new, native Xcode extensibility SDK.  However that SDK is extremely limited it what it can do.  Most of the plugins in Alcatraz can't be ported to it.\r\n\r\nI, and many other developers (as can be attested here https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz/issues/475) would like a way to re-enable the old plugin system, without having to resort to disabling OS-wide security protections.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 8\r\n2. Fail."
