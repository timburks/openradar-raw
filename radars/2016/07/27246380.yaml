    description: "Summary:\r\nThe frame of a buttons `titleLabel` reports an incorrect value after `setTitle: forState:` is called.\r\n\r\nThis is only an issue when using Auto Layout to position the button within a view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open & run UIButton-Issue sample project.\r\n- See the button layout is correct with a correct value printed to the console.\r\n- Tap the only button on the view.\r\n- See the incorrect width of the `titleLabel` logged to the console.\r\n- Tap the button again and see an incorrect layout matched with incorrect `titleLabel` width printed in the console.\r\n- Now toggle on the \"Apply fix\" switch.\r\n- Tap the button again and see the correct layout with correct width of the `titleLabel`.\r\n- Tap the button again so the button's title is set to the shorter text and see the correct widths again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe frame of the `titleLabel` of the button should report the correct frame after a title is set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe frame of the `titleLabel`reports incorrect values when queried after setting the title of the button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1 & 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIButton-Issue.zip', 'UIButton-issue.gif' and 'UIButton-issue.mov' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nPotential fix:\r\nRemove the animation of setting the title and force a layout before redrawing view.\r\n\r\n```\r\noverride func setTitle(title: String?, forState state: UIControlState) {\r\n    UIView.performWithoutAnimation { () -> Void in\r\n        super.setTitle(title, forState: state)\r\n        self.layoutIfNeeded()\r\n        self.setNeedsDisplay()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```"
