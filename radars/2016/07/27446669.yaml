    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an UIDocumentInteractionController is presented as “open-in”, and the iPad gets rotated, the UIDocumentInteractionController will be dismissed but its documentInteractionControllerDidDismissOpenInMenu-delegate-method is not being called.\r\nThe biggest impact of this may be related to custom “Open-in”-UIActivity-implementations in various apps. The UIActivity-implementations rely on the behaviour that any of the delegate-methods are being called, to call “activityDidFinish:” at the correct point of time. As none of the delegates are being called when the device gets rotated, “activityDidFinish:” is never being called and the UIActivityController and all its UIActivities will never be removed from memory, thus, they leak.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project\r\n2. Tap the button\r\n3. Rotate the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs the UIDocumentInteractionController is being dismissed, it calls documentInteractionControllerDidDismissOpenInMenu on its delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIDocumentInteractionController is being dismissed, but it doesn’t call its delegate-method documentInteractionControllerDidDismissOpenInMenu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10b3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Simulator / iPad 4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIDocumentInteractionControllerRotationBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
