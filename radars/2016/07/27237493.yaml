    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I transfer an app to Instruments from the CPU gauges, it doesn't really work.  The app is unresponsive to clicks. The simulator itself seems to be alive.\r\n\r\nAttached is a video showing it in action.  It's kind of long - but shows the app being handed off to instruments and failing. Then instruments being invoked directly (via command-I), which works, then back to a hand-off situation, where it fails. And then a second try making sure there's no core audio involved.\r\n\r\nattached are the console messages filtered for Xcode.  There were no log search results for a filter of 'instruments'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. run the app in xcode\r\n2. go to the CPU gauge page\r\n3. Transfer to Instruments\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. instruments cranks up and I can use my app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4 Instruments cranks up but the app is unresponsive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just run instruments directly, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've seen this fairly often in Xcode 7.3 also, to the extent I never try transferring to instruments from there.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bad-instrument-handoff.mp4' and 'xcode-messages.log' were successfully uploaded."
