    description: |-
        The PDF specification states that an ICC color profile can be embedded in the document, but macOS does not support this.

        Since PDF files can be added to an asset catalog, there needs to be some kind of documentation that states which profile is assumed (likely sRGB) and how it processed.

        For example, if file is selected as a base image that is converted to sRGB or Display P3 as needed, how is the raw color in the PDF handled? Is a value like 123,45,67 converted from sRGB to 114,50,16 in Display P3? Or are the raw values assigned in the Display P3 color space?
