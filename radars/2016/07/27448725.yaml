    description: "Boris Yurkevich20-Jul-2016 03:32 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe bough about 10 new iMac computers for our office. Our boss told us to hold option key during set up to do network restore. I couldn't finish my network restore without connecting old USB mouse.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on new Mac\r\n2. Hold option key\r\n3. Select partition from your local OS X Server\r\n4. Wait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRestore should finish\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhite square with blinking mouse and keyboard appeared on the screen. iMac suggested to turn on green switch both on mouse and keyboard. Turning switch on and off didn't do anything. As well as connecting Lightning cable.\r\n\r\nEventually I tried different Lighting cable and keyboard worked for 2-3 screens, then it stopped again. I stuck on another screen with the stamp icon and Continue button.\r\n\r\nFinally I connected USB mouse and it helped me to finish network restore.\r\n\r\nThen login screen appeared and I was able to enter password with Lightning connected keyboard. It only worked when connected.\r\n\r\nAfter I logged in, I was able to pair both mouse and keyboard through Lightning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niMac Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015\r\nSerial Number DGKS20CQGG7F\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing new Lighting keyboard and mouse\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
