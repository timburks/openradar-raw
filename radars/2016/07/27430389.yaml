    description: "When a NSImageView is used on a HUD Panel, the whole image is slightly translucent/transparent, which makes seeing the image very difficult and is unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new NSPanel and set type to HUD Panel\r\n2. Add a NSBox\r\n2. Drag a new NSImageView to the NSBox\r\n3. Set some image to the NSImageView\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe image is expected to not be translucent, should be opaque and not change depending on what is behind the NSPanel.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nImage is displayed translucent and especially light images are very hard to read, see the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nAttachment:\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IezdFzD.png"
