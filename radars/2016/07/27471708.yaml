        Summary:
        The Swift standard library appears to have a very low priority in the ordering of search results. I think it should be very high.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the documentation window in Xcode 8.
        2. Type "print" in the search field.

        Expected Results:
        The print(_:separator:terminator:) function in the Swift standard library shows up very high in the search results. I would expect it at the top.

        Actual Results:
        The print function doesn't show up at all in the live search results. You have to click through to Show All Results to find it.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        See the attached screenshot. Similar things happen with a lot of APIs in the Swift standard library.
