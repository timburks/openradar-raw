    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see attached video.  the project being shown is attached as well.\r\n\r\nI don't like a lot of distraction when I'm trying to work. That's why code coloring is all black, I have completion on-demand only, show-all-issues off, and live issues off.\r\n\r\nWell, I'd leave live issues off (that's my preference) but because of rdar://27162167 they have to be on, otherwise playgrounds are broken.\r\n\r\nI have \"Show All Issues\" (control-command-M) disengaged.  That reduces the visual cacophony.  I hit that key combo to see what the error is, then hide it.\r\n\r\nExcept for the \"hey, this warning applies to this region\" red squiggles. They're still there.\r\n\r\nThis particular warning is pretty worthless (it's going to be used in a couple of minutes. Wish I could turn that warning off), and now I have the red squiggles in my face, as well, which thanks to my vision correction dances around in my field of vision whenever I move my head, adding insult to injury.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo red squigglies when there's a warning and \"Show All Issues\" is turned off.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just O.D. on Adderall, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'red-squigglies.mp4' and 'MyFatnessPal.zip' were successfully uploaded."
