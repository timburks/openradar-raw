    description: "Xcode Editor Extensions can be programmed to open other applications, but when they do their process appears in the OSX Dock as the .appex bundle, and bounces for a few minutes before going away, presumably at the same time as the extension process is exited or terminated by Xcode.\r\n\r\nThe method of opening another application used in the sample is:\r\n\r\nNSWorkspace.shared().launchApplication(\"TextEdit\")\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Install an Xcode Editor Extension that opens other apps\r\n2. Perform the extension command that will open an app\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nThe extension opens an app, and the app appears in the Dock.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\nThe extension opens an app, and the extension appears in the Dock and bounces, the app also appears in the Dock.\r\n\r\n#### Xcode Version/Build & OSX Version/Build\r\n\r\nOS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n\r\nAlso occurred on:\r\n\r\nOS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 1"
