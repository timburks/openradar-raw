    description: "Summary:\r\nI was trying to help a dude on swift-users out (https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/Week-of-Mon-20160704/002544.html), and I wanted to get part of the stack trace to paste in to the message.\r\n\r\nClicking the + shows some of the stack trace (the 12.09.22 screen shot), but not enough to be useful, and when I try to click and copy it, I get a beep.\r\n\r\nClicking the eye shows the other stack trace (the 12.09.26) - aside from centered stack traces being really hard to read, I couldn't figure out how to click / select / copy the contents.\r\n\r\nThere was no information in the console. I couldn't figure out how (if possible) to get an lldb console.  Guessing that's not possible.\r\n\r\nattached is the playground in question\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'j23n4j32n4j23n42j34nj.playground.zip', 'Screen Shot 2016-07-09 at 12.09.26 PM.png' and 'Screen Shot 2016-07-09 at 12.09.22 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
