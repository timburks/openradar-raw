    description: "Summary:\r\nMoving a project's parenting directory while the project is open understandably causes Xcode to go \"WTF mate, where'd all my stuff go\".\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, Xcode leaves a \"bubble\" in the Recents menu.  Choosing this item causes Xcode to present two alerts of complaint.\r\n\r\nAttached is a video showing the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project\r\n2. Move the project's parent directory somewhere else\r\n3. Xcode understandably freaks out.  Say soothing words and close the remants of the project\r\n4. Open the Recents menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. The recents menu should have valid projects and playgrounds in it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. There's a bubble with no name in the recents menu.  (as I'm walkin' through the desert on a bubble with no name...)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bubbles-the-monkey.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
