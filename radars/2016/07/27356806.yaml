    description: "Summary:\r\nPreview cannot scroll correctly on the thumbnail view with landscape PDFs.\r\n\r\nI have a 100+ page landscape PDF that was generated using Keynote (Standard 4:3 size).\r\n\r\nThe scrolling on the thumbnails using a 2-finger gesture is impossible with a landscape PDF.\r\n\r\nThe scrollbar is buggy and shows a single page, or erratically jumps to show the correct position.\r\n\r\nThe scroll location keeps reseting to the bottom. This makes it impossible to scroll through thumbnails.\r\n\r\nSidenote: scrolling with a thumbwheel logitech USB mouse works ok in the thumbnail, but the scrollbar still renders it's size erratically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Test2LandscapeBUGGY.pdf in Preview\r\n2. Open sidebar\r\n3. Scroll with 2-finger gesture on the Thumbnails\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. I should be able to move to any location\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. The scroll location resets to the bottom of the PDF (last page) and resumes the gesture scroll momentum. It is impossible to scroll.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis does not occur with landscape PDFS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
