        Summary:
        The documentation search results are sometimes less than useful because they don't show type information. This makes it sometimes impossible to identify the API you're looking for with APIs with multiple overloads.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the documentation viewer in Xcode.
        2. Type "+" in the search field and hit Return.

        Expected Results:
        The search results list provides enough information for the reader to distinguish between different overloads (such as type information for arguments and return type).

        Actual Results:
        The search results come up as seen in the attached screenshot. The list shows roughly 20 overloads for the "+" function, but without type information. It is impossible to select the one you're looking for.

        Regression:
        n/a
