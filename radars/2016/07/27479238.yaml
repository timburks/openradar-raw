    description: "Summary:\r\nvideo attached.  project attached\r\n\r\nThings happening in this video:\r\n* Project has errors, that's due to migrating to Swift 3, and I'm dealing with the fallout.  Not unexpected\r\n* I build, see some errors, as I'm reading and pondering the errors, they disappear (but I still have the error sigil in the gutter). Usually the errors aren't taken away when reading them.\r\n* I flip forward to another file (which has errors).  There are some error displays in the editor\r\n* flip back to the orignial file. No change.\r\n* flip back to a file with no errors\r\n* flip forward to the original file. No change\r\n* flip forward to the file with errors - the errors are _GONE_.  If I walked up to this file, I'd believe that it was in perfect shape ready to go.\r\n* Flip backward to the original file.  These errors are gone too.\r\n\r\n(sourcekit did not crash - I use all-black for my code colorization due to my vision correction)\r\n \r\nMost likely a quit and restart of Xcode will fix this, but figured show you some evidence of really bad misbehavior that I often see  on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build, expecting errors\r\n2. Read the errors\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The errors stay around long enough to read\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The errors are taken from me, ripped from my grasp.  Also, after navigating through a couple of files, the fact that there are errors in the code completely disappear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just learn to speed-read, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'now-you-see-them.mp4' and 'GrafDemo.zip' were successfully uploaded."
