    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie - nothing responds with anything useful when option-clicking. The help navigator doesn't show anything when clicking on anything.\r\n\r\nI did a clean build folder and a rebuild.\r\n\r\nThis is the error-mop-up after a swift-3 migration (which itself had errors, but I don't know if those were useful - rdar://27477891)\r\n\r\nSource Server did not crash - I use all-black for my syntax colorization because of reasons.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is the error-ful project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do a swift-3 migration. Have some errors to clean up (not unexpected)\r\n2. Option-click on anything\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Get inference information. Or get some pop-up up help\r\n4. Get some stuff appearing in the quick help inspector\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3, 4 - nothing.  \"no quick help\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just don't use the built-in tools and search the docs old-school, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\nc.f. rdar://22524679\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'no-help-for-you.mp4' and 'GrafDemo.zip' were successfully uploaded."
