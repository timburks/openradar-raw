    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the process of filing rdar://27236415, I managed to catch Xcode do the \"hey man, I don't know where your simulators are. Let's hope nothing... untoward... happens to them\"  This is the bug report with the evidence.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie for what I did (quit Xcode7, which actually had been 'relaunched' from the crash reporter dialog, because of rdar://27162192), then running Xcode 8, trying to run my app (no simulators). Then quitting Xcode and rerunning (simulators)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just restart Xcode once your blood pressure returns to normal, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'where-did-it-go-george.mp4' and 'xcode-messages.log' were successfully uploaded."
