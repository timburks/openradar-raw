    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I scroll to my app in the dock, and wait there, my understanding is that my app should start running normally. However, this does not seem to be the case on a physical Apple Watch.\r\n \r\nNone of the WKExtensionDelegate or WKInterfaceController lifecycle functions are ever called after I have stopped on my app in the dock. The functions are only called once I have clicked and entered my app from the dock.\r\n \r\nOn the simulator, everything seems to work fine. After lingering on my app in the dock [WKExtensionDelegate applicationWillEnterForeground], [WKExtensionDelegate applicationDidBecomeActive], and [WKInterfaceController willActivate] are all called while still in the dock.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run and install the attached application on a physical Apple Watch\r\n2. Scroll to the application on the dock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should start running again after waiting on my application in the dock for a short period of time. (The counter in the app should start counting again.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application stops running, evident from the counter not counting.\r\n\r\nIf you retry the steps to reproduce on the simulator, the counter will continue counting even while the application is in the dock.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatchOS 3 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42 mm.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MyWatchApplication.zip' was successfully uploaded."
