    description: "Mark Dalrymple15-Jul-2016 08:12 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes, when I go to a storyboard and drag out a connection wire with control-drag, the wire is actually insulation - nothing connects.  I have to stop, randomly click things, and then try again.\r\n\r\nI haven't figured out exactly what's doing it\r\n\r\nVideo attached (wired.mp4) showing my problem.\r\nThe project is attached.\r\n\r\nAfter some playing around, discovered that if the View is selected (either blue highlight, or a latent selection in dimmed blue caused by going to another file and back), I cannot make connections from buttons in the editor pane.  Inconsistently, I _can_ make connections with control-drag from the outline list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just wonder why things aren't connecting and the click around randomly, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'inconsistent-selection-interference.mp4', 'ObjCInterop.zip' and 'wired.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
