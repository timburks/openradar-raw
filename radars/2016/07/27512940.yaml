        Summary:
        When configuring Core Data entity attributes, you are able to specify whether an attribute is optional or not. Unfortunately, the generated swift files do not take this into account, and all generated attributes are marked as optional.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add an optional attribute to an entity
        2) Generate the code

        Expected Results:
        Optional properties are declared as Swift optionals. Non-optional properties are _not_ declared as Swift optionals.

        Actual Results:
        All properties are declared as Swift optionals.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        This may be intentional as it is possible to read from a value before it has ever been set. However, an alternative approach then would be to mark such properties as implicitly-unwrapped-optionals, which allow them to be used as normal, but hinting to the user that it might contain nil if being read before being written to.
