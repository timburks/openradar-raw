    description: "Please update the terminfo definitions that ship with OS X. This can be done by bringing in a newer ncurses package or selectively updating the definitions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTerminal.app supports the \"dim\" capability for half-bright text output. Terminal.app identifies itself by default as \"xterm-256color\".\r\nThe \"xterm-256color\" definition shipped with current MacOS Sierra betas, however, does not allow that capability to be used:\r\n\r\n1. Type into the terminal under a profile with system defaults (terminal declared as xterm-256color):\r\necho this text is normal; tput dim; echo this text is dimmed\r\n2. Launch a new terminal after modifying Terminal.app settings under Advanced -> Terminfo -> Declare terminal as to \"dtterm\"\r\n3. Type into a new terminal window under the profile with the modified settings above:\r\necho this text is normal; tput dim; echo this text is dimmed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe output in both cases should consist of one line with normal intensity text followed by a line with half-intensity text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the TERM=dtterm Terminal window will behave correctly. \r\n\r\nThis is because in the particular version of ncurses shipped with OS X, the xterm profiles are not blessed with a \"dim\" capability. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 Beta (16A254g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n# Notes regarding TERM/Terminfo on MacOS\r\n\r\nIt is not the case that dtterm is a better TERM default for Terminal.app. \r\n\r\nHowever, it likely is the case that another option present, nsterm, is a better default. This is a terminfo ruleset that is tailored specifically to terminal.app (which the terminfo author believes to derive in lineage back to NSTerm). With a newer version of ncurses installed (e.g. through Homebrew: `brew install ncurses; brew link --force ncurses`) nsterm provides a better experience than even xterm-256color because it contains a newer nsterm terminfo which attempts to define the exact capabilities that exist in Terminal.app as of El Capitan, a better match than xterm-256color. The terminfo that ships with MacOS is today too moldy as of present to yield a good experience here, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
