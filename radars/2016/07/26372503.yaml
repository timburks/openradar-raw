    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I add music to my iCloud Music Library with iTunes Match, I often find that \"matched\" tracks are incorrect. For example, a live version of a song might match a studio recording, or an original master might match a \"remastered\" version. While this is not the end of the world, what is very frustrating is that often the per-track matching results in an album where half the tracks are uploaded and the other are matched. Because remastering today frequently involves boosting volume substantially, listening to an album this way can be very irritating. iTunes badly needs a \"force upload\" option that allows the user to ensure the original files are uploaded, not matched incorrectly. Alternatively, Match could simply work on a per-album basis. If an entire album cannot be matched, don't match any of the tracks in the album. This would ensure albums stay consistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Rip CD\r\n2. \"Update iCloud Music Library\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlbum is \"Matched\" or \"Uploaded\" in its entirety\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlbum is a mix of \"Matched\" and \"Uploaded\" tracks with inconsistent mastering or performances"
