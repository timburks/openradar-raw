    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently, the Bedtime feature in the Clock app will assume I'm in bed at the time I specify as my preferred sleep time. The only way to change this appears to be selecting \"go to sleep now\" when I get a notification to go to bed.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Clock app uses my phone's motion to detect when I move at night and when I wake up, it should be able to determine that I've gone to sleep early based on the fact that it's charging and motionless for an extended period at night.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Bedtime to go to sleep at some time (e.g., 12:00 AM)\r\n2. Before this time, put the iPhone on the bedside table and go to sleep (e.g., 11:22 PM).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy sleep analysis when I wake up knows that I went to bed at 11:22 PM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy sleep analysis when I wake up says I went to bed at 12:00 AM."
