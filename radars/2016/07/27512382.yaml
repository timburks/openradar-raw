    description: "Summary:\nSince it’s introduction, iOS Text Replacements syncing has been incredibly broken, often deleting _every_ shortcut, failing to sync between devices, and recovering shortcuts that have long since been deleted. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIt’s plagued many users, but here is an example of what has happened to me recently:\n\n1) One day, all of my shortcuts were gone. Every single one. From both iOS and macOS.\n2) I added back a few of my shortcuts on iOS\n3) These failed to sync to my Mac\n4) Several months later, all of my previous shortcuts came back, even some I had deleted prior to them disappearing.\n5) Again, they all disappeared several days later\n6) I added back more shortcuts\n7) Today, every shortcut came back, minus my new ones I had added recently.\n\nExpected Results:\nShortcuts don’t delete themselves, and sync correctly between devices.\n\nActual Results:\nShortcuts magically deleted themselves, and do not sync correctly between devices.\n\nRegression:\nIt’s completely random when it happens.\n\nNotes:\nI know syncing is hard, maybe is there a way to completely reset my personal shortcuts so this doesn’t keep happening?"
