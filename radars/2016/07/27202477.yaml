    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you set up a UITableView to combine rows with actions (returning a non-empty array from `tableView:editActionsForRowAt:`) and rows with no actions (returning either an empty array or nil from said method), rows with actions will stop allowing you to swipe on them after you attempt to swipe on one of the rows without actions\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a UITableView\r\n- Implement UITableViewDataSource\r\n- Implement `tableView:editActionsForRowAt:` such that it returns actions for some rows but not for others.\r\n- Launch app.\r\n- 1: Swipe on a row with actions\r\n- 2: Swipe on a row with no actions\r\n- 3: Swipe on a row with actions\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1: shows the actions beneath the row and they work\r\n2: doesn’t allow shipping\r\n3: same as 1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1: behaves as expected\r\n2: allows swiping the row slightly, not displaying anything underneath\r\n3: after 2, all attempts to swipe rows will fail, and actions are not usable after the UITableView is recreated (which in some cases may require the app to be re-launched). This is reproducible 100% (see attached project)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.0 Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is reproducible in iOS 9.3 and iOS 10 Beta 1 and 2.\r\nNo workaround has been found. I’ve attached a minimal project that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproduces on any device and simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewActions-RadarSampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
