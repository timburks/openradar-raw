    description: "Summary:\r\nSupposedly rdar://27236415 (Xcode8: Incredible amount of spew to debug console) was fixed, but I'm still seeing unwanted output to the console. Not nearly as much before, but enough to be annoying.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing the problem starting with a brand new project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore the traffic to the console and hope nothing important gets interleaved, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'spew-2-brute.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
