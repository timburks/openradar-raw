    description: "27389949\r\n\r\n# Title\r\n\r\ntvOS doesn't respect UIKeyInput\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nCustom UIView classes which implement UIKeyInput do not take input from a bluetooth keyboard or show the on-screen keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Implement a UIView class which conforms to UIKeyInput\r\n2. Make that view instance first responder\r\n3. View is first responder, but will not take any key pressed from a connected bluetooth keyboard and the on-screen keyboard will not be visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expected Results\r\n\r\nUIKeyInput method -insertText: to be called on keypresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Actual Results\r\n\r\nNothing happens. Keypresses on a bluetooth keyboard are ignored and the on-screen keyboard is never visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional Notes\r\n\r\nAttached a project which takes keypresses from a bluetooth keyboard on iOS but does not on tvOS.\r\n\r\nRun the InputTest target on iOS with a keyboard attached and start typing. the \"TestView\" (which implements UIKeyInput) will change color as you type.\r\n\r\nBuilding the InputTestTV target for tvOS, nothing happens when you press a key on the keyboard (even thought the view *is* the first responder)."
