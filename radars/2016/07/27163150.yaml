    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a header file being imported in a $PROJECT-Bridging-Header.h .  When I try to open that header from the bridging header file (via command-click / or menu jump-to-definition), I just get a beep and a question-mark in a bezel\r\n\r\nattached is a video showing the problem\r\nattached is the project being shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a header to the bridging header\r\n2. command-click that header #import, or do control-click->Jump to definion\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nnavigate to the header file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\njust a beep.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just remember you have to navigate to headers from other files, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ObjCInterop.zip' and 'no-open-for-you.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
