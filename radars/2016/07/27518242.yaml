        Summary:
        When the user has the subject field visible in messages, the bottomLayoutGuide for UIViewControllers in an iMessage app has the wrong length. Specifically, it appears that the bottomLayoutGuide gets its height from the height of the subject + message bar, and _not_ the toolbar at the bottom.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add a subview to an iMessage app view controller
        2) Pins its edges using auto layout to the left and right edges, and top and bottom layout guides

        Expected Results:
        Subview’s bottom aligns with top of toolbar.

        Actual Results:
        Subview’s bottom only aligns with top of toolbar if the user has chosen to not show the subject field. Otherwise, it will be another toolbar’s height _above_ the toolbar.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Attached are two screenshots which demonstrate the issue. A subview that has been pinned to the layout guides is blue, and the superview is yellow. When the subject field is not present, there is no issue. When the subject field is present, the blue subview’s bottom is not aligned with the toolbar. I’ve also attached a sample project to demonstrate this issue.
