    description: "Summary:\r\nSince upgrading to the first public beta of iOS 10, all radio stations in Apple Music only play clean music. I even created a new station from an explicit song and it started a station with the clean version of that song.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a radio station from an explicit song\r\n2) Apple Music starts the station (and usually plays the same song), but only plays the clean version.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApple Music plays the explicit version of the songs when Restrictions > Music is set to allow Explicit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Music started my station and played the song I used to create the station, but switched it to the clean version.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 [14A5297c]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRestrictions (Settings > General > Restrictions) are off on this device.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs since upgrading to iOS 10."
