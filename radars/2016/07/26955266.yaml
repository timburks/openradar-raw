    description: "The deprecation of the kCFStreamNetworkServiceTypeVoIP in favour of PushKit notifications precludes the possibility for applications/solutions which need to work where no Internet connection exists, such as remote locations without mobile or hardwired connections (or even slow or unreliable connections).\r\n\r\nApplications which provide VoIP services (via dedicated hardware and local WiFi) are unable to provide VoIP/SIP services to Apple devices as they can not generate a Remote Notification without having accessing to the Internet and with the deprecation of kCFStreamNetworkServiceTypeVoIP, devices no longer guarantee the life of the service while the app is in the background, making the use of Apple devices unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe move towards PushKit is not an issue, the inability to generate a Remote Notification without access to a Internet connection is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a server which generates Remote Notifications.\r\n2. Register a device for Remote Notifications from the server\r\n3. Connect both to the same WiFi network\r\n4. Remove Internet access from the WiFi network\r\n5. Generate PushKit notifications from the server\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. A remote notification\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Nothing.  No body seems to know that nothing has happended\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are open to any reliable solution which helps us solve this issue, including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. An embedded APNs server which can run the hardware device locally and serve Remote Notifications over the local WiFi network\r\n2. Guarantees over the reliability of services like Bluetooth based notifications, while the App is in the background\r\n3. Some other mechanism which would allow our SIP based hardware to generate a notification to the Apple Device while the app is running in the background in a guaranteed and reliable manner\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple devices supporting iOS 9+, localised WiFi with no Internet Access"
