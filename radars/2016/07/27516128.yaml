    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you run this defaults command:\n\n```\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ExplainWhyBuildCommandsAreRun -bool YES\n```\n\nXcode's build output will include detailed information on why specific commands were run. This output can be extremely useful for figuring out why compile times are slow, or just in general more information on how the build pipeline works. It would be great if this was a public Xcode preference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Try to find something on the internet about `ExplainWhyBuildCommandsAreRun`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis option is documented somewhere, and is in Xcode's preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou find this tweet https://twitter.com/bdash/status/661742266487205888\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
