    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I try to complete something, Xcode offers \"color literal\" and \"image literal\", even when they make no sense.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie - I do a completion of my own, root-level class (which also conforms to CustomStringConvertible) for a single class-level method.\r\n\r\nI get that method suggested (yay), description (yay CustomStringConvertible), and two fancy literals.\r\n\r\nI tried using one of them (maybe I'm missing something obvious), but no, when I complete using them, I get errors.\r\n\r\nProject is also attached, FWIW.  Brand new trivial project. About 20 minutes programming, 30 minutes radar filing so far.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDon't suggest things that don't make sense\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore half of what the completion window offers, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MyFatnessPal.zip' and 'no-color-for-you.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
