    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are querying the user's music library, using a MPMediaQuery\r\n\r\nUpon activating this, a prompt is shown in iOS10 asking for permission to access the user's media library, however the MPMediaQuery continues to run whilst the prompt is showing, returning no results (assumes no permission)\r\n\r\nIf you accept the permissions prompt and re-run, it works fine\r\n\r\nAs there is no documented way of us asking for permission, any automated request must therefore wait for the permission prompt to be either agreed or dismissed, before the underlying code can run - otherwise the user gets unexpected results\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun a MPMediaQuery\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPermission prompt shows, then code runs if permission is granted\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPermission prompt shows, then code runs instantly without user accepting/denying prompt. As such, first run of code always returns no results\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Public beta 2 (10.0 14A5309d)"
