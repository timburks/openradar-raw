    description: "Summary:\r\nClang has all the smarts it would need to power this, so it would be great if marking a property of an enum type as IBInspectable should translate the possible values of this enum to the options in an NSPopupButton in IB.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy and paste the following code into a Swift file of some project:\r\npublic\r\nclass BigLoada: NSObject {\r\n    public\r\n    enum Track: Int {\r\n        case AJourneyToReedham, FullRinse, Massif, ComeOnMySelector, TheBodyBuilder, TequilaFish, JacquesMalChance\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @IBInspectable\r\n    var favoriteTrack: Track\r\n    @IBInspectable\r\n    var bogusAttribute: String?\r\n\r\n    public\r\n    override init() {\r\n        favoriteTrack = .ComeOnMySelector\r\n        super.init()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension BigLoada.Track: CustomStringConvertible {\r\n    public\r\n    var description: String {\r\n        switch self {\r\n        case .AJourneyToReedham:\r\n            return \"A Journey To Reedham\"\r\n        case .FullRinse:\r\n            return \"Full Rinse\"\r\n        case .Massif:\r\n            return \"Massif\"\r\n        case .ComeOnMySelector:\r\n            return \"Come On my Selector\"\r\n        case .TheBodyBuilder:\r\n            return \"The Body Builder\"\r\n        case .TequilaFish:\r\n            return \"Tequila Fish\"\r\n        case .JacquesMalChance:\r\n            return \"Jacques Mal Chance\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n2. Create a new xib or storyboard in this project, and instantiate a custom NSObject.\r\n3. Set this instance’s class to BigLoada and open its property inspector.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- There are two properties exposed on the “BigLoada” instance: An NSTextField labeled “Bogus Attribute”, and an NSPopUpButton labeled “Favorite Track”\r\n- Ideally, the popup button has “Come On My Selector” preselected. (No selection at all/“Default” would be acceptable as well, though.)\r\n- When clicking the popup button, you get all the enum cases listed in the order in which they occur in the type.\r\n- Optionally, there is an additional “Default” option above a separator item followed by the possible enum cases.\r\n- Ideally, the enum cases make use of the custom description, such that the popup resembles the track listing of Squarepusher’s “Big Loada” record.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the “Bogus Attribute” property is exposed in IB at all.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode-beta (8S128d), but any earlier version of Xcode will do, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am very well aware that there are existing radars for this already, and probably since WWDC 2014. But it would be so nice if this would actually be implemented!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
