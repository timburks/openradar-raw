    description: "View Controller that should render only in landscape on iPhone devices, draws the landscape sized view in portrait.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Existing View Controller is displayed in Portrait\r\n2. Display a new view controller with preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation returning UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft; supportedInterfaceOrientations returning UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape; and shouldAutorotate returning NO.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew View Controller should display rendered correctly in Landscape\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA landscape sizing of the view is rendered in portrait, so it draws from the top-left and draws off screen to the right, while leaving the bottom half of the screen black.\r\nNote 1: [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation] returns UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft though the view is really being drawn in portrait.\r\nNote 2: Backgrounding and returning to the app causes the view to draw correctly"
