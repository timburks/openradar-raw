    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode loves to modify my xib files with trivial changes if I even slightly glance at them. This has been happening for four years now. \r\n\r\nAttached is yet another movie demonstrating the problem.\r\nAttached is a source code control log of a single Xib file, with all of the bogus revisions just because xcode can't control its bladder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a slightly newer xcode than the one you have\r\n2. Click on a xib file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. You can look at the xib file without extra work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. The xib file is modified, marked as dirty, and saved to the file system.\r\n\r\nThis means I either have to look at this and revert it every single time, or I have junk in my source control system log.  Such as this:\r\n\r\nchangeset:   4588:2e7bcefd1187\r\nbranch:      keiser-buddy\r\ntag:         tip\r\nuser:        Mark Dalrymple <markd@borkware.com>\r\ndate:        Sat Jul 02 14:34:35 2016 -0400\r\nsummary:     thank you xcode for piddling on my xib file\r\n\r\nchangeset:   3979:d411d6249abb\r\nbranch:      md-verify-video\r\nparent:      3977:c1a63525cc39\r\nuser:        Mark Dalrymple <markd@borkware.com>\r\ndate:        Thu Feb 12 11:17:58 2015 -0500\r\nsummary:     xcode piddled on my xibs again\r\n\r\n... 5 non-piddle revisions ...\r\n\r\nchangeset:   3009:275b1916d02d\r\nuser:        Mark Dalrymple <markd@borkware.com>\r\ndate:        Tue Aug 27 17:33:58 2013 -0400\r\nsummary:     xcode piddled on it\r\n\r\nchangeset:   2998:b4990477498e\r\nuser:        Mark Dalrymple <markd@borkware.com>\r\ndate:        Mon Aug 26 20:31:43 2013 -0400\r\nsummary:     Remove the stink of Xcode 5 preventing it from opening in 4\r\n\r\n... 4 non-piddle revisions ...\r\n\r\nchangeset:   2746:491d1aac2b42\r\nuser:        Mark Dalrymple <markd@borkware.com>\r\ndate:        Sun Apr 21 20:35:49 2013 -0400\r\nsummary:     thank you xcode for piddling on these files for no good reason.
