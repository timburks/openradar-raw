    description: "Summary:\r\nToggling Show All Issues moves the blinking cursor's position, but not the insertion point.\r\n\r\nI was editing some code, had Show All Issues on.  I turned it off, and noticed my insertion point was blinking up a line.  This wasn't the actual insertion point - when I started typing, it went to where the cursor was.\r\n\r\nAttached is a video showing what happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be editing around a show-all-issues placard.\r\n2. Cursor to two or three lines below the placard\r\n3. Turn show-all-issues off\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. The insertion point and blinking cursor stay where they were\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. The blinking cursor moves, but not the insertion point.  They're disconnected until the next keystroke.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just never trust the insertion point, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'lies-cursor-lies.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
