    description: "Possibly a duplicate of rdar://26872644\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe version of xcodebuild distributed with Xcode 8 beta 3 exhibits a hanging behavior if its output is piped to another command while running a `build test` command.\r\n\r\nThis was not a problem with xcodebuild distributed with Xcode 7.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing Xcode 8 beta 3\r\n\r\nThe happy path:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iOS Single View project in Swift, including Unit Tests and UI Tests. In my example, I've called it \"Whatever\"\r\n2. On the command line, navigate to the directory where Whatever.xcodeproj is located.\r\n3. Run: `xcodebuild -scheme Whatever -project ./Whatever.xcodeproj -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<SIMULATOR_ID>' build test` substituting a simulator ID for your system\r\n4. Find that the simulator is launched, the tests run, the command exits, and control returns to the terminal\r\n\r\nThe sad path (starting in-place from step 3):\r\n\r\n3. Run: `xcodebuild -scheme Whatever -project ./Whatever.xcodeproj -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<SIMULATOR_ID>' build test | grep 'SUCCEEDED'` substituting a simulator ID for your system\r\n4. Find that a simulator is launched, the tests run, but the command never exits, and control does not return to the terminal.\r\n5. Quit the Simulator app, and find that the command exits and control returns to the terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to pipe the output of `xcodebuild build test` to another command without causing it to hang.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe example command hangs in the terminal after printing \"** TEST SUCCEEDED **\", never returning control to the terminal. Quitting the spawned Simulator.app allows the command to exit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6\r\nXcode 8 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6\r\nXcode 8 beta 3\r\nRunning in Terminal.app\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
