    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome apps offer multiple widgets. With iOS 10's affinity for them, they might choose to do this on purpose. I may prefer to have one used in my Today view (is it still called that?) and one in the 3D Touch menu. That way, a developer can provide widgets with cross-purposes and simpler design, like Apple does with iOS 10 widgets and is the preferred usage model for watchOS complications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI love the \"Up Next\" widget, so leave it in my Today view. (Is it still called that?) I don't need multiple of these, so I remove the \"Calendar\" widget from \"Add Widgets\" screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Calendar app shows the \"Calendar\" widget, or I can pick that widget in Settings in some way. I sometimes want the peek into my full day's schedule beyond the next event.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe widget used by 3D Touch-activating the homescreen icon isâ€¦ random. Alphabetical? inode number? Who knows.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5309d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnother good example: I want Maps Destinations in my Widgets but Maps Nearby in 3D Touch.\r\n\r\nIf this behavior exists already, it should be more obvious for a dolt like me. ;-)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB Verizon, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
