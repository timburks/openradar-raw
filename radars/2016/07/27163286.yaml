    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode loves to beep. LOVES to beep.  When you mismatch braces. When it can't find something in quick open.  When it can't \"jump to definition\".\r\n\r\nSounds drive me crackers.  I want to be able to play music from my Mac, but not if Xcode's going to beep on a regular basis.  It's also galling, working late at night, and if I forgot to mute the machine, getting a loud blasted BEEP shattering the darkness. In a room of 30 students, it can be cacophonous.\r\n\r\nI would love for a pref to turn off _ALL_ audible feedback.  Ya'll have given me some secret `default write` preferences to turn off the beeps from the editor on mismatched braces.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. look at Xcode slightly cross-eyed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. silence\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. it beeps at you.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nEvery Xcode since time began.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
