    description: "Summary:\r\nI have found the new Scribble feature in Messages unexpectedly useful for quick responding. I'd like this functionality in all text input triggered by `WKInterfaceController .presentTextInputControllerWithSuggestions(_:allowedInputMode:completion:)`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a (good) watch app for Twitter, such as Tweetbot or Twitterrific.\r\n2. Force-touch and select \"New Tweet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can pick between Scribble and Dictation like I can when replying to a message in Messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI'm forced to try and get Siri to understand about my joke about NSGestureRecognizer. (It's really good, though, I think you'd like it.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S5247t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther use cases:\r\n- Add new Reminder interface, without having to mangle, \"Hey Siri, add Radar colon watch message scribble to my Work list.\"\r\n- Could be used to drive a search UI for e.g., Music; such a palmOS-graffiti-like is used to drive search in my car.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs in any non-Messages app\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
