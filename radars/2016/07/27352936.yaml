    description: "Summary:\r\nThe JavaScript key up and down events are sent when the arrow keys are pressed on the iPad Pro keyboard, however all of the relevant properties of the KeyboardEvent object are either 0 or undefined. This means that it is not possible to identify which of the arrow keys was pressed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upload the attached HTML file to a web server and open it open an iPad Pro (either size) with the Apple iPad Pro keyboard cover attached*\r\n2. Observe that when pressing a letter or numeric key the key code shows correctly\r\n3. Observe that when pressing an arrow key the key code is unknown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyCode property would be the same as those when pressing arrow keys on a keyboard in Safari for OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe values are undefined or 0.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS, any version of Safari running on iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro (either size), with the Apple iPad Pro keyboard (again, either size). Bluetooth keyboards also have the same issue"
