    description: "Summary:\r\niCloud Keychain shares Accounts from other machines, including the modern Google OAuth flow, re-authenticating as necessary. In Sierra DP3, this re-auth process cannot be completed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in to my Mac running Sierra\r\n2. Wait for iCloud Keychain \"Turn on '<#google account#>' prompt.\r\n3. Hit \"Turn On\" button\r\n4. Log into Google through the modal in the new SysPrefs window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe OAuth process ends and my account is activated on this machine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter entering my 2FA credentials, the web view is disappears and account re-auth does not complete.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCould not figure out a workaround.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not occur on 10.11 (so it doesn't appear to be a token problem), and the sync still works on other Macs (so it doesn't appear to be an iCloud Keychain problem).\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
