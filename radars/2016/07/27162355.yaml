    description: "Summary:\r\nI did a swift 3 migration. All went well, but my issues navigator had a bunch of scary errors in it.  Is this something I need to be aware of? Did the migrator work? Did it crash? Are there link errors I need to fix now.\r\n\r\nNah, just leftovers.  A rebuild clears them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do a swift 3 migration\r\n2. Swift migrates\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. There is no step 3\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The issue navigator has a bunch of weird errors that I might need to evaluate. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just rebuild if you get errors that don't make sense, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bizarre-errors.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
