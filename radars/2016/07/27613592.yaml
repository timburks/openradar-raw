    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\nI opened the devices window to look at a device's logs.  When I tried to resize it with the obvious horizontal line (the one next to the content), nothing happens.  If I click and drag in the wide white box, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nMousing around, the cursor changed about 30 pixels higher.  Over an _invisible_ area.  And it's tiny - about two pixels tall.\r\n\r\nNot sure how we're expected to know that this random invisible area is actually the tool we need.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just try to predict where invisible UI is located, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'invisble-divider.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
