    description: "Summary:\r\nA view placed the Swift Playgrounds for iPad Live View does not perform as well as when the same view is placed in a native app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a view that does some complicated drawing. In my case, I was doing line drawing using SpriteKit.\r\n2. Place that view in an app and run on the iPad from Xcode.\r\n3. Place that view in a Playground and run in the Live View from the iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe performance of that view in the Playgrounds Live View would be comparable to having that view compiled into an app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Playground Live view was an order of magnitude slower.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHaving the Playground performance be comparable to the actual app is important because it would allow quick iterative testing to be done directly on the iPad.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTesting was done on a 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro."
