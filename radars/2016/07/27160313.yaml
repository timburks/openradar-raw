    description: "Summary:\r\nConverting to Swift 3.0 requires Xcode 8. Xcode 8 is still in beta. iTunes Connect does not allow apps built with beta software to be externally tested. Therefore, one cannot externally test an app that has been converted to Swift 3. (Even if you only target iOS 9.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an iOS app in Xcode 8.\r\n2. Convert the code to Swift 3.\r\n3. Archive the app and submit it to iTunes Connect.\r\n4. Mark the new build for External Testing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe external testers receive a notification and can download the app to help test.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message is shown: “External testing is not supported for builds that have been created with a beta version of Xcode or iOS.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode-beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis provides a huge blocker to Swift 3 early adopters. How are we expected to thoroughly test our app when we have to wait until the Xcode 8 GM to test externally?"
