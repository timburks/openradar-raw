        Summary:
        We used the app Monodraw to create an ASCII-Version of the navigation-scheme in our app and copied that as documentation into the source-code. In Xcode 7, that worked really well as the default-font is a true monospace font and the ASCII-“image” looks perfect. In Xcode 8, the new default-font “SF Mono Regular” destroys the image as it seems like that it is not a true monospace font.

        Overall, the new font is great and i would like to keep it instead of - as workaround - create an Xcode-scheme that uses the “old” font. It feels like a “design”-bug, as a monospace-font should render each and every character in the same width, shouldn’t it?

        I attached a zip that contains two screenshots, one from Xcode 7 and one from Xcode 8.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a wonderful chart with Monodraw and copy it into Xcode 8 and see how it will be destroyed evily.

        Expected Results:
        The default-font of Xcode 8 should be a true monospace-font.

        Actual Results:
        Nice ASCII-images are destroyed by the default-font of Xcode 8.

        Regression:
        Did not occur with the default-font of Xcode 7.
