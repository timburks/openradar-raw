    description: "Summary:\r\nvideo attached. Project attached.\r\n\r\nWhen I try doing on-demand completion (that is, using escape rather than having it in my face), it doesn't work reliably inside of a string interpolation.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows me trying to get \"hat.bounds\" (where hat is an NSBezierPath) to complete because I didn't remember the precise name (is it bounds? frame? rect?  splunge?)  It only gave me the option for \"color\", which isn't even a property of bezier paths.\r\n\r\n(obtw, I use black for all my syntax highlighting colors due to my vision correction.  Sourcekit is happily uncrashed.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try something like\r\n\r\nlet hat = NSBezierPath()\r\nprint(\"hat bounds = \\(hat. <escape>\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. Get a completion for various hattributes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. Get a single unrelated completion.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just do your completions on another line of code and then copy/paste in to the string interpolation, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'GrafDemo.zip' and 'no-completion-for-you.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
