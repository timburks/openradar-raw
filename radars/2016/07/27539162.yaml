    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\"Bedtime\" acts like an alarm, but isn't treated like one for snoozing. Additionally, Siri doesn't include it for \"Turn [on/off] all my alarms\" or \"Show me my alarms\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Bedtime in Clock\r\n2. Make some Sleepytime tea (this is a v. important part of reproducing)\r\n3. When the reminder comes up, hit \"I'm Going To Bed Now,\" lying through your teeth.\r\n4. At some point, get some rest.\r\n5. Wake up with the alarm caused by Bedtime\r\n6. Hit Snooze on the alarm\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can sate the Bedtime alarm from the lock screen without opening Clock and turning off Bedtime.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Bedtime alarm has no points for feedback, other than me throwing my poor phone across the room.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5309d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy sleeping-in self thanks you. My coworkers two hours later, however, do not.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB Verizon, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
