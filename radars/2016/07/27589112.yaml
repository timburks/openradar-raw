    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a notification pops up for a reminder triggered at a specific time, I completed it from the notification. I then saw it was still appearing on my iPhone’s lock screen, so I launched the Reminders app on my Mac and saw the reminder had not been completed there. Completing it in the app, it also completed on my other synced devices. I’ve had the same thing happen when completing reminders from the lock screen of my iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a reminder to go off at a particular time\r\n2. Click the “Complete” button on the notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification disappears, the reminder is marked as completed in the Mac app, and that completion syncs to all other iCloud-synced devices\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, aside from the notification being dismissed\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to effect the Reminders app on iOS as well"
