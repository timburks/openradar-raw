    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 8 (beta 1 or 2).\r\n2. Open an existing Xcode 7.3.1 project with storyboards.\r\n3. Open one of the existing storyboards.\r\n4. Xcode prompts to choose a device. Choose one.\r\n5. Show the File Inspector. Change the \"Opens In\" to Xcode 7.x.\r\n6. Xcode warns \"Saving for Xcode 7.x will close your document and data for Xcode 8.0 features will be removed.\". Click \"Save & Close\".\r\n7. Try to open the storyboard again. Xcode 8 will not allow you to open it unless you convert it again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to leave storyboards (and xibs) in Xcode 7 format, so I can still open them in Xcode 7 while we transition.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to leave the storyboard files in Xcode 7 format and edit in Xcode 8."
