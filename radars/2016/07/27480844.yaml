    description: "Summary:\r\nVideo and project file attached.\r\n\r\nXcode 7 used to let me quick-open the ProjectName-Swift.h generated header.  With Xcode8 I have to find a file that includes ProjectName-Swift.h and command-click it to open.\r\n\r\nEven with restarting Xcode, purging build folder, rebuilding, making sure everything compiles, no joy.\r\n\r\nIt worked in Xcode 7, but was flaky.  This is an actual quote from some iOS training materials I wrote:\r\n\r\n  &Xcode; can be pretty flaky. If you see an empty generated header, or\r\n  you're only seeing about 10 lines worth, or if you're seeing a pile of\r\n  Swift, or you're not seeing changes you've made to the Swift file\r\n  reflected in the generated header, you may need to successfully build\r\n  and run your project to see the correct version.  If you quick-open\r\n  an &Objective-C; header and get a generated Swift interface instead of\r\n  the actual header, quick-open the file again.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even now, trying that litany doesn't let me quick-open the file at all.\r\n\r\n(obtw, SourceKit has not crashed, I use black for all of my syntax colorization colors due to my vision correction)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Command-shift-o to get the quick-open dialog\r\n2. Enter in ${projectname}-Swift.h, for your version of project name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Get the generated header\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. You got nothin' . c.f. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73AhhdbMFj8&t=36s\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just find a file that includes it and jump through it there, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis worked (for the most part) in Xcode 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'GrafDemo.zip' and 'no-quickopen-for-you.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
