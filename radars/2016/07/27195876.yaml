        Summary:
        NSManagedObjects are KVC for the entity as defined in the model file, so methods are generated at runtime if theyâ€™re accessed. To expose these methods to the compiler, the obj-c code generation generates stubs like follows:

        @interface Event (CoreDataGeneratedAccessors)

        - (void)addNotesObject:(Note *)value;
        - (void)removeNotesObject:(Note *)value;
        - (void)addNotes:(NSSet<Note *> *)values;
        - (void)removeNotes:(NSSet<Note *> *)values;

        @end

        The runtime then provides the implementation. This behavior can be done in swift as well:

        extension Event {
            @NSManaged func addNotesObject(value: Note)
        }


        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a managed object entity with a to many relationship and look at the generated code.

        Expected Results:
        There should be KVC compliant mutation methods stubs generated.

        Actual Results:
        There are no KVC compliant mutation method stubs generated.

        Regression:
        This does not appear to be a regression.
