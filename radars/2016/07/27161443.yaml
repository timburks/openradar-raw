    description: "Summary:\r\nI have several purpose-built instances of the same face for different use cases. For instance, I have an instance of Modular in Red with no complications (just the time) that I use when I go to the movies theater, so as to not bother anybody else when I check the time. It'd make sense to call this face \"Movies,\" it's not just \"Modular\" to me; I have another \"Modular\" face that I use day-to-day\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new instance of the Modular face from the Face Gallery.\r\n2. Return to My Watch > My Faces.\r\n3. Tap \"Edit\" to reorder faces.\r\n4. Tap on one of the face instances.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike tapping on an Alarm in Edit mode of the Clock app, I'd expect a user-editable label for a face.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFaces can only be reordered or deleted from the Edit Faces page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S5247t)/iOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue only occurs if you like using faces and have many of them. :o)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
