    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you add a watchOS target to an app, the extension includes a \"Complications Group\" setting in the \"Complications Configuration\" section of Xcode. This was not mentioned in the WWDC talk introducing watchOS 2 complications, and I have been unable to find any information about it anywhere else. The setting is linked to an image asset group with sections for different complication types, but what are those images? What sizes should they be? Where are they used? Should they be in color or monochrome?\r\n\r\nWhile trying to figure out another issue, I looked at the documentation for CLKComplicationPrivacyBehaviorHideOnLockScreen. This was the one hint I could find anywhere: \"For circular, modular small, and utilitarian small complications, ClockKit displays the complication icon provided by your WatchKit extension.\" I suspected that might be where the \"Complications Group\" images were used, and some testing confirmed my suspicions.\r\n\r\nXcode gives an error if the wrong image sizes are used. This is the only place I've seen that makes it clear what icon sizes to use.\r\n\r\nI still have no idea if they should be color or monochrome. I can do some testing and see what looks good, but experience tells me that making assumptions based on the current implementation of something is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lack of documentation, I was able to find various sample projects from WWDC talks that included watchOS support. None of them used the \"Complications Group\" images at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search the documentation for \"Complications Group\", or just go through WWDC videos and sample code looking for any information about it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind some information explaining what the \"Complications Group\" is for, how those images are used, what sizes they should be, and whether they should be single color or full color.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is difficult to find any information at all without just resorting to trial and error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNo current documentation exists"
