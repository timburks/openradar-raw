    description: "Summary:\r\nI use an RTF file for my app's About Box contents.  I find it nicer to edit in a tool rather than hacking HTML or importing a markdown parser.\r\n\r\nXcode's RTF editor has 'paste' which preserves style on the clipboard.  That's not what I want (I'm pretty particular about fonts and formatting).  Other text editors have a \"paste and match style\". It'd be nice if Xcode's RTF editor did the same thing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy something to the clipboard that has style information (such as a license from Github)\r\n2. Edit an rtf file in xcode\r\n3. Paste in contents\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. because it's styled, and I don't want style I'd ordinarily do a \"paste and match style\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Weep because there's no \"paste and match style\". rend tunics.  wash teeth.  Then duck out to TextEdit to paste in the content\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso missing from Xcode 7 :-)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'paste-match-style.png' was successfully uploaded."
