    description: "Summary:\r\nThe WWDC badges only show the persons name on one side. 50% of the time, this side will not be facing out, so you can not see a persons name on their badge when meeting them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGreet several people with WWDC badges\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTheir respective names can be easily read on all of their badges\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTheir respective names can likely only be read on 50% of the badges\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn previous years there was a barcode on the \"back\" of the badge. In WWDC 2016, the barcode is no longer present (and some sort of wireless identification such as RFID is used instead). This should make it easy to show the same information on both sides of the badge."
