    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode seems to frequently pollute the build folder, leading to weird behavior, and lost time debugging, when cleaning the build folder makes the app work correctly.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing what I've seen fairly often in Xcode 7, and now in Xcode 8 - application behaves very strangely .  Given my litany of blame, I blame myself first before the tools.  I burn some time trying to debug.\r\n\r\nI then clean the build folder, and stuff magically works again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Program normally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. program builds normally. Program stays in a stable state\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Get a weird crash\r\n4. Debug said weird crash for awhile\r\n5. Doubt your sanity\r\n6. Perhaps bring in other people and burn their time\r\n7. Decide to purge the build folder\r\n8. Things magically work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just purge your build folder all the time, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappened all the time in Xcode 7.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'dead-chicken.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
