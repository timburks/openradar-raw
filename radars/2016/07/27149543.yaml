    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes my MainMenu.xib file (brand new project via Xcode8b1, but have seen this forever) is marked dirty, and never becomes clean\r\n\r\nMovie attached.\r\nproject attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. notice MainMenu.xib is dirty. \"oh, I better save this\"\r\n2. Save the file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. file is saved. Icon returns to normal.  Nothing out of the ordinary in the sidebar to attract my attention\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. file is saved.  Icon stays dimmed-and-dirty.  Now I can't stop looking at it because it's out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore it, or restart Xcode again, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nbeen seeing this for years.  I may have radar'd it back then, but I don't feel like checking.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'ol-dirty.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
