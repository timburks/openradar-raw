    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 *requires* a team to be set for a target before it can be built. The team information will be stored in the project file itself. It is possible to use the `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` build setting instead, but that still means the target is tied to a specific team.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is specially problematic for open source Swift projects. The project simply can’t have any team due its open source nature, but needs to be built from source each time due to Swift’s ABI instability.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to specify the team somewhere outside the project. A natural solution would be to be able to specify this in a scheme which can then be stored in workspace.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode without specifying the team (there’s no API for unsetting the team after it has been set)\r\n2. Make sure signing is turned on (e.g. build for iOS device)\r\n3. Build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project should build without it being tied to a specific team\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode stops the build until a team is specified.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1 and 2"
