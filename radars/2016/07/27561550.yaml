    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if an app would like to upload a single photo that you've taken from your photo library, you must grant it access to your entire photo library. This leads to applications having unnecessary access to your photo library, when all the user really wanted to do was upload a single photo, or group of photos.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an app where users can upload photos to your online service\n2) Attempt to access a single photo\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is differentiation between accessing a single photo for upload vs access all the users photos.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps gain unnecessary access to the user's entire photo library.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
