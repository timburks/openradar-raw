    description: "Summary:\r\nAttached is a movie that shows to drawing glitches.  The first happens at the beginning when going out of the autolayout corrections panel.  - a weird blue blob.\r\n\r\nThe second occurs about 0:50 in to it (so you can see what I was doing to cause it - but feel free to jump there.)  The jump bar icons for the xib file get shown as dirty, but the same icon over in the file navigator stays clean.  Even multiple saves don't clear the dirty flag.\r\n\r\nAlmost the opposite of rdar://27149543 - Xcode8 - MainMenu.xib file permanently dirty, even after saving repeatedly.  Would be happy if they agreed with reality :-)\r\n\r\nAlso attached the pr√∂ject in case it'd be useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore any dirty flags because they can't be trusted, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'ol-dirtay.mov' were successfully uploaded."
