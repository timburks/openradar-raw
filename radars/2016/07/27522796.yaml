        When the keyboard is shown in an iMessage extension, the chat message text field on top of the keyboard is not animated along with the keyboard but pops into place non-animated. The keyboard dismiss animation is fine, however.

        Please see the attached screencast of the images sample extension. It doesn't matter if the presentationStyle changes from compact to expanded or if it is already expanded.
