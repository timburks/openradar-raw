        Summary:
        When developing iOS apps with the simulator there’s no way to use my Mac’s camera to take photos or video. This means certain types of applications simply can’t be developed and tested in the simulator.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Run an app that uses the camera in the iOS Simulator.
        2. Try to capture photos or video in the app.

        Expected Results:
        The simulator bridges my Mac’s camera and allows me to capture photos and video, similar to what happens with my Mac’s keyboard.

        Actual Results:
        No camera is supported by the simulator.

        Notes:
        I realize this isn’t a particularly novel idea but eventually this should be a thing if at all possible. It would be pretty glorious.
