    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently when using playgrounds, they Just Don't Work - they accept code edits and what not, but not rebuild or re-run, or even re-evaluate errors.\r\n\r\nattached is a video showing a playground that had an error, which was fixed, and for nearly a full minute after that, refused attempts to get it to acknowledge that yes there's new code.\r\n\r\nThe video and playground in question are attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just thrash around adding and removing code, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'playgrounded.mp4' and 'njn34jn3j45n34jn53j5.playground.zip' were successfully uploaded."
