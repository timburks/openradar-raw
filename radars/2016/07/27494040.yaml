        Summary:
        On iOS 10, Today widgets are now presented along with shortcut items when 3D Touch is applied to home screen icon of an app. Application shortcuts support dragging the finger and releasing to select a shortcut item, but Today widgets do not.

        Today widgets are currently presented first - meaning closer to the initial 3D touch location – and any of the application’s shortcut items are presented further away from the initial touch.  Depending on where the icon is located on the screen, this could be above or below those shortcuts.

        Since many widgets are non interactive, and those that do provide buttons require the user to release the initial 3D touch and tap again to trigger an action, it makes more sense to flip the current presentation and present the application’s shortcut items closer to the initial touch location, allowing less distance to be traversed to release and trigger the shortcut in a single tap.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Use 3D Touch to tap on home screen icon of an app which provides a Today widget and application shortcut items.
        - Drag finger to shortcut item.
        - Release to trigger item.
