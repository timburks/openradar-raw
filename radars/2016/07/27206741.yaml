    description: "Summary:\r\nIf UITextInput’s “keyboardAppearance” property is set using “appearance()” to UITextView and UISearchBar classes, an exception is thrown without description, saying “Please file a radar on UIKit if you see this assertion.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Add “UITextView.appearance().keyboardAppearance = .Dark” wherever in the code\r\n2 - Add a UITextView to a view controller\r\n3 - Open the view controller\r\n4 - The exception is thrown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no errors and the UITextView and/or UISearchBar keyboard should be the expected appearance\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn exception is thrown with the attached stack trace.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI was always able to reproduce it, including in new, clean projects running in the Simulator with iOS 9.3 with Xcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve attached the stack trace and an example project. A workaround is possible by setting the desired keyboard appearance to each instance of UITextView or UISearchBar without using “appearance()”"
