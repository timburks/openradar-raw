    description: |-
        A screenshot taken on a Display P3 screen has a sRGB profile embedded. It should be Display P3 (so things like Photoshop can handle it correctly.)

        To reproduce, take a screenshot, then use Photos to get it onto your Mac. When you export the original file, it shows that the file is an 8-bit PNG with a sRGB profile. A sample is attached.
