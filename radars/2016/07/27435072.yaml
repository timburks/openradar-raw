    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UIViewController is presented modally from another UIViewController, it is unable to hide or otherwise affect the status bar. If the presented view controller returns \"true\" from prefersStatusBarHidden() this has no effect. Prior to iOS 9 this worked fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app which presents a 2nd view controller modally (presentViewController(animated:, completion:)).\r\n2. In the 2nd VC implement prefersStatusBarHidden() so that it always returns true\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the 2nd VC is presented, the status bar should be hidden.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the 2nd VC is presented the status bar remains unchanged\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem prior to iOS 10.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround is for the presenting VC to hide the status bar before it presents the 2nd VC, which is not always an ideal way to do things."
