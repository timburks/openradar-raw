    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes the simulator starts off in landscape mode (window is wider than taller), but the simulator things it's in portrait mode (window is taller than wider), so is rotated on the screen.  I have to rotate it one click and back to make it useful\r\n\r\nscreenshot attached\r\nvideo attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. always run the simulator in landscape mode\r\n2. Somehow reboot the simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Simulator starts out in landscape mode.  Or simulator resets to portrait mode.\r\n4. App displays normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. App window is landscape.  Simulator things it's protrait.\r\n4. have to twist your head to look at the app\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just rotate the simulator one click andback, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-07-02 at 2.56.36 PM.png' and 'rotated-simulator.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
