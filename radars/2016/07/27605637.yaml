        Summary:
        A method that returns nil using the ?:-operator, where the alternative-return-value is a call-expression, does not detect that the first return-value is the nil-literal.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the attached project and start the analyzer in Xcode 8b3.

        Expected Results:
        The analyzer should show a warning in line 29 that nil is being returned.

        Actual Results:
        The analyzer finds no issue.

        Regression:
        -
