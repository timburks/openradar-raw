        Summary:
        Safari Reader looks bad, on Mac and iOS, on pages like this one: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/fallen.html

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Visit http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/fallen.html on iOS or Mac Safari.
        2. Activate Safari Reader.

        Expected Results:
        The page becomes easier to read.

        Actual Results:
        The formatting is fine, but before you can get to the actual page content, there’s a giant ugly gradient image. I don’t even see where on the page it’s coming from. Some shadow or something. See attached screenshot.

        Regression:
        Unknown
