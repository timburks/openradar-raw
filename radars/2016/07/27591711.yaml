    description: "Area:\r\nTouchID\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an app prompts for Touch ID, pressing the home button dismisses the prompt and treats it as canceled. The app doesn't get backgrounded though, so it's a pretty confusing behavior for users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get prompted for Touch ID (within a 3rd party app)\r\n2. Press home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither:\r\nA) Pressing the home button backgrounds the app instead of simply dismissing the prompt\r\nOr:\r\nB) Pressing the home button while the Touch ID prompt is up has no effect if the fingerprint is recognized at the same time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Touch ID prompt is dismissed, and the app is told that the user cancelled the prompt, even though they may not have intended to (some users think that the only way you can do Touch ID is to press the button at the same time, and many users, including myself, pretty frequently accidentally press it while doing Touch ID verification).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll Touch ID enabled devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
