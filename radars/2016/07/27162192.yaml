    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes when I quit Xcode, I get a bug reporter crash in my face.\r\n\r\nattached is the crash log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Quit Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. Xcode quits\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just dismiss the crash dialog and next time xcode starts tell it to not open windows, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis particular time I had turned on live issues, with a playground open, and quit for it to take effect.  c.f. rdar://27162167\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'crash-log.txt' was successfully uploaded."
