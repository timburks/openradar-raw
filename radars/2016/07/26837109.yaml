    description: "Area:\r\nCellular Service (Calls / Data)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you install more than one app from my vendor \"Tobit.Software\" and disable \"Cellular\" for the first installed app, all apps with the same build version lose access to cellular internet (WLAN disabled). \r\nFor all apps, except the one which was installed first, \"Cellular\" settings are enabled. Despite enabled cellular connection, i can see following error in device log:\r\n\r\n <Error>: tcp_connection_handle_connect_conditions_bad 81 failed: 2 - Path was denied by NECP policy\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this issue with adhoc or debug builds. It just happens with apps installed from App Store.\r\n\r\nSome example apps:\r\nTobit.Software (Bundle ID: com.tobit.slitte.60038-22141)\r\nBamboo! (Bundle ID: com.tobit.slitte.59140-09519)\r\nStattAlm (com.tobit.slitte.59770-03476)\r\noffsite (com.tobit.slitte.59141-06162)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Install \"Tobit.Software\" app (https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/tobit.software/id596750508?mt=8)\r\n2. Open app \"Tobit.Software\" and leave app\r\n3. Disable WLAN\r\n4. Disable \"Cellular\" for \"Tobit.Software\" \r\n5. Open app \"Tobit.Software\" again\r\n6. Install second app from vendor Tobit.Software - for example \"BamBoo!\" (https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/bamboo!/id542655144?mt=8) \r\n7. Open second app \"Bamboo!\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccess to cellular for second app \"Bamboo!\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo internet access for app \"Bamboo!\". \r\n\r\nAll TCP connections fail, with following error:\r\n<Error>: tcp_connection_handle_connect_conditions_bad 81 failed: 2 - Path was denied by NECP policy\r\n\r\nApp gains internet connection, if you enable \"Cellular\" for first app (i.e \"Tobit.Software\"). \r\nChanging setting for second app \"Bamboo!\", like disabling/enabling has no effect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 / Both app with build version 5.206\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64GB, O2 Germany"
