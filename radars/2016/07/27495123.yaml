        Summary:
        No audio—system or user—is played through the headphones after the device wakes up.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Put device to sleep
        2. Unplug headphones
        3. Wake up device
        4. Plug in headphones
        5. Start iTunes playback

        Expected Results:
        Sound from music playing in iTunes is heard

        Actual Results:
        No sound is heard until headphones are unplugged while device is awake, then plugged back in.

        Regression:
        Unknown. Started with this laptop which came with, I believe, 10.11.3.

        Notes:
        Workaround is to start playback, unplug headphones, plug headphones back in. Reliable but obnoxious.
