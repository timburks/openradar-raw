    description: "I've watched the WWDC video that explains the reasoning behind the need for \"app translocation\" or \"Gatekeeper Path Randomization\".\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, it protects the user from falling prey to modifications to resources (data files) that are outside of the downloaded app's bundle, as those files would not be protected by code signing.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand, though, is why this protection is also applied to zip files that contain ONLY a signed app bundle and NO external files outside of it.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if a single app is delivered as a zip file, which is the cast for many if not the majority of apps, then they should not need to be translocated at all. And since translocation causes a lot of problems for apps (e.g. slower launch, troubles with self-moving to Apps folder, inability of self-adding to Login Items), why don't you stop enforcing translocation where it's not needed, saving us developers a lot of grief?"
