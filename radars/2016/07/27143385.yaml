    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to get help on array's removeFirst() method - Xcode gives me nothing with quick look or \"look up in documentation\", until I actually go look in the documentation.\r\n\r\nOther things (Like String.hasPrefix) work fine.\r\n\r\nVideo attached\r\nproject attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Call removeFirst on an array of strings\r\n2. Try to get quick help\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. get quick help\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. you got nothin'\r\n\r\nSeems to be random what is good, and what's broken.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just always search the docs and ignore quickLook, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'docs-broken.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
