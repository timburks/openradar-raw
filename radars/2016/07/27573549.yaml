    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie showing the problem (including a slow-motion showing the problem in detail).\r\n\r\nWhen the quick help inspector goes to display text, it shows up at the bottom of the navigator first, then is redrawn at the top, leading to a distracting / amateur-looking visual flicker.\r\n\r\nProbably related to rdar://27248509 - Quick Help Inspector flashes like a strobe light while typing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just take some aspirin for the flicker-induced headache, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'help-text-double-dragon.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
