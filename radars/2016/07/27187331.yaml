Begin typing “the contact email address for your Apple ID” into the Search field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail searches my messages for “the contact email address for your Apple ID”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSomewhere around when I’m typing “your Apple,” mail Crashes. This also happens when I paste the string into the search field.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMost searches don’t crash Mail - just this one. I’ve reproduced this on two machines. The one in the screen recording has three Gmail accounts and one iCloud account. Also reproduced it on a machine with two of the gmail accounts from the other machine, and no others.\r\n\r\nAttached screen recording also uploaded to http://cl.ly/gdVr"
