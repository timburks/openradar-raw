    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached video.  I did a checkout master and git pull to update my build tree.  Xcode said \"d00d u changed the world underneath me\" (which is understandable), and then it decided to collapse all my open groups.\r\n\r\nXcode decides randomly to collapse everything, which can be a real pain. For this trivial project, it's not too bad.  For another project I have with hundreds of files and a dozen or so groups, nested (screenshot attached), when Xcode decides to collapse all the things (usually after a quit and restart to fix it of numerous other problems), it can take a while to drill down to where I was working.  This project uses subversion, so it's not a git thing, and not necessarily a merge and update thing, but I managed to catch evidence of it happening, so here it is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just never use the file navigator, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'collapsarama.mp4' and 'Screen Shot 2016-07-31 at 6.39.38 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
