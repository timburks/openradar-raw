    description: "Messages extensions can show a conversation participants name on a chat bubble in the transcript by using the participant identifier string prefixed with a $ in the message template layout or message summary text.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no equivalent to this within the message extension view controller, either in compact or expanded presentation styles. It is very desirable to be able to show the names of your friends within the extension, not just within the chat transcript."
