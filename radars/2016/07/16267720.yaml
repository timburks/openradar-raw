    description: "Summary:\r\nFor 64 & 32-bit compatible code, all CGFloat values have to be explicitly qualified with (CGFloat) to please the compiler. For example, 0.1 is double so should be the same as CGFloat under 64-bit, but Xcode will complain when compiling 64 & 32-bit universal binary:\r\nImplicit conversion loses floating-point precision: 'double' to 'CGFloat' (aka 'float')\r\n\r\nCLANG_WARN_SUSPICIOUS_IMPLICIT_CONVERSION can be used but it covers many other types of conversion warnings which are actually very useful and should not be suppressed. So a finer-grained flag for suppressing this warning is much needed.\r\n\r\nCode: http://cl.ly/3q3w321d4024"
