    description: "When using any animated png (.apng) file as the image for a MSSticker, iMessage does not display the sticker correctly.  \r\nWhen the iMessage app first loads and you tap the .apng sticker nothing happens.  The only thing that works is peeling the sticker and dragging it.  When you let go of the sticker it doesn't stick to any existing message.  Then after dragging, when you tap the .apng sticker it adds an empty file icon into the text field.  These steps are documented in the attached apng.mov file.  The project is also attached.  These results are from running on the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached Xcode iMessage project.  When the iMessage app loads, tap the first sticker, nothing happens.\r\nPeel the sticker and it drags around but won't stick to any messages.\r\nTapping the first sticker again places and empty file icon in the text field.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnimated .apng stickers should work just like animated .gif work.  The second sticker is the working .gif.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.apng stickers do not work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5297c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are 2 files.  An apng.mov showing the .apng not working and the second file MessageStickers.zip is the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus 64GB Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'apng.mov' and 'MessageStickers.zip' were successfully uploaded."
