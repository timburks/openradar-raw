    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a zip file contains entries that describe a folder instead of a file, they cannot be expanded with OSX's standard tool for this task.\r\n\r\nThat is a bug because there's good reasons to include dir entries in a zip file, i.e. to specify custom attributes on them, such as permissions. And it happens.\r\n\r\nAlso, the pkzip standard that ditto should follow allows this (see below). So, ditto fails to adhere to the standard and is causing grief for users, forcing them to search for other tools.\r\n\r\nAttached is an example zip file that won't uncompress. In fact, that's the official zlib source code, which is the base for the zip format. Not being able to unpack this is a bit ironic, isn't it?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.5, 10.12 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt has been reported at least once before (rdar://8769517), but that earlier report fails to explain why this is a bug in ditto.\r\n\r\nWhen I reported this issue to Mark Adler last week, he suggested to report this to Apple, so I do this now. Mark Adler is the original zip tool autor. He understands this best and he agrees this is a bug in ditto.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you need an engineer for this, I'm available (I've written my own zip code in the past, not built on the variously available open source solutions that are already available, so I'm a bit of an expert on this, too).\r\n\r\n--- added for openradar ---\r\n\r\nThe file can be downloaded here: http://files.tempel.org/zlib/rdar_27398797/zlib128-dll.zip\r\nThis is the same file as it was offered on zlib.org until mid-July, when it was replaced with a version that doesn't upset Apple's Unarchiver any more."
