    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a polish thing, but noticed it with a brand new project.\r\n\r\nIt's an ipad-only project.  Went to the storyboard to lay out my ipad UI in an ipad environment.  The storyboard by defaults opens as a phone.\r\n\r\nI think it should initially open as ipad because that's the form factor i'm going to be designing stuff in.  It won't be until later, or never, that I'll be wanting to see stuff in a compact form that would necessitate visiting the phone sizes.\r\n\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new project from the default template.  For devices choose \"device only\"\r\n2. Open the storyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Storyboard opens ipad-style - it is an ipad-only project after all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Storyboard opens with iphone-size VCs\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIn Xcode7, the storyboard initially is populated with ipad-sized view controllers.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'storyboard-default.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
