    description: "Summary:\r\nJust a visual glitch.  See attached movie. \r\n\r\nI wanted to copy the signature of this method into some training materials I'm writing.  I couldn't get the selection started at all. Then I noticed if I click a line lower than I expected, the selection would start working.\r\n\r\nYou can see how the selection is not tracking the mouse.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just click randomly til stuff selects, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'click-offsides.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
