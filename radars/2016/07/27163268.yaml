    description: "Summary:\r\nI was wanting to select a single line of code, so I triple-clicked it.\r\n\r\nXcode decided to select it, and the next line of code.\r\n\r\nAnother line selected correctly with triple-clicking.\r\n\r\nNo difference in the newline characters in the source file.  If I remove the newline between the two lines and replace it with an identical newline, it works ok.\r\n\r\nundoing restores the bad behavior.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing the problem.\r\nattached is a screen shot of the hexdump showing the identical newlines throughout the file \r\nattached is the project showing the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just avoid selecting lines or getting used to editing out chunks of the selection, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-07-04 at 6.13.07 PM.png', 'selection-wtf.mp4' and 'ObjCInterop.zip' were successfully uploaded."
