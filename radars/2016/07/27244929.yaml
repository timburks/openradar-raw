    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen previewing a track if you use the back swipe gesture but cancel after dragging slightly, the segmented control which is only supposed to be shown on the list view is shown on the album view. Screenshot shows the result of the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes Store\r\n2. On the right of the \"New Music\" label, tap \"See All>\"\r\n3. Note the segmented control that appears in the nav bar, then tap the first album to go into the album view.\r\n4. Tap the first track to preview it.\r\n5. Use the back swipe gesture to navigate back but hold the gesture, notice the segmented control appear.\r\n6. Let go of the gesture so you stay on the album view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should not be a segmented control on this view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe segmented control with \"Name\", \"Release Date\" an \"Featured\" appears in the album view when it is only relevant to the previous view that showed the list of albums.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 2 14A5297c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso present on iOS 9, and on iOS 9 there can be other glitches related to the preview playing bar when using the back swipe rather than tap back.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 6G\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-07-08 at 14.48.34.png' was successfully uploaded."
