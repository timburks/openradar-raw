    description: "Summary:\r\nHappily working along, and Xcode decided to stop running things in the simulator. Tried restarting the simulator and clearing the build folder, but still won't run.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing my typical flailing around.\r\n\r\nQuitting and restarting Xcode did unwedge it.  When it restarted, it opened the wrong projects :-(  And when I reopened my project of interest, it had collapsed all my open groups :-(\r\n\r\nAttached are all the mentions of Xcode in Console.app when doing a log search.  It goes back 40 minutes prior to this happening.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just restart Xcode all the time, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'invalid-device-state.mp4' and 'xcode-logs.log' were successfully uploaded."
