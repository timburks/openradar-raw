    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://26954460\r\n\r\nPeter Steinberger23-Jun-2016 00:28 AM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere's been some confusion if *creating* UIImage objects from background thread is safe. The documentation mentions usage, but this does not necessarily mean that objects can be *created* on background threads. And there was a race condition in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/issues/2572#issuecomment-227895102\r\n\r\nIt contains sample code as well (also attached here). This seems to be fixed in iOS 10 (both via testing and my research) BUT the documentation is unclear about it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should be clearly documented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDocumentation is too vague\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2/10b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.3.1/8b1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIImageWithDataMultithreaded.zip' was successfully uploaded."
