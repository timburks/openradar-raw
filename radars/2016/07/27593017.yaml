        Summary:
        As part of the OS X setup process, the user chooses whether or not to send usage and analytics data to Apple. I propose removing the “to Apple” part, and making the preference available to all applications. It’s a less-than-ideal experience for new users to have to opt into privacy settings like that with each new app. It would be better to use the global setting, but give apps the ability to expose UI to override it for their particular apps.
