        Summary:
        Due dates set after snoozing an alarm can’t be removed

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a reminder (either on the Mac or on an iOS device) and set a date to be reminded at
        - When the alarm fires, snooze it (either using the Mac or the iOS device)
        - A due date gets set automatically (the alarm time gets shifted by 5/15 minutes and the due date gets set at the original alarm time)

        Expected Results:
        Users should be able to remove the due date using the Mac’s Reminders app.

        Actual Results:
        The Reminders app doesn’t have a checkbox for the due date field like it has one for the “On a Day” field. Users can’t remove the due date using the Mac.

        Regression:
        As shown in the screenshots in this blog post http://scribnasium.com/2013/10/ios-7-reminders-remove-due-date/ in Mavericks (I guess: the post is about 2 years old) the Reminders app had a checkbox to remove the due date.

        Notes:
        Users can remove the due date only by toggling on and off again the “Remind me on a day” setting on the iOS app.
