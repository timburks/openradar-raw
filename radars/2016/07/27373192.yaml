    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI think the new emergency SOS feature is a great idea, and I completely understand why it needs to be extremely simple to access.\r\n\r\nAlas, at least for those of us with little ones, it's a little *too* easy to access, as evidenced by my unexpected conversation with the Seattle Police yesterday.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is for Apple to add an option to disable the SOS feature entirely.\r\n\r\nI have already disabled \"Press and Hold for SOS\". But this does not appear to be sufficient: my daughter has discovered that, even when my watch is locked, long-pressing the side button brings up a screen with sliders for \"Power Off\", \"Medical ID\", and \"Emergency SOS.\" She has already powered off my watch from that screen, so it's only a matter of time before I have another conversation with the Seattle PD.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have a watch running watchOS 3\r\n2. Have a curious little daughter\r\n3. Wait a while\r\n4. Be embarrassed and remorseful when Seattle PD is rightfully scolding you.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo unintended 911 calls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAt least one unintended 911 call."
