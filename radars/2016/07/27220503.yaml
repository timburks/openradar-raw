        Summary:
        When editing a core data model file, the editor frequently breaks. The main pain continues to operate as expected, but the inspector pane does not update when different attributes are selected. It appears to work, but when the code generation occurs, none of the changes are taken into account. Closing the window and re-opening the model file results in the changes being discarded.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I have not found concrete reproduction steps, however it appears to occur when adding new attributes the most often. I’ll have the data model inspector pane selected, and create a new attribute. When I build the data model inspector focuses on the Entity, and then when I select future attributes nothing happens.

        Expected Results:
        The pane always follows the attribute selection and changes are always persisted.

        Actual Results:
        The pane stopped working and my modifications were lost.

        Regression:
        This is a regression from previous versions of Xcode (at least I’ve never seen this behavior before.)
