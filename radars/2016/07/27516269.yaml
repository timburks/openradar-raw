    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing a UIRefreshControl with custom tintColor (blue) in a UITableViewController inside a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nIf -[UIRefreshControl beginRefreshing] is called on viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear, the table's content offset is changed to show the refresh control but the view is blank, the refresh control does not show.\r\n\r\nIf called from viewDidAppear, the table's content offset is unchanged. A slight scroll up reveals the refresh control, but it has the default black tintColor. After manually refreshing it the tintColor is correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project and tap on the appropriated buttons.\r\n\r\nOn the viewDidAppear option, scroll up very slightly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf called from viewDidAppear and programmatically changing the table's content offset, the refresh control appears and has the desired tintColor.\r\n\r\nThis should be the behavior wether beginRefreshing is called from viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear or viewDidAppear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nrefreshControl appears blank or doesn't appear at all\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5309d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug also occurs when building with the iOS 9 SDK.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64gb\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'RefreshControlBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JotaMelo/iOS10RefreshControlBug"
