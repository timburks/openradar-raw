    description: "Summary:\r\nAttached is a video showing the problem.\r\nAttached is the project file.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - I outdented some incorrect code,  and indented it back.  The line of code with a legitimate error had a red-error-sigil courtesy of Live Issues.  After outdenting and indenting, the error sigil turned disabled-gray, and then disappeared, making me think that my incorrect code suddenly is correct now.\r\n\r\nI outdent code (with command-[) before copying it into our Big Nerd Ranch course materials  because the extra level of indentation of the average swift function isn't useful in print - just four wasted columns that we can otherwise use.\r\n\r\nSo I shifted-over this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @IBAction func startObserving() {\r\n        guard progress == nil else {\r\n            // disallow multiple concurrent progress objects\r\n            return\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        progress = Progress(totalUnitCount: 30)\r\n        swift.watchProgress(progress)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n'swift.watchProgress(_: Progress)` doesn't exist yet. So this is erroneous code.\r\n\r\nIn the process of outdenting it, copying it, and re-indenting. I noticed the error sigil disappearing.  It happened reliably enough (about 9 times out of 10) I started up screen flow to catch evidence of the editor losings its mind.  The video shows a successful identification of the error, and then a disappearance of the error signs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt's one of those \"have to use Xcode for a while before it loses its mind\" things. Quitting Xcode and re-running it doesn't show the problem, so there's something deep in the editor stuff that's going wrong, as witnessed by the evidence here.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just scratch your head and restart Xcode, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bizarre-error-disappearance.mp4' and 'ObjCInterop.zip' were successfully uploaded."
