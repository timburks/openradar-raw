    description: "Summary:\r\nI am experiencing a bug that causes an endless spinning / spinner hang at restart or shut down if I have EVER connected to another Mac via SMB (cmd+K, smb://foo/bar) during that session\r\n\r\n▪︎ The critical difference seems to be SMB3.0, SMB2 or CIFS mounts do not trigger the bug\r\n\r\n▪︎ If you simply CONNECT but do not actually attach to any shares, the bug will not manifest\r\n\r\n▪︎ Disconnecting the share before restarting does not fix the problem\r\n\r\n▪︎ Starting up in SAFE MODE (holding shift) does NOT avoid the problem\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. connect from Mac #1 (running ElCap 10.11.x) to Mac #2 (also running ElCap 10.11.x) via smb://mac2/share\r\n\r\n2. attach and browse a shared folder\r\n\r\n3. try to restart Mac #1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac should restart cleanly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen turns black with a white \"spinner\" in the middle, which will stay there until the end of time. I have left it there for 8+ hours (overnight) and it never stops. The only way out at this point it to hold down the power button until the Mac shuts off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested with OS X 10.11.1, 10.11.2, 10.11.3, 10.11.4, 10.11.5 and 10.11.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have other SMB3.0 servers (Synology NAS, Windows 2012 server) and connecting to those does NOT cause the bug to trigger. It only seems to happen when connecting to another MAC"
