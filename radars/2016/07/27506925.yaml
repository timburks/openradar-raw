        Summary:
        While developing a iMessage app, it might make sense to link against an embedded dynamic framework, such as when using 3rd party code. Unfortunately, if you’re developing a standalone iMessage application without an associated iOS app, there is no way to embed the framework in the app bundle, making it impossible to use.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Create new Xcode project
        2) Select iMessage App template, and finish setting up
        3) Add iOS Dynamic Framework target
        4) Attempt to use said framework from iMessage app

        Expected Results:
        You are able to use the framework.

        Actual Results:
        App crashes with “dyld: Library not loaded:”, as the framework is not embedded in the application.

        Regression:
        This is not an issue when there is an iOS app target as well, since that app can embed the framework.

        Notes:
        I’ve attached a very simple Xcode project to demonstrate this issue. Just build + run on device (NOT simulator). Thank you!
