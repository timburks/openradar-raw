    description: "Summary:\r\nIn-app settings are common items for a navigation bar or toolbar, but there's no system item for it. It would make sense for iOS to include one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create your settings UI\r\n2. Create a bar item to open that view controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe system item UIBarButtonSystemItemSettings exists and provides exactly what is needed. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not exist, and the developer must find or make a settings glyph. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 14A527c\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
