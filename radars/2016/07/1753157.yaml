    description: "In the middle of doing something on my late 2012 Mac mini, severe graphical issues occur. Thick lines appear across my two screens, sometimes with other smaller lines within them. Occasionally, the lines flash in and out as well.\r\n\r\nI can get it to go away most of the time by dragging a window over the affected area, however, sometimes this does not work, and I need to restart the computer to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs multiple times per day. I’m not entirely sure how provide steps to reproduce this because it’s so random, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThis bug did not occur on macOS Developer Preview 1 or OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan.\r\n\r\nSide note: A bug similar to this occurs on my early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro — at startup, before displaying the login screen, the screen flashes with a few black lines then proceeds to the login screen. This does not occur on my Mac mini, however."
