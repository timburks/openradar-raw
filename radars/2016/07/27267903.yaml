    description: "I'd like tvOS games to be able to provide custom button images for use in Remote.app on iPhone when Remote.app is in game controller mode.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, game controller mode looks like this image: http://i.imgur.com/6NkUoNj.png , which is not very user friendly. Games have to provide extra instructions for users to let them know that \"Select\" is the same as clicking the Siri remote, that the Play/Pause button does not actually pause/unpause the game but instead functions as a normal game controller button, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I am proposing that games be allowed to provide an image asset pack that contains two images (each at @2x and @3x resolution) for use as buttons in Remote.app. That way the button's intended use in the game can be much more clear, and provide an overall better user experience.\r\n\r\nThat way, the Remote.app game controller screen would instead look like the image at http://i.imgur.com/IIjZ2dL.png\r\n\r\nThe name of the image asset pack can be specified in the game's Info.plist, and Remote.app can transfer the appropriate images when it connects to the game as a controller.\r\n\r\nAs a further enhancement, tvOS games could optionally provide more than one image asset pack for Remote.app to use, and switch between them programmatically at run time. This would allow games to specify a set of button images for use in menus, for when a game has different play modes (such as move/explore and then a separate combat mode), etc.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think it would be an extremely useful feature/enhancement if tvOS games could make Remote.app on iPhone look like the image at http://i.imgur.com/IIjZ2dL.png instead of its current button labels by providing custom image assets."
