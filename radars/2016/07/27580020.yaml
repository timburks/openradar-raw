        Summary:
        The majority of UIKit APIâ€™s dealing with attributes for NSAttributedString use [String: AnyObject]. UISegmentControl uses [NSObject: AnyObject]. This forces a bunch of unfortunate casting

            @available(iOS 5.0, *)
            public func setTitleTextAttributes(attributes: [NSObject : AnyObject]?, forState state: UIControlState)
            @available(iOS 5.0, *)
            public func titleTextAttributesForState(state: UIControlState) -> [NSObject : AnyObject]?

        Steps to Reproduce:


        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
