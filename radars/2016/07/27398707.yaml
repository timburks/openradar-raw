    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iBooks for Mac indicates that there is an update to an existing e-book, it is impossible to know what changed, and whether it is worth re-reading all or part of that item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click on the Download item _when there are items pending update_.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect some link to release notes for that change that indicate which part of the book has changed, whether it is just metadata, images, or text. Also, there is no way to know if one's notes have been affected by the change.\r\n\r\nI would further expect a tool to compare the new version with the current version.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible, in case of doing references, to get the exact version for which a note was made.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust an update button that, given the lack of knowledge of what the update entails, should not exist, and have updates happen automatically.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niBooks for Mac 1.5\r\nMac OS X 10.11.5"
