    description: "The “swipe between pages” feature allows a long swipe left or right to move back and forward in a web browser’s history, similar to clicking the back and forward buttons in the browser’s toolbar. This works in both Chrome and Safari. This feature works with Magic Mice, Magic Trackpads, and laptop trackpads.\r\n\r\nWhen using a Magic Mouse, a checkbox in System Preferences:Mouse:More Gestures allows control of this feature. By turning “Swipe between pages” off (it defaults to on), the feature can be disabled.\r\n\r\nIn macOS 10.12dp1, this checkbox has no effect in Safari or Chrome. Whether it’s enabled or disabled, the swipe feature is always enabled in both these browsers.\r\n\r\nIn previous OS versions, when the checkbox is unchecked, the swipe feature is properly disabled.\r\n\r\nI have tested with the original Magic Mouse and the Magic Mouse 2. I have not tested with a trackpad on 10.12dp1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Configuration: macOS 10.12dp1 16A201w, Magic Mouse 2.\r\n1. Open System Preferences.\r\n2. Open the Mouse preference pane.\r\n3. Choose the More Gestures tab.\r\n4. Uncheck the “Swipe between pages” checkbox.\r\n5. Close System Preferences.\r\n6. Open Safari.\r\n7. Visit a page, like https://google.com/.\r\n8. Visit another page, like https://apple.com/.\r\n9. Do a long swipe on the top of the Magic Mouse to navigate to the previous page. Your finger will physically move across the top of the mouse from left to right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe browser should remain on the same page, https://apple.com/ from step 8.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser navigates back in history, to https://google.com/ from step 7."
