    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has default templates divided up by architecture.\r\n\r\nIt is a rare day when the project's architecture has any sway over which section is selected.\r\n\r\nSee attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new Mac project\r\n2. Add a new file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe macOS / OS X section is selected, with one of the default templates selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's a crap shoot.  Usually for projects that are 100% iOS, I get OS X selected as the architecture.  Even for days on end.\r\n\r\nI just made a new Mac project in Xcode 8, added a new file, and iOS was selected.\r\n\r\nRarely has Xcode ever chosen the correct architecture, which just leads me to sigh, and choose \"blank document\" unless I really need a companion xib file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just a scroll and two clicks, but when it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh death-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has been happening with every xcode version since iOS came out.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'arch-error.png' were successfully uploaded."
