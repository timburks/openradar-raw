        Summary:
        It would be nice to be able to set the accessibilityLabel of a UIAlertController to something distinct from the title, and have it be picked up by VoiceOver.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Work on a transit app, where you are frequently tweaking user-facing strings so that VoiceOver will pronounce them correctly. In this case, I’m expanding transit-specific abbreviations like opp → opposite and ave → avenue.
        2. Desire to use such a string in the title of a UIAlertController.
        3. Decide to use the original, un-expanded string in the title, because it looks better to sighted users.
        4. Notice that VoiceOver pronounces the abbreviations wrong, and try to set its accessibilityLabel to the pronounceable version.

        Expected Results:
        There is a way to override the way VoiceOver reads the title and/or message of the alert controller.

        Actual Results:
        There is no way to do this.

        Regression:
        Not a regression

        Notes:
        I’ve attached a trivial sample project that demonstrates the issue if you run it on a device with VoiceOver enabled. I also posted here: https://cl.ly/ggaE
