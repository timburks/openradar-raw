    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes the Cross cursor in IB lies.  It says \"hey I'm in a panel resizing area\" is actually off-by-one sometimes, and so clicks and drags register as a region drag (and scroll)\r\n\r\nThis leads to situations like \"I need just a little more space to see what I'm doing\" and then scrolling my carefully-positioned material around.  So I don't have my more-space, and I have to reposition my editing material.\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing the problem. Attached is the project seen in the movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Edit a storyboard\r\n2. Position the cursor over the resize panel that shows the storyboard content\r\n3. Drag left to resize the panel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. the panel resizes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. sometimes, the click becomes a drag, and scrolls the storyboard editing area.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just reposition my storyboard scrolling area and try to resize the panel again, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'cross-cursor-lies.mp4' and 'Conduit.zip' were successfully uploaded."
