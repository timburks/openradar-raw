    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is basically a re-radar of 15203065 which I cannot access any more on Radar. I don't know what you did but such missing radars happen quite often and are frustrating for bug reporters.\r\n\r\n'\\n' is a line separator. But paragraphRangeForRange also treats it as a paragraph separator. I think it is incorrect according to Unicode Newline Guidelines: http://unicode.org/standard/reports/tr13/tr13-5.html.\r\n\r\nAnyway the document of \r\ngetParagraphStart(_:end:contentsEnd:forRange:) should state clearly what characters are paragraph separators, just like getLineStart(_:end:contentsEnd:forRange:) for line separators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample app and read console logs.\r\n\r\nCode: http://cl.ly/3U1N2H2Z0R3Z"
