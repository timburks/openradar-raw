        The asset catalog for an image that uses the “sRGB and Display P3” gamut contains a slot for a 1x Display P3 image.

        The problem is that there is no 1x device that can use a Display P3 image. All Display P3 screens are currently 2x and will presumably be 3x sometime this fall.

        Including this slot makes more work for both designers and developers because they think it’s required.
