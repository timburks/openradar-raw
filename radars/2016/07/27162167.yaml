    description: "Summary:\r\nI never have Live Issues turned on - I'm experienced enough to find them worthless. \"of course there's a problem with this line, I'm not done typing it. Get out of my face\".  I usually get 5-10 lines of code down, then do a build t check my work.\r\n\r\nThis breaks playground's usability, because they seem to only report problems via live issues.  It'd be nice that when it runs (to mirror my 'build to get errors\") if it would show errors.  Or put something in the console. \r\n\r\nAttached is a movie showing the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn off Live Issues in Xcode preferences\r\n2. Make a playground\r\n3. Have an error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Get an indication of the error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. Nothing.  Until live issues are turned on and  Xcode restarted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just toggle a preference and restart Xcode, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'no-errors.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
