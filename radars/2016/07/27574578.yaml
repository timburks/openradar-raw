    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, there's a predicate to get contacts in a group, but there's no call to get groups belonging to a contact. \r\n\r\nFor instance, you can use this predicate to get contacts in a group. \r\n+ (NSPredicate *)predicateForContactsInGroupWithIdentifier:(NSString *)groupIdentifier;\r\n\r\nBut to get all the groups that a contact belongs to, you have search for each group and iterate over the results to determine a relationship. This can be very slow if a user has a meaningful number of groups. \r\n\r\nAn example what this predicate could look like: \r\n+ (NSPredicate *)predicateForGroupsForContactWithIdentifier:(NSString *)contactIdentifier;\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo steps to reproduce. Enhancement request. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeveloper makes one API call to get the groups belonging to a contact. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser iterates over all groups determines if the contact belongs in that group. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 and earlier\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS Devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
