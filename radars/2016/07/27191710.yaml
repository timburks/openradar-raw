    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a project uses swift, Xcode 8 beta 2 (8S162m) fails to copy the standard swift library when linking against specific frameworks.\r\nMore specifically, the \"Copy Swift standard libraries\" build step fails with the following error:\r\n\"Found an unexpected Mach-O header code: 0x72613c21\"\r\n\r\nRemoving the offending frameworks from the link phase gets the build through.\r\nSo far, I've only seen the Crashlytics/Fabric frameworks to be causing this.\r\nBuilding a pure objective c project does not trigger the problem.\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) is not affected by this problem either.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that these 2 frameworks are actually static libs packaged as in a framework bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached MachoHeader project\r\n2. Attempt to build and run\r\n3. Open attached MachoHeaderNoSwift project\r\n4. Attempt to build and run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth project build and run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMachoHeader fails to build with error \"Found an unexpected Mach-O header code: 0x72613c21\"\r\nMachoHeaderNoSwift builds and runs successfully\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8S162m\r\nOSX 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached 2 projects to this bug report, both projects are the canned \"single view\" Xcode templates to which I've simply added the aforementioned frameworks.\r\n\r\nMachoHeader.zip is a pure swift project exhibits the issue.\r\nMachoHeaderNoSwift.zip is a pure objc project and is not affected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SampleProjects.zip' was successfully uploaded."
