    description: "Summary:\r\niOS's widgets allow developers to build widgets that provide information at a glance and perform quick tasks. One longstanding limitation of widgets is that they cannot support text input via the keyboard.\r\n\r\nHowever, it'd be extremely useful for widget extensions to be able to support text input. This way, widgets could be used for many types of quick tasks, such as adding a reminder or jotting down a quick note.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a text field in a widget\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text field should work properly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo keyboard appears when the user taps on the text field\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
