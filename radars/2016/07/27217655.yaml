    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen waking the Mac up from sleep, it will show a black screen and nothing else (the Mac needs to be asleep for a few minutes for this to happen). Once in the black screen, the only way that I can actually use the Mac again is to do a hard shutdown and boot again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPut the mac to sleep\r\nWait a few minutes\r\nTry to interact with the mac again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac should wakeup as it always did.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlack screen (display is turned on and backlit but the screen content is black). The fans will usually be running at full speed as well.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 Beta (16A239j)"
