    description: "Summary:\r\nquick feature request - all too often I drop in a UIImageView into a storyboard, and then put a gesture recognizer on it.  I set up my handling code, go to run, and ... nothing happens.  The image view by default has user interaction turned off.\r\n\r\nIt'd be a nice convenience, that if someone drops a gesture recognizer on a view, (they're expecting it to work on that view, after all :-) )and to turn on \"user interaction enabled\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. add a uiimageview to a view in a storyboard\r\n2. drop in a (e.g.) long-press gesture recognzier\r\n3. hook up the connections\r\n4. write the code\r\n5. run the app\r\n6. long press on the image view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n7. the code gets run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7. nothing.  The image view has \"user interaction enabled\"  disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
