    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a complication shows a countdown that's usually a number of days, with a text provider like this: [CLKRelativeDateTextProvider textProviderWithDate:date style:CLKRelativeDateStyleNatural units:NSCalendarUnitDay];\r\n\r\nIn watchOS 2, this usually shows something like \"3 DAYS\", which is great. If there's less room it might say \"3D\", which is not as great, but it's OK. In watchOS 3, the \"3 DAYS\" display has been shortened to \"3DAYS\", even if there's a huge amount of room, like on the Modular Large complication. This reads really awkwardly.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if I had more control over exactly how the text displays. For example:\r\n\r\n- I'd like to choose whether there's a space after the number or not\r\n- I'd like to choose whether it should be \"3D\" or just \"3\", since it's generally understood that my app will display a day countdown\r\n- Even better, I'd love to have an option to show \"Tomorrow\" or \"Today\", when there's room\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2 through watchOS 3 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
