    description: "Summary:\r\nsee attached movie.  The project as seen at the end of video is attached.\r\n\r\nI see this fairly often, unfortunately i didn't get the lead up captured on screen recording (after filing 10 xcode radars so far today, I was hoping I was done. So yeah, I had a great weekend working on personal projects for fun, how about you?)\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the editor gets in to a state where indenting the code (whether via control-I, or the Structure->Re-Indent command) destroys code - it moves things around, inserts weirdness, and flat-out removes code.\r\n\r\nI hope this behavior isn't acceptable in a programmer's editor.\r\n\r\nI had an email conversation with *redacted* back in January about this exact problem.  I'm willing to forward that conversation to someone.  It has some attachments and animated gifs.\r\n\r\nThat particular iissue seemed to be related to newlines vs carriage returns from copy and pasted code from outside of Xcode. (but only after Xcode had been running for a while.  Closing the project and re-opening and things behaved correctly)\r\n\r\nThis time everything was purely inside of Xcode.  No outside editors involved.\r\n\r\nSourceKit has not crashed - all of my syntax colors are black, due to my vision correction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode doesn't get destroyed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI was going to paste my usual \"when these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh blah blah blah\" signature - but stuff that actively corrupts code?  That takes me from just disliking a tool to really being unable to trust it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'confused-death.mp4' and 'MyFatnessPal.zip' were successfully uploaded."
