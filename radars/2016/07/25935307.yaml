    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a CGSize property is set as @IBInspectable the Interface Builder doesn’t allow its values to be negative.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Subclass a UIView\r\n2 - Create a CGSize property and annotate it as @IBInspectable\r\n3 - Open the storyboard\r\n4 - Create a view and set its class as the custom one.\r\n5 - Try to set negative values for the size property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConsidering that CGSize’s properties “width” and “height” are CGFloat, they should be allowed to be negative. This is emphasised by the SDK that does accept this behaviour with properties like CALayer’s “shadowRadius” who’s default value is (0, -3)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Interface Builder doesn’t allow the input to receive negative values\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
