    description: "Note: marked as duplicate of 22244602 (open)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Apple Music users are able to tap the heart button to indicate that they Love a song. This action feeds into the music recommendation engine.\r\n\r\nUsers can create playlists of songs they have Loved, but it only includes songs that they have manually added to their library.\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to see a list of the songs they have Loved without having to add the song to their library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Listen to a streaming song in Apple Music (i.e. not in your library)\r\n2. Tap the heart icon\r\n3. Create a Smart Playlist with the attribute \"Loved is True\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe song should appear in the playlist\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe song doesn't appear in the playlist\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSpotify and Rdio support this\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll"
