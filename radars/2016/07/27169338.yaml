    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the +/- buttons in the SceneKit editor is very annoying and tedious, making it necessary to resort to typing in numbers. The values that increment/decrement seem to be arbitrary and unexpected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a node to a SceneKit scene and change a value such as x position. (See if you can set the value to 5).\r\nThe values you will see after each increment are as follows:\r\n\r\n1,2,3,4,14,24,34,134,234,334\r\n\r\nIf you then choose to decrement, so get back to your original values the sequence becomes:\r\n\r\n334,-666,-1666\r\n\r\nThis is very unhelpful, and seems pretty pointless to use.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe values should increment/decrement in an expected way, such as 1 point at a time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe values follow a strange rule that is not expected and makes selecting the correct value harder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) and Xcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs in all instances of these buttons in the scene kit editor."
