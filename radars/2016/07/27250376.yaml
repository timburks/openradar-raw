    description: "Summary:\r\nInexplicably, every application on my computer, except for Safari, can use the Internet just fine: Twitter, App Store, Google Chrome, etc. But in Safari, no matter the web page or domain, AJAX requests never finish and page loads never finish. Attempting to load or reload a page results in one HTTP or HTTPS GET request that never finishes or even times out (at least, I'm looking at Inspector and this request is already 3 minutes old and still supposedly loading).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have no idea how to reproduce, although this happened immediately after I returned to the office after traveling with my laptop.\r\n\r\nToggling Wi-Fi on/off and toggling my company VPN on/off had no effect. \r\n\r\nI have not restarted the computer or Safari, but I fully expect that one or the other would fix the issue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari can load pages when the computer is on the Internet\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari can't load any pages or data.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1.1 (11601.6.17)\r\non OS X  El Capitan 10.11.5 (15F34)"
