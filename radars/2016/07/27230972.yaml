    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a Messages extension is launched from the grid view, it should be able to successfully request an expanded presentation style.\r\n\r\nIn either willBecomeActiveWithConversation or didBecomeActiveWithConversation, you can call [self requestPresentationStyle:MSMessagesAppPresentationStyleExpanded] but it will silently do nothing.\r\n\r\nI believe that if you are swiping horizontally between message extensions that this should fail, but if you launch the extension by tapping on the icon in the grid view, this call should succeed.\r\n\r\nMy message extension requires having keyboard access, which is only available in expanded mode. The behavior that I'm going to have to implement is to have the view for the compact style have a \"launch expanded style\" button, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create Messages extension\r\n2. In will/didBecomeActiveWithConversation call [self requestPresentationStyle:MSMessagesAppPresentationStyleExpanded]\r\n3. User launches extension from grid view of messages apps\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessages extension launches in expanded presentation style\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExtension is in compact presentation style"
