    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 10's powerful Notification Content extensions give users a great experience when receiving notifications from various apps. The Notification Content extension can handle notification actions (the buttons on the notification) and decide whether or not the notification should be dismissed in response to the user selecting an action.\r\n\r\nThe ability for a notification to not dismiss when an action is selected is great, but the ability to update the actions afterwards is necessary to use this functionality to its full potential.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user receives a notification from a social network that includes a \"Like\" action, the action should change to \"Unlike\" after it's invoked by the user. An \"Archive\" action from an email client should turn into an \"Undo Archive\" action. Some actions may be permanent and irreversible (such as replying to a message or choosing how to proceed with an automated workflow), so it should also be possible to hide an action entirely after it's been invoked. Other use cases also require the ability to add new actions after one's been selected, or to remove all of the actions while a request is made (which could be displayed in the notification content's UI), and add a new set once the request is complete.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, the notification's category or set of actions should be updatable at any time by the Notification Content extension, perhaps as a method on NSExtensionContext.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at UserNotificationsUI API\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way of changing the category of the notification at run-time or passing in an arbitrary set of actions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API exists\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1"
