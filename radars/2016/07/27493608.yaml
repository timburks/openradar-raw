        Summary:
        For a while now class dump users have the privilege to get their own method:
        -[UIViewController attentionClassDumpUser:yesItsUsAgain:althoughSwizzlingAndOverridingPrivateMethodsIsFun:itWasntMuchFunWhenYourAppStoppedWorking:pleaseRefrainFromDoingSoInTheFutureOkayThanksBye:]

        Sadly though, it seems like people that read the assembly do not get any such benefit. :(

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Look through UIKit assembly. E.g. look into the body of the above mentioned method.

        Expected Results:
        - Some nice cstring or some sort of text mentioning people that read the assembly and explaining to them why this is a horrible idea.

        Actual Results:
        - The method seems to be empty.

        Regression:
