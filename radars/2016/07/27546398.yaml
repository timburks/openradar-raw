    description: "When receiving an interactive iMessage via Notification Center and force-touching the notification to reveal the content\r\n\r\n- it takes a long time (several seconds) until the content is displayed\r\n- the content can't be tapped. I would expect that I can tap the content just as in the Messages app in order to select it in the iMessage extension."
