        In an iMessage extension in extended presentation style, when the user edits the message to include a multiline text, the bottom edge inset of the content view controller is not updated accordingly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run the attached sample iMessage extension and expand it. Note that the table view has correct contentInsets. Now enter the message text field and type a multiline message.

        Expected Results:
        The bottom contentInsets and scrollIndicatorInsets should automatically update to accommodate the larger message text view.

        Actual Results:
        The bottom contentInsets and scrollIndicatorInsets don't update. They stay at the initial value of 44.

        Note:
        Both view controllers of the sample app use "Adjust Scroll View Insets" and "Extend Edges Under Bottom Bars" so it should work.
