    description: "When assigning an image provider to a CLKComplicationTemplateExtraLargeSimpleImage, the template behaves differently depending on the image source: \r\n\r\n* When the image provider gets an image from the asset catalog, the image correctly displays in the full bounds of the extra large complication area. \r\n* When the image is drawn dynamically using UIGraphics commands and the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext function, the resulting image is masked to a circle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDraw a complication image using UIGraphics commands and get the resulting image via the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext function.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe resulting image will be shown completely in the extra large complication area, just as it would be if the image came from the asset catalog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is masked to a circle."
