    description: "Summary:\r\niOS's extensibility framework allows developers to build extensions that make iOS even more powerful. Extensions come along with a few limitations, as noted in the App Extensions programming guide. One of these is that extensions cannot access the microphone.\r\n\r\nHowever, it'd be extremely useful for widget extensions to be able to use the microphone. This way, widgets could include quick recording or, in iOS 10, dictation features. For example, a voice recording app could offer a widget that allows the user to record a quick voice note.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to use audio recording API from a widget\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should work properly (assuming the user has granted permission to that app/widget to use the microphone)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't work\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
