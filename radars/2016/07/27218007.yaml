    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMusic app has new tab bar that doesn't follow Apple design guidelines. If user is colorblind he cannot see which tab is selected because icon doesn't fill or change stroke. It's always the same. Shame on you\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Accessibility setting turn on b/w mode. Open music app. Switch tab. You don't know where you are. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSame behaviour as in previous version of the music app. Outlined icons when not selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTabbar only shows selection with color\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUI and UX is terrible\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0302.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\nProvide two versions of custom tab bar icons. Provide icons for both the selected and unselected states. The selected icon is often a filled-in version of the unselected icon, but some designs call for variations to this approach. For example, Apple apps sometimes invert icon interiors, increase or reduce strokes, and enclose the icon within a shape, such as a circle.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/custom-icons/"
