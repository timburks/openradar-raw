    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Quick Help Inspector, if it's up while typing, flashes between \"No selection\" and \"No Quick Help\" while typing.  Kind of distracting...\r\n\r\nPlease see attached video.\r\nThe project in question is attached, if that has any determination\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just close the inspector, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ClassMaker.zip' and 'blink-blink-blink.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
