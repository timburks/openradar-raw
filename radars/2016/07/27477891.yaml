    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see attached movie - I start off with a clean build folder, and then do a swift 3 migration. I have four errors.  The conversion seems to have worked (I haven't built it yet), but have all those error splotches.  Do I need to worry? Is there something terribly wrong I have to fix?  If it's not an important error, why tell me there are errors?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just ignore random errors you don't understand, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
