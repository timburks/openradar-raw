    description: "Summary:\r\nPreviously you could go to Window -> Projects to open a list of your projects. There you could remove derived data and snapshots. This window is missing in Xcode 8. This is very unfortunate, because removing derived data is a crucial part of iOS development, because Xcode frequently has problems that can be fixed this way. Which is a whole problem in itself, but at least it was acknowledged before Xcode 8. Now we have to manually delete derived data from the Finder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDoes not apply here.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a convenient way to remove derived data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no convenient way to remove derived data."
