    description: "Summary:\r\nI get a warning. The warning text box is on the line after the warning.\r\nI try to fix the warning, but I can't see what I'm typing because of this warning box.  I know what the warning is now and would like to not type blind, or hide all messages and then turn them on, or add a blank line to just be removed later, all to work around deficiences in Xcode's UI\r\n\r\nScreen shot attached\r\nVideo attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a warning such that it displays after the affected line of code\r\n2. Figure out how to fix the warning. Enter code in the line after the affected line of code \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. I can see what I'm typing without having to do-something-then-un-do-something\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. The text is obscured.  I have to hide all messages, and later remember to show them.  Or else I have to enter in enough vertical whitespace to avoid the warning, enter in the new code, build so that the warning goes away, then remove that vertical white space.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just do-something-then-un-do-it, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBeen happening forever.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'blind-typing.mp4' and 'invisibru.png' were successfully uploaded.  <links in comments>"
