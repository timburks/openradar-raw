    description: "Sending -[CMMotionManager -startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame:toQueue:withHandler:] with any reference frame other than CMAttitudeReferenceFrameXArbitraryZVertical silently fails without returning an error to the completion handler.\r\n\r\nI understand that the watch doesn't support other reference frames due to the lacking magnetometer but it should at least fail with an error (e.g. CMErrorNotAvailable) when the reference frame is not supported. \r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice to indicate the supported reference frames in the documentation."
