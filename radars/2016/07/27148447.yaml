    description: "Summary:\r\nRan the static analyzer on my big iOS (ObjC-only) project.\r\n\r\nibtool crashed, with instructions to file a bug report.  Here it is.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the entire window attached.\r\n\r\nattached is an archive of the nib file(s) - xcode piddled on it (OF COURSE. What's an xcode revision that doesn't make trivial changes to xib files and saves them without my consent?). I don't know if the crash is due to the pre-piddled or post-piddled version, so they're both here.\r\n\r\nTwo crashlogs attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Analyze my big honkin' project\r\n2. Get some valid complaints\r\n3. Get a crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nso far happened once.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ibtoold_2016-07-02-140856-1_pheasantbook.crash', 'Archive.zip', 'Screen Shot 2016-07-02 at 2.10.03 PM.png' and 'ibtoold_2016-07-02-140856_pheasantbook.crash' were successfully uploaded."
