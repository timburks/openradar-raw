    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a .h file (it doesn't have a corresponding .m file if that makes any difference). When I try to generate an interface for it to see how Swift will see things.  I get \"Generating Interface\" and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nattached a video showing it in action\r\nattached the project in question.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Project\r\n2. Open Foodie.h\r\n3. Generate Interface from the MoreStuffâ„¢ menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Get a generated interface\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Get a never-disappearing \"Generating Interface\" banner.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just uh... I dunno how to work around it, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'no-generated-interface.mp4' and 'ObjCInterop.zip' were successfully uploaded."
