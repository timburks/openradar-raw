    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm adding an extension to Array, scoped by String.  I had the syntax wrong.  Xcode said \"hey, there's an error\" but no indication in the editor that anything was wrong. In fact, the only indication was the teeny-tiny little icon in the top bar (which I generally ignore - it's just flickering noise most of the time)\r\n\r\nI click on the error, and it takes me to the build like with a message \"<unknown>:0: error: type 'Element' constrained to non-protocol type 'String'\", no indication of where the problem is.  Luckily this is a small project so I know where to look\r\n\r\nvideo and screen shot attached. Project attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Extend Array, limited to arrays of strings, and get the syntax wrong\r\n2. Get an error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Xcode shows where the error is \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Get shuffled to the build log with no indication where the problem is\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just grovel around in the build log, but\r\nwhen it happens day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappened often in Xcode 7 too.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'useful-error-message.mp4', 'useful-error-message.png' and 'ClassMaker.zip' were successfully uploaded."
