    description: "Summary:\r\nHere's a video of me trying to work on a side project (seems that most of my free time is spent filing radars...)\r\n\r\nI copied and pasted something, which went briefly into an error state, did a build, and then back out.  There were 11 errors reported for what should have been a one-liner. When I went to look at the list of errors, they were pretty bizarre:\r\n\r\nCannot convert return expression of type 'Int' to return type 'mig_subsystem_t!'\r\nCannot convert return expression of type 'Int' to return type 'kauth_cred_t!'\r\nCannot convert return expression of type 'Int' to return type 'rpc_subsystem_t!'\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the problem I went to look at the errors in more detail. Control-clicking and doing \"reveal in log\" didn't work, even though the entries were there in the log.\r\n\r\nI figure this can be filed under \"Swift errors need improvement so they don't spew incomprehensible results\" or \"show in log navigator is sometimes broken\"  I'll leave that to your wise judgement.\r\n\r\nProject is also attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - don't try to looking errors up in the log, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'weird-errors.mp4' and 'MyFatnessPal.zip' were successfully uploaded."
