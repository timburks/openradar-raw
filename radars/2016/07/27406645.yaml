        During Session 712 at WWDC it was recommended to use 16-bit per channel images in the asset catalog.

        JPEG (JFIF) only supports 8-bit per channel images. JPEG 2000 allows 16-bit images, but is not supported by Xcode. Only PNG supports 16-bit images, but itâ€™s not a good choice for high resolution imagery where lossy compression is a good tradeoff.

        Is the recommendation for JPEG assets to convert them to the Display P3 color profile before adding to the asset catalog?

        Or would it be better to just leave the source image in the ProPhoto or Adobe RGB color space that the original photographer used?
