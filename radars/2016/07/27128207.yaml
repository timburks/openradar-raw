    description: "Summary:\r\nIt happened to me many times during my iPhone 6s usage. I didn't have this problems with iPhone 5. Often my iPhone turns itself off when it has from ~ 16% to 35% juice.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCarry your iPhone in front pocket of your jacket during winter in London.\r\nOr leave your iPhone on the desk near the open window for the whole night not - not charging and with battery less than 30%\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhone turns itself off only when temperature is below 0º. Snowflake and charging icons appear on the screen to indicate that its cold and needs to be charged. \r\nWarning would be useful too so user have time to warm the devices before it is useless.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone turns itself off when it is little cold 1º — 10º maybe. UI blames the low battery when battery is not empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlready twice I got lost in London because I couldn't use Apple Maps. I had to heat iPhone with my body to make it work. How people suppose to figure this out when UI says the battery is low, while in fact it has 40% and just needs heating.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s black 64 GB with Apple Leather Midnight Blue Case."
