    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an app name is localized, that name is not displayed correctly in the Watch app on the iPhone. For example, my app is named \"Deliveries\". I have an InfoPlist.strings file with a localized CFBundleDisplayName and CFBundleName. If I change the language to Japanese, it says \"デリバリーズ\" on the home screen. It even says \"デリバリーズ\" if I open the Watch app tap \"Complications\". But if I open the Watch app and scroll down to find my app there, it says \"Deliveries\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached app on an iPhone with a paired watch. All I did to create this sample app was create a new iOS app, add a watchOS target, and then add an InfoPlist.strings file with a localized CFBundleDisplayName and CFBundleName.\r\n2. Set the iPhone's language to Japanese.\r\n3. Verify that the app on the home screen is titled \"Japanese\".\r\n4. Open the Watch app.\r\n5. Scroll down to the list of third-party apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be labeled \"Japanese\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app is labeled \"LocalWatch\", which is the non-localized title.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3 beta 2, iOS 10 beta 2 (14A5297c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't think this problem is new in iOS 10—I've seen reports of the same issue in iOS 9. I've tried adding localizations to both the Watch app and its extension, but that doesn't seem to work either.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LocalWatch.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOn further testing, it seems the app name shown in the location is actually taken from the .watchkitapp bundle, at least in iOS 10. But I've added an InfoPlist.strings file with localizations and it still isn't translated, whereas the title used for the app on the watch itself is translated.\r\n\r\nI have also identified two other places where the app name is not translated, both on the watch itself:\r\n\r\n- The complication name. To see this text, press on a watch face, swipe over to the view when you can customize the complications, tap a complication, then use the digital crown to select a complication. The complication name is shown in a green box above the complication itself. In my new test project it should say \"Japanese App Display Name\" when the language is set to Japanese. Instead it shows \"Unlocalized App Display Name\".\r\n\r\n- The placeholder text that is shown when CLKComplicationPrivacyBehaviorHideOnLockScreen is used. To see this text, select a complication like \"Modular Large\" or \"Utilitarian Large\", then lock the watch. The app name will be shown. Again, in my new test project it should say \"Japanese App Display Name\" when the language is set to Japanese. Instead it shows \"Unlocalized App Display Name\".\r\n\r\nIn all three of these cases, the name seems to be taken from the .watchkitapp bundle. I can tell the InfoPlist.strings file is recognized, because \"Japanese App Display Name\" does show in some places—at the top of the screen when the app is first launched, and when the app is viewed in the dock.\r\n\r\nPlease see the updated attached project for a demonstration of these problems."
