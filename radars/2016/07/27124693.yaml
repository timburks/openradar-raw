    description: "Summary:\n\nWhen using version control (say command line GIT) to checkout a different version of our project we frequently get into situations where a bunch of our workspace projects are modified externally. This confuses Xcode and results in long sequences of reload alerts being presented. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nUse version control to check out an older version of a sufficiently complex workspace. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nXcode would detect that several projects were modified and offer to reload the entire workspace. \n\nActual Results:\n\nA sequence of alerts is presented, promoting to reload every single project that changed. See the attached GIF. It can even get much worse that this for us. \n\nRegression:\n\nHappens in every Xcode version so far. Including Xcode 8 beta. \n\nNote:\n\nThe workaround is to have Xcode closed during the checkout. Itâ€™s not a very convenient one though, as you might forget to do this or have to do it frequently during some operations (say bisecting the history to find a regression)."
