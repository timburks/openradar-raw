Download Connect app.\r\n2. Upload app to iTunes Connect.\r\n3. Submit it for review.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should get a single notification about the app changing state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get 2 notifications about the app changing state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nConnect version 3.2.1 (355)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is simple - just ignore it.
