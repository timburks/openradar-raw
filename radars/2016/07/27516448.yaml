    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you add a storyboard reference from one storyboard to another, there is no way to tell from the target view controller, that it has an external storyboard reference. This makes it difficult to determine where a view controller is being used from another storyboard, or if it's being used at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create 2 storyboards A and B\r\n2) In storyboard B add a view controller with a storyboard ID\r\n3) In storyboard A, add a Storyboard Reference targeting the view controller in storyboard B\r\n4) Go back to storyboard B\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to tell from storyboard B, or the specific view controller, that it has a reference from another storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou cannot tell if it is being referenced from anywhere else.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis makes it especially difficult if you have quite a few storyboards, and a view controller can be shared from many of them. We have 30 storyboards in the Lyft project, and some view controllers such as adding payment can be shown in many different flows, so there are quite a few storyboard references to the same view controller."
