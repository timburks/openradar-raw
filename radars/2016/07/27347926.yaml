    description: "Summary:\r\nSearching in preview doesn't match whole strings, but treats words individually. This means in a large PDF you get hundreds of results for a phrase that may actually only appear once. You can wrap the search in quotes, but this still doesn't always work, especially when you don't type the whole word.\r\n\r\nThis is infuriating as I am looking for a particular page in a large PDF, but can only remember a partial string, searching for that string doesn't actually show me it in the document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached PDF in Preview.\r\nSearch for the string infinite numb\r\nNarrow down results by typing \"infinite numb\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first search infinite numb should return 1 result\r\nThe second search \"infinite numb\" should return 0 results, as the PDF does not contain quote marks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ninfinite numb gives 5 matches, even though the string only appears once in the document.\r\n\"infinite numb\" gives 0 matches even though the string is right there, I can see it!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPreview Version 8.1\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTextEdit search works perfectly, please at least add an option to go back to normal search like that."
