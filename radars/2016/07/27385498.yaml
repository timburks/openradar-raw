    description: "Summary:\r\n(this is the second time I've submitted this - RadarWeb decided to fail during the upload, and even doing \"save draft\" didn't actually save draft.  _sigh_)\r\n\r\nSometimes when I drag out a UIButton (or other ui item), and drop it into a view controller editing area, instead of actually dropping, it scurries back to the list of UI items.\r\n\r\nBecause I usually double-click things to edit them, I expect the button to be there, but it's inexplicably gone. That causes the editing canvas to zoom.  I unzoom the canvas, and it scrolls the useful stuff totally out of view :'-(\r\n\r\nAttached is a movie demonstrating these.  There's also a slow-motion showing exactly what was going on.\r\n\r\nAttached is the project being shown, if it's worthwhile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just drag out a button again, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBeen seeing this for version after version\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sorryboards.mp4' and 'ObjCInterop.zip' were successfully uploaded."
