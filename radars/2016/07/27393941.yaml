        Summary:

        Activating a content blocker currently requires a PhD in astrophysics.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. If the app developer is nice, there’s a tutorial that tells you how to enable the content blocker (design smell #1) – see the one in the Better app (https://better.fyi)
        2. If the app developer is nice, there’s a button that opens up Settings for you
        3. Even if the developer is nice, they cannot take you directly to the Safari → Content Blockers section because prefs:root=SAFARI&path=CONTENT_BLOCKERS doesn’t work) – the closest they can get you (pre-iOS 10) is to the Safari settings.
        4. Even if the developer is nice, on iOS 10, it seems that we cannot even get you to the Safari settings as using openURL with prefs:root does nothing.

        Expected Results:

        Ideally, we should be able to request permission to activate a content blocker from within the app via a modal dialog:

        The Better content blocker is asking to be enabled. [Don’t Allow] [OK]

        This would cut in-app tutorials and hugely reduce the person’s load.

        Notes:

        Please, at the very least, don’t take away our ability to take a person to the right place in Settings so that they can easily enable a content blocker.

        If you’d like to provide a quick enhancement, please fix the prefs:root feature so that we can take people directly to the content blockers section of the Safari settings in the Settings app.

        Or, if you really want to help reduce the effort people have to go through, please implement the in-app permission dialog I suggested above.

        Thank you in advance.
