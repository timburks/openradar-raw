    description: "Summary:\r\nPower Meters are a critical part of advanced cycling training. Power can only be measured and not estimated through calculations. Power data is measured in watts.\r\n\r\nMany years of research have gone into tracking, measuring and extracting value from these data points. A great introduction is the first half of th the Training and Racing with a Power Meter (http://www.amazon.com/Training-Racing-Power-Meter-2nd/dp/1934030554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433873118&sr=8-1&keywords=racing+power+meter+bible). More info on the wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_power_meter\r\n\r\nThere are many devices and companies that track this type of information: http://www.powertap.com/ or http://garmin.com/ or http://www.stagescycling.com just to name a few.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Buy a power meter\r\n2. Do a bike ride with power\r\n3. Note that there is no way to track this in HealthKit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nData should be tracked in health kit\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nData is not tracked in health kit\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall"
