    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe SF Mono font is not included in the iOS 10 runtime.  After watching WWDC 2016 Session 803, Typography and Fonts (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/803/), I would expect the SF Mono font to be included with iOS 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCalling `[UIFont familyName]` in an application running on an iOS 10 device does not list \"SF Mono\" as an available font in the San Francisco font family.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSF Mono is not listed as an available font.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI would expect SF Mono to be listed as an available font.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.x\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices supporting iOS 10"
