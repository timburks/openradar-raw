    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UNUserNotificationCenter class documentation contains a suggestion to the user which can lead to a bad user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the section “Requesting Authorization for User Interactions” under the UNUserNotificationCenter class documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 2nd sentence should read something like: “You request authorization using the requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:) method, which you typically call at an appropriate time to request permission from the user.”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt currently reads, “You request authorization using the requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:) method, which you typically call early in your executable’s life cycle.” \r\n\r\nThis is bad because it encourages developers to often put this request into applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions:. Putting this kind of authorization request early into the executable’s life-cycle is a bad user experience for the user, and can often lead to the user denying the permissions to show user notifications.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nUNUserNotificationCenter\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter\r\n\r\nSection: Requesting Authorization for User Interactions\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOver time, as iOS has evolved, we have found that asking the user for iOS permissions is delicate process, one that can often create a bad user experience for the user, and end up with the app not receiving the permission needed. The right way is to ask ONLY at the appropriate time, when the user may have already begun a related action, so that they are primed to answer yes."
