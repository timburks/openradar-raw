        Summary:
        The Now Playing app and screen in Music should show the time remaining and/or a progress bar. It is very helpful to know how much time is left in a song or podcast and I currently canâ€™t do that without looking at my phone.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Play a song or podcast and open the Now Playing app on the watch.

        Expected Results:
        I should see both the time remaining and time elapsed.

        Actual Results:
        I currently only see the time elapsed.
