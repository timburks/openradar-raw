    description: "Summary:\r\nA project with both Unit Tests and UI Tests will generate code coverage when ran in the XCode IDE. If the same project is run using `xcodebuild test` from CLI, code coverage from the Unit Tests will exist but coverage from UI Tests will be missing\r\n\r\nSample project with UI Tests and Unit Tests, showing a difference in coverage from `xcrun llvm-cov report` between the project built via IDE and via CLI\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/iwllyu/UITestCoverageBug \r\n\r\nthelvis4 found a discrepancy between how the two building processes differ - https://github.com/nakiostudio/xcov/issues/22#issuecomment-232014641\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install XCode 8.1 with Swift 3\r\n2. clone the UITestCoverageBug project from https://github.com/iwllyu/UITestCoverageBug \r\n3. Open the project in XCode and run the tests. See both Unit and UI tests get run. See both `testedViaUnitTest` and `testedViaUITest` are covered\r\n4. in terminal, run `xcrun llvm-cov report` (see github for details)\r\n5. check that coverage for ViewController.swift is 80%\r\n6. in terminal, run `xcodebuild test` for project (see github for details)\r\n7. in terminal, run `xcrun llvm-cov report` (see github for details)\r\n8. check that coverage for ViewController.swift is now 40%\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncoverage for ViewController.swift is 80%\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncoverage for ViewController.swift is now 40%\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 8.1\r\nOSX 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
