    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit (Maps)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Portland (and many cities in the US!) there are a sizable number of people who use a bicycle for transportation, either full time or occasionally. Thanks to increased bicycling infrastructure and an upcoming bike share service, it's likely that number will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nThe street system in Portland includes a number of routes specifically designated for bicycling. These routes incorporate lower traffic speeds, traffic calming measures and specific infrastructure such as bike lanes. However, Apple Maps does not show these routes in its UI or provide a way to prefer them for routing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Choose a destination in Apple Maps.\r\n2. Tap 'Get Directions'.\r\n3. There is no option for bicycling directions, and no indication of which streets are better for bicycling.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to create a route specifically for bicycling. Also, the map UI should indicate which roads are better or worse for bicycling based on the amount and speed of traffic, and infrastructure such as bike lanes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple Maps does not include features related to bicycling.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5297c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
