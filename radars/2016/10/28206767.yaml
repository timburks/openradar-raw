    description: "Summary:\r\nCallKit directory extensions are shown in iOS Settings under Phone > Call Blocking & Identification for user management.\r\nIn the event that an app contains multiple extensions, the name of the extension is rendered as \"<App Display Name> â€” <Extension Display Name>.\r\nHowever, when the extension contains Info.plist localisations using InfoPlist.strings files, only the localisation corresponding to CFBundleDevelopmentRegion of the extension is used, regardless of the user's locale settings.\r\n\r\nThis does not appear to affect other extensions which are not managed through Settings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Refer to the attached sample project and install on a device.\r\n2. Set device language to either French or German.\r\n3. Check the Messages app and note that the iMessage extension contained in the sample project shows its name with the correct localisation.\r\n4. Check Settings > Phone > Call Blocking & Identification and note that the extension names are shown in English.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe extension display name is shown according to the user's locale settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe extension display name always uses the localisation specified by CFBundleDevelopmentRegion \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 A1586"
