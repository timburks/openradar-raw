    description: "Summary:\r\nMuch hay has been made, in nerd circles, about the fact that the Touch Bar's elimination of a physical \"esc\" key will be a nuisance to fans of command-line editors such as vi or emacs.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be cool if these command line tools could themselves take advantage of the Touch Bar, providing custom UI to improve their own functionality?\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: while a Terminal window is the first responder, if the tool being run (which may, of course, be only a shell) can provide Touch Bar customizations, then defer to the tool for management of the Touch Bar's content.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1 (16B2657) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
