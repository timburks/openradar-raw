        Summary:
        After an app finishes playing audio, the now playing screen stays visible with stale information in CarPlay. It should dismiss itself and return to the browse interface.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play audio through a CarPlay entitled app
        2. Have the now playing screen visible
        3. Let the audio reach its natural conclusion where the app sets MPNowPlayingInfoCenter nowPlayingInfo dict to nil

        Expected Results:
        The now playing screen dismisses itself (or at least blanks out the metadata like control centre on iPhone does)

        Actual Results:
        The now playing screen stays visible and displays stale information. Play controls are still visible even though tapping them does nothing.

        Regression:
        iOS 10.1 CarPlay Simulator
