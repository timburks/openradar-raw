    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter recording a video using UIImagePickerController, if the entire capture directory is deleted then UIImagePickerController will fail to record again until the app is relaunched. The error message says \"The requested URL was not found on this server.\", and the follow messages are logged to the console:\r\n\r\n[Camera] Encountered an error during video recording! (duration: Zero error: <private>, file: <private>)\r\n[Camera] File does not exist: <private>\r\n[Camera] Attempting to generate BGRA thumbnail data of format 5003 with an invalid surface.\r\n[Generic] video path <private> for PLPreviewImageAndDurationForVideoAtPath does not exist\r\n[Generic] video path <private> for PLPreviewImageAndDurationForVideoAtPath does not exist\r\nCould not load value for key tracks: The requested URL was not found on this server.\r\nCould not load value for key duration: The requested URL was not found on this server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Capture a video using UIImagePickerController.\r\n\r\n2. When complete, delete the capture entire directory (not only the file).\r\n\r\n3. Try to capture a video using UIImagePickerController again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMany videos can be captured over and over again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCapture fails until the app is relaunched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 (14A456), iOS 10.1 Beta (14B55c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression in iOS 10 and does not occur on iOS 9.3.5. There's a very easy work-around which is to delete only the captured video file and not the entire directory.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for UIImagePickerControllerDelegate doesn't mention anything about deletion at all, so we are left to decide what we should and should not delete. Whether or not the directory is supposed to be deleted it would be nice if the documentation stated something about the policy.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, or any other iOS 10 device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImagePickerRequestedURLNotFound_iOS10.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/00c68ybi3zzti41/ImagePickerRequestedURLNotFound_iOS10.zip?dl=0"
