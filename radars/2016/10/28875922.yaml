    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs of iOS 10, after calling `UIApplication.unregisterForRemoteNotifications()`, you are unable to re-register (at least for some period of time). This contradicts the documentation, which states that “apps unregistered through this method can always re-register.”\r\n\r\nThis is important because there’s no other good way to prevent a user from getting push notifications, if they’ve logged out. You could make an HTTP request to your own server to tell it to stop sending them to this device, but this requires the user to be online at the time when they log out (or for the HTTP request to be queued up and executed later, which would mean keeping the logged out user’s tokens around longer than necessary). Alternatively, you could introspect push notification payloads and compare them against the currently authenticated user before allowing the notification to be shown, but this is unnecessary engineering effort.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Call `UIApplication.unregisterForRemoteNotifications()` on iOS 10\r\n- Call `UIApplication.registerForRemoteNotifications()`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne of the following `UIApplicationDelegate` methods would be called:\r\n\r\n`application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData)`\r\n`application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError)`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNeither of those `UIApplicationDelegate` methods are called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrior to iOS 10, you could re-register after unregistering."
