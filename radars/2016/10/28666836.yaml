    description: "Summary:\r\nI had a named pipe lurking in my app bundle.  As a result, it wouldn't run on a simulator or device - however, the error is very cryptic as it doesn't point out where the unsupported resource is.  I ended up rebuilding my development certificate & provisioning profile (it was code sign complaining after all), before finding out about something else on the bundle causing this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create an iOS project in Xcode.  \r\n2.  Add a folder reference to it.\r\n3.  In a terminal, navigate to that folder you've just added a reference to, and type the following commands:\r\n\r\nmkfifo my_pipe\r\ngzip -9 -c < my_pipe > out.gz &\r\n\r\n4.  Build the project and attempt to run it on a simulator or device!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither codesign ignores this resource, or points out where the offending resource is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCodesign tells you there's an unsupported resource, but doesn't tell you where it is!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a)\r\nmacOS 10.12 (16A319)\r\niOS 10 SDK\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne way I easily got a named pipe lurking is from using the Realm browser to open up one of my Realm files inside my app bundle (please don't shoot me for not using Core Data......)"
