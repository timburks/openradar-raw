    description: "Duplicate of 27823998\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nInvoking NSTextView's setUsesInspectorBar:true multiple times from a 32 bit app crashes the app on macOS 10.12, including the latest beta (10.12.1 16B2553a).\r\nThis is a regression - pre-10.12 it does not crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSimply invoke setUsesInspectorBar on a NSTextView several times, toggling the value each time.\r\n\r\nA demo project is attached. Run it, then toggle the checkbox twice. That'll cause the crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version does not matter - it even happens with apps built with Xojo, which don't use Xcode at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease don't ask for a system report. It's tedious to create, and I've already got plenty of confirmations from other developers, and everyone can reproduce it. So, you should, too, without needing my specific system setup. I'm actually using a fairly clean Sierra installation.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not occur on pre-10.12 systems, but occurs on all currently available 10.12 and 10.12.1 systems.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Xcode-project.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nGet it here: http://files.tempel.org/tmp/TextArea-Crash.zip"
