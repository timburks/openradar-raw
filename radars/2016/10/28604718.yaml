    description: "Summary:\r\nI made a simple example with a UICollectionView and prefetching activated. I put some logs and you can see that always on prefetching cellForAtIndexPath is called. Is that guaranteed? It is always the case except for on item 0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample\r\n2. Look at the ouput in Xcode\r\n\r\n2016-10-04 08:11:12.668 PrefetchingSample[94247:11189819] Cell for row at indexPath: [0, 0]\r\n2016-10-04 08:11:12.689 PrefetchingSample[94247:11189819] Prefetching indexPath: [[0, 1]]\r\n\r\n3. Scroll to page 1\r\n\r\n2016-10-04 08:11:43.956 PrefetchingSample[94247:11189819] Cell for row at indexPath: [0, 1]\r\n2016-10-04 08:11:44.134 PrefetchingSample[94247:11189819] Prefetching indexPath: [[0, 2]]\r\n2016-10-04 08:11:44.190 PrefetchingSample[94247:11189819] Cell for row at indexPath: [0, 2]\r\n\r\nNow you see that a prefetching also calls cellForItemAtIndexPath.\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Is that desired behavior or can this change in the future \r\nor is guaranteed that cellForItemAtIndexPath is called after prefetching method?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncellForItemAtIndexPath called in all situations after prefetch method is called or never called and preparing and loading data up to user in prefetching method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncellForItemAtIndexPath not called after prefetching of item 1\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PrefetchingSample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
