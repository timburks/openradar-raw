    description: "Summary:\r\nFor each codesign task in my Xcode build chain it takes multiple minutes to perform codesign.  This amounts to over 10min long single build times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I updated to Mac OS 10.12.1\r\n2. I Build and run a project for a tvOS device\r\n3. I wait for a very long time\r\n4. It eventually completes over 10min later.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should take as long as it did to codesign as it did on Mac OS 10.12.0.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt takes many times longer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 OR 8.1\r\nMac OS 10.12.1"
