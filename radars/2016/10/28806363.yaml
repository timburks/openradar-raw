        Summary:
        Sometimes the iPhone powers itself off at 30%, when connected to power again it boots and it proudly displays it has 31% of battery remaining. (It happens at various percentages, just using 30 as an example)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use your iPhone until the power is below 50%

        Expected Results:
        You can reach 0% before it turns itself off.

        Actual Results:
        At 30% it turns itself off (I've also had it happen at any number between 20 and 40), I've seen it happen much less when I am in Low Power mode (but I rarely get there)

        Regression:
        This didn't use to happen.

        Notes:
        t's a sunny day, you're taking a nice walk with your glorious computing device of the future and suddenly you see a scene so beautiful it could make Chuck Norris weep. Quickly you take out your glorious computing device of the future, it still has 30% battery left!, and open the Camera app, you frame the perfect shot andâ€¦ the glorious computing device of the future goes black. You connect it back to your external battery only to be greeted by 31%, like it's mocking you. O how it mocks me.

        This usually happens when I haven't touched the iPhone in a while, so it went from 60 to 30% with a black screen, if I then unlock it and open one of these (also happens with other apps, but these are usually the ones I'm opening in such a situation):

        - Camera.app
        - Waze.app
        - Maps.app
        - Twitterriffic.app

        My glorious computing device of the future just shuts down.
