        Summary:
        Calling the same setter on appearance proxy results in multiple calls on actual instance. Each proxy call results in one call on the actual instance.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Attached Swift playground illustrates this behavior.

        Expected Results:
        The setter on the instance should be called just once and should reflect the last call on matching appearance proxy.

        Actual Results:
        All appearance proxy calls for particular selector are replayed on the matching instance.

        Notes:
        This is an issue when UIAppearance proxies are used to change the apps theme in runtime (e.g. switching between light/day and dark/night theme).
