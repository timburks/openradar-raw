    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBluetooth health devices (ie. heart rate strap) do not show up in Apple Health when they are set up (connected, paired, etc) through a 3rd party app instead of iOS' Settings app.\r\n\r\nAt Pebble, we're working on adding the standard Bluetooth Heart Rate Service (HRS) to the Pebble watches.\r\nThe connection between a Pebble watch and iPhone needs to be set up through the Pebble iOS app for a variety of reasons. In our opinion, it's also a much better user experience to guide our users through the set up process inside our app vs. having to explain to the to go into iOS' Settings > Bluetooth etc.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Apple Health only registers Bluetooth health devices that are connected through iOS' Settings app. Therefore, a Pebble (with HRS-enabled firmware) that has been connected from the Pebble iOS app does not show up in Apple Health.\r\nIf the Pebble is connected (starting in the disconnected state) from iOS' Settings app, it *does* show up in Apple Health.\r\n\r\nThis same behavior/issue can also be reproduced using any off-the-shelve BLE HR chest strap. (See steps to reproduce)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and open the LightBlue BLE test app from the App Store.\r\n2. Take an BLE HR chest strap and turn it on.\r\n3. Connect to the strap using the LightBlue app.\r\n4. Go into the \"Heart Rate Measurement\" characteristic and subscribe to notifications.\r\n5. Open Apple Health.\r\n6. Observe that the HR chest strap is not listed under Sources > Devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 6, I would expect the HR chest strap to be listed under Sources > Devices.\r\n\r\nIf it's not possible to automatically list health devices that were not set up through iOS' Settings/Bluetooth menu, I would expect an option in the Apple Health app to set up already connected devices with Apple Health.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 6, the HR chest strap is not listed under Sources > Devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
