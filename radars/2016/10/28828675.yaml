    description: "Summary:\r\nOur VoIP App (Avaya Equinox) is built against the iOS 9 SDK and uses CTCallCenter to monitor for cellular calls. \r\nWhenever our app comes to the foreground, we alloc a new CTCallCenter instance to check for any cellular calls.\r\nRunning on iOS 10 (10.0.2), the application occasionally hangs with what looks like a deadlock with large number of CallKit threads.\r\n(See attached decoded crash log).\r\nIt's not clear how exactly to reproduce this, I'm hoping the crash logs will give enough information ot determine what's causing the deadlock.\r\nFrequency of occurrence is 2-3 times a day when testing VoIP calling.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee Description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee Description\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee Description\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
