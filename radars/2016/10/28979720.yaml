    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Objective C protocol contains a function with a ResultBlock.\r\n\r\nXcode suggests to conform to the protocol by implementing the function as follows:\r\n\r\npublic func withCompletion(_ completion: ResultBlock) {}\r\n\r\nAfterwards it keeps on telling: Type ‘SynchronizationSwift’ does not conform to protocol ‘ObjectiveCProtocol’\r\nAnd it suggests to implement the function again as stated above.\r\n\r\nI can get rid of the compilation error when adding a ? or ! as follows:\r\n\r\npublic func withCompletion(_ completion: ResultBlock?) {}\r\n\r\nBut this gives me a warning: Parameter of ‘withCompletion’ has different optionality than expected by protocol ‘ObjectiveCProtocol’\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project in Xcode\r\n2. Build the code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected to suggest correct protocol implementation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIncorrect suggestion that results in the same compilation error that we are trying the fix\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.1 (8T61a)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCODE ON GITHUB: https://github.com/wvpelt/xcode-compilation-issue"
