    description: "Summary:\r\nSelection in lists in the artists view is partially broken, compared to the rest of the OS. Say you want to select items 1-4 and 7-9 in a list. In Finder, you can achieve that with cmd and shift clicking (as detailed below in steps to reproduce). And it works in every standard list view. But it doesn't in iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou can try it in Finder and in iTunes and compare the results\r\n1. Select item 1\r\n2. hold down the shift key and select item 4\r\n=> items 1 through 4 are selected\r\n3. hold down the cmd-key\r\n4. Select item 7\r\n=> items 1 through 4 and item 7 are selected\r\n5. Now press the shift key\r\n6. select item 9\r\n=> iTunes: items 7 through 9 are selected\r\n=> Finder: items 1 through 4 and 7 through 9 are selected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsame behaviour as in Finder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes forgot about the first part of the selection\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.5.1.21 Mac OS 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
