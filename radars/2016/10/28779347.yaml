    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's easy in Xcode to view the generated assembly for an Objective C file, but the same menu item is always disabled when focused on a Swift source file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Focus on a Swift source file.\r\n2. Select Product -> Perform Action from the menu bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Assemble menu item should be enabled, and selecting it should generate assembly code that the active Swift source file would generate upon compilation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu item is disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n10.12 (16A323) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can understand why the \"Preprocess\" item is disabled, because there is no (I think?) preprocess stage, per se, for Swift. Maybe this item got disabled inadvertently in the midst of disabling Preprocess for Swift?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
