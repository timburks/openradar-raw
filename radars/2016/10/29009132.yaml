    description: "Summary:\r\nThe SDK interface to the `trackingMode` property of `NSSegmentedControl` has been incorrectly marked `@available(OSX 10.10.3, *)` when in fact it is only one of the values for `NSSegmentSwitchTracking` that should be so marked. This causes a compiler error which must be worked around.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an Xcode project for macOS with a deployment version of 10.9 and including a source file containing this code (it can be included in the applicationDidFinishLaunching method, for example):\r\n\r\n    let segmented = NSSegmentedControl(frame: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 85, height: 40))\r\n    segmented.trackingMode = .momentary\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project should build successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode reports a compiler error, both in the source editor and when building the project:\r\n\r\nerror: 'trackingMode' is only available on OS X 10.10.3 or newer\r\n            segmented.trackingMode = .momentary\r\n                      ^\r\nnote: add 'if #available' version check\r\n            segmented.trackingMode = .momentary\r\n                      ^\r\nnote: add @available attribute to enclosing instance method\r\n            segmented.trackingMode = .momentary\r\n                      ^\r\nnote: add @available attribute to enclosing extension\r\n            segmented.trackingMode = .momentary\r\n                      ^\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1 (8B62)\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2657)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEvidence on the Internet suggests that this has been a problem as far back as Xcode 7.\r\nIt may be possible to work around the problem by using key-value code to set the property, but this should not be required."
