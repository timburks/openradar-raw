    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation of UIPasteboard does not say anything about thread safety. Given that the general pasteboard is a shared resource across different processes and given the fact that starting with iOS 10 it even makes network requests to retrieve items from other devices, I would assume the pasteboard is thread safe. However as it belongs to UIKit and UIKit has the golden rule of not being thread safe unless stated otherwise somewhere in their documentation, I am really not sure about this.\r\n\r\nThere should be something in the documentation mentioning this, one way or another. Especially as there are quite some use cases where accessing it on a background thread is very useful as it otherwise may block the main thread (rdar://28787338)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nUIPasteboard - https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uipasteboard\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
