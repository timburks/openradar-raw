    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a workspace with multiple projects (ex. iOS & tvOS), Interface Builder will not let you set a custom class in one project where a class with the same name, but different parent class, exists in the other project, even though the classes are not in the same project or apart of the same target.\r\n\r\nIf you open the individual project files, you are able to set the custom class as expected. However, when you open the Workspace again and click the arrow in the \"Class\" field in the Identity Inspector, you are always taken to the same class.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nI have created a sample project where I have an iOS project that uses Objective-C and a tvOS project that uses Swift. The iOS project uses a UIViewController, named ViewController, as it's custom class for the root view. The tvOS project has a UITabBarController, also named ViewController, as it's custom class for the root view. In the storyboard for the iOS project, I am able to select \"ViewController\" for the \"Custom Class\". In the storyboard for the tvOS project, I am NOT able to select \"ViewController\" for the \"Custom Class\". If I open the tvOS project on it's own (not using the Workspace), I am then able to select \"ViewController\" for the \"Custom Class\" and everything works as expected. I now go back to the Workspace and open the storyboard for the tvOS project, \"ViewController\" IS still selected for the \"Custom Class\", however; selecting the arrow icon in the \"Class\" field that is supposed to open the class file in the Editor window, ViewController.h is opened, instead of ViewController.swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample project. The example has already been configured as described in the steps below - all you need to do is attempt to set the Custom Class for the Tab Bar Controller in the tvOS project storyboard.\r\n\r\nYou may also perform the following steps to reproduce separately:\r\nPart 1\r\n1. Create a Workspace\r\n2. Create an iOS project that uses Objective-C and add it to the workspace\r\n3. Add UIViewController subclass to the iOS project and name it \"ViewController\".\r\n4. Add a \"View Controller\" object to the iOS project's storyboard\r\n5. Set \"ViewController\" as the Custom Class for the storyboard's UIViewController scene\r\n6. Create a tvOS project that uses Swift and add it to the workspace\r\n7. Add a UITabBarController subclass to the tvOS project and name it \"ViewController\"\r\n8. Add a \"Tab Bar Controller\" to the tvOS project's storyboard\r\n9. Click the drop-down in the \"Class\" field in the \"Custom Class\" section of the Identity Inspector\r\n10. \"ViewController\" is not visible as an option.\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\n11. Close the workspace and open the tvOS project on its own\r\n12. Open the tvOS project's storyboard and select the \"Tab Bar Controller\" scene added earlier\r\n13. Click the drop-down in the \"Class\" field in the \"Custom Class\" section of the Identity Inspector\r\n14. You are now able to select \"View Controller\" as the custom class\r\n15. Close the tvOS project\r\n16. Open the Workspace again\r\n17. Open the tvOS project's storyboard\r\n18. Select the \"Tab Bar Controller\" scene - \"ViewController\" is still selected as the Custom Class\r\n19. Click the arrow icon in the \"Class\" field in the \"Custom Class\" section of the Identity Inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPart 1:\r\nI expect to be able set a custom view controller to any class I have in the project that the storyboard belongs to.\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nI expect to be taken to the actual custom class for the project the storyboard belongs to\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPart 1:\r\nI am not able to set a custom class for an objects of different types\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nSelecting the arrow icon in the tvOS project takes me to the custom class file in the iOS project.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 (8A218a)"
