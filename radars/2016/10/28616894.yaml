    description: 'When using the new token based authentication for APNs (instead of the traditional certificates) the APNs connection hangs and sometimes times out after a few minutes without a response. Also the notification doesn''t get send. When there is a valid structured JWT token this issue happens (if encoded wrong or such it replies Invalid).
