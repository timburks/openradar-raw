    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen invalidating a view backed by a CATiledLayer, a previous tile remains \"stuck\" and isn't correctly invalidated.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen when the view is invalidated (on the main thread), while at the same time, the tile render threads are still working on a previous version of the tile. Instead of caching the new version of the tile, the previous version is cached.\r\n\r\nThe view backed by CATiledLayer is a subview of a UIScrollView and is zoomable. The rendering of a tile can be expensive and can use the render thread for 10ms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe attached example app demonstrates this problem.\r\n\r\n1. In a CATiledLayer, start rendering all red tiles (this would take about 3 seconds to complete)\r\n2. Each render step takes about 10ms\r\n3. During rendering (after 800ms), invalidate the complete view (setNeedsDisplay)\r\n4. Start rendering all gray tiles (this again takes about 3 seconds)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll tiles should become gray\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo tiles (randomly?) remain red\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, iOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCode is also available here: https://github.com/Q42/CATiledLayerBug\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro 12\""
