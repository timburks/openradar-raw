    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Compressor 4.3 command-line interface seems to be ignoring whatever value is set for the \"-locationpath\" parameter.\r\n\r\nEven when explicitly setting the path and filename that you want to write the output file to, the Compressor 4.3 CLI will write the file to the same folder as the source file, and ignores whatever filename you have explicitly set in the -locationpath parameter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upgraded to Compressor 4.3 (from 4.2.2) via Mac App Store (macOS 10.11.6)\r\n\r\n2. Issued Compressor CLI command in Terminal. Example test command: /Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/MacOS/Compressor -computergroup \"This Computer\" -batchname \"KHON\" -jobpath /Volumes/Orson_RAID5/temp/20161030/_master/16HOCC013_2016HolidayTVC_ONLINE.mov  -locationpath /Volumes/Orson_RAID5/temp/20161030/test1234.m4v -in \"01:00:00:00\" -out \"01:00:29:23\" -settingpath /Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/Resources/Settings/Apple\\ Devices/Apple\\ Devices\\ HD\\ \\(Best\\ Quality\\).setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn .m4v file encoded using the \"Apple Devices HD (Best Quality)\" setting should be written to the \"/Volumes/Orson_RAID5/temp/20161030/\" folder, with the filename \"test1234.m4v\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file is properly encoded with the  \"Apple Devices HD (Best Quality)\" setting, but it is written to the incorrect folder, with an incorrect name.\r\n\r\nThe file gets written to the same folder as the source file, and with the same basename as the source file. While this is ok when the file-extension is different from the source, it is disastrous when the extension is the same as the source.\r\n\r\nFor example, specifying the \"/Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/Resources/Settings/ProRes/proRes422Name.setting\", and a -locationpath of \"/foo/bar/test.mov\" will result in the original source file getting clobbered, because Compressor is writing a file with the same filename to the same location as the source.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCompressor 4.3 build 295518\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis issue has been resolved in Compressor 4.3.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue did not occur in Compressor 4.2.2 on the same version of mac OS (10.11.6)"
