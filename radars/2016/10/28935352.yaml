    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Music for iOS 9, there was a button to clear the whole \"Up Next\" queue. The button is gone in iOS 10.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic when for example you just want to play a single song from an artist's album (let's say before going to sleep).\r\n\r\nOn the iOS 9 version of the app, you could:\r\n- Tap the song\r\n- The song would play, and all the following songs in the album would be added to the \"Up Next\" queue\r\n- You could remove all the following songs by tapping the \"Clear\" button\r\n=> The playback would stop after one song.\r\n\r\nOn iOS 10, if you follow the same steps, you need to clear all the following songs of the album one by one, as there is no \"Clear\" button anymore. This a error-prone and very time-consuming.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Music app\r\n2. Find an album you like with multiple songs\r\n3. Tap a song in the album (except the last one)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tapped song and all the following songs in the album are added to the \"Up Next\" queue, and it's possible to clear this queue to play only the one tapped song.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tapped song and all the following songs in the album are added to the \"Up Next\" queue, but you can't clear the queue easily.\r\nSo your options are:\r\n- Clearing the queue by hand, song by song;\r\n- Waiting for then of the one song you wanted to play, then press the Pause button;\r\n- Being sad and miserable, and listening to the whole album.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 to 10.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease bring back the \"Clear\" button :'(\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'music-clear-queue.png' was successfully uploaded."
