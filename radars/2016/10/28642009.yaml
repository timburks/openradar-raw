    description: "Summary:\r\nWithin search ads, there is no targeting for Designated Marketing areas - for instance large metropolitan areas with many included cities. This is exacerbated by rdar://28639380, which does not allow entry of more than 10 markets at a time. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to enter a DMA when adding cities\r\n2. Discover you can’t \r\n3. Ask iOS developers what the hell is going on\r\n4. iOS developer files bug\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDMAs should be able to be added so you don’t have to add the billion suburbs of cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago individually when you wish to use search ads. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDMAs not able to be added -> MARKETING RAGE. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone, search ads is a new product. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLet me know if you want me to get more details from the marketing team on this."
