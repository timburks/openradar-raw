    description: "Felix Krause\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen creating your first push notification certificate, all associated provisioning profiles for the given app will switch the state from \"Active\" to \"Invalid\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clear your Apple Developer Account to have no certificates and no profiles, to make sure everything is in a clean state\r\n2. If necessary, create a new App ID\r\n3. Create a development certificate\r\n4. Create a development provisioning profile associated with the newly created certificate\r\n5. You'll see that the provisioning profile is green with the state \"Valid\"\r\n6. Create a new push notification certificate by switching to the \"Certificates\" tab, \"New\" and select the development push notification certificate typ\r\n7. Upload the signing request file, click on \"Done\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe previously generated provisioning profile should still be valid, as we haven't touched the provisioning profile, nor the certificate\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe previously generated provisioning profile has switched to orange \"Invalid\". The user has to select the provisioning profile, and click on \"Update\" to repair the profile. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
