    description: "Summary:\r\nUIStackView is a non drawing view. So the attributes inspector in Xcode should only display the settings it has, not everything. \r\ne.g. Background color is something which has no effect on a UIStackView, but is still displayed in the attributes inspector on a stack view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 8.0\r\n2. Create a single view application\r\n3. Drag 2 labels into the storyboard and stack them into a UIStackview\r\n4. Check the attributes inspector for the stackview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBackground color, and any drawing properties which the stack view cannot rendered should not be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDrawing options, including background color are displayed\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a), OSX El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1004)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot attached. Almost lost 20 minutes debugging why the background color is not coming up."
