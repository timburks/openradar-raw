    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen getaddrinfo() function is called with the local host name, for example, Johns-MacBook-Pro.local, it hangs for about 5 seconds. It only happens when File Sharing is disabled in the system sharing preferences.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure file sharing is disabled in system preferences.\r\n2. Manually determine the host name of the local computer and set it, if necessary, to something ending with ‘.local’ like Johns-MacBook-Pro.local.\r\n3. Either run the command: dscacheutil -q host -a name Johns-MacBook-Pro.local\r\nor run the command-line utility from the attached Xcode project.\r\n4. You should see a hang of approximately 5 seconds.\r\n5. Enable file sharing in system preferences.\r\n6. Run the same resolution command again.\r\n7. There should be no delay.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt was expected to see no delay in local name resolution regardless of file sharing enabled state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere was a delay when calling getaddrinfo() with local host name ending in ‘.local’ when file sharing was disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf necessary, flush the DNS cache before attempting to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppears on macOS 10.12 including beta 3. Does not appear on previous macOS versions.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Getaddrinfo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
