    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you open an old Xcode 7 iOS project in Xcode 8 the simulators are all missing, and it is not possible to add any simulators, Xcode appears to be in a broken state. A workaround is required to fix it (in additional notes below).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS project in Xcode 7.\r\n2. Open the project in Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSimulators should be usable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimulators are missing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can workaround this issue by quitting Xcode 8, right clicking on the xcodeproj to show package contents and delete the xcuserdata folder. Now opening the project again in Xcode 8 and the simulators have returned. Unfortunately any time an Xcode 7 project is openened in the future then this bug returns again. So something is wrong with the xcuserdata between Xcode versions, it is not backwards compatible maybe.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
