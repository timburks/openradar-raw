    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need to validate renewed auto-renewable subscriptions for ”iOS 7 style transaction receipts”. Currently only it’s only available for ”iOS 6 style transaction receipts for auto-renewable subscriptions.” according to the documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH104-SW1\r\n\r\nSimply ”iOS 7 style transaction receipts” needs the latest_receipt field, just as the old receipts had.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1, Have an auto-renewable subscription (one month), for a service both available on the iPhone and the web. Let’s say it’s a TV-show with new episodes every week.\r\n2, Purchase the subscription (one month)\r\n3, Wait one month, let the subscription renew but don’t open the app.\r\n4, Visit the web-page to watch the TV-show\r\n5, To verify that the user is subscribing, try to verify the latest receipt - but there is none.\r\n6, Ask the user to go home and find hers/his phone, open the app and click ”Restore purchases”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe field ”latest_receipt” being populated with the latest receipt, so we can know if the customer is still subscribing or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly available for ”iOS 6 style transaction receipts”\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince ”iOS 6 style transaction receipts” is deprecated but not removed, you can still get the latest_receipt-field by fetching those as well (or instead of the newer receipts). This means that by since ”iOS 7 style receipts” has less functionality than the older ones, Apple are incentivizing its third-party developers to keep using legacy code. For an unwelcome surprise when the deprecated functions are finally removed. A situation that will make nobody happy.\r\n\r\nIf the purpose of this is to prevent auto-renewable subscriptions to be used for multi-platform services it should be clearly stated that this is the case - AND - Apple must not prevent third-party payments in our apps."
