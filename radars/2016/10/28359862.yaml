    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn our mail server (accessed by IMAP) there's a folder tree under the read-only (possible error source!) folder \"user\", which is completely missing after refreshing the mailboxes view (by pull down to refresh). It was there up to iOS 9.3.3 and is also there after first setup of the account. This issue does occur with multiple user accounts, so it's not permission related. All other IMAP folders are shown correctly, except the read-only one with multiple subfolders (up to 5 levels).\r\n\r\nPlaying with the IMAP Inbox Prefix (setting to \"user\") temporarily solves the problem, but only shows folders under \"user\". Inbox, Sent, etc aren't shown any more (=> useless). Leaving the IMAP Inbox Prefix to default dosn't show \"user\" and its subfolders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove IMAP account\r\n2. Reboot device\r\n3. Add IMAP account \r\n4. Open Mail.app\r\n5. All the missing mailboxes are there\r\n5. Pull down to refresh \r\n6. \"user\" folder is missing, other IMAP folders are there\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRead-only folder \"user\" with all its subfolders is shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRead-only folder \"user\" is missing after refresh of mailboxes view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0.1 [14A403] (both devices)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64 GB and iPhone 6s 16 GB"
