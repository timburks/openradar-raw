    description: "Summary: If there are multiple alarms for the same time, and the newest-made one doesn't repeat on the current day, when you ask Siri to turn on the alarm, you ain't gonna be waking up when you want to. It turns on the most recent alarm, whether or not it includes the current day \U0001F62E‚è∞\U0001F52B\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Create an alarm at a given time.\r\n2. Create a second alarm at the same time, setting the repeat to not include the current day.\r\n3. Ask Siri to turn on the alarm for that time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Siri would turn on the alarm for the current day.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Notice that the most recently created alarm is turned on, even though it doesn't include today. \r\n\r\nVersion: 10.0.2/14A456\r\n\r\nNotes: This bug may well have been present in earlier versions of iOS, but I'm not sure of that. This is the first that I've noticed it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iOS 10.0.2 on an iPhone 5S.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_1466.PNG', 'IMG_1464.PNG' and 'IMG_1465.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
