    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://28666439\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs a developer I need to have a way to browse documentation easily and reliably. This was always possible with Dash, until Apple removed it from the store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to the store\r\n- Search for Dash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe well known dash app is shown in both, the iOS and Mac AppStore and I can purchase and download it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not available. According to https://blog.kapeli.com this is the case because Apple removed it from sales.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS, macOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is very essential for the daily work of every developer to have a good way to browse documentations. Sadly Xcode’s integrated documentation browser is far from perfect. It is slow, has a very limited feature set, is not available on iOS, and doesn’t work with third party documentation. Therefore not being able to use Dash is a huge cut in productivity.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
