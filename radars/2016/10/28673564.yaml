    description: "Summary:\nWhen mixing @IBInspectable and @objc on a single property, order appears to matter in whether the inspectable UI will appear in IB.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a Swift iOS single-view app from the Xcode template.\n2. Add the following snippet (ugly wrapping for Radar purposes only):\n\nextension UILabel {\n\n    @IBInspectable\n    @objc(myPropertyObjC)\n    public var\n    myProperty: String {\n        get {\n            return \"foo\"\n        }\n        set {\n            \n        }\n    }\n}\n\n3. Open Main.storyboard in the storyboard editor, a.k.a. “IB”.\n4. Drag out a UILabel to the storyboard.\n5. Look for the myProperty inspectable interface at the top of the Attributes Inspector.\n\nExpected Results:\nAn editor for “My Property” will appear at the top of the Attributes Inspector.\n\nActual Results:\nNo such editor appears.\n\nRegression:\nUnknown, but reproducible in Xcode 8.0 and 8.1b2.\n\nNotes:\nTo make the editor UI appear in IB, swap the @IBInspectable line with the @objc line:\n\n    @objc(myPropertyObjC)\n    @IBInspectable\n    public var\n    myProperty: String {\n\nNow the “My Property” editor will show up in IB.\n\nExample project also uploaded here: https://cl.ly/hhmF"
