Not so easy to reproduce in the sample app, so please have patience. It will occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Copy an image in Photos app.\r\n2. Launch sample app on your iOS device. It should show the copied image.\r\n3. Copy some text on a mac that Handoff to your iOS device.\r\n4. Wait to see the image disappear.(If it doesn't disappear it is another UIPasteboard Handoff bug that makes pasteboard content transferring unreliable.)\r\n5. Wait longer(may take as long as several minutes) to see image appear again.\r\n6. Wait longer(may take as long as several minutes) to see the image disappear again.\r\n7. Repeat 5~6.
