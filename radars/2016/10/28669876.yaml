    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a two-factor authentication notification is displayed on multiple devices simultaneously, engaging with and dismissing the notification on one device should cause the notification to gracefully disappear from all other devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith a two-factor authentication protected account:\r\n\r\n1. Arrange to have two or more devices configured as trusted for a given Apple ID. For example, a Mac and an iPhone.\r\n\r\n2. Go to an Apple-ID protected resources in Safari on the Mac. For example, log in to bugreport.apple.com.\r\n\r\n3. Log in and confirm that the notification, asking to approve the login appears on all devices.\r\n\r\n4. Engage with and confirm the authentication on the Mac, obtaining a login code and completing the login.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe authentication notification on all other devices should disappear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification remains visible, even a long time after the login has occurred. This leaves the user in a confounding situation where they are later benig asked to approve a login which is no longer pertinent. They must either \"approve\" it in retrospect, thus gaining a login code that they didn't really want anymore, or disapprove it, yielding a message that there is danger of infiltration to the user's account.\r\n\r\nAt some stage: whether it's as soon as the notification is engaged/dismissed on one device, or after the login that prompted the notifications to appear has completely logged in, the notifications should disappear on all devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
