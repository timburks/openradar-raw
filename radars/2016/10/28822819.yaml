    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEven if I cycled for a long time,\r\nCMMotionActivityManager never returns CMMotionActivity \r\nin which the value of 'cycling' is 'true'.\r\nThe value of 'cycling' is always 'false'.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading my iPhone to iOS 10, the value is always 'false'.\r\nBefore upgrading (i.e. in iOS 9), I could get some results in which the value is 'true'.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Cycle with iPhone for a while\r\n2. Check the history of CMMotionActivity by calling CMMotionActivityManager.queryActivityStarting\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can get some CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true'.\r\n\r\n# Of course, I understand that the motion processor sometimes fails to estimate the user's motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHowever, I can not get any CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true' after upgrading to iOS 10.\r\nBefore upgrading, I could get some CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true'.\r\n# I ride my bicycle every weekday.\r\n\r\nI wrote an app for iPhone to check all of CMMotionActivity cached (7 days).\r\n https://github.com/river24/CyclingChecker\r\nThis app shows the CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true'.\r\n\r\nWith this app, I checked on the following environments:\r\n - NG : iPhone SE 64GB (SIM Free) + iOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n - NG : iPhone 6s 16GB (SIM Free) + iOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n - OK : iPhone 6s 16GB (SIM Free) + iOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n - OK : iPhone 6 16GB (SIM Free) + iOS 8.3 (12F70)\r\n\r\n * OK : Get some CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true'\r\n   NG : Get no CMMotionActivity in which the 'cycling' value is 'true'\r\n   I carried all iPhones together\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB (SIM Free)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
