    description: "Thomas Zoechling\r\n05-Oct-2016 12:23 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApplications that load assets from the catalog crash when the following conditions are met:\r\n - The app is built with Xcode 8 on macOS 10.12 \r\n - The app is launched on OS X 10.11 \r\n - The asset is a PDF\r\n - The asset uses a \"Template\" suffix\r\n - The asset has RTL layout options set (like \"Mirror\" or \"Both\")\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCheck the attached sample for a pre-configured project that exposes the issue.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new macOS project in Xcode\r\n2. Add a simple button that can hold an image to the UI\r\n3. Drag a black & white PDF Template asset to the asset catalog\r\n4. Set a RTL option like \"Right to Left, Mirrors\" in the asset catalog inspector\r\n5. Assign that image as the button's image\r\n6. Compile the app with Xcode 8 on macOS Sierra\r\n7. Copy the .app bundle to a machine running OS X 10.11 and launch the app\r\n8. Note that the app crashes during nib/asset loading\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app works when launched on OS X 10.11\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes when the affected asset is loaded from the catalog.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBuild configuration: MacBook Pro 15'', macOS Sierra 10.12\r\nRuntime configuration: MacBook Pro 15'', OS X 10.11.6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AssetCatalogRTLCrashPDF.zip' was successfully uploaded."
