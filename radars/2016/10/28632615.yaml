    description: "Summary:\r\nImplement a mode where, when logging into a Mac remotely, the (remote) Mac's display stays locked or 'dark' while I'm using it.\r\n\r\nI've seen this called \"Curtain mode\"\r\n\r\nIn this feature request, I'll refer to the remote Mac I'm logging into as 'mac mini' and the Mac I'm sitting at as \"macbook\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLock my mac mini, walk away.\r\nLog into macbook, screen share into mini\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmini's Thunderbolt display stays off (optionally?) while I read email, check web sites, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnyone in eyeshot can see what I'm doing on the mac mini. Since I'm potentially on the other side of the house/country/world, I have not idea who might be watching (slight exaggeration, but...)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of El Capitan, Sierra 10.12.1 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI may be logging in FROM a VNC client on my iPad or even (gasp) a Windows machine, so the ideal implementation for me would be an option on the \"Sharing\" preference pane to \"Hide Display while Logged in remotely\".\r\n\r\nAlso ideal would be a toggle in the menu bar item that comes up when I'm logged in remotely, to disable the preference for the current session (say, if I'm logged in and I want someone to see what I'm doing).\r\n\r\nNice to have would be some notification on the screen saver, e.g. \"Alan is logged in remotely from IP 192.168.100.5\" -- while I'm using it, in case someone hacked me. ;)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\"Remote\" Mac running El Capitan or Sierra (that I'm logging on to)\r\n\"Local\" Mac, PC, iPad, etc. that I'm holding/using to log into the Remote."
