        I'd like to reuse artwork for the most similar language, not the default language.

        Example: When I define "English", "French" and "French (Canada)" as languages and supply screenshots for English and French, I'd like to reuse the French screenshots for "French (Canada"), not the English screenshots.

        However, I only have a checkbox to reuse the English screenshots since English is the default language for the app.

        So I have to upload all French screenshots again for "French (Canada)". With 5 iOS screen resolutions and 2 watchOS screen resolutions and iOS and iMessage app this makes 60 screenshots I have to upload again. :(
