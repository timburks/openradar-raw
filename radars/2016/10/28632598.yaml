        Summary:
        DEP is not available in every country. This is a massive issues for large companies such as Facebook, Google, IBM, etc. We *cannot* use DEP unless it is available in every country we opertate in (or there is some alternate way to enroll in DEP).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have an office in Brazil
        2. Can't get DEP

        Expected Results:
        Be able to use DEP from vendors in Brazil

        Actual Results:
        Can't use DEP because it isn't supported in Brazil

        Notes:
        Brazil is just one example, but there are many countries where DEP is not available, which means we must get DEP'd machines in the US and wait 6 months for things to get through customs. This isn't feasible as it makes logistics pipelines a nightmare.
