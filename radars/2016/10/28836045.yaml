        Summary:
        When debugging a ReplayKit broadcast extension, every time I step in the debugger, another thread is spawned to deal with an incoming frame.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a ReplayKit UI and broadcast extension
        2. Configure the extension to use a sample handler
        3. Launch the broadcast extension into an app, with the debugger active
        4. Put a breakpoint in the - (void)processSampleBuffer:(CMSampleBufferRef)sampleBuffer withType:(RPSampleBufferType)sampleBufferType method
        5. Step through that method line by line

        Expected Results:
        6. A single handler thread is used to process the callbacks into my code, dropping frames if the handler is too slow (e g when slowly stepping through the callback

        Actual Results:
        6. Each time I step, another thread is spawned to handle incoming frames, all pausing on my breakpoint and it becomes very difficult to follow along what’s actually happening


        Notes:
        Are you just dispatch_async’ing to a delegate queue for every frame? Won’t that completely saturate the CPU if the handler is every too slow in handling just a handfull of frames, spawning threads until a watchdog kills the process?

        I learned a few weeks ago that dispatch_async is really bad for the producer-consumer pattern, as there’s no facility for push-back when the consumer is too slow (causing this exact issue in my own app, eventually watchdog-killing the app).
