    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is difficult for users to find iMessage apps. We have an existing iOS app with lots of users, and they are having trouble finding and enabling our iMessage app. It would be nice if there was an API for our main app could launch the iMessage app to help the users along. This should work both in the case where the user has enabled and has not yet enabled our iMessage app.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have to provide users with a long set of instructions on how to find and enable the iMessage app, and it is very cumbersome."
