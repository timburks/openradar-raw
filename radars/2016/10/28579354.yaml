    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I register an observer against a user preference, my observer is called multiple times with the exact same information. This causes problems when I need to do something like play an audio file in response to the user changing a preference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached project\r\n2. Check or uncheck the MyKey checkbox\r\n3. Observe observeValueForKeyPath being called multiple times with the same values.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nObserver should be notified once, as there is only one change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nObserver is notified multiple times with the same information \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12 (16A323)\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a)"
