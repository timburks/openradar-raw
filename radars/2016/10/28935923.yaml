    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 10.1 was just released and I hoped that all my star ratings would show up again in Music.app on my iPhone. But star ratings are still gone. I think a switch in settings, whether one wanted to use stars or hearts would be great.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Music.app, look around for the star ratings of the songs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsomewhere, being able to look at the star ratings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nno star ratings to be found.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 -> iOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 32GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
