        Summary:
        When attempting to run unit tests for AFNetworking in Xcode 8 and iOS 10, and the test suite routinely crashes and hangs. Inspecting the stack trace, it points to a method inside [__NSURLBackgroundSession setupBackgroundSession] waiting on a semaphore.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Check out `e035bdd` from the AFNetworking repository on Github. Run the unit tests on the iOS target. Should hang within 1-3 runs.

        Expected Results:
        No hang

        Actual Results:
        Hang
