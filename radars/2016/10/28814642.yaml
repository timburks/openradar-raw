    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the JS onbeforeunload event, the dialogue is only shown until the user chooses to navigate away.\r\nOn subsequent pages on the same site, the onbeforeunload function is called, but the dialogue is no longer shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new tab and navigate to any page (e.g. apple.com)\r\n2. Open the JS console and paste the following:\r\n    window.onbeforeunload = function() {return true;};\r\n3. Click on the page\r\n4. Hit Refresh\r\n5. *Observe the warning is shown*\r\n6. Click to stay\r\n7. Hit Refresh again\r\n8. *Observe the warning is shown*\r\n9. Click to leave (the page will refresh)\r\n10. Paste exactly the same code in the JS console again\r\n11. Hit refresh\r\n12. *Observe that the warning is not shown* :(\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dialogue should once again confirm whether you wish to leave\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialogue does not confirm\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G1004); Safari: Version 9.1.3 (11601.7.8)\r\n\r\nOSX: 10.12 (16A323); Safari: Version 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the user navigates to a different site (e.g. initially on apple.com, then moves to icloud.com) then the dialogue is shown for one page on that site too. Upon navigating back to the first site, it works there again for one time.\r\n\r\nHaving the JS return nothing:\r\n    window.onbeforeunload = function() {return;}\r\ninstead of clicking on the Leave button means that subsequent pages work, but this doesn't really solve the issues with the typical usage of this feature - e.g. to confirm whether a user wants to move away from a page after making changes to a form.\r\n\r\nSee https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-56465 for our internal issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air 11\" Mid 2013 \r\nMacBook Pro 13\" Mid 2013\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
