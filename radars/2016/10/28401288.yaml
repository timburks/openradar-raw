    description: "Facing an issue with Xcode 8. While i open my existing old project with storyboards, most of the UIViews and all the UIScrollView subviews are miss aligning and subview's height and width becomes double (like width:320 becomes 640). It looks like there is a layout bug in Xcode 8. Mostly the issues are with UIScrollView subviews layout. On redesigning layout, saved and closed the Xcode. If i open the same project with Xcode 8 again, this time again layout frame is changing for scrollviews and few UITabeViewCell contents centring to one location. Too much time is wasting because of this bug in Xcode 8. Kindly resolve it as soon as possible. We cannot use Xcode 8 until a new release comes from Apple.\r\n\r\nVersion: Xcode 8 (Build: 8A218a). Mac OS X EI Capiton Version:10.11.6 (15G1004)."
