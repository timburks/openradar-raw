    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEmoji flags are just graphical representations of Unicode region indicators, which consist of two characters each and map almost 1:1 to ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 codes. From a technical point of view it makes absolute sense to sort them alphabetically by code, but this is opaque to users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. select the Flags section from the emoji soft keyboard\r\n2. try to find the “American flag” or the “flag of Great Britain”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers quickly find the right flag they’re looking for. This includes flags of their or their ancestors’ home countries, current, previous and future locations, previously used flags, locations of contacts, trending countries in the news …\r\n\r\nThese should either be highlighted (e.g. by size or color) or appear (also) on top of the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPeople accidentally use the wrong flag, even for their own country, e.g. the Liberian \U0001F1F1\U0001F1F7 or Malaysian \U0001F1F2\U0001F1FE instead of the US flag \U0001F1FA\U0001F1F8 – and get ridiculed for it. Some flags are virtually indistinguishable at small size or bad lighting, e.g. Ireland \U0001F1EE\U0001F1EA vs. Italy \U0001F1EE\U0001F1F9 and Netherlands \U0001F1F3\U0001F1F1 vs. Luxembourg \U0001F1F1\U0001F1FA, or are just the same colors in reverse order, e.g. Poland \U0001F1F5\U0001F1F1 and Indonesia \U0001F1EE\U0001F1E9, or rotated, e.g. Hungary \U0001F1ED\U0001F1FA and Italy \U0001F1EE\U0001F1F9, or differ only in an (optional) emblem, e.g. Italy \U0001F1EE\U0001F1F9 and Mexico \U0001F1F2\U0001F1FD. \r\n\r\nOther people abuse a national flag as a stand-in for a non-existing one, e.g. the Chilenian flag \U0001F1E8\U0001F1F1 for Texas. \r\n\r\nUsers frequently fail to find the flag they’re looking for altogether and complain. They are also looking for non-national flags in that section, e.g. White \U0001F3F3, Black \U0001F3F4 and Checkered Flag \U0001F3C1 or the ZWJ sequences Rainbow Flag (“Gay Pride” / “Peace”) or Skull and Bones (“Jolly Rogers”). A frequent complaint is that “the American flag” is listed almost last instead of (almost) first.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 and before\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS 10 offers to replace country names typed in by the flag, but that doesn’t solve the UX issue for those using the graphical search approach.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
