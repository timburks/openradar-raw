    description: "Peter Steinberger\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSystem Slow/Unresponsive\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI can't pinpoint this to 100% nor can I provide a sample app, but I've seen again and again new weird complete freezes after the text loupe should be gone and just before the menu that shows \"Paste\" (IF available) comes up for text inputs.\r\n\r\nThis is really disruptive and annoying and I blame Universal Clipboard. This never happened before iOS 10, and I it only happens when my Mac is open and I'm in a WiFi. Also only sometimes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBe in WiFi\r\nHave Mac open and configured so that Universal Clipboard works (magic, I guess have a shared Apple account? Not documented how this actually works - it just does)\r\nUse apps. Observe sporadic slowdowns.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not freeze whole app for 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFreezes app. Very disruptive. Or, as Trump would say it:\r\n\r\nSad. Inefficient. Weak!\r\n\r\n(OT: please don't vote for someone who treats women that way, the world is watching.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1, also happened with 10.1b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther people have similar issues, I found rdar://28774309 which reports something similar but shorter.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
