    description: "Area:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niPhone cannot find a beacon in region even the beacon is always beside the phone (in 50 cm) when the app is in background and the 'Uses Bluetooth LE accessories'  background mode is enabled.\r\nThe TxPower of beacon is +4dB (maximum), and advertising interval was 800ms, 500 ms and 350 ms.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. clone https://github.com/SanggeonPark/iOSRangedBeaconInRegionProblem.git\r\nand run it on the phone.\r\n2. Start advertising iBeacon with \"73676723-7400-0000-FFFF-0000FFFF0007\" proximity UUID very close by the phone. Set TxPower of beacon as +4dB (max) and Advertising interval as 800 ms.\r\n3. Press home button on the phone to put the app in the background.\r\n4. After an hour open the app and check the ranged beacon in region event.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app could get the ranged beacons through the CLLocationManagerDelegate method (locationManager: didRangeBeacons:inRegion:) call even the app is running in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOver 30% of CLLocationManagerDelegate method (locationManager: didRangeBeacons:inRegion:) calls doesn't deliver any beacon. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0.2 (14A456) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64GB Model A1688"
