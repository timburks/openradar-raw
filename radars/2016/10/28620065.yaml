    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWeb clips (single page web-apps added to home screen) display differently when you open them from the homescreen directly, and when you open them from the SpringBoard search. When opened from the homescreen, the Safari toolbars are hidden (which is desirable), but not when opened from search.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit a single page web app, (e.g. https://on.here).\r\n2. Tap the \"Add Bookmark\" icon, and add the web app to your home screen.\r\n3. Test opening the app by tapping the icon on the home screen.\r\n4. Note that the web app will run without any Safari toolbars, appearing more like a native app.\r\n5. Now search for the same web clip from the home screen search (e.g. type \"on.here\").\r\n6. Tap on the web clip icon in the search results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe web app displays as if you opened it directly from the home screen, with no Safari toolbars.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are Safari toolbars when the web app is opened from SpringBoard search.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 (14A456)"
