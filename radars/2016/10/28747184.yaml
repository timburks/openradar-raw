    description: "Summary:\r\nUsers are reporting that occasionally, a system-level prompt asking for access to the system's Twitter account store appears. The request always comes from an app named \"exited?\". Regardless of whether the user taps OK or Don't Allow, the dialog immediately reappears. The only solution is to reboot the device.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot displaying the system-level dialog. Public reports can be seen at:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7522442?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7574864?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7322073?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttp://www.redmondpie.com/fix-ios-exited-would-like-access-to-twitter-accounts-issue-heres-how/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnable to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis system level dialog should only appear in response to a particular app requesting access to the system's store of Twitter accounts. The app requesting access should actually be an app that is on the users' device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis system level dialog appears when no action has been taken that would result in a change in access to the system store of Twitter accounts. Additionally, there is no app installed on the users' devices named \"exited?\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSeen in iOS 7 beta and above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nunknown"
