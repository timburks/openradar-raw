        Summary:
        When using Voice Over and Bluetooth kicks in and changes the audio output to the Bluetooth speaker there is no announcement that the audio input will change. This could lead to a situation where suddenly Voice Over appears to stop working (while it is actually working fine but playing on the external audio source). Which is pretty hard to debug if you rely on Voice Over.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Setup a Bluetooth speaker
        2. Pair your phone with it
        3. Wander outside the range of the speaker
        4. Enable Voice Over
        5. Wander back in range of the speaker

        Expected Results:
        Siri asks you "Do you want to change audio inputs?" (or just announces that the output will change)

        Actual Results:
        The output just changes without the Voice Over user knowing it (except the output stops working)

        Regression:
        /

        Notes:
        My (blind) brother ran into this last week. He called me to notify that "Voice over" wasn't working or at least was working sometimes but not all the time. It wasn't until I (with vision) was able to look at his phone that I discovered that the Audio output was rerouted to the Bluetooth speaker (in another room).

        So as a blind user some kind of notification or even a "Are you sure?" prompt would help in making him able to fix this problem himself. So help me help you help him :)
