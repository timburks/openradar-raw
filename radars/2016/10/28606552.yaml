    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you call an initializer that has an @objc protocol argument on an NSObject subclass, it is reported leaks the argument being passed according to both Instruments and the Memory Graph, but it's actually a false positive (doing the same thing in a loop doesn't cause memory to grow).\r\n\r\nThis was originally reported as a bug on Swift: https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2839\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAlternative 1: \r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample project\r\n2. Click Debug Memory Graph\r\n\r\nAlternative 2:\r\n1. Instrument the attached sample project using the Leaks instrument\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNeither the Memory Graph nor Instruments should report a leaked `Inner` object\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth the Memory Graph and Instruments should report a leaked `Inner` object\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LeakReproduce.zip' was successfully uploaded."
