    description: "Area:\r\nHomeKit (Home app)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nHomeKit and the Home app should be able to understand who is currently at a home. Currently, the Home app shows the location symbol on the home you are in but is not aware of other guests or admins that are in the home.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\nUser A has an automation set up so that if they leave the location of the home, the lights turn off. This works fine when a single person lives at this location.\r\n\r\nUser B also has access to the home and is planning to stay at home today. As User A leaves the house the lights turn off leaving User B in the dark. \r\n\r\nHomeKit/Home.app should have the ability to set the condition of \"users present/not present\" on an automation to prevent this situation happening. For example \"Turn the lights off when I leave if nobody is home\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Give two users access to the same home\r\n2. Set up an automation so that lights turn off when you leave\r\n3. One user leaves and all the lights turn off\r\n4. The second user is now sat in the dark\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHomeKit should be aware of presence and prevent automation based on presence\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. HomeKit runs the automation and turns out all the lights\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 [14A456]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S 64GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
