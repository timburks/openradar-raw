    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app is intermittently exhibiting behavior that indicates that NSUserDefaults is not returning previously stored values. In all cases, our app is in the foreground and visible on-screen. \r\n\r\nFor example, we store boolean values for whether a user has gone through the onboarding flow or seen various interstitials in NSUserDefaults. Our analytics have recorded a sharp increase in Onboarding screen views and interstitial events on iOS 10, and we have likewise observed this behavior intermittently on our own devices. However, we have not been able to reliably reproduce it. It seems like we just arenâ€™t able to read user defaults sometimes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Store a boolean value in NSUserDefaults on a previous application sessions.\r\n1. Attempt to read the previously stored value in NSUserDefaults.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe previously stored value should be read correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe previously stored value does not appear to be read correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 and higher\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVariety of iPhones (iPhone 6, iPhone 7, etc.)"
