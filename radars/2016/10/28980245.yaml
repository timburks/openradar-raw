    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 removed the ability to load plugins like Alcatraz and Xvim and WakaTime. While the new extension interface is a good step forward, it doesn't provide enough flexibility to implement the great functionalities that such plugins already provide.\r\n\r\nI understand the reasons why this has been done but since the extensions interface is very restrictive, I'm asking for the old plugin architecture to be left available until the extension mechanism becomes more powerful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add Xvim or other plugin to Xcode plugin's folder\r\n2. Open Xcode 8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe plugin loads into Xcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe plugin doesn't load\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a thriving plugin community for Xcode (http://alcatraz.io/) which produced many plugins that make it Xcode easier to use.\r\n\r\nThat thriving community partly stalled due to Xcode 8's restrictions in running 3rd party plugins and some functionality can not be replicated with available official APIs\r\n\r\nI appreciate that there is a new, native Xcode extensibility SDK.  However that SDK is limited in what it can currently do.  Most of the useful plugins in Alcatraz can't be ported to it.\r\n\r\nI, and many other developers (as can be attested here https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz/issues/475) would like one of two things:\r\n\r\n(a) a way to re-enable the old plugin system, without having to resort to disabling OS-wide security protections, for a year until the new Extensions system is fully developed.\r\nOR\r\n(b) accelerated development on the new Extensions system so that it can support the functionality required to port the most popular Alcatraz plugins as soon as possible\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
