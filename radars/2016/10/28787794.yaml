    description: "Throughout Springboard there are SEVERAL UILabels which represent running timers/times which in iOS 10 are not monospaced and therefore cause jittery movements when the timers/times are changing.\r\n\r\nThe 4 cases I've acknowledged the problem are:\r\n1. Music Control Panel Widget\r\n2. Now Playing screen in the lock screen (while playing music)\r\n3. In-call call timer status bar (green)\r\n4. Voice memos recording timer status bar (red)"
