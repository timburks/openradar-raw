Run sample playground to see the bug.\r\n2. Set outputColorSpaceType to extended sRGB to see the correct result.\r\n3. Set toFloat to false and outputColorSpaceType to any type that supports integer format to see that integer format always works correctly.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cwGE060IcdE"
