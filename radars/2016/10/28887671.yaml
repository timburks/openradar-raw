    description: "Summary:\r\nI downloaded and launched Xcode 8.1 beta (8T47). After seeing all of my prebuilt frameworks weren't compatible with Swift 3.0.1, I closed it and haven't opened it since (except to get the version number for this report). Since opening the first time, ⌘/ no longer works in Xcode 8.0 (8A218a). You don't realize how much you use that until it doesn't work :)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode 8.1 beta (8T47)\r\n2. Quit Xcode-beta\r\n3. Launch Xcode 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n4. Press ⌘/ after code has finished indexing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt comments out the current line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The menu item is disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a), Xcode 8.1 beta (8T47), macOS 10.12.1 Beta (16B2553a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n⌘/ works fine in Xcode 8.1 beta (8T47)"
