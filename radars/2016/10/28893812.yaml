    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation (Audio / Video)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis only happens on iOS 10. Previous version of iOS work fine\r\n\r\nUIImagePickerController.cameraFlashMode = .on or .auto or .off always sets the flash mode to off. This happens when showsCameraControls for the UIIMagePickerController instance is set to false. \r\n\r\nWhen showsCameraControls is true the cameraFlashMode is set as expected both with the default flash control as well as programmatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the compressed project - ImaegPickerIssue.zip and run it in Xcode 8 on an iOS 10 device (minor version does not matter, this is reproducible on all release version of iOS10)\r\n2. On the initial screen tap the button that says \"Launch Camera\" - a UIImagePickerController instance will be shown in camera mode. Allow the app to access the camera. The button in the upper left corner shows the current flash state. The state is shown correctly as Auto. The button can also be tapped to change the state.\r\n3. Now tap the button to attempt to cycle through the various flash states.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cameraFlashMode should be set to the correct value as the program dictates when showsCameraControls is false. The button should successively show title as Auto->On->Off\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou will observe that the button always shows \"Off\". If you debug the functions flashButtonTapped and updateFlashTitle you will notice that the cameraFlashMode is always set to off overtime we attempt to change its state.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0.1 (14A403) or any other iOS10 version\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs mentioned, this bug is reproducible on any  iOS10 version. Hardware or minor version of iOS 10 does not matter. From the forums I see that this was a problem in iOS 10 beta too.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNA - this bug is iOS 10 specific and occurs on all iOS devices that are installed with any version of iOS10\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImagePickerIssue.zip' was successfully uploaded."
