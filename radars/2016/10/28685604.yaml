        Summary:
        It would be very helpful to have an option to turn on a vibration when the Apple Watch disconnects from the iPhone via bluetooth. This would allow for people who accidentally leave their phone somewhere, to be notified immediately that this has happened. I understand that for people walking around their house without their phone, this could be annoying. That is why I think it should be an option that can be turned on/off. You could also tie it to the fact that if they are both connected to the same Wifi, it doesn’t vibrate, however if they aren’t, then it vibrates.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Leave your phone in one place and walk far enough away that your watch disconnects from your phone.

        Expected Results:
        If the (new) option is turned on, it should vibrate to let you know that you have left your phone.

        Actual Results:
        An icon is showing at the top of the watch face. However, you need to look at the watch to see this.
