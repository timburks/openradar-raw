    description: "Summary:\n\nIt would be very useful (especially for those of us with a goldfish-like memory) if you could tell Siri to remember personal facts (kept private to an iCloud account), which it would remember and then be able to query at at later date. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n- “Siri: remember that my cousin,s new pet dog is called Fido”\n- Wait 3 months\n- “Siri: what is my cousin’s pet dog called again?”\n\nExpected Results:\n\nSiri should remember this kind of stuff - like a PA with a good memory.\n\nActual Results:\n\nSiri’s memory doesn’t seem to be much better than my own.\n\nRegression:\n\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
