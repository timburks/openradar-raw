    description: "Summary:\r\nClass properties are expected to be usable with dot notation. When using a custom getter name this does not work as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGiven the following declaration:\r\n\r\n    @interface Foo : NSObject\r\n    @property (class, readonly, getter=sharedInstance) Foo *shared;\r\n    @end\r\n\r\n... one expects the following to compile:\r\n\r\n    Foo *foo = Foo.shared;\r\n    \r\n... yet the compiler issues the following error:\r\n\r\n    property 'shared' not found on object of type 'Foo'\r\n\r\nAfter changing the code to:\r\n\r\n    Foo *foo = Foo.sharedInstance;\r\n\r\n... the error goes away.\r\n\r\nThis is not the expected behavior and not in line with instance properties.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`Foo.shared` should compile without errors.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`Foo.shared` does not compile."
