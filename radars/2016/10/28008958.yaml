    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are building a framework that uses modern system frameworks, but also allows to deploy to older systems. We usually use `@import FrameworkName;` in code (ObjC), which also links the framework unless disabled in the host app's build settings.\r\n\r\nWe would expect @import to trigger weak-linking frameworks since that's the safe option. For some frameworks this is true, e.g., Intents, but the Speech framework is not weakly linked and therefore crashes on older systems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached a sample project: It builds with the iOS 10 SDK, and runs on iOS 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nRun it on iOS 9 (simulator is fine, reproduces on device, too, but requires additional configuration work for Intents)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are two classes that @import a framework that is only available on iOS 10. Both should log that the respective class is not available. None of the frameworks should be linked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes because the Speech framework could not be loaded.\r\n\r\nIf you disable the Speech class (remove the .m from the Compile Sources phase, and comment out the usage in the view controller), the app runs fine, i.e., the Intents framework handles it gracefully, as described in \"Expected Results\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can fix this by explicitly linking Intents, and setting it to optional. This works fine in single apps, but for a framework, it's much nicer if this works automatically and does not crash apps that forget to set this.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2.6 GHz Core i7\r\n16 GB\r\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB\r\n\r\nSample Project:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qar8ilq31uk9l5y/SpeechImport.zip?dl=0"
