    description: "Appearance Manager settings sometimes affect the drawing of app extensions, Mail Compose View Controllers, Message Compose View Controllers, and Safari View Controllers. This is undesirable because those view controllers do not otherwise share the look and feel of the app.\r\n\r\nThe most extreme case is app extensions. The developer of an app often can't know or test every extension that might be invoked within an app.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Open the attached sample project.\r\n\r\n2.  Note the following code in AppDelegate.swift that is run when the app is launched:\r\n\r\n// Make the titles of buttons and UIBarButtonItems red. Make navigation bar backgrounds red.\r\nUIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(UIColor.red, for: .normal)\r\nUINavigationBar.appearance().backgroundColor = UIColor.red\r\nUIBarButtonItem.appearance().setTitleTextAttributes([NSForegroundColorAttributeName:UIColor.red], for: .normal)\r\n\r\n3.  Run the app on a device that is configured to send mail and messages. (If run in a Simulator or on a device not configured this way, demonstrating with the Mail Compose View Controller and Message Compose View Controller will not work.)\r\n\r\n4.  Tap \"Share Text\", and then invoke Mail from the share sheet. Note the red background on the navigation bar of the mail sheet.\r\n\r\n5.  Tap \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n6.  Tap \"Mail Compose View Controller.  Note the red background on the navigation bar of the Mail Compose View Controller.\r\n\r\n7.  Tap \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n8.  Tap \"Message Compose View Controller\".  Note the red background on the navigation bar of the Message Compose View Controller.\r\n\r\n9.  Tap \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\n10.  Tap \"Safari View Controller\". Note the red \"Done\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect the Appearance Manager calls not to affect these external view controllers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Steps to reproduce, the calls do affect the external view controllers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sample project is available at:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vt9xsnm9qslmzr1/AppearanceManager.zip?dl=0"
