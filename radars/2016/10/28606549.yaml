    description: "Summary:\r\n\"What is my wife's birthday\" successfully read contacts to extract the birthday date (19th June), but then stated it was 18th June?\r\nPerhaps there's a timezone bug here? I am on BST so 00:00 on 19th June would still be 18th June on GMT (or timezones west e.g. PST)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAsk for your wife's birthday on a British based system ;)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe actual date (e.g. 19th June)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n18th June\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis was on Mac Siri (Sierra)"
