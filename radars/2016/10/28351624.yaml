    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have WKWebView inside the UITableViewCell. The web view load request and then after finished loading, I'll resize the web view height to be equal to its content height, then adjust table view cell height to fit accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was the web view only displays the area that fit the screen size. When I scroll down, everything is white. But I see that the web view rendered with correct height, tap and hold on the white area on the web view still see selection. Zooming with pinch makes the web view area that displaying on the screen visible, but other areas sometimes become white.\r\n\r\ndemo: https://github.com/pawin/strange-wkwebview\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached the sample app here, so just run and scroll down the web view see the result.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to see fully rendered web view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwhen scroll the webview it will only show white area\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, and simulators\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'strange-wkwebview-master.zip' was successfully uploaded."
