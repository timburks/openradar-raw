    description: "Summary:\r\nI often see a notification for a newly-arrived message. I double-click it and macOS switches to Mail and opens the new message in its own window. I scan it and want to delete it, so I hit the delete key, but nothing happens. If I close the window and see the message in the Mail three-pane view, the delete key works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Double click a \"New Message\" notification in Notification Center\r\n2. Let Mail open and display the new message in its own window\r\n3. Hit the delete key on the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessage window should close and the message should be deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 10.0 (3226)\r\nmacOS Sierra Version 10.12 (16a319)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I open messages in their own windows manually, within the Mail app, the delete key does work. It only seems to be disabled when a message is displayed by clicking through from a Notification."
