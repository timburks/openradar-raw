    description: "Summary:\r\nPreviously-paired devices listed in System Preferences > Bluetooth have an 'x' icon next to them. Clicking this 'x' on devices that are not currently connected does not remove them, but instead attempts to connect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClick the 'x' icon next to a device which is paired but not connected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device association is removed and it no longer appears in the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe computer attempts to connect to the device. If it fails to connect to the device, it is not removed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Bluetooth device paired to a Mac, such as a wireless keyboard or mouse."
