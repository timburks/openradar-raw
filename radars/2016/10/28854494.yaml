    description: "Summary:\r\nThe information contained on these two pages is very often not up-to-date or accurate. For example, earlier today (2016/10/19) the DEP portal was down at minimum from 1:15PM CST to 2:15PM CST. Nothing was noted on the status pages. If you run queries for either of the two URLs below on the Macadmins Slack (macadmins.org) it is clear they are treated as a running joke. Can these pages please be kept up to date as MDM becomes more and more important for macOS administration, and is critical for iOS administration.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/system-status/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExperience an issue with one of Apple's systems (DEP, APNS, MDM), that is clearly on Apple's end and not on the customer end. Navigate to:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/system-status/\r\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\r\n\r\nAnd witness that no issues have been reported. Refresh all you want, there will not be any updates.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Apple to update the status pages in a timely manner and provide postmortems on issues so admins have some assurance that the problems are unlikely to reoccur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus issues are almost never reported.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApple Services, Stores, and iCloud\r\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\r\nSystem Status\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/system-status/\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations 03-Nov-2016 11:21 AM\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback, it is noted.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments about the resolution, please update your bug report with that information so we can respond."
