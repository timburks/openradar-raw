    description: "Peter Steinberger28-Oct-2016 04:46 PM\r\n\r\nThis is also somewhat related to rdar://28999727 and the whole prefetching changes in iOS 10.\r\nPeter Steinberger28-Oct-2016 04:45 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen asking a collection view for cellForItemAtIndexPath: it does only return cells that are visible and not all cells that are configured. This was fine before cell prefetching became a thing, as these two states basically were identical. Now however this is different.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the sample app\r\n- Scroll through the list and notice the different cell colors\r\n- Red means `cellForItemAtIndexPath:` did not return the cell, blue means it did.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- All cells are blue\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Depending on scroll speed, most of the non-initial cells are red.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is because in the collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath: delegate call I dispatch a configuration event. From what Iâ€™ve experienced, this is a pretty common approach to load data asynchronously. The issue arises when that data loads faster than the cell scrolls into the view.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the fact that the documentation says `Returns the visible cell object at the specified index path.`, however to me this sounds like a bug. As mentioned above: Previously this was identical with everything that was configured via `collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:` and due to the equal naming of these two methods they really should work hand in hand. So now that prefetching is a thing, the documentation and functionality on this should be changed to make these methods work like counterparts. `cellForItemAtIndexPath:` should return all cells that have been configured by `collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:`.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CollectionViewTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
