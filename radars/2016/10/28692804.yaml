    description: |-
        When an iMessage app inserts an MSMessage into a conversation while in compact mode, this action is not announced via VO in any way. Also, the VO focus isn't changed. That way, the user doesn't understand that the state has changed and the iMessage app has inserted a message.

        In contrast, while in expanded mode, the VO focus is switched to the message input field giving the user at least a hint that a selection was made. However, there's still no announcement that an MSMessage was inserted above the message input field.

        The insertion of a message is an important event that should be announced by VO in a consistent manner across all iMessage apps.
