    description: "Area:\r\nMetal\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter updating to iOS 10 we got a new bug. Restoring our app from background became to take a lot of time accompanied with graphical artefacts. Sometimes it leads to device freezing which can be fixed only by means of rebooting. On iOS 9 we have not got such problem on the same application. On iOS 10 (iPhone 6 and early) we have not got such problem either.\r\nOn devices iPhone 6s and later since iOS 10 OpenGL ES 2.0 driver become \"OpenGL ES 2.0 Metal - 33\". I suppose in this case OpenGL ES 2.0 is emulated by means of Metal, is it correct? Can it be the reason of this bug?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run MAPS.ME\r\n2. Turn off the screen by power button\r\n3. Wait for about 1 minute\r\n4. Unlock the device by home button pressing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInteractive map\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot-responding map, graphical artefacts (looks like geometry blinking)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
