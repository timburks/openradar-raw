    description: "Summary:\r\nI've read how to delete an App from the store:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html\r\n\r\nAnd right now I have two tests I made back in the day to check how TestFlight work. They're not \"real\" Apps, never are going to be published in the store. Now I want to delete them, but I can't. Although they are in the correct state \"Prepare for Submission\", the \"Delete App\" button doesn't appears at the bottom in the \"App Information\" section.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that they have never been published. But they're not finished apps. So will never pass through validation process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Enter iTunes Connect\r\n- Select an App never published / sent through validation\r\n- Select  \"App Information\" \r\n- Delete it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should disappear from my ITC account\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't find the Delete App button\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nBrowser: Chrome Version 53.0.2785.116 (64-bit)"
