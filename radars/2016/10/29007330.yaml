        Summary:
        I have multi-device Wi-Fi calling enabled on my iPad, iMac, and a secondary (non-cellular-connected) iPhone. Every call I get results in between one and three missed calls. I’ll get two or three if I don’t pick up (and therefore actually miss the call), or I’ll get one or two missed calls, even when I pick up. It seems that the different devices aren’t talking to each other about whether each call was picked up or not.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Receive call
        2a. Pick up
        2b. Ignore the call

        Expected Results:
        After 2a, the Phone app shows a single received call and no missed calls. After 2b, the Phone app shows a single missed call.

        Actual Results:
        After 2a, one or more missed calls are shown, and after 2b, two or more are shown.

        Regression:
        As far as I can tell, it’s worked this way as long as I’ve had Wi-Fi calling turned on from my other devices

        Notes:
        This is seriously annoying, especially when I pick up the call, requiring me to always go in and clear the missed calls.
