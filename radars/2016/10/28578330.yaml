    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen sending a screenshot via macOS Sierra's Messages.app the screenshot always gets terribly compressed and we can do nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAs a developer this is really frustrating when I want to show something to a colleague or friend and all he gets is an awful and blurry compressed picture instead of a crisp and beautiful retina screenshot.\r\n\r\niOS 10 has a setting to reduce file size but Sierra doesn't and maybe it's automatically activated and we can't disable it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Messages.app on macOS Sierra.\r\n2. Take a screenshot and send it to a friend.\r\n3. Your friend rages to the blurriness\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFriends receive beautiful and crisp retina screenshots in all their glory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAwful blur.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occur even when sending a legacy display screenshot which is terrible since they are not really heavy by default."
