    description: "Summary:\r\nSet an onImage and offImage for UISwitch control in Storyboard, but this has no effect since iOS 7. No warnings. Just no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag in a UISwitch to the canvas.\r\n2. Set the off and on images in storyboard\r\n3. No images are displayed.\r\n4. Google and figure out in Apple Docs(!!!) that the on/off images need to have a certain size. https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/UIKitUICatalog/UISwitch.html\r\n5. Still no images are displayed.\r\n6. Google some more and realize “In iOS 7, this property has no effect.” https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiswitch/1623689-onimage\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n * Either have it work, or have at LEAST a console warning. Even better would be to completely remove it from storyboard and the API if possible.\r\n * Also have the Apple docs in the UI catalog updated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee steps 4-5"
