    description: "Area:\r\nDevice Management / Profiles\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis ticket is for the ability for Enable Lost Mode to be allowed to make a sound once enabled on the device.  This is a feature available on Find My IPhone but is missing on the MDM spec for Enable Lost Mode.  The ability to check this somehow when enabling would be a very welcome feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould like the ability for the MDM Enable Lost spec to mimic the Find My Iphone feature in which a sound is emitted once enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo sound option is available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad and Casper MDM"
