    description: "Summary:\r\nI haven't been able to use lldb with Swift in Xcode since Swift first came out. In the most recent months, I was under the impression that this was because I was using Carthage, which according to Apple is not supported due to the use of precompiled Swift binaries.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recently started playing with a side project without the use of Carthage, and after writing just a couple hundred lines of Swift on a branch new Xcode 8 GM project, as soon as I tried to set a breakpoint and `po` anything, I only got lldb errors everywhere.\r\n\r\nSee open source Github project that I used to reproduce this: https://github.com/JaviSoto/SwiftPoker. In case I push more commits, try commit hash `28c3b4acfe4c1bfa80a99f4071f75b00c99762b4` where I definitely reproduced these errors. See attached screenshots for examples of the portions of code where I set the breakpoints and the errors I got.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create Xcode 8 Swift project\r\n2. Write some Swift\r\n3. Set breakpoints in Swift code\r\n4. `po variable` in lldb\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVariable contents are printed in the debugger\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDifferent types of errors appear, `po` never works.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 GM\r\nSwift 3.0 GM\r\nOS X 10.11.6"
