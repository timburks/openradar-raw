    description: "Summary:\r\nOur VoIP application built on iOS 9 SDK uses the NSURLNetworkServiceTypeVoIP network service type to trigger waking up our app when a new call or message arrives. This has stopped working on devices running iOS 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a NSMutableURLRequest instance.\r\nSet the networkServiceType to NSURLNetworkServiceTypeVoIP.\r\nSend the request to the server using an NSURLSessionDataTask.\r\nServer delays responding until a call or message arrives (long poll).\r\nApp is moved to the background (and suspends).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the server responds, the app wakes and receives the response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the server responds, the app does not wake and the response times out.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- We expect this behaviour if we re-built our app on he iOS 10 SDK. \r\n- We do not expect our deployed (iOS 9 SDK) versions of the app to stop working on iOS 10.\r\n- the CFStream level version of this flag (kCFStreamNetworkServiceTypeVoIP) continues to work as expected."
