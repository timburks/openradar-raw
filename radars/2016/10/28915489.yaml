    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSometimes Xcode stops to launch my application. I saw this issue on iOS with Simulator but also when I was doing a development of a command-line Mac OS tool.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are the following:\r\n\r\nI start my iOS app as usually by Command+R, I start seeing the launch screen of my app and then it hangs. What is especially annoying is that Xcode stops responding to Stop action via both \"Command+.\" and also Stop button doesn't work: it is clickable and is of solid black color but clicking on it doesn't change anything, the only thing is that I get:\r\n\r\n\"\r\n*** If you believe this error represents a bug, please attach the log file at .....log\r\n\"\r\n\r\nYou find the log in attached.\r\n\r\nIf I kill both Xcode and Simulator and run the app again, the issue is still there.\r\n\r\nI have tried to clean:\r\n- My simulator by both manually and by using     xcrun simctl erase all\r\ncommand.\r\n- Derived Data\r\n- App's Build directory\r\n- Various folders like /var/folders/*, /tmp and /var/tmp\r\n\r\nNothing of this helps to resolve the issue. Restarting the machine once does help sometimes but sometimes not.\r\n\r\nI noticed that if I don't do anything for some time (like turn on computer after a night) Xcode starts working again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo stable strategy to reproduce this. I run the app in Simulator and it is working but after a certain point when I run it again, it hangs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see my app running correctly. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see it hanging on a launch screen instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.1 beta (8T47)\r\n\r\nI saw the same issue on Version 8.0 and also before that in Xcode 7.x versions."
