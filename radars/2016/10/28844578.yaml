    description: "Summary:\r\nThe “Show {Events,Viewers} on Second Display” features in the Window menu assume which display to be shown on and do not allow the user to pick another display if they have three or more.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect at least 2 extra displays.\r\n2. In FCP, click Window → Show Events on Second Display.\r\n3. Attempt to drag the top bar to the third display.\r\n4. Activate Mission Control, then drag the window to the third display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth methods cause the window to be moved to the display it is dropped on, and this change is permanent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to move the window. After closing Mission Control, the window briefly appears on the third display, then reverts back to the second display.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFinal Cut Pro 10.2.3; macOS 10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
