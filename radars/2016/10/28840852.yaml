    description: "In Sierra, it is no longer possible to script a volume mount.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to do things like scripted backups/rsyncs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nopen -g afp://whatever\r\n\r\nPre-Sierra, works and mounts the volume using the stored Keychain password.\r\n\r\nSierra, pops up the alert asking to OK the mount.\r\n\r\nsudo open -g afp://whatever\r\n\r\ndoes not work either.  It might be possible to do sudo mkdir /Volumes/Whatever, mount_afp whatever, but it seems difficult to ensure it behaves in the same manner as mounting the volume.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect nothing else, but I'd like it if Apple quit screwing up automation."
