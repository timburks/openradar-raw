Create a UIImagePickerController\r\n2. Set its sourceType to .Camera\r\n3. Set its mediaTypes to [ kUTTypeImage ]\r\n4. Set its cameraDevice to .Rear\r\n5. Set its cameraFlashMode to .On\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReading the UIImagePickerController's cameraFlashMode property should return .On, and taking a picture by calling -takePicture should trigger the flash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReading the UIImagePickerController's cameraFlashMode property returns .Off and taking a picture by calling -takePicture does not trigger the flash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI am also seeing this issue on an iPhone 5S running iOS 10.1 beta 3 (14B71), running code compiled with Xcode 8.1 beta 3 (8T47)\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 27560011"
