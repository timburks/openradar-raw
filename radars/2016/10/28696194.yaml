    description: "Often apps do not refresh with the latest content when it is immediately available. It makes for a poor user experience compared to using a DVR. For example, if there is a new episode available of a TV show and I open the related app, such as Hulu or HBO Now, I should see that new episode listed. Often I have to kill the app and restart the app to get it to refresh the content. Sometimes that does not even work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start an app like Hulu or HBO Now\r\n2. Wait for a new episode of a show to be available by schedule\r\n3. Open the app\r\n4. Look for the new episode\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\n\r\nI would expect it to be easier to find new episodes quickly. Back when I used a DVR I could simply power on my TV and see all of the recent recordings. I wish I could get a listing of the recently available shows that I watch listed somewhere to make it easier to directly start watching new content.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer Apple TV apps to have some kind of subscription model with push notifications which let the user indicate they are interested in updates on a show and then get immediate notifications to the Apple TV to update either the app or a list on the home screen for all new content which makes it easier to select new content and start watching it.\r\n\r\nI believe the apps which fail to show new content are caching TVML data. A push notification could tell the apps to invalidate their cache so the next time the app is used new content is loaded. A background download would be appropriate too to make the apps more responsive on startup.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOften I miss new episodes, such as Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, because the app does not show there is a new episode available even though these episodes are available the same night as they are available on cable."
