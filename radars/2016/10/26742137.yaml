    description: "We develop an app called Genius Scan. Users can scan documents with their phone and build PDF files. They then send their files by various ways, but mostly by email.\r\n\r\nFor 5 years, we have been experiencing to some extend people who were unable to send their emails. The emails would get stuck in the Mail app Outbox and never be received.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the issue started to become really common. We are getting several emails a day regarding this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is severely affecting users because \r\n- They can't send emails anymore. \r\n- They can't even delete the email which is in the process of sending, unless they switch to Airplane mode, something they don't think about doing and shouldn't have to do.\r\n- They also believe Genius Scan is responsible for the issue and we are unable to help them which leads to a very frustrating experience for these Apple users.\r\n- It also sometimes lead to consuming a lot of data as the Mail app keeps retrying to send the email.\r\n\r\nWhat we know:\r\n- the issue is not related to the server rejecting the large attachment\r\n- the email app can get stuck in the Mail app Outbox and will prevent the user from sending other emails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe have been unable to reproduce the issue ourselves. However, from what our users describe the issue is happening as follow:\r\n- Users create a PDF file in Genius Scan\r\n- The choose the Email export option.\r\n- We display a MFMailComposeViewController and attach the file.\r\n- The user sends the email\r\n\r\n- The recipient never receive the email.\r\n- They end up opening the Mail app and the email is stuck sending in the Outbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The email is sent properly or fails to send with a clear error\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email is stuck in the Outbox of the Mail app in a \"sending\" state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone"
