    description: "Summary:\r\nMany UIAppearance calls do not work in tvOS 10\r\n\r\nIn tvOS 9, I was able to say:\r\n\r\n`UITabBar.appearance().backgroundColor = UIColor.green`\r\n\r\nand the tab bar background would be green. In tvOS 10, this does not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached project, or do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new tvOS project using the Tab\r\n2. In AppDelegate.swift, in application(application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions), add the following:\r\n    UITabBar.appearance().backgroundColor = UIColor.green\r\n    UILabel.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [FirstViewController.self]).textColor = UIColor.red\r\n3. Run the app in the tvOS 9.2 simulator\r\n4. Notice the tab bar background is green and the labels are red\r\n5. Run the app in the tvOS 10.0 simulator\r\n6. Notice the labels are still changed to red, but the tab bar background is unchanged.\r\n\r\nBecause of these, much of my theming in my tvOS apps is broken. This is causing text to be invisible in UINavigationBar and UITabBar because both the text and background are getting set to black.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect all calls to UIAppearance that worked in tvOS 9 to work in tvOS 10\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome UIAppearance calls do not work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ntvOS Simulator, Apple TV 4"
