    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's a really weird issue going on with one of the sites I use regularly, where every now and then it surfaces an error that looks like\r\n\r\nundefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.message')\r\n\r\nThe problem is, in the code where it occurs, it's literally impossible for `e` to be undefined. The code sets it in all code paths leading up to this point. And the author of the site even inserted an explicit check for `if (!e)` which doesn't trigger, but then the line immediately after the if block throws the error.\r\n\r\nAFAIK this issue is new to Safari 10, since I never saw it before I upgraded to macOS Sierra. And it's never occurred on any other browser, according to the site author.\r\n\r\nThe issue is documented in detail at https://github.com/Reviewable/Reviewable/issues/410, including a listing of the code in question.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use reviewable.io for a while\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should work correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOccasionally it will pop up a message saying it crashed, with that error as the reason.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 10.0.1 (12602.2.14.0.7)\r\nOS X 10.12.1 (16B2555)"
