        Summary:
        You cannot manage a machine via DEP unless the machine in question has internet access.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Start up a DEP Machine without access to the internet.

        Expected Results:
        It should enroll in the MDM directly

        Actual Results:
        Does not enroll in the MDM


        Notes:
        Many machines are used strictly offline for security purposes. Examples: iOS Build machines, Government classified networks, etc. We need a method to DEP/Enroll a machine in an MDM without internet access. If DEP is required for management agents, this whole use case no longer works as we cannot enroll in DEP.
