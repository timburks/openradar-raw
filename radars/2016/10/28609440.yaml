    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing Swift 2.3 on Xcode 8, when a unwind segue is created using a Storyboard, Xcode tries to connect it to a matching method in the view controller by appending \"WithSegue:\" to the method name, which causes a mismatch with the unwind segue and it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAttached is an example project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Create a new project and configure it to use Swift 2.3\r\n2 - In a UIViewController, create a @IBAction method to receive the unwinding segue.\r\n3 - In a storyboard, create an exit segue that links to the method created in step 2 (note that \"WithSegue\" is appended to the method contract)\r\n4 - Run the app and execute the segue action\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe presented view controller should be dismissed to the target view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe presented view controller isn't dismissed and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA possible workaround is to change the target method name by appending \"WithSegue\" *after* the segue has been created in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nI've attached a new project with an example.\r\n\r\nNote that if a new exit segue is created, Xcode tries to link it with a method named \"unwindToViewControllerWithSegueWithSegue\"\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRunning on a brand new project on Xcode 8.0 (8A218a) running on a MacBook Pro Retina 13\" Late-13 with macOS 10.11.6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Segues Example.zip' was successfully uploaded."
