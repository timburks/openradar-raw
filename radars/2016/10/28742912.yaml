    description: "Summary:\r\nI have occasion to create a UITableView that contains cells that themselves contain UICollectionView instances. Those collectionView instances need to scroll, but not support selection. I would expect that since I set allowsSelection to false on the UICollectionView that a tap gesture would propagate up and select the UITableViewCell containing the collectionView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached file\r\n2. Build and run the project.\r\n3. Tap on the red cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UITableViewCell should be selected and echo a debug message to the console. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.5, iOS 10.0.2, iOS 10.1 Beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, iPhone 7+, various simulators\r\n\r\nApple's Response:\r\nFrom the sample project attached, the UICollectionView is the full size of its containing table view cell, which will cause the collection view to intercept touches from the table view cell and table view. The WWDC session “Advanced Scrollviews and Touch Handling Techniques” covers ways to handle this situation in depth: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/235/"
