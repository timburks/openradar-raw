    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I'm doing tvOS development work and I need to change the simulator scale (in or out of app), the simulator gets a cropped view. \r\n\r\nThis happens whether I change the scale using the keyboard shortcuts or the menu items (Window -> Scale -> ...)\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this is to quit out of the simulator and relaunch. \r\n\r\nThis is noticed in the following simulators:\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T395)\r\ntvOS 9.1 (13U85)\r\ntvOS 9.2 (13Y234)\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not observed in the tvOS 10 simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the tvOS 9.x simulator. \r\n2. Change the scale using the keyboard shortcut. \r\n  - Notice how the UI is cutoff. \r\n3. Change the scale back to what it was. \r\n  - Notice how the UI is not fixed. \r\n4. Quit the simulator. \r\n5. (re)Launch the tvOS 9.x simulator. \r\n6. Change the scale using the menu actions. \r\n  - Notice how the UI is cutoff. \r\n7. Change the scale back to what it was. \r\n  - Notice how the UI is not fixed. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI should adjust gracefully to changing the scale. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI does not change gracefully and is cutoff. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\ntvOS 9.0 (13T395) - Simulator\r\ntvOS 9.1 (13U85) - Simulator\r\ntvOS 9.2 (13Y234) - Simulator\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Simulator Screen Shot Oct 3, 2016, 9.27.37 AM.png', 'Simulator Screen Shot Oct 3, 2016, 9.27.35 AM.png', 'Simulator Screen Shot Oct 3, 2016, 9.29.22 AM.png' and 'Simulator Screen Shot Oct 3, 2016, 9.27.58 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
