    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new ProvisioningStyle = Automatic is awesome for development teams. \U0001F44D great job, it 'Just Works'.\r\nHowever for CI infrastructure, ProvisioningStyle=Automatic does not play nice. For example we have the same target but with Adhoc and Appstore provisioning profiles, so I want to be explicit about those on our build infrastructure, but if PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER is specified along with ProvisioningStyle=Automatic, xcodebuild will fail with '(app name) has conflicting provisioning settings'\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nIf there was an option or variable that could be set with an .xcconfig for the ProvisioningStyle, then it wouldn't be a problem. However instead I have our CI setup to edit the project file prior to building. \r\n\r\nDifferent proposed solution:\r\nOr if PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER and CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY are set, xcodebuild assumes manual style, and doesn't fail, but just warns."
