    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPad (simulator or device, tested on 9.3 and 10.0), attempting to tap a UIBarButtonItem that was added in interface builder to the storyboard that has an action set up in the viewdidload of a view controller, the action would not be fired. If the user taps into the textbox on screen to bring up the keyboard however, the action fires fine. If the users then dismisses the keyboard (by tapping on the hide keyboard button in the bottom right of the keyboard), tapping the button will do nothing again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run xcode project on iPad\r\n2. Click \"SHOW ALERT\" button and nothing will happen\r\n3. Click into text box so keyboard appears\r\n4. Click \"SHOW ALERT\" button and alert is displayed. \r\n5. Dismiss alert\r\n6. Hide keyboard by pressing button in bottom right of keyboard\r\n7. Click \"SHOW ALERT\" button and no alert is displayed\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert would show every time the user clicks \"SHOW ALERT\" button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert is only shown when user clicks \"SHOW ALERT\" button AND the keyboard is displayed."
