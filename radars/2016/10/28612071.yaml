    description: "Summary:\r\nI haven't been able to use lldb with Swift in Xcode since Swift first came out. In the most recent months, I was under the impression that this was because I was using Carthage, which according to Apple is not supported due to the use of precompiled Swift binaries.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recently started playing with a side project without the use of Carthage, and after writing just a couple hundred lines of Swift on a brand new Xcode 8 GM project, as soon as I tried to set a breakpoint and `po` anything, I only got lldb errors everywhere. I originally filed rdar://28477944, but I still reproduce these in Xcode 8.1 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nSee open source Github project that I used to reproduce this: https://github.com/JaviSoto/SwiftPoker. In case I push more commits, try commit hash `28c3b4acfe4c1bfa80a99f4071f75b00c99762b4` where I definitely reproduced these errors. See attached screenshots for examples of the portions of code where I set the breakpoints and the errors I got.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open project from https://github.com/JaviSoto/SwiftPoker commit hash 28c3b4acfe4c1bfa80a99f4071f75b00c99762b4\r\n2. Set breakpoint on Hand.swift:208\r\n3. Run tests on SwiftPoker target\r\n4. Wait for breakpoint to be hit\r\n4. Type `po $0` in lldb\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contents of the anonymous variable `$0` are printed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't work, and error is printed: \r\n\r\nerror: <EXPR>:3:1: error: anonymous closure argument not contained in a closure\r\n$0\r\n^\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1 Beta 2, Swift 3, macOS Sierra GM"
