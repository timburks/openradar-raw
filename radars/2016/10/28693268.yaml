        Summary:
        I want to insert a soft line break in my text that's being rendered by CTFramesetter, so as to start a new line but not start a new paragraph. I can't.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Make an attributed string that contains a unicode 2028 character. Give it a paragraph style, such as adding some paragraphSpacing.

        Expected Results:
        The paragraphSpacing makes the line breaks after newline characters be bigger, but does not make the line break after the unicode 2028 be bigger.

        Actual Results:
        The paragraphSpacing applies to both line break characters and the unicode 2028 character.

        Notes:
        Enumerating using NSStringEnumerationByParagraphs correctly identifies that the 2028 character is not a paragraph break. It seems to be only CTFramesetter that has the issue.
