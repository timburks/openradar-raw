    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe make an ajax request in javascript much like this:\r\n\r\n$.ajax({\r\n  timeout: 120000, // 2 minutes timeout\r\n  url: url // a request to a url - the request to the server is known to take between 1 and 2 minutes\r\n});\r\n\r\nThe request will error after 2 minutes, even though we know from debugging at the server that it was successfully handled and the response was sent at sometime between 1 and 2 minutes. We see an error in the log at that time \"Failed to load resource:  The request timed out.\"\r\n\r\nIt is acting as though the request actually took longer than 2 minutes to process, although we know that not to be the case.\r\n\r\nWe see this issue in our iOS app which is using the iOS webview control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a website with an ajax request as above. Connect to the site and make the request\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe request will succeed at some time between 1 and 2 minutes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe request errors as explained above\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 (14B55c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will try installing iOS 10.1 beta 4 to see if the issue resolves\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
