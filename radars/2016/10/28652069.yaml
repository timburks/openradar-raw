    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is difficult and confusing for users to enable iMessage apps when they receive a message from their friend with a chat bubble containing an iMessage app.\r\n\r\nConsider when the user taps on the chat bubble, if they have already have the iMessage app installed on their device (either as a standalone iMessage app or embedded in a container app), but the iMessage app is not enabled. Currently iOS opens the App Store for iMessage to the Manage tab, and the user needs to find the app in the list, toggle the switch on, and then close the modal sheet and tap on the chat bubble again. I propose that when the user taps on the chat bubble, one of the following things happens:\r\n1. iOS launches the iMessage app, even though the app is technically disabled. This is OK -- the user actively wanted to perform this action. Or,\r\n2. iOS shows an alert to the user asking if they would like to enable the iMessage app and proceed (answering in the affirmative should then automatically open the iMessage app with the chat bubble selected)\r\n\r\nIf the user does not have iMessage app installed on their device, tapping on the chat bubble launches the App Store for iMessage to the app product page. The user must then download the app, and the \"GET\" button is replaced with an \"INSTALLED\" label, with the user can not act upon. Instead, it should be an \"OPEN\" button, which should open the iMessage app, and importantly, continue with selecting the chat bubble that the user initially selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user has a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe experience can be difficult and frustrating.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7"
