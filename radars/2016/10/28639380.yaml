    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen writing a Core Image Kernel Language Shader, it automatically gets translated to Metal under iOS 10. In our case this translation fails because the `greaterThanEqual` function is apparently unavailable. This is especially severe since there seems to be no way of deactivating this automatic translation for UIKit apps.\r\n\r\nHere’s the output from my example project:\r\n\r\nMetal library creation failed with error: Error Domain=MTLLibraryErrorDomain Code=3 \"Compilation failed: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogram_source:48:22: error: use of undeclared identifier 'greaterThanEqual'\r\n\r\n  bool isWhite = all(greaterThanEqual(float3(pixel), float3(tolerance)));\r\n\r\n                     ^\r\n\r\n\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Compilation failed: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogram_source:48:22: error: use of undeclared identifier 'greaterThanEqual'\r\n\r\n  bool isWhite = all(greaterThanEqual(float3(pixel), float3(tolerance)));\r\n\r\n                     ^\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI’ve uploaded a minimal example project that reproduces the issue here: https://github.com/Ben-G/AppleBugProjects/tree/master/MetaliOS10Issue/SheetCompareTestiOS10\r\n\r\nIt simply loads an image, applies a Core Image Kernel Shader to it and attempts to add it to a UIImageView. On iOS 10 devices this operation fails with output shown above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shader keeps working as it did on iOS 8 and iOS 9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe automatic translation fails and results in an empty image instead of an image that is transformed through the shader."
