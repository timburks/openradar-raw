        Summary:
        New verbs were added to /usr/bin/security. One such verb is set-key-partition-list which besides a single line that states "Set the partition ID of a key." offers no further documentation.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Type 'man security' in the Terminal
        2. Search for 'set-key-partition-list'
        3. Get no results

        Expected Results:
        Documentation for 'set-key-partition-list' is found.

        Actual Results:
        No documentation of 'set-key-partition-list' is available.

        Regression:
        This verb is seemingly new to macOS 10.12 so no regression is available.

        Notes:
        In order to fully understand what 'set-key-partition-list' does it would be very helpful to have in-depth documentation of the "partition ID" concept and how a list of them affects a key and applications that want to use that key.
