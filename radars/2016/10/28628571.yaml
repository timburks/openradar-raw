    description: "Summary:\r\nQuick Help no longer interprets HTML markup in Objective-C comments, even though Doxygen and HeaderDoc support a limited subset of HTML.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Objective-C file in a source editor.\r\n2. ⌥-click a symbol such as -bold, -link, or -table to open the Quick Help popover for that symbol.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoldfaced text, a hyperlink, and a table containing monospaced text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlain text. See the attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a) and 8.1 beta 1 (8T29o)\r\nmacOS 10.11.6 (15G1004)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDoes not reproduce in Xcode versions 4.3 through 7.3.1 (7D1014).\r\n\r\nAlso does not reproduce in Swift files that use the syntax described in <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/MarkupSyntax.html>.\r\n\r\nThe ability to specify HTML (or any kind of markup, really) in documentation comments is particularly important for libraries. Many libraries transform these comments into full HTML docsets using HeaderDoc, Doxygen, appledoc, or jazzy. Incidentally, jazzy has no problem with HTML markup, even though it relies on Clang for Objective-C comment parsing. So the issue definitely doesn’t lie with Clang.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsuccessfully uploaded."
