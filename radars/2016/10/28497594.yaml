    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Capabilities view of a macOS target, the switch to turn ON and Off Sandboxing does not turn it off.\r\n\r\nThe swift works when you want to turn sandboxing on, but later it does not turn it off. You have to disable it manually in the entitlements file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a macOS App Target and go to the Capabilities view\r\n2. Turn on Sandboxing using the switch in that view. It works fine and the app is sandboxed.\r\n3. Try to turn it off by clicking the switch or dragging it to the off position. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSandboxing should be turned off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe switch control returns to the On position, and sandboxing stays activated.\r\nFrom this point on, you can only turn off sandboxing by editing the entitlements file directly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version: 8.0 (8A218a)\r\nmacOS version: 10.12 (16A323)"
