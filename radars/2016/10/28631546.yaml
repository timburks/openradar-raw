    description: "Summary:\r\niOS10 on the iPhone, Sierra on the Mac. No matter what incantations I try (restarting both devices etc), the universal clipboard does not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCopy something on the Mac\r\nPaste on iOS\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClipboard from macOS gets pasted\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClipboard from iOS gets pasted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n14B55c\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you're responsible for Universal Clipboard, don't feel too bad! Airdrop hardly ever functions for me, Handoff sometimes seems to do something but usually flakes out, so it's not you, it's me. I'm probably doooooomed because I've mentioned my love for Snow Leopard too many times and now Siri thinks she's not welcome.\r\n\r\nI asked her what the problem was and she answered: \" I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do. \" so I'm pretty sure I'm this [distance between fingers diminishes] close to not being able to open the pod bay doors."
