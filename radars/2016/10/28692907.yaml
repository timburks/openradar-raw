        It's not possible to switch pages of different iMessage apps using VO. While I can select different pages in the paging indicator at the bottom, the page content doesn't change and thus doesn't reflect the paging indicator anymore.

        I can reproduce the problem also without VoiceOver by tapping at the left or right of the paging indicator: I can change the selected page in the paging indicator but the page content doesn't change.
