        Summary:
        NSAttributedString.boundingRect(with:options:context:) returns {x 0 y 0 w 0 h 0} when called on an attributed string containing only the attachment character (0xFFFC) and an associated image. This happens on macOS, but not on iOS.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open one of the attached playgrounds. There is one for Xcode 7.3.1 and one for Xcode 8 or 8.1 beta, and the bug reproduces the same on either one.
        2. Set the playground to run on iOS. Observe that the last line produces a resulting rect of {x 0 y 0 w 108 h 108}. This is correct and expected.
        3. Set the playground to run on macOS.

        Expected Results:
        The last line produces {x 0 y 0 w 108 h 108}

        Actual Results:
        The last line produces {x 0 y 0 w 0 h 0} (the degenerate rectangle).

        Regression:
        not a regression as far as I can tell.

        Notes:
        Does not reproduce on iOS. Reproduces on the 10.11 and 10.12 machines where Iâ€™ve tried it, in Xcode 7.3.1, 8.0, and 8.1 beta 2.
