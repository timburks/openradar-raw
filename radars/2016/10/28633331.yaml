        Summary:
        By default, clients will check into an MDM server once every 6 hours (unless they get an APNS push). This should be configurable rather than a hard 6 hours (For macOS specifically).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to configure poll time for MDM checkins
        2. Can't because it isn't an expose option

        Expected Results:
        1. Configure poll time via config profile

        Actual Results:
        Cannot configure because it isn't an option.

        Notes:
        MDM only polls every 6 hours, so if APNS does not work correctly, you have no way to ensure changes go out quickly. This could be a perfect storm combined with a 0day vuln.
