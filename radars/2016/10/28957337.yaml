    description: "Summary:\r\niTMSTransporter can suddenly not modify price tiers of recurring subscriptions. It cannot either create new recurring subscriptions nor lookup recurring subscriptions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 A, Create an auto-recurring subscription with the iTMSTransporter using the previously documented XML-format.\r\n2 A, Get the following error: \r\nERROR ITMS-3000: \"Line 7 column 54: element \"family\" not allowed anywhere; expected element \"in_app_purchase\" at XPath /package/software/software_metadata/in_app_purchases/family\"\r\n\r\n1B, Use iTMSTransporter to lookup all in-apps or specify any recurring subscription\r\n2 B, See that your request has been ignored - the in-app is not even recognized as existing! \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA working iTMSTransporter, as it was previously (perhaps just a few months ago?)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError or no results.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0\r\niTMSTransporter 1.9.0"
