    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Xcode 8, the \"Comment Selection\" command (under Editor > Structure, shortcut ⌘ + / ), was re-implemented as an App Extension. It seems the new implementation has a performance problem.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to large chunks of code (say, more than 200 lines), the command is noticeably slow, and will block Xcode's main thread for a few seconds (!).\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from Xcode 7, where the implementation was fast enough that there was no noticeable freeze, even when commenting out large files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode 8\r\n2. Open a large source file\r\n3. Select more than 200 lines (the more you select, the more the lag will be noticeable)\r\n4. Press ⌘/ to comment-out the selected lines\r\n5. Make coffee and wait\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe lines are commented out instantly; there's no step 5.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe lines are commented out after a few seconds of Xcode freezing and beachballing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 GM\r\nXcode 8.1 beta (8T47)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro 11,1\r\nIntel Core i5 2,6 GHz\r\n8 Go RAM\r\n\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1004)"
