        I can't use the current MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem due to various issues (see below), particularly lack of zoom level control in tracking mode.
        However, I'd like to use the provided button animations. So I'd like to request to open up the underlying UIControl without the need to attach it to an MKMapView.

        I'd imagine an API like this:

        @interface MKUserTrackingButton
        @property (nonatomic) MKUserTrackingMode trackingMode;
        @property (nonatomic) BOOL searching;
        - (void)setTrackingMode:(MKUserTrackingMode)trackingMode searching:(BOOL)searching animated:(BOOL)animated;
        @end


        These are the issues that prevent me from using MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem:

        rdar://15374604	MKUserTrackingModeFollow prohibits annotation selection at the edge
        rdar://15374402	MapKit: programmatic zooming during UserTracking
        rdar://12814821	MKMapView zooms in when initially activating MKUserTrackingModeFollow
        rdar://12804133	MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading automatically deactivates when zoomed in

        I feel this would be useful to many developers because the current MKMapView tracking behavior doesn't work for a lot of use cases. Also, the fact that MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem is not a view but a UIBarButtonItem limits its usefulness because I can't position it easily anywhere on the screen without using horrible hacks.
