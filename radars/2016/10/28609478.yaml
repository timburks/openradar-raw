    description: "Summary:\r\nIn tvOS projects with or without icons there's no visible difference from the drop-down Schemes menu. You can't tell if the project already has an icon or not. This is confusing for iOS developers, used to see the target icon the moment is set up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. create a new tvOS blank, single view project\r\n2. you can run that project, has no icon, can see the icon placeholder in Schemes selector\r\n3. add a valid AppleTV icon to the project\r\n4. scheme / target icon doesn't change\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScheme / target icon change when icon is set\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScheme / target icon doesn't change when icon is set\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)"
