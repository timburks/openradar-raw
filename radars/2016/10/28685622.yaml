        Summary:
        You should be able to modify a vertical block of text at the same time like you can in Vim. In Vim, you can make a vertical selection using visual mode and then make a modification and it will alter all lines at the same time. This is extremely useful in development in certain situations. Currently the only way to get around this limitation is to either open the file in Vim or do it manually. These are both unacceptable alternatives.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        You have a block of comments that all have an * and you want to change them to a -

        /**
          * This is a test. How would you change these
          * characters if you want them to be a different
          * character without having to go and delete each one,
          * one at a time.
        */

        (There are better examples)

        Expected Results:
        I can select all of the characters and do something to be able to insert a single character or multiple characters in its place.

        Actual Results:
        I can only delete them. If I want to insert, I would have to do each one, one at a time.
