    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you migrate Swift 2.x -> Swift 3.0 code in Xcode 8, if and guard statements using `where` are migrated to use a comma instead. Currently the migrator replaces where without removing the leading space, leaving you with `something , something`. Instead it should also remove the leading space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project, change it to use Swift 2.3\r\n2. Add an if statement with a where clause\r\n3. Migrate it to Swift 3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nwhere is replaced with a comma without a leading space\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe space before where is maintained.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:"
