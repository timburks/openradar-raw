    description: "Summary:\r\nOn macOS 10.12 Sierra Navigation Services dialog file lists (created by NavCreateChooseObjectDialog, for example) do not respond correctly to clicks. Clicking on the name of a file or folder in List or Column view does not, as expected, select the item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached NavServicesTest application (found in the build/Release folder)\r\n2. Choose Openâ€¦ from the File menu\r\n3. Set the dialog to List or Column view if it is not already\r\n4. Click on the name of a file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file is selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file is not selected\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClicking on file names with the Option or Command key pressed appears to work correctly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis problem has been observed on a number of recent Retina Macs: the 2015 MacBook Pro 15\", the 2015 MacBook Pro 13\", the 2016 MacBook, and the 2015 5K iMac. I have seen it with my application Fetch, the BareBones applications BBEdit and TextWrangler, and the attached NavServicesTest application. I do not see the bug on the 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. I do not see it on 10.11. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NavServicesTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
