    description: "Summary:\r\nI have several releases in the wild right now (e.g. 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3) and 2.3.4 was released late Wednesday. And though the crash counts for previous releases (2.3.3, 2.3.2, etc.) continue to updated for recent days, the 2.3.4 release is not available in the version picker dropdown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open xcode\r\n2. go to window -> organizer -> crashes\r\n3. Choose version drop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect, with some delay, usually ~24 hours, to see my new version (2.3.4) in the version selector in the crashes organizer with the list of crashes for that version.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see the 2.3.3, 2.3.2, and all other previous releases, but not the latest version. Their numbers continue to update. In fact, because the bulk of our users are now on 2.3.4, I see what looks like a huge reduction in crashes for the previous version (2.3.3), since most folks have moved on to 2.3.4. However, when I look at the crashes in iTunes Connect analytics (https://analytics.itunes.apple.com) I can see that indeed there are still plenty of crashes in the new version (~1k/day).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014), also tried Xcode 8 Beta, XCode 8 Beta 2"
