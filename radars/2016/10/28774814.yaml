    description: "Summary:\r\nThe WatchBackgroundRefresh sample is intended to demonstrate background downloads using a URLSession downloadTask, but in practice the download does not ever complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download WatchBackgroundRefresh  sample code from https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/WatchBackgroundRefresh/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017295\r\n2. Open in Xcode and set the current target to WatchBackgroundRefresh WatchKit App\r\n3. Build and Run in the iPhone and Watch simulators\r\n4. Once the app has launched, tap the Schedule Refresh Button\r\n5. Immediately type Command-Shift-H to simulate pressing the Digital Crown, sending the app into the background\r\n6. Wait and monitor the Xcode console output\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter Step 4 the following line should appear on the console:\r\n\r\nsuccessfully scheduled background task, use the crown to send the app to the background and wait for handle:BackgroundTasks to fire.\r\n\r\nAfter Step 5 the following lines should appear:\r\n\r\nreceived background task:  <WKSnapshotRefreshBackgroundTask: 0x7b565410>\r\nreceived background task:  <WKApplicationRefreshBackgroundTask: 0x7b36a980>\r\napplication task received, start URL session\r\nRejoining session <URLSession: 0xXXXXX>\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter Step 4 the following line appears as expected:\r\n\r\nsuccessfully scheduled background task, use the crown to send the app to the background and wait for handle:BackgroundTasks to fire.\r\n\r\nAfter Step 5 the following lines appear:\r\n\r\nreceived background task:  <WKSnapshotRefreshBackgroundTask: 0x7b565410>\r\nreceived background task:  <WKApplicationRefreshBackgroundTask: 0x7b36a980>\r\napplication task received, start URL session\r\n\r\nBut we never see the line expected next:\r\n\r\nRejoining session <URLSession: 0xXXXXX>\r\n\r\nOr indication that the download has completed. The app's Dock snapshot  is never updated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatchBackgroundRefresh  \r\n https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/WatchBackgroundRefresh/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017295\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nI failed to mention the most important part: I see these results with Xcode 8 (8A218a) and with Xcode 8.1b3 (8T47)"
