    description: "In Keyboard Maestro, my users configure the function keys heavily to control their Mac the way they want it to operate.\r\n\r\nWith the Touch Bar, as well as taking away the function keys, there appears to be no way to add to the Control Strip to allow non-active applications to provide services.  The need for this should be obvious given Xcode ships with the ability to do this!  If you guys need to do it, chances are the rest of us will too!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSierra Touch Bar. 10.12.1"
