    description: "As of Xcode 8.0, the API reference states the following:\r\n\r\n\"Currently, NSApplicationActivationPolicyNone and NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory may be changed to NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular, but other modifications are not supported.\"\r\n\r\nNSApplication.h, on the other hand, has more up-to-date information:\r\n\r\n\"In OS X 10.9, any policy may be set; prior to 10.9, the activation policy may be changed to NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited or NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular, but may not be changed to NSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory.\"\r\n\r\nThe change in OS X 10.9 is pretty significant for apps that can switch between being a standard Dock app and living in the menu bar, for example, as it means we don't have to specify LSUIElement=1 and relaunch when removing ourselves from the Dock anymore. So it would be nice if this change got documented properly."
