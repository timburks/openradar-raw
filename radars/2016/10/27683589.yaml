    description: "I have an app  that presents SFSafariViewController and user logs in, but in order to log in they receive push notification to authenticator application (which is separate application such as MePin or NokNok Passport) when user taps the notification authenticator app opens and user provides fingerprint or pin to authenticate, then they should return to the app which is user logging into and SFSafariViewController should stay on the same page before user tapped the push notification but it doesn't it seems like it refreshes the website or navigates to the initial URL. It would seem that if I authenticate and return to my app really fast then SFSafariViewController will remain on the correct page and won't refresh.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample:\r\n1. Present SFSafariViewController from your app\r\n2. on receiving push notification from another app tap it to open the other app\r\n3. while in the other app tap around\r\n4. return back to your app via status bar back button\r\n5. SFSafariViewController will refresh the page\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController should not refresh the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController refresh the page when returning from the background\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 developer beta 4 also iOS 10.0.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s and iPhone 7"
