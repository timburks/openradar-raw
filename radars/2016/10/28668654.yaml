        Summary:
        When restoring my iPhone, I got into a situation where I can’t do anything because the phone thinks it is online but it is joined to a captive WiFi network but hasn’t authenticated.  Presumably the same thing would happen if you joined a WiFi network with no internet access

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Restore iPhone using iTunes
        Tap Hello
        Join a captive WiFi network
        Tap Next
        Sign in with Apple ID:
        “Verification Failed
          There was an error connecting to the Apple ID server.”
        Tap Don’t have an Apple ID or forgot it?
        Tap Set Up Later in Settings
        Tap Don’t Use
        Alert Disappears, back button briefly disappears and then reappears

        Expected Results:
        When joining the captive WiFi network you should be presented with a web browser allowing you to authenticate with it as you would in settings.  You should also be able to leave a joined WiFi network.
        When tapping “Don’t use” from the “Don’t have an Apple ID or forgot it” view, the setup process should continue.

        Actual Results:
        There is no way to authenticate with a captive network.  There is no way to leave the network once you have joined.  There is no way to turn off WiFi and use cell data.
        Tapping “Don’t use” from the “Don’t have an Apple ID or forgot it” view does nothing

        Notes:
        Not sure if relevant but during restoration  iTunes prompted with the “Activation Lock” screen where I entered my AppleID and password
