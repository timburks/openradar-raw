    description: "Summary:\r\nLike many users I use multiple messaging apps but most of these apps does not have desktop or even web apps. As far as I know apps like Whatsapp, Snap, Whirl and others do not have Mac apps. And dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge and others do not even have websites for messaging. It would be helpful if there were a unified protocol which allows these third-party iOS apps to be able to interact also on the Mac via the Messenger app. And it would be equally helpful to also integrate on the iPhone. Perhaps Apple could create a service which handles the integration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would be able to message people in various apps on my iPhone or on my Mac just like I can with SMS messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost apps have no way to access messages on the Mac or a website.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10, macOS Sierra\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith the new features related to Messaging on the iPhone I'd like to see it extended to support third-party integrations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLatest iPhone and Mac"
