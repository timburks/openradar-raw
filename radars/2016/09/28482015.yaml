    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen \"Gather coverage data\" is checked, and unit tests and UI tests are attached to the target, running llvm-cov on the resulting Coverage.profdata does not include coverage from UI tests. The coverage is shown correctly in the Xcode UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS application target with unit tests & UI tests\r\n2. Edit the target's scheme to \"Gather coverage data\"\r\n3. Add a UI test\r\n4. Run the following commands:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -scheme <scheme> -derivedDataPath ./out -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6s' test\r\nxcrun llvm-cov show -instr-profile ./out/Build/Intermediates/CodeCoverage/Coverage.profdata ./out/Build/Intermediates/CodeCoverage/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/<Application>.app/<Application>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth unit tests and UI test coverage is reflected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly unit test coverage is reflected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a) on macOS Sierra 10.12 (16A323)"
