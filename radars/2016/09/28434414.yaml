    description: "Summary:\r\nThe message label of a CNContactViewController is displayed in a quite large font and is truncated to one line. This is a step back from ABPerson/UnknownViewController where the label was displayed in a smaller font and multiple lines (at least initially, see rdar://28434218).\r\n\r\nWhen the content is scrolled upwards, the font size is decreased revealing more of the truncated text. This looks ugly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project and hit the \"New Contact\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message property should be displayed in a reasonably small font with multiple lines and the font size decreased on scrolling.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message property is displayed in a quite large font and is truncated to one line.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nStart the app again (important!) and tap \"New Contact (legacy)\" instead to compare with ABUnknownViewController's layout."
