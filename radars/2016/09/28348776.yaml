    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up Boot Camp, the estimated installation time is given in minutes and seconds, and neither is singularized correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be on a Mac set to US English.\r\n2. Open Boot Camp Assistant.\r\n3. Start a Windows installation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label indicating the time remaining uses correct singulars when referring to 1 minute or 1 second.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt always uses “minutes” and “seconds,” including “1 minutes” and “1 seconds”.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo idea if it’s always been like this, and I don’t have a Sierra installation handy to check if it’s fixed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot also uploaded to https://cl.ly/hUD1"
