    description: "eter Steinberger06-Sep-2016 08:47 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe border radius of UIDocumentMenuViewController in a popover doesn't match up. Seems like the radius is slightly off... it's a detail but it really doesn't look great. Notice the white border in the selected state.\r\n\r\nIn my deal world, the arrow would fill up with the selection as well, but that's a design decision. \r\n\r\nTweet: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/773229245359325184\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse pdfviewer.io or any other app that exposes the UIDocumentMenuViewController. Select a button. Notice the radius has problems.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should fill completely, without white shadow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRadius differences.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8b6, iOS 10b8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTrying this on the Simulator or a pristine device has the added benefit that only one item is available so you see all 4 edges.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-09-06 at 20.37.32.png' was successfully uploaded."
