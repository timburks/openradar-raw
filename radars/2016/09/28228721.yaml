    description: "Summary:\r\nThe following UITextContentTypes behave the same as UITextContentTypeFullStreetAddress:\r\n\r\nUITextContentTypeStreetAddressLine1\r\nUITextContentTypeStreetAddressLine2\r\nUITextContentTypeAddressCity\r\nUITextContentTypeAddressState\r\nUITextContentTypePostalCode\r\n\r\nRather than inserting only part of the address string (eg. the city or state name), the entire address string is inserted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a text field and set its `textContentType` to `UITextContentTypeAddressCity`.\r\n2. Open the maps app and select an address (or do something else that will prompt the system to suggest an address when we return to the text field).\r\n3. Run the app with the text field and make it the first responder.\r\n4. Observe that the address from step 2 is suggested by the keyboard.\r\n5. Tap on the suggestion.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe city name should be entered into the text field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe full address string is entered into the text field.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
