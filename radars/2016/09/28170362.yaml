    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 extensions are not able to force the compiler to show a warning at a certain line. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an Xcode 8 extension\r\n- Have a situation where you’d prefer to show a warning rather than changing the text directly\r\n- Have no way to do that\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Would like to be able to emit warnings via the compiler for things which need to be addressed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Can’t. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n(Not a regression, this is a new feature)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBasically this would be really helpful for any kind of linting extension, because it brings greater awareness to the user of when they’ve violated a particular linter’s spec. It could also be used to emit warnings for possible non-localized strings or other stringly-typed code likely to fail because we are all awful spellers."
