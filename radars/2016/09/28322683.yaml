        Apparently the first party Apple Workouts app supports pausing a workout via the side and digital crown buttons. This is a neat interaction that I hadn’t heard about. I’d like to request two enhancements to this functionality:

        1) I’d like third party apps to be able to use this event to pause and resume their workouts. The API for this already exists, via the HKWorkoutSession handleGeneratedEvents method, that includes event types for pause and resume. That method is not currently called when this button action is taken. I’d like for that to be the case so that third party workout apps can be consistent with the main system app.

        2) I’d like for the button action to also work on the watch face. Currently it only works when the main Fitness app is in the foreground. I think it should work at any time that a workout session is active.

        Bonus

        3) I’d like for John Gruber’s suggestion to be implemented regarding the dual use of this for taking screenshots. As a workout app developer, I take screenshots all the time. I think this would be a huge benefit for my own use and that of many other developers and power users.
