    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhenever I have issues with my iOS device, or my install isn't working properly and I'm seeing a lot of bugs, I'm instructed to reset my device to factory settings. However, I can't do this without restoring from a backup because I want to keep my two years worth of HealthKit data. \r\n\r\nI'm also unable to even export Health data from the Health App. And even if that did suceed, I'm unable to import the data that is exported.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run into multiple iOS errors/bugs\r\n2. Be told by Apple Support across various support lines to restore my iPhone as new\r\n3. There is no present way to restore from new AND keep health data\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExport data from Health App Successfully (which I am unable to do as well)\r\n\r\nImport exported Health data to a brand new fresh install of iOS\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't import existing Health Data into the health app without a full backup and restore, thus bringing over various iOS bugs \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.5 (13G36)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne of the biggest issues even with this solution is I have no possible way to export my data from the Health App. I've let my iPhone sit, unlocked, for hours, and I always have the Health App crash and unable to export my data. This is an issue and reason I want to restore my iPhone and start from new, but I can't even do that because I want to completely keep all of my health data."
