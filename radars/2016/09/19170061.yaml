    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Base Station>Restart… command in Airport Utility 6.3.4 shows an ellipsis after it, implying that there will be a confirmation dialog of some nature before the base station is restarted. However, the selected base station is restarted immediately, with no further user interaction. This is not only poor UI, it could result in bad consequences. For instance, I chose that menu command before I warned others on the network that the LAN would go down, because I assumed that there would be an additional step before the Time Capsule restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Airport Utility\r\n2. Select a base station.\r\n3. Choose Base Station>Restart…\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dialog to appear confirming whether I actually want to restart my base station.\r\n\r\nAlternately, leave functionality as it is and remove the ellipsis.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe base station is restarted immediately."
