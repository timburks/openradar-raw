    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWkWebView will not load urls that are plain http:// It appears to load urls that are https:// without problems. WkWebView works as expected in main iOS app. This only appears to be an issue with the extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample project.\r\n\r\nRun MessagesExtension target\r\n\r\nTap 'https' button: https://google.com loads\r\nTap 'http' button: http://lurefishbar.com does not load. There is no network request made (verified with http proxy Charles)\r\n\r\nI have tested with a variety of plain http:// urls. None of them load.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWkWebView loads both http and https urls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlank WkWebView\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S 128GB Verizon on Wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestWkWebViewHttpInExtension.zip' was successfully uploaded."
