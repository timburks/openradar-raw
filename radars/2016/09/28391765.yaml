    description: "Summary:\r\nWatchBackgroundRefresh (official Apple sample code), the call to scheduleBackgroundRefresh doesn't work on an Apple Watch with watchOS 3.0 (14S326). It does work on the Watch Simulator.\r\n\r\nSpecifically no callbacks to handle(...) are made after the call to scheduleBackgroundRefresh for either background processing or snapshot refresh.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/WatchBackgroundRefresh/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nThere are also other public comments about this issue:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39202187/watchos3-handle-backgroundtasks-setwkrefreshbackgroundtask-on-device-be-ca\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download WatchBackgroundRefresh sample code:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/WatchBackgroundRefresh/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\n2. Run on Apple Watch with watchOS 3.0 (14S326)\r\n\r\n3. Press \"Schedule Refresh\" button\r\n\r\n4. Put app in background by pressing digital crown to return to home screen\r\n\r\n5. Watch Xcode logs for activity\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCallbacks to handle(...) are made for WKApplicationRefreshBackgroundTask. This is indicated by Xcode log: \"received background task: ...\"\r\n\r\nAlso callback expected for snapshot refresh, i.e. WKSnapshotRefreshBackgroundTask\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo callbacks occur\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S326)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the issue is background budget for example, then debug mode should give indication of the cause rather than silently failing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S326)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
