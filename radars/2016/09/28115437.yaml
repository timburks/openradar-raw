    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen compiling with the iOS 10 SDK, and running on an iOS 10 device, calling MFMailComposeViewController() can return nil when MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail is false, despite the fact that its initializer is not marked as failable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with a fresh simulator that has no mail accounts installed.\r\n2. Write an app that initializes a MFMailComposeViewController, like this: MFMailComposeViewController().\r\n3. Notice that the value returned by MFMailComposeViewController() is actually nil and could potentially cause a crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are two expected results:\r\na. MFMailComposeViewController() would never return nil (this was the behavior on iOS 9), or\r\nb. MFMailComposeViewController() would be marked as failable, so Swift consumers would have to handle the optionality of the return value.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMFMailComposeViewController() returns nil, despite not being marked as a failable initializer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MFMailComposeViewControllerBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
