    description: "Summary:\r\nOur application will occasionally crash when attempting to set vocabulary strings on INVocabulary using -setVocabularyStrings:ofType:\r\n\r\nWe have not yet been able to reproduce.\r\n\r\nOn very rare occasions, the Intents framework will invoke -[_INVocabulary _THROW_EXCEPTION_FOR_ATTEMPT_TO_PROVIDE_VOCABULARY_OF_TYPE_THAT_APP_DOES_NOT_HANDLE_:] which raises an exception and crashes our application.\r\n\r\nOur app supports INSendPaymentIntent and INRequestPaymentIntent. We also take care to not set or remove vocabulary strings unless the user has authorized our application to use the shared vocabulary. The SiriKit integration works successfully for most users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWe are not yet able to reproduce. The issue occurs rarely when we attempt to set new vocabulary strings for Siri using INVocabulary.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should not crash when updating the vocabulary with types that our application can handle and the user has authorized the application to work with the Siri vocabulary.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application occasionally crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAffects all devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CrashLogs.zip' was successfully uploaded."
