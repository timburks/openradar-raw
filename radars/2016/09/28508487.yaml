    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Music provides the user options to “Love” and “Dislike” tracks. A track a user has “Disliked” should never appear in Apple Music’s auto-generated playlists (My Favourites Mix and My New Mix).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Apple Music\r\n2. Open the most recent “My Favourites List” on the “For You” tab\r\n3. “Dislike” one the tracks, eg. by Force Touching the track and tapping “Dislike”\r\n4. Wait until next Wednesday when the Favourites Mix is refreshed with new tracks\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe track you disliked should be banished from the My Favourites List, and should never be suggested to the user again. Ideally, if disliking a track from a Mix, that track should also be removed from the current Mix. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the My Favourites List is refreshed, the disliked track is still a contender for selection, and may appear in the new mix. If disliking the track from within the mix, the track remains in the list. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nReproducible on Apple Music in iOS 10.1 (14B55c), as well as iOS 10.0.1 and iTunes 12.5.1.21.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne of the first generated lists I received included Miike Snow’s Genghis Kahn (https://itun.es/us/yLuq_?i=1061243229), a song I find particularly grating. I “Disliked” (and skipped) this track when it first played, and it appears as “Disliked” on both iOS’ Music.app (DislikedTrackiPhone.PNG) and iTunes (DislikedTrackiTunes.png). Since disliking it, it’s been included in two or three additional My Favourites Mixes, including the one generated today (Wed 28th September, 2016, MyFavouritesMix.jpg): https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/my-favorites-mix/idpl.pm-20e9f373919da080d123ca1d7a118f0f\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus (iOS 10.1/14B55c) / iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) running macOS 10.12 (16A319) with iTunes 12.5.1.21. Apple Music is also running on an iPad (iOS 10.0.1) and an iPhone 6s running iOS 10.0.2."
