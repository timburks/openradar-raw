    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connected to CarPlay:  When a text message, iMessage, Push Notification, etc. are received on my iPhone it flashes for a few seconds on my car deck and then goes away.  If not acknowledged on CarPlay, after a given amount of time, I expect this to go to my Apple Watch but it never does.\r\n\r\nIt seems my iPhone assumes I have acknowledged the notification since it, very briefly, flashed on my car deck.  This is a flawed assumption seeing that, and I know Apple would agree, my eyes should be on the road and therefore can't stare at my car deck continually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect Phone to CarPlay\r\n2. Have an Apple Watch connected to same iPhone as CarPlay\r\n3. Have someone send any type of notification to you (text, iMessage, etc...)\r\n4. Do not acknowledge notification on phone or CarPlay\r\n5. Apple Watch will never receive the notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf, without CarPlay, Apple is ok sending notifications to my Apple Watch while I'm driving...then it seems logical to expect the same behavior when I am connected to CarPlay.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider the current design as this bad UX renders my Apple Watch almost useless while connected to CarPlay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification flashes only once on the car deck and only for a few seconds.  No other alert is received on CarPlay or iPhone and is never sent to Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUX is incorrect and disregards the entire purpose of the Apple Watch - to be an extension of my iPhone; primarily to ease notifications.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nCarPlay, iPhone 6s Plus, and Apple Watch Sport"
