        Summary:

        If you have different .entitlements files set for different build build configurations, the Capabilities tab under target settings will only show the settings that are applicable to the default configuration. Therefore, if you switch the current build configuration (using scheme switcher), the Capabilities tab won’t reflect the reality for non-default configurations

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the test case project
        2. Switch scheme to “Release”
        3. Go to project -> app target -> Capabilities

        Expected Results:
        - Under Keychain access groups, you should see “com.nozbe.TestCaseGroup” (as in Release.entitlements)

        Actual Results:
        - You will see “com.nozbe.dev.TestCaseGroup” (as in Debug.entitlements)
