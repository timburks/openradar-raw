    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe use XIBs througout our project and we have lots and lots of them. As Xcode 8 became publicly available we downloaded the Xcode 8 from App store and udpated our development environments. Now when I open any XIB it asks me \"Choose an initial device view\" and I started choosing \"iPhone 6s plus\" as the device. The XIBs are now resized to a particular device size and all the controls inside it are also resized accordingly because all of them are controlled via autolayout. Everything looks good in XIB. Now when I run the application (simulator or device) and go to the particular view couple of controls do not appear at all on screen. If I break the constraint in XIB by moving them 1 point from where they are supposed to be and then run the application, they load without any errors. I tried everything that was possible in XIB including deleting and adding all the constraints but I am still seeing the same problem. If I revert the XIB to Xcode 7.x compatibility then it works fine. But with Xcode 8 it doesnt allow me to make changes to XIB which is compatible with Xcode 7.x."
