    description: "See, for instance: https://self-signed.badssl.com/\r\nThe dialogue displayed warning the user that the certificate the server presented is untrusted is very easy to ignore. An average user, conditioned to click the default (or, here, rightmost) button to skip past similar warnings, could easily skip past the message and effectively deprive themselves of all the protection TLS is meant to provide."
