    description: "Summary:\r\nA few minutes ago, I accidentally deleted a PDF book from iBooks. I'm not 100% sure what happened, but I was in the list view, and I was trying to edit an author name.\r\n\r\nI *think* what happened was that the text field became unexpectedly deselected as I was trying to correct a typo. Instead of backspacing, iBooks thought I wanted to delete the book. The confirmation dialog came up, but I was still typing. I pressed return to commit my change to the author name, but since the dialog had just appeared, I was actually confirming the \"Delete Everywhere\" button.\r\n\r\nThis all happened within a second or so. I did not have a chance to even read the text of the dialog. I wasn't even sure what I had accidentally confirmed until I noticed the book was gone.\r\n\r\nThis button should not be the default. It is *very* hard to recover from. I was able to get my book back because I have technical knowledge of where iCloud Drive files are stored, and a Time Machine backup. Normal users would not be able to recover from this. As far as I can tell, deleted iBooks aren't even visible in the \"Recover Files\" section of icloud.com.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iBooks for Mac\r\n2. Select a book\r\n3. Press the delete key on your keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should not be easy to accidentally, immediately, and irrevocably delete a book from every device I own.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's very easy to do this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 (16B2333a)\r\niBooks 1.7 (1253.15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a screenshot of the dialog that appears.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-09-28 at 6.19.13 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
