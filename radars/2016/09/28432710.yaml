    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen looking at the stream of logs from the current Mac device in Console 1.0 (1.6.8) on macOS Sierra 10.12 (16A323) when running as a Standard user the view that should display logging output is completely blank. However, if you use the \"log stream\" command in Terminal, which is the same data as I understand it, you get the expected output without being asked for admin credentials or to use \"sudo\". Since the command line can return the stream to Standard users, it seems like the fact that Console cannot display the logging stream is a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in to macOS Sierra as a Standard user\r\n2. Open the Console app\r\n3. Make sure the Mac you are using is selected under the Devices section of the sidebar\r\n4. Notice that nothing is displayed in the main section of the Console window where log messages should show up\r\n5. Also go to the Terminal app and run \"log stream\"\r\n6. Notice that in this environment you are shown the appropriate stream of log messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Console app should be able to show the stream of log messages to Standard users, not just running \"log stream\" in Terminal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Console app does not show any stream of log messages, though with the same permissions running \"log stream\" in Terminal does.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12/16A323"
