    description: "Summary:\r\nPresenting a view controller in the current presentation context when there is a split view controller in the VC hierarchy between the presenting view controller and the context-defining view controller will cause the presentation context frame to be incorrect after device rotation. Instead of being the frame of the context-defining view controller, it will become the frame of the secondary VC of the UISplitViewController. \r\nThe attached project demonstrates this.\r\n(Openradar note) Attached project setup : \r\nA container VC A with definesPresentationContext = YES\r\n->containing a UISplitViewController B\r\n    ->B is presenting a viewController C with modalPresentationStyle = OverCurrentContext\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached project, run on an iPad device / simulator.\r\n1. Rotate to landscape\r\n2. Press the button to present\r\n3. Rotate the device to portrait and back to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe presented VC is still presented over the whole SplitViewController (which defines the context)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe presented VC is only presented over the secondary part of the SplitViewController\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad"
