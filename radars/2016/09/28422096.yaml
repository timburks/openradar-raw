    description: "Summary:\r\nNormally, when you call -finishTasksAndInvalidate on an NSURLSession, it calls -URLSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError on its delegate as soon as its last task is finished. However, that does not happen with a background session on iOS 10 if the app is sent to background state and back to foreground during download.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached project and Product->Test it on iOS 10 Simulator or device. There is one UI test performing the steps listed below.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can Run the app and do the same steps manually:\r\n1. Launch the app from the attached project on iOS 10 Simulator or device.\r\n2. Tap \"Start Download\".\r\n3. Wait for the download to finish.\r\n— The label below will say \"Session invalidated\", which is expected.\r\n5. Tap \"Start Download\" again.\r\n6. When the progress indicator starts moving again, press the Home button.\r\n7. Wait 1-2 seconds and tap the app icon again to return to foreground.\r\n8. Wait for the download to finish.\r\n— The label will say \"Task completed\" but never switch to \"Session invalidated\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-urlSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError: is called and the label shows \"Session invalidated\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-urlSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError: is NOT called and the label shows \"Task completed\", indicating that only -urlSession:didCompleteWithError: was called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A345), iOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you call -finishTasksAndInvalidate again after returning to foreground, the session _will_ call -urlSession:didBecomeInvalidWithError: on the delegate after finishing the tasks.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTried on several iOS devices and simulators, probably any of those\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'URLSessionInvalidation.zip' was successfully uploaded. // also available here: https://github.com/garkhipov/URLSessionInvalidation"
