        Summary:
        Some podcasts like Emoji Wrap from Emojipedia have emoji in their metadata. When this is displayed in Control Centre the characters are darkened and less legible.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play a podcast from Emoji Wrap by Emojipedia
        2. Swipe up Control Centre

        Expected Results:
        The emoji characters in the episode metadata are rendered as they are elsewhere in the system (including the same episode meta data displayed on the lock screen)

        Actual Results:
        The emoji characters are rendered very dark, like as if there is a dark overlay over them. Itâ€™s very difficult to see the detail in them or in some cases to identify what they are
