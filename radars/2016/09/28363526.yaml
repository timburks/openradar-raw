    description: "Summary:\r\nThe compiler (tested with Swift 2.3) complains about using NSLocale properties when deploying to iOS 8/9 even though the same property names were available before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n// Create target to deploy to iOS 8.x or 9.x\r\nimport Foundation\r\n// here the compiler will complain:\r\nlet symbol = NSLocale.autoupdatingCurrentLocale().currencySymbol\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUpgrading to Swift 2.3 would continue to work. Maybe a few adjustments here and there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe compiler informs me that currencyCode and others are marked as available for iOS 10+ only and that my code has to take this into account. \r\n\r\nThe thing is: since this is a runtime switch and not a compile time switch, I cannot compile with the new SDK for the old version; I have to provide an alternative code path for devices running iOS 8/9. But the only alternative is to use the property with the same name. Only the compiler won't allow.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.0\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
