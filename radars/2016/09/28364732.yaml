    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextView can not correctly handle rotation because it layouts subviews using its frame instead of bounds. When transform is not identity frame is unusable, quoted from doc:\r\n“If the transform property is not the identity transform, the value of this property is undefined and therefore should be ignored.”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Activate text view.\r\n3. Input text.\r\n4. See the text view’s content does not fit its bounds\r\n5. Read the console logs to see the mismatch of between text view and its _UITextContainerView.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cvygAqlgCds\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe it is a very old bug. People are discussing it since 2011: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6479727/applying-transform-to-uitextview-prevent-content-resizing"
