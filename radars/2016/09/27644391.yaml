    description: "Summary:\r\nI use custom UICollectionViewCell with auto layout constraints. With iOS 10 beta4 (and also beta3, I don't know for previous versions) when the layoutSubview() is called the subviews bounds are not set correctly.\r\n\r\nIndeed the cell bounds is correct, however the bounds for each subview seems to have default values. I have to scroll the collectionView to update the cell properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the project\r\n2. Run the example (whatever the device)\r\n3. The cells are \"empty\" (only orange background)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach cell should contains a green circle over the orange background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cells are \"empty\" (only orange background)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 - beta 3 and over\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulators and iPad mini 2"
