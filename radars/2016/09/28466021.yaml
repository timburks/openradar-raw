    description: "Summary:\r\nQLPreviewPanel on macOS 10.12 Sierra will always log about AutoLayout issues when it is invoked.  It does not appear as a developer there is anything we can do about this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. @import Quartz; and then call [QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe sound of silence.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is always this log:\r\n\r\n\"2016-09-25 10:07:33.341804 QLPreviewPanelBug[9792:528062] [Layout] Detected missing constraints for <private>.  It cannot be placed because there are not enough constraints to fully define the size and origin. Add the missing constraints, or set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=YES and constraints will be generated for you. If this view is laid out manually on macOS 10.12 and later, you may choose to not call [super layout] from your override. Set a breakpoint on DETECTED_MISSING_CONSTRAINTS to debug. This error will only be logged once.\"\r\n\r\nBecause our app checks to see if the preview panel is visible as part of an event chain override, this message is logged immediately when our app launches on every single launch.  Having unnecessary logging makes it hard to identify legitimate problems/debug/deal with xcode popping stuff up/etc.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 GM and 10.12.1 beta (16B2327e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis affects Tumult Hype (http://tumult.com/hype/)."
