    description: Since Sierra currently brakes Karabiner (https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), and since many of us use Karabiner to map the Caps Lock key to a Hyper Key (https://www.nadeau.tv/configure-hyper-key-osx/), Control-Command-Option-Shift, and since macOS already can map the caps lock key to a modifier, it would be extremely excellent if you allowed mapping the caps lock key to Control-Command-Option-Shift.
