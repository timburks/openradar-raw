    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a Swift project where SWIFT_VERSION is set to 2.3 for all targets. Yet sometimes when compiling you see compiler fixits that suggest syntax changes for Swift 3.0. I'd estimate that it happens more than half the time I do a clean build. The build still succeeds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift project\n2. Set use legacy swift version to yes\n3. Add some syntax such as `guard let ... where ... else {}` that has changed in Swift 3\n4. Compile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should compile with no warnings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes Swift 3 fixits show up while the app is compiling.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached screenshot for a small example."
