    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to match a MPMediaItem object to an entity from the iTunes search API, there needs to be a field that exposes the Store ID of the item. If a user has an Apple Music subscription, this would allow playing the content using the queueWithStoreIDs method on MPMusicPlayerController.\r\n\r\nThis would only be relevant for iOS 9.3 and up since queueWithStoreIDs was first introduced then.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Query for MPMediaItems\r\n2. Sync the data across multiple devices within my app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSongs are playable on the other device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no relevant ID matching the song to playable content\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
