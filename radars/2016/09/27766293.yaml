    description: "Summary:\r\nApp is unable to resume a previously interrupted download task. \r\n(Session is created with backgroundSessionConfiguration) \r\nIf the app gets terminated while download task is in progress, NSURLSessionTaskDelegate gets called and it receives the error with download task resume data. \r\nApp stores the received data and then tries to create a download task using -[NSURLSession downloadTaskWithResumeData:].\r\n\r\nError received:\r\n*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: data is NULL\r\n\r\nTask gets created but most of it's properties are not set, for instance currentRequest or originalRequest.\r\n\r\nThat results in this error:\r\nInvalid resume data for background download. Background downloads must use http or https and must download to an accessible file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project for an app that uses background download with NSURLSession\r\n2. Start downloading a file\r\n3. Manually terminate the app before the download\r\n4. Try to recreate a download task using resume data received in the \r\n- [URLSession: task:didCompleteWithError:] method\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTask to resume download is created and previous download continues, as it does when the app is running on iOS9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-[NSURLSession downloadTaskWithResumeData:].\r\n\r\nError received:\r\n*** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver initForReadingWithData:]: data is NULL\r\n\r\nTask gets created but most of it's properties are not set, for instance currentRequest or originalRequest.\r\n\r\nThat results in this error:\r\nInvalid resume data for background download.
