    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the timer in WatchOS 3, the timer displays a notification with the text COUNT_DOWN_TIME_REACHED after the timer expires.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Raise watch and say \"Hey Siri, set a timer for one minute\"\r\n2. Wait for timer to expire.\r\n3. Click Stop on the timer expired screen.\r\n4. Wait a few seconds. A notification will appear from Alarms with the text COUNT_DOWN_TIME_REACHED.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect one of two behaviors. Either:\r\n1) No notification is generated. The timer expired screen (together with taps from the taptic engine) is sufficient notification.\r\n2) A notification is generated with text along the lines of \"The timer expired\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA notification appears with the text \"COUNT_DOWN_TIME_REACHED\""
