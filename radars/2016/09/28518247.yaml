    description: "Summary:\r\nMore options for audio message expiration would be useful, as the current options are too limited. Currently there are only \"After 2 Minutes\" and \"Never\". These 2 options are drastically opposite ends of the spectrum, and there leaves a lot of desired options in between, such as a few hours, days, or even 1 month.\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, regular text iMessages have expiration options of 30 Days, 1 Year and Forever. Audio messages should offer more options along those lines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Settings > Messages > Expire (Audio Messages).\r\n2. There are only 2 options, \"After 2 Minutes\" and \"Never\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMore options for expiration, such as a few hours, days, or even 1 month.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly 2 options, which are too limited. 2 minutes is just too short of time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a suggestion for additional options that should be a relatively trivial addition and a huge gain in usability.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device with iMessage\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
