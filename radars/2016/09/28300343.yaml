    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 10, any text typed into in a contenteditable element within a WKWebView will not trigger an automatic scrollview scroll to keep the caret on screen. So if the input text/caret goes underneath the on-screen keyboard, or off the bottom of the view, the user has to manually scroll the view to keep the input text in sight, which is a serious usability issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the attached project: tap the text to start editing and trigger the display of the on-screen keyboard, and type/press return until the caret goes underneath the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen text is input while the caret is not visible, the scrollview should automatically scroll so that the caret, and the input text, is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe input text is added to the content editable element but the scroll view does not scroll. To see the input text, the scroll view has to be scrolled by swiping.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue does not occur in iOS 9.3 and lower. It does occur in the iOS 10.0 GM.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIâ€™ll attach a project to demonstrate this issue, which is also available from https://github.com/Bipsync/ios-wkwebview-scrolling."
