    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing the sharing section of the activity app can become confusing if you have multiple contacts with the same first name. I have two contacts named Tim in the screenshot attached and I have no idea which contact is which at a glance. I now have to open the full activity ring view then press the info button to load their contact card.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find two friends with the same first name who use the activity app\r\n2. Add them to the activity app and have them accept\r\n3. Look at list and see two entries with the same name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nList should show both first and last name or have the option to enable this\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee two contacts with same name and no way to differentiate between them without going two levels deep\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_2802.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
