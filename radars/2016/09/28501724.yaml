    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a medium sized project that has very inconsistent build behaviour. Sometimes it does an incremental build that is very fast, sometimes it goes on to recompile everything. The build process can be uncomfortably long, which adds friction to the development process...\r\n\r\nThe project is written in Swift 2.3 and utilizes Cocoapods. The project file settings are as close to default as possible.\r\n\r\nIt happens both with device and simulator\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot entirely sure what and when causes the issue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChange a file. Hit run. Recompile only the changed file and any other immediately affected files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe entire project is rebuilt\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a), macOS 10.12 (16A323)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe project folder is on an iCloud Drive folder. The DerivedData is in it's default location (the issue happens with deleted DerivedData too)\r\n\r\nI have run \"defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ExplainWhyBuildCommandsAreRun -bool YES\"\r\nThe attached build log is with it. According to it \r\n\r\nCompile Swift source files\r\nCompileSwiftSources normal x86_64 com.apple.xcode.tools.swift.compiler\r\n    (running because command line arguments are different from the last time)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
