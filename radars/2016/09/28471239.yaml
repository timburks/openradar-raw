    description: "Summary:\r\nExample: Drawing PDF pages using CGContextDrawPDFPage can consume a lot of memory for some users' documents. Since this is a blackbox operation, there's no way for us to respond correctly to memory warnings.\r\n\r\nIf we'd be able to isolate the rendering in a separate process and iOS kills it, at least the app itself wouldn't need to be killed and users wouldn't be interrupted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Render a PDF page containing a high resolution image\r\n2. Watch the app crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA way for us to avoid crashing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way for us to avoid crashing"
