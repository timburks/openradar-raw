    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode suggesting to make optional delegate methods private instead of inferring the correct method is a recipe for disaster and I'm pretty sure not something anyone wants ever.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a Swift 2 project in Xcode and don't automatically convert it\r\nOpen the AppDelegate\r\nThe suggested Fix-It for application:didFinishLaunching is useless\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should offer a better Fix-It to change the parameters\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOffers to make the method private. Runtime crashes are sure to follow if you use that solution\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-09-19 at 14.28.55.png' was successfully uploaded."
