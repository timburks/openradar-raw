    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you've ever disabled the ApplePersistence setting on macOS which (at some point) stopped windows from being reopened on restart, there is an log to standard error about its current state. This is quite noisy for command line tools that utilize the parts of AppKit that trigger this log.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePersistence -bool false` (the value can be anything, there just needs to be one)\r\n2. Create a new Swift file with this contents:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport AppKit\r\n\r\nDispatchQueue.main.async {\r\n    exit(0)\r\n}\r\n\r\nNSApplication.shared().run()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run the swift file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is no output in either stdout or stderr\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is logged to stderr:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-09-21 12:55:10.217 swift[56106:179178] ApplePersistence=NO\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12 16A323\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRun: `defaults delete NSGlobalDomain ApplePersistence` to clear this setting and stop this logging."
