    description: "Peter Steinberger01-Sep-2016 08:47 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSee attached image or this somewhat pointy tweet: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/771327098741030914\r\n\r\nThe AirDrop UI does not scale well when many apps are installed. It uses an alert view that, while scrollable, is quite confusing. Adding icons and using a grid might be a better solution (one could use a UI similar to SpringBoard for selection - or like the activity view controller)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall apps that can open PDF. There are lots. You can also try our PDF Viewer: pspdfkit.com/viewer\r\n\r\nAirDrop a file. Observe massive dialog.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBetter UI\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLoads of text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.5 and 10.0b6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CrRN59MW8AE0lfU.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
