        Summary:
        Trickling in crashes with NSGenericException - Start date cannot be later in time than end date!

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Cannot reproduce locally

        Expected Results:
        No exception

        Actual Results:
        Exception

        Regression:
        New to iOS 10 (makes sense since this is in the new NSURLSessionTaskMetrics code

        Notes:
        Is there potential risk with clock skew?  FWIW: we do all our timing metrics with mach time to avoid potential issues with timezone traversals, regional settings changes or daylight savings time changes.
