        Summary:
        The introduction of the directories for i.e. `GroupContainers` for the `simctl listapps` command is very useful. Unfortunately, it can only be used with a booted simulator device. This command should work with shutdown simulators, too.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a terminal.
        2. Call `xcrun simctl list apps <device>` with <device> being a the UUID of shutdown simulator.

        Expected Results:
        The call prints a json string for each app of the device.

        Actual Results:
        The call prints:
        `An error was encountered processing the command (domain=com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimError, code=163):
        Invalid device state`

        Regression:
