    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a success archive of an iOS app destined for the App Store (successfully built as an archive, manually signed with an iOS Distribution cert/provisioning profile), trying to upload this to iTunes Connect consistently has Xcode 8 crashing on me. Happens whether I manually sign or use automatic signing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build an archive of a release scheme\r\n2. When Organizer window pops up, select just built archive.\r\n3. Select 'Upload to App Store' to send this to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nAfter about 10 seconds of processing, it will crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected a confirmation dialog that iTunes Connect now had my IPA file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode Crashes. The Crash Report on re-open is attached as a .txt file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 GM (8A218a)\r\nEl Capitan 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I build using the command line to archive and export to an IPA, when I upload via iTunes Connect via the Application Loader, I do get some errors which may shed light on something Xcode can't handle. Mostly, \"ERROR ITMS-90046\" errors on embedded frameworks (all packaged with Carthage; a mixture of Objective-C and Swift 2.3 frameworks).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy only development machine. Consistent crashing in this scenario.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Uploader Errors submitting command line built IPA.jpg' and 'Xcode8.GM.CrashLog.txt' were successfully uploaded."
