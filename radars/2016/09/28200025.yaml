    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you send a push notification through apns to watchOS, if any of the values in the payload are `null`, the watchOS `didReceiveRemoteNotification` function of `WKUserNotificationInterfaceController` is not called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a watchOS Swift project with a notification scene\r\n2. In your generated `PushNotificationPayload.apns` file, add a custom key with `null` as the value\r\n3. Put a breakpoint in the generated `didReceiveRemoteNotification` function\r\n4. Run the notification scheme\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe breakpoint should be hit and the right notification handler should take over\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince there is a `null` in the payload, the rich notification function is not called, and the static interface is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUse the attached sample project as an example. Delete the commented line from `PushNotificationPayload.apns` to see the rich interface."
