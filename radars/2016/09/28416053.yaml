        Summary:

        Images with embedded color profiles are displayed incorrectly on the iOS lock screen.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) Add the attached Source.JPG to your iPhone so that it shows up in the Photos app.
        2) Open the photo and then bring up the activity sheet.
        3) In the activity sheet, select “Use as Wallpaper”. You will see something like this:

        http://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/LockScreenRadar/Photos%20Set%20Wallpaper%20-%20Color%20Profile%20OK.PNG

        4) Tap “Set”.
        5) Lock your phone, then press the power button to see the lock screen.

        Expected Results:

        The photo on the lock screen should look like it did in Photos.

        Actual Results:

        The color profile is being ignored and raw color values are being sent to the display:
