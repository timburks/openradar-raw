        Summary:
        I should be able to navigate to the declaration of types in the Swift standard library using Open Quickly in Xcode (Cmd+Shift+O) when I'm in a playground.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new Swift playground in Xcode or open an existing one.
        2. Type Cmd+Shift+O to open the Open Quickly UI.
        3. Type "collection" or any other text that matches a type in the Swift stdlib.

        Expected Results:
        The matching type in the Swift stdlib should be the first or one of the first entries in the result list. Selecting it should jump to the declaration in the stdlib (same as Cmd+clicking on a type name).

        Actual Results:
        The search results only show header files from Cocoa (see attached screenshot).

        Regression:
        n/a
