        Summary:
        iMessage app receives no callbacks at all if a message is selected after user scrolls to a different app

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch app from included sample project
        2. Tap insert message
        3. Send
        4. Swipe to a different iMessage app in the app drawer
        5. Tap the message in the conversation view

        Expected Results:
        Message app launches in expanded presentation style and we receive some kind of callback like `didSelectMessage`, `willTransitionToPresentationStyle`, or `didBecomeActiveWithConversation`.

        Actual Results:
        Message app launches in expanded presentation style but receives no callbacks whatsoever.
