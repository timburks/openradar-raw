        The attached screenshot is the Settings bundle that I’m about to submit for the next update of Better (https://better.fyi) because the content blocker activation flow is so broken now that I am getting support requests from people who think that the option to activate the blocker is missing (which it is, from Better’s own settings, which is the only place I can take them).

        Please see rdar://27393941 for more.
