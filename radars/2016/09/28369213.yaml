    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 10 GM, QLPreviewController fails to reliably render xls files. See the screenshots above comparing the sample app (attached) with the iOS 8 and iOS 10 versions of QL.\r\n\r\nThe bug results in the cell grid not properly rendering in cases depending on whether or not there's data in the cells.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip QuickLook.zip\r\n2. Open QuickLook.xcodeproj\r\n3. Build and run for the iOS 10 simulator.\r\n4. Observe artifacting in with both files (grid1/grid2.xls)\r\n5. Build and run for the iOS 8/9 simulator (your choice!)\r\n6. Observe proper behavior\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the grid to render properly, to best represent Excel's output.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe grid does not render properly. See ios10-grid1/grid2 screenshots.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 [14A403]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device that runs iOS 10, or the simulator is sufficient.\r\n\r\nSample App: https://www.dropbox.com/s/csmgljh96uyxiqr/QuickLook.zip?dl=0"
