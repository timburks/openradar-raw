    description: "Summary:\r\nWe'd like to be able to customize the user experience chrome when presenting a web page to our users.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we'd like the ability to change the following:\r\n- Change the navbar \"Done\" button to a close \"x\" glyph or a back button as appropriate.\r\n- Have the navbar \"Done\" button, close \"x\" glyph or back button remain visible and active in the status bar after the navbar has been collapsed via the user scrolling the web page.\r\n- Add our own buttons to the right of navbar's readonly URL text field, such as a \"Share\" button.\r\n- Replace the tab bar with our own implementation.\r\n- Provide a way to know the user's vertical scroll position within the page so that we can overlay custom \"what's next\" content when the user finishes reading the original page.\r\n- Provide a way to specify the color of all elements of chrome associated with SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDisplay a web page to users via SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect to be able to customize SFSafariViewController such that it fits the needs and aesthetic of our applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController cannot be customized and is not useful for us as-is.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall versions of iOS"
