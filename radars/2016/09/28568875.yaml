    description: "Area:\r\nHomeKit (Home app)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 10, HomeKit can frequently get into a state where HMHomeManager returns an empty array of homes, even when some homes have already been set up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. iOS 10\r\n1. Have a HMHome set up.\r\n2. Have remote HomeKit access enabled via Apple TV login.\r\n3. Turn off Wifi, open (Apple's) Home App to access home remotely.\r\n4. Wait a few seconds.\r\n5. Turn on Wifi, open (Apple's) Home App to access home locally.\r\n\r\n* These repro steps have worked to reproduce the issue consistently for me on my home network with my personal HomeKit setup. A friend has the identical problem with his setup. Otherwise, I'm not sure how transferrable they are.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHMHomeMangager should return the array of homes it had before remote access was attempted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHMHomeManager returns an empty array of homes, even seconds after the HMHomeManger gets initialized and its delegate set. homeManagerDidUpdateHomes: is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 [14B55c]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is in both the public 10.0.2 [14A456] release, and remains a problem in the beta seed of 10.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S (64 GB) AT&T, on wifi and cellular"
