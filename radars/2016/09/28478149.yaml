        I’m noticing that the scene and associated nodes contained by a WKInterfaceSKScene in my watchOS 3 app stop working when the app is backgrounded or deactivated for several minutes or more. When I resume the app and it becomes active again, the rest of the UI behaves as expected but the sprite kit scene and nodes are either no longer visible at all, or they don’t respond to SpriteKit actions and commands to modify the node’s content.

        I’m setting up my scene and nodes in code in the app’s awakeWithContext method. I tried moving this code to willActivate and setting up the scene again and presenting it every time, but that doesn’t work either.

        I believe this to be an issue with how watchOS may be optimizing resources for sprite kit content while the app is deactivated. I’m assuming it’s trying to unload content that then isn’t reloaded when the app is reactivated.
