    description: "HealthKit should include a HKQuantityTypeIdentifier constant representing INR (international normalized ratio) as a measure of prothrombin time or coagulation (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time#International_normalized_ratio>).  This would be immensely valuable for people who are taking warfarin (Coumadin) to reduce the possibility of blood clots and who are measuring their own INR at home.\r\n\r\nThe suggested constant name is \"internationalNormalizedRatio\".  The corresponding value should be type Double; the value is unitless.  Typical ranges are 0.8-1.2 for untreated individuals and 1.9-3.1 for individuals taking warfarin.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch the HealthKit API document for references to INR.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA HKQuantityTypeIdentifier representing INR values.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such HKQuantityTypeIdentifier was found."
