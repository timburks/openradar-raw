    description: "*** Description ***\r\n\r\nWhen any app calls into drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates: and `afterScreenUpdates` is YES, the app afterwards exhibits visual bugs with the iOS multi-finger system gestures (five finger pinch to background app, or four finger swipe to move between apps, etc). Specifically, a black frame can be seen when swiping between apps or pinching away to the home screen.\r\n\r\nIf afterScreenUpdates is NO or renderInContext: etc. is used, the issue does not occur.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible in a template iOS project using Apple's own example code for drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates.\r\n\r\n*** Repro Steps ***\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iOS app from a default template, with a single view and label in the view (label is optional)\r\n2. In the main view controller's `viewDidLoad` method, call the following snippet below which calls into drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:\r\n3. Perform a four finger swipe (slowly) on the app to move to another app\r\n\r\nSnippet:\r\n\r\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\r\n        CGRect rect = self.view.bounds;\r\n        UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(rect.size, YES, 0.0f);\r\n        [self.view drawViewHierarchyInRect:rect afterScreenUpdates:YES];\r\n        UIImage *snapshotImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();\r\n        UIGraphicsEndImageContext();\r\n        \r\n        //Don't need to actually do anything with our image to reproduce the bug,\r\n        //so we'll just log it to the console. After this code has run, four finger\r\n        //gestures (to swipe between apps, or background the current app) will show\r\n        //a black frame on iOS 10\r\n        NSLog(@\"%@\", snapshotImage);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n*** Comments ***\r\nContact info:\r\nTwitter: @hmblebee    |    http://sound-of-silence.com/"
