    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to sync podcasts to my iPhone using iTunes, an error message is displayed informing me that podcasts will not be synced because the Podcasts app is not installed on my iPhone. I have other apps on my iPhone that *can* play podcasts, such as the app I developed, Harken For iPhone.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from iTunes 12.4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install iOS 10 and iTunes 12.5.\r\n2. Ensure that the Podcasts app is not installed on the iPhone\r\n3. Configure iTunes to sync podcasts to the iPhone\r\n4. Press the Sync button on iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPodcasts should sync to the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message is displayed by iTunes indicating that podcasts will not be synced because the Podcasts app is not installed on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.5.1\r\niOS 10.0.1\r\nMac OS Sierra 10.12"
