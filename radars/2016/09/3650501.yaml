    description: "I initially thought the option for Exposé to use modifier keys like Shift and Command was genius. When do you ever use those keys ~by themselves~? But those keys activate Exposé even when they are pressed to use normally.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen when using modifier keys with Exposé is that Exposé does not activate until the key is released without another key being pressed in the interim--that is, only on a tap. Perhaps this should be a preference.\r\n\r\nBarring that, or in addition to it, is to use whatever keys I wish with Exposé. For instance, I almost never use my numeric keypad."
