    description: "Link to Example Repo: https://github.com/jzucker2/TableViewFooterBug\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using a custom UITableViewHeaderFooterView as a section footer, the footer jumps to the bottom of the view whenever an item is added or removed by NSFetchedResultsController. As soon as scrolling occurs, the section footer jumps back to its proper place at the bottom of the section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the provided example app\r\n2. Build and deploy to a 10.0 simulator or iPhone running iOS 10.0\r\n3. Click on button in section footer to add an item\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter adding an item, the section footer jumps to the bottom of the UITableView. If the table view is scrolled even slightly, it properly readjusts the section footer back to the bottom of the section.\r\n\r\nIf another item is added, this bug reproduces. If an item is deleted (either by swiping right and tapping on the row's delete action or by tapping the remove item button in the navigation bar) then the bug also reproduces in the exact same way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone 6S 128GB AT&T, and iPhone 7 Plus Simulator 10.0 (14A345)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nDevice: iOS 10.0.1 (14A403) and Sim: iPhone 7 Plus Simulator 10.0 (14A345)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis reproduced on device and on simulator. This might reproduce in older versions of iOS but I did not check yet. (Would have to create a new Core Data stack without NSPersistentContainer).\r\n\r\nAlso found another person with the same issue on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26240549/uitableview-section-footer-view-position-after-endupdates\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S 128GB AT&T and 15\" Retina MacBook Pro with Xcode 8.0 (8A218a)"
