    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen leaving a review for an app it appears that it's always necessary to enter your Apple ID password. Leaving a review should honor the setting to not reprompt for a password after 15 minutes and when authentication is required it should be possible via Touch ID in the same way that purchasing an app can be done solely with Touch ID.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the App Store\r\n2. Find an app you have installed\r\n3. Tap Reviews, scroll down, tap Write a Review\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen Touch ID is enabled you are prompted to authenticate with Touch ID\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are prompted to enter you Apple ID password"
