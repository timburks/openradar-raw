        Summary:
        Accessibility labels for iMessages Sticker Packs are read incorrectly by VoiceOver

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Create a new Sticker Pack Application using the Xcode template
        2) Drag “Bacon.png” into the Sticker Pack group in the Asset Catalog
        3) Set the Name to “Bacon” and leave Accessibility empty (with “Same as Name” showing)
        4) Build and Run the StickerPack with VoiceOver turned on

        Expected Results:
        VoiceOver should read the name as “Bacon”

        Actual Results:
        VoiceOver reads the name as "Bacon P-N-G Accessibility Label"
