    description: "Summary:\r\nSome of my devices have duplicate entries in the Text Message Forwarding settings pane for my devices. Typically, only one of the entries, when turned on, will trigger PIN entry on that device. Toggling the other entry doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Upgrade multiple devices to iOS 9/OS X El Capitan\r\n2. Restore one of the non-iPhone devices\r\n3. On iPhone, open Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding\r\n4. Observe multiple entries\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is only one entry in the list for each of my iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are duplicate entries for my Apple Watch and one of my Macs.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 beta 2 (13A4280e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue seems to be linked to restoring devices without deactivating Wi-Fi Calling first, such as with using Recovery Mode on iPad, Reset All Content and Settings on Apple Watch, or reformatting my Mac.\r\n\r\nThe issue does not seem to affect other iCloud services; the list of devices at iCloud.com has no duplication.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus 64GB T-Mobile, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
