    description: "Summary:\r\nFirst of all big props for bringing safe extensions to Xcode!\r\n\r\nHowever, there’s one thing that’s really missing is the ability to add custom views over the text (i.e. overlays).\r\n\r\nI currently help maintain Peckham (https://github.com/markohlebar/Peckham) which is an Objective-C import helper.\r\n\r\nWe currently can’t upgrade Peckham to use XcodeKit since we can’t show an overlay to choose the matching header.\r\n\r\nThis issue may seem to be Objective-C specific but I’m sure that adding overlays will help extensions all across their spectrum.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:"
