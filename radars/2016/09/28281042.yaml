    description: "Peter Steinberger13-Sep-2016 06:46 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis is essentially the same bug as rdar://27261367, but for UIDocumentMenuViewController. We didn't notice that during the beta phase because we only recently started using it, and noticed that our PDF Viewer (https://pspdfkit.com/viewer/) app beta started crashing as we removed the hack for the now fixed rdar://27261367.\r\n\r\nWorkaround is acceptable, but other people will trip over the same issue and it might also be an AppCompat problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee rdar://27261367; replace UIActivityViewController with UIDocumentMenuViewController - everything else is the same.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIKit should not leak internal enum states for public properties.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIKit leaks internal enum states for public properties.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
