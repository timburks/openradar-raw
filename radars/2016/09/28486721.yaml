    description: "Summary:\r\nMy bug rdar://20942029 was marked as duplicated of another issue. The issue was once open but has since been closed. When the related issue's status changed, I didn't receive a notification and had no information on why it was closed or the resolution status. \r\n\r\nReceiving a notification of some sort, either in the Bug Reporter or via email be a great addition to the Bug Reporter tool. Even being able to see something like \"fixed in Xcode 8\" would be a lesser solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a bug (#2)\r\n2. Mark it as duplicate of an open bug (#1)\r\n3. Close the original duplicate bug (#1)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome kind of feedback as to the status of the original bug (#1), either via email or in the bug reporter tool.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
