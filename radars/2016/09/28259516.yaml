        Summary:
        In Xcode 8, I’m renaming a class via the “Refactor -> Rename” tool. After providing a new name and continuing, the modal window that lists the changes that will be made only includes the class’ header and implementation. So any files that have references to the original class name are not updated to use the new name.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Rename a class that has been used elsewhere in the codebase via the refactoring tools.

        Expected Results:
        All instances of the class’s old name, and references to the class’ header file within import statements, should be updated to reflect the new name.

        Actual Results:
        Only the class’ files are updated.

        Regression:
        This was working in Xcode 7.1
