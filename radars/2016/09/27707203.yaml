    description: "Area:\r\nNotification Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen registering notification actions (old API) today, one can register using Minimal or Default context. The later happens to be used on Apple Watch as well.\r\n\r\nWe were using Minimal to register notification actions we don't support in our Watch OS 1 app (update planned!). These would show up when one pulled down on a Notification in iOS 9 but not show up on Watch.\r\n\r\niOS 10 doesn't seem to make use of Minimal, which means we now need to register these actions w/ the Default context. This means the action we don't yet support on Watch now appears and is broken.\r\n\r\nCan we have a way to opt out of specific notification actions on Watch?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRegister notification actions for Default context\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRegister notification actions for Default context and specify whether they appear on Watch: They appear on Watch only when specified and on Phone always.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey appear on Watch and Phone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9, 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, Apple Watch"
