    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen converting a project that has @IBActions hooked up to a Storyboard in the form of:\r\n\r\n@IBAction func doSomething(sender: AnyObject?) {}\r\n\r\nThe storyboard references are not updated to the name they apparently would expect now which is doSomethingWithSender\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached project in the folder \"IBAction original\" in Xcode 8 and convert to Swift 3 when prompted.\r\nRun the project, press one of the buttons on the storyboard. The app will crash with unrecognizedSelector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe converter should either: \r\n\r\n* update the storyboards to reference the new names\r\n* better, insert an underscore to ignore the sender: parameter. The names will match\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing is updated, apps crash and all references need to be updated manually.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
