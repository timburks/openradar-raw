        Summary:
        There isn’t an easy way to copy the identifier of an Apple Watch paired to a connected iPhone with Xcode

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Connect to a Mac an iPhone that’s paired with an Apple Watch
        2. Open Xcode -> Window -> Devices, select your iPhone
        3. Look for the watch under “Paired Watches”
        4. Right click OR press Cmd+C

        Expected Results:
        On right click, an option appears to copy the UDID. On Cmd+C, Watch information is copied

        Actual Results:
        Nope

        Regression:
        This regressed since previous versions, when it was only possible to pair a single Watch to an iPhone.
