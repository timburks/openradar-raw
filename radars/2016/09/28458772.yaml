    description: "Summary:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsset/1416316-setbyaddingobject?language=objc doesn't mention that when you call -[NSSet setByAddingObject:] on a toll-free bridged CFSetRef, the returned NSSet isn't a toll-free bridged CFSetRef. As a result, the returned NSSet may have different behavior, and thus may contain fewer objects.\r\n\r\nI demonstrate this behavior in https://gist.github.com/hborders/8aa94a3f2b69b0f0890aecd96cc2f1f1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nView the documentation:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsset/1416316-setbyaddingobject?language=objc\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Toll-FreeBridgin/Toll-FreeBridgin.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010810-CH2\r\n\r\nThis behavior isn't mentioned\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe behavior shown in https://gist.github.com/hborders/8aa94a3f2b69b0f0890aecd96cc2f1f1 should be mentioned somewhere\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe behavior shown in https://gist.github.com/hborders/8aa94a3f2b69b0f0890aecd96cc2f1f1 is not mentioned anywhere"
