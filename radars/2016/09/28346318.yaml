    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need to be notified when the current URL being displayed by an instance of SFSafariViewController has changed, either via user activity or automatically via javascript or HTML redirection.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary so that we can detect when malicious actors are attempting to present spam or porn or other undesirable content to our users and so that we can avoid presenting this content to users in the future.\r\n\r\nWe realize that this request is at odds with the privacy-preserving nature of SFSafariViewController, but as it stands, the limitation causes us to expose our users to danger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPresent a web page via SFSafariViewController. Change to a different web page, either via a web redirect, a javascript redirect, or by tapping a link in the original web page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOur code should receive some notification that the root URL within the page has been changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSFSafariViewController is an opaque black box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall versions of SFSafariViewController"
