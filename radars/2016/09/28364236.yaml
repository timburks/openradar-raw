    description: "Summary:\r\nBuilding with Xcode 8.0, an app loading a Collada file with bones animation will crash on iOS 9. The same app runs fine when built with Xcode 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project with Xcode 8.0\r\n2. Run it on a device with iOS 9\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee a 3D scene of a worm with a crawling animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes with error message: \r\n\"SceneKit: error, Library Deserialization: cannot finalize the deserialization of <C3DSkin 0x14edcc160 joint:3 weight:0 baseGeom:0x0>\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis crash does not occur on devices running iOS 10.0. It also does not occur with iOS 9.3 when built using Xcode 7.3.1 with the same Collada file.\r\n\r\nAlso, when converting the .dae to a .scn file, the app runs without crashing, but presents the console message \"SceneKit: error, Cannot update the joints using node names: can't find node\" and the bones animation doesn't show either.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBuild machine: MacBook Air running OS X 10.11.6, tested on iPhone 4s running iOS 9.3 and iPhone 6s running iOS 9.3"
