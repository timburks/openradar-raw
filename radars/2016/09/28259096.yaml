    description: "Summary:\nI use the page located at iTunes Connect > My Apps > (App) > Activity > All Builds > (Build) to check the configuration for my app. Until recently it displayed the value of the com.apple.developer.default-data-protection entitlement in the build’s provisioning profile. It was useful to check that the build had the correct value before submission, especially as we’ve been bitten a few times by this issue: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/63596#63596. \n\nNow that setting isn’t being displayed, even though I’ve confirmed it set both in the App ID section in Member Centre and in the provisioning file that was used to create the uploaded archive.\n\nThis may be related: in Xcode, the entitlement is also no longer listed when inspecting the summary of the IPA prior to submitting it to the store.\n\nI’ve double checked the archives that I’m creating and the embedded.mobileprovision file definitely has the correct entitlement within it. \n\nWithout either method of validating the submitted value of this entitlement I’ve no way of knowing whether the app I’m distributing to my users has the correct entitlement.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSet up an app with a Data Protection entitlement (e.g. NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication), and upload a build to iTunes Connect.\n\nExpected Results:\nIn iTunes Connect > My Apps > (App) > Activity > All Builds > (Build), somewhere on the page the value for the Data Protection entitlement should be displayed (and it should be NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication).\n\nActual Results:\nThis entitlement is not reported.\n\nRegression:\nThis was definitely displaying a few months ago.\n\nNotes:"
