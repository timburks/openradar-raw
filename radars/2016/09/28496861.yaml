    description: "Area:\r\nControl Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using the flashlight, pointing the light towards different areas (or just the motion of walking while pointing it at the ground to light the way) can trigger Raise To Wake and cause the screen to activate. \r\n\r\nA secure grip on the phone almost invariably means that fingers will be in contact with the screen: this can swipe on notifications or activate widgets and generally cause havoc. \r\n\r\nTurning on the flashlight should disable the Raise To Wake feature to prevent such issues\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Control Center to activate the flashlight, then lock the screen\r\n2. Use the phone as a flashlight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen remains locked\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen randomly wakes up and accepts inadvertent touch input\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 [14A456]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S+\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
