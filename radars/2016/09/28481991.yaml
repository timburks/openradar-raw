    description: "When setting a window tintColor, CNContactViewController applies the tint color selectively only and sometimes only after a cell refresh.\r\n\r\nSee the attached video (taken from the iOS 10.1 beta Simulator) and note the following issues:\r\n\r\n- Only \"Edit\", \"message\", \"work\" and the FaceTime icon are tinted\r\n- The message and work icons are not tinted\r\n- the phone numbers and email are not tinted\r\n- only when causing a cell refresh by scrolling up and down, the phone numbers and email are tinted correctly\r\n\r\nA test on the actual device (iPhone 7 @ 10.1 beta) showed that the FaceTime and Call buttons are not tinted as well."
