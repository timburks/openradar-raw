    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPhotos --> Albums --> People lists \"262 Photos Scanned. To finish scanning your remaining 3152 photos, lock your iPhone and connect it to power\".\r\n\r\nHowever, after locking the phone and connecting it to power overnight for four days, no progress is reported, and the number of photos scanned does not increase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Photos\r\n2. Check the progress in Albums --> People\r\n3. Lock the phone and connect it to power. Leave it overnight.\r\n4. Launch Photos\r\n5. Check the progress in Albums --> People, compare the result to the previous day.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe total number of photos scanned increases every night, and the remaining photos reduces every night.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe total number of photos scanned does not change, and the number of photos remaining does not change, even when the phone is locked and connected to power.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen new photos are added to the library, they are scanned as expected. However, existing photos are still not scanned.\r\n\r\n\"iCloud Photo Library\" is enabled.\r\n\"Optimise iPhone Storage\" is enabled.\r\n\r\nTried multiple power cables, in case it's a faulty cable causing the issues. However, this does not seem to help.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128GB, using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
