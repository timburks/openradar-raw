    description: "iOS 10 is out on 9/23/2016, we tested BLE broadcasting when app is in background, we have a sample app to broadcast the BLE signal and another central role app to scan for the signal from the peripheral role app.\r\n\r\nWe have tested on about 15 devices across iPads, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 7.When the peripheral app ran on these devices, the central app can discover most of them, except one 6s model: A1633. For the model: A1633, after we put the peripheral app to background, the central app cannot discover the peripheral anymore."
