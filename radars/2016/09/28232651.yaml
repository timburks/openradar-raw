    description: "I installed iOS 10 Beta (14A5346a) on an iPhone 6s Plus and the method CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation just does not seem to work as expected when I use UIImagePickerController's live view to adjust itself with respect to the entire main screen. When the same code was built on an iPhone 6s Plus with iOS 9.3.2, the method works and the black bar at the bottom has an expected height as shown in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nSample code: \r\n\r\nobjImagePickerController.cameraViewTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation(0, 64);   \r\n\r\nNote: objImagePickerController is an instance of UIImagePickerController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse UIImagePickerController's live view to fill the entire screen (because aspect ratio of camera preview and main screen are different). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see a change in how the live view tries to adjust itself with respect to the main screen (as shown in the screenshot.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo change is observed regardless what translation parameters are passed to the CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation method, the image remains the same (as shown in the screenshot).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5346a) and iOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus"
