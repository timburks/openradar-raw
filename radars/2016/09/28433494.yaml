    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the Account Detail view of the Music app the \"Done\" navigation bar item doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open music app.\r\n2. Tap on user profile image to access Account view.\r\n3. Tap on profile cell at top of Account view.\r\n4. Tap on \"done\" bar button item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would not expect there to be a done button in that view since it is inside a navigation view controller and the back button pops the view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDone button will remove the first responder and dismiss the keyboard. If the keyboard is already dismissed the button does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, iPad Air 2"
