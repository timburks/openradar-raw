    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever we call abort on a SourceBuffer during a pending operation, subsequent calls to appendBuffer will result in an decode error (error code 3) on the video node.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jer: \"In Safari, we reset the parser state to the NEED_INIT_SEGMENT state.  Weâ€™d need to change our implementation (which would require a platform-level fix) to reset to the NEED_SEGMENT state.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a similar bug report filed in 2014 (In SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::abort(), support reseting parser to the last appended initialization segment.): <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135164>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/dbaulig/6nf3gue0/. Note that the URLs for the segments in the fiddle may expire after a while. So, might need fresh URL to replace.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSegments appended to source buffer correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEncounter decode error (error code 3).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll Safari with MSE support."
