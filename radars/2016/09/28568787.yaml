    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\nBy default, S/MIME lookups are performed against the GAL, instead of locally. Should be swapped, or provide a toggle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\r\n1) Setup S/MIME per https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202345\r\n2) Attempt to send mail within domain to a known contact. iOS Mail defaults to “Unable to encrypt”\r\n3) Tap lock to encrypt using local store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\n\r\nBy default, according to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202345, Mail should locate my local contact’s cert. It does not until tapping the lock icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\r\n\r\nTap lock icon instead of having iOS fallback to local contacts.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nHappens with every email attempted to send.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
