        Summary:
        The attached movie describes it best, the progress tick moves in erratic ways.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open iTunes
        2. Start playing Action Bronson's 'Bon Appetit ... Bitch !!!!!!!'
        3. Start playing Track 9 of 35 "Growing Up"

        Expected Results:
        I'd see the tick progress across the progress bar in a predictable manner.  For example once each 1/12th of a second. Or even better, I'd just see it glide across the screen, accurately showing the position in the track.

        Actual Results:
        The tick starts with a spurt, then stutters, then find its feet again and slowly finds it rhythm, once each second.

        Notes:
