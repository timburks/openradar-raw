    description: "Summary:\nUntil recently the value of the Data Protection entitlement that’s set in my embedded provisioning profile was displayed in the archive summary pane that is displayed prior to submitting an IPA to the App Store in Xcode. This no longer happens as of Xcode 8.\n\nIt was useful to check that the build had the correct value before submission, especially as we’ve been bitten a few times by this issue: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/63596#63596.\n\nThis may be related to rdar://28259096, in which this entitlement value no longer appears in the build summary page within iTunes Connect.\n\nI’ve double checked the archives that I’m creating and the embedded.mobileprovision file definitely has the correct entitlement within it. \n\nWithout either method of validating the submitted value of this entitlement I’ve no way of knowing whether the app I’m distributing to my users has the correct entitlement.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSet up an app with a Data Protection entitlement (e.g. NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication), and create an archive via Xcode. Attempt to export the archive as a signed package for App Store deployment, choose a development team, then inspect the entitlements of the resulting package in the view that subsequently appears.\n\nExpected Results:\nWithin the entitlements should be an entry for Data Protection, and it should match the value in the embedded provisioning profile (NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication in this case).\n\nActual Results:\nNo such entry appears.\n\nRegression:\nI believe this was working the last time I submitted a package using Xcode 7.1.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
