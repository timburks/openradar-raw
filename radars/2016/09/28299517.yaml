        Summary:

        I don't use Apple Music (another discussion), I sync my music using iTunes to my iPhone (another discussion), I have the toggle of "Show Apple Music" in the off position. The Music.app keeps showing Apple Music related functionality.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Turn off the "Show Apple Music Toggle"

        Expected Results:
        My Music.app doesn't show a "Connect" or a "Radio" tab, if I press search I don't see trending searches, just my music.

        Actual Results:
        The only tab that's actually useful (for me) is the library tab. The other 3 are practically useless to me.

        Regression:
        Ever since Apple Music came to live.

        Notes:
        Another fun fact is that with each OS update the toggle seems to find itself in the "On" position.
