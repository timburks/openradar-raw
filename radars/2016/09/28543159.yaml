    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder macOS 10.12, drag and drop image files from Photos 2.0 to any applications using WebViews (including as Safari) is broken.\r\n\r\nThis breaks the drag & drop from Photos to any website allowing image uploads via drag & drop as well as our Mac application GarageSale, which uses WebViews to compose eBay listings with images from Photos.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the webpage: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_ondrag_all in Safari\r\n2. Drag any image from Photos to the right-most rectangle in the right hand pane.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rectangle should get a red highlight. (as with macOS 10.11/Photos 1.5) \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo highlight appears\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12/ Build 16A322\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.12/Photos 2: Bug appears\r\nmacOS 10.11/Photos 1.5: Works as expected"
