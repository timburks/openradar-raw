    description: "Summary:\r\nWith Safari 10, it is now necessary to right-click an item in the reading list to remove it.\r\n\r\nThere used to be the little (X) on hovering, but it was removed with the new swipe-to-delete function. This forces users of non-multitouch pointing devices to resort to right-clicking to delete an item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use non-multitouch pointing device\r\n2. Try to delete item from Reading List\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect an easier way to remove an item from the Reading List in absence of a multi-touch pointing device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am forced to use the context menu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 (11602.1.50.0.10) on OS X 10.11.6"
