    description: "Summary:\r\nInternally, NSURLSession uses __NSCFLocalDownloadTask, which doesn't inherit from NSURLSessionDownloadTask. This seems like bad practice to me anyway, since the API pretends it does (so somewhere along the line there's an object being cast to a type it doesn't conform to)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an extension on URLSessionDownloadTask, adding e.g. a method to calculate the current progress of the download task\r\n2. In one of the URLSessionDownloadDelegate methods, call this method on the incoming downloadTask argument\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the compiler should warn about extending URLSession*Task or the __NSCF implementations should respect the structure of the public interfaces\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn exception is thrown:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFLocalDownloadTask progress]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fd571ddb820'"
