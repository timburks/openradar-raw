        Summary:
        i tried installing two different call blocking apps from the app store (a free one and then a $4 one), but was unable to activate either from Settings our ing my initial attempts. Eventually it activated. I literally did nothing other than lock my phone, unlock it, go back to Phone preferences from the Call Blocking section, and try again.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install a call blocking app (CallBlock or WhoCalls)
        2. Launch the app and perform any initial setup
        3. Go to Settings > Phone > Call Blocking & Identification
        4. Tap on the toggle for the app

        Expected Results:
        Toggle turns green, app reports it has permission

        Actual Results:
        The toggle refused to turn green after multiple attempts and a restart, though it finally did work on a later attempt
