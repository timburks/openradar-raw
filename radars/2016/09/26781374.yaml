    description: "Summary:\r\nMany developers who rely on vim also relied on an undocumented Xcode plugins feature. This allowed us to use a fairly popular plugin, XVim (https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim/) that provided vim-like keybindigs for Xcode.\r\n\r\nSince Xcode 8, this is no longer possible â€” SIP disallows injecting your own key mapping and the extension API isn't powerful enough to enable plugins similar to this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 8\r\n2. Try to use Xvim\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can use vim-like bindings and be more productive (or at least think you are).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou're sad because you can't use vim-like bindings.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
