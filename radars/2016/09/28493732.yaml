        Summary:

        When opening an app from a notification (and the app is already running in background), application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo:fetchCompletionHandler: will not be called.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo:fetchCompletionHandler:` method to your UIAppDelegate
        2. Open the app, then close it (let it run in background)
        3. Have a push notification appear
        4. Tap the notification to open the app with it

        Expected Results:
        - `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo:fetchCompletionHandler:` will be called with the notification info.

        Actual Results:
        - Nothing happens

        Regression:
        - This is a regression from iOS 9
        - `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo:fetchCompletionHandler` is called just fine for background pushes, just not when app is opened from a notification
        - UNUserNotification API for this seems to work

        Notes:

        Workaround is to *also* implement `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo:` method. Then this one will be called when opening app from a notification, and the variant with the fetch completion handler will be called for background pushes.
