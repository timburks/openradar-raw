        Summary:
        In nearly every preceding version of Mail.app there was a menu item and corresponding shortcut keystroke for marking or un-marking messages as junk.  Allowing the built-in iCloud/Mail.app spam filtering to automatically move messages into the Junk folder is not an option as there are far too many false positives in my case.  So my (and I assume many others') only option is to manually mark or unmark messages in my inbox, hoping to train the spam filter enough that I can trust it.  The big problem is that the only way to mark messages as not-junk is to open the message and click the "Not Junk" button.  There's no more shortcut, and the message must be opened before it can be un-marked as spam.  It makes the whole process about 10x slower than just using the keystroke while skimming through a message list.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) View message list
        2) Notice that some valid messages are marked as spam
        3) Notice that there is no way to mark as not-junk from the message list (I have the message viewer hidden), only a way to move them to the junk folder
        4) Open the message, and notice that there is still no menu item or keyboard shortcut to mark the message as not-junk
        5) Drag the mouse all the way over to the "Not Junk" button and click it
        6) Take a nap to recover from the exhaustion of step 5

        Expected Results:
        I expected to select (single click, not needing to open) the message in the inbox and hit ⌘⇧J to mark the message as not-junk.

        Actual Results:
        Selecting a message and pressing ⌘⇧J now actually moves the message into the Junk folder, which is the *opposite* of what it used to do for messages that were marked as junk in previous versions of Mail.app.  Just a bit frustrating.

        Regression:
        The problem didn't occur prior to Mail.app 10.0
