        There should be a public API for developer.apple.com. Managing things like devices and provisioning profiles by hand from the website is cumbersome, especially for larger teams and complex projects.

        Such an API already exists — developer.apple.com itself uses it, and Xcode seems to use parts of it — but it isn’t publicly documented and changes often.

        Simply releasing a documentation to it and committing to keeping the API stable would make a lot of developers’ lives much better.
