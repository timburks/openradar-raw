    description: "Tried to use Siri on a computer that does not have a microphone attached - I was expecting Siri to allow entering questions by keyboard (in addition to being able to ask them by speaking).\r\nWhile I understand that the primary focus is to bring smart speech recognition to the Mac, usually, there is a keyboard attached to a desktop computer, which is also a way to quickly enter text.\r\n\r\nI could imagine that this might be more useful than speaking in e.g. a larger office with many people in the same room, or in environments where there's quite a bit of noise, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease consider allowing to enter questions for Siri using the keyboard on macOS."
