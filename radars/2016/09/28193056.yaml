    description: "The HKUnit class should include a class function \"ratio()\" to return a unit suitable for recording measurements where the value is a unitless ratio that may be greater or less than one.  The documentation for \"percent()\" implies that the value may range only between 0 and 1, but this would not be appropriate for (e.g.) INR measurements, where a therapeutic range might be 1.9–3.1 but a normal range is 0.8–1.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExamine the HealthKit SDK docs for a \"ratio\" unit type.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHKUnit should contain a \"ratio\" unit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHKUnit does not contain a \"ratio\" unit."
