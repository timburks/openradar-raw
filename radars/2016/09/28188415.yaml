    description: "Area:\r\nNotification Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe would like the ability to detect notification dismissal (banner, notification center, or the new expanded view iOS 10). Ideally, this action would start the application and pass the notification payload to a delegate method so the application in the background so it can process dismissal. Perhaps this could be a custom notification action one can register for.\r\n\r\nDismiss is a negative signal that can be used to decrease the number notifications sent to a given user. This prevents fatigue and ensures individuals only receive notifications they value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Register for custom notification actions\r\n2. Send a notification to your device w/ the correct \"category\" set in the APNS payload\r\n3. Dismiss the notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe host application or relevant extension is started and a delegate method is called w/ the notification payload an an action representing \"dismiss\" or similar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe host application or extension that handles custom notification actions is not started\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device"
