    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT, or initial ticket) in Ticket Viewer, if no KDCs for the Keberos realm are contactable, Ticket Viewer will show an error dialog saying \"Incorrect Password\". That message is extremely misleading for the user, as the actual error has nothing to do with the (in)correctness of their password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a Kerberos identity to Ticket Viewer.\r\n2. Make sure all KDCs for the realm for the given identity are not reachable, for example by disconnecting the Mac from the internet.\r\n3. Delete any cached Kerberos ticket for the identity, then try to obtain a TGT by clicking on the refresh button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf no KDCs are reachable, I'd expect an error message to appear informing the user of that problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error dialog appears with the text \"Incorrect Password\".\r\n\r\nIn Console, the real error is logged:\r\n\r\n17/07/2014 15:54:31.899 Ticket Viewer[437]: set-error: -1765328228: unable to reach any KDC in realm EXAMPLE.ORG, tried 2 KDCs\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9.4/13E28"
