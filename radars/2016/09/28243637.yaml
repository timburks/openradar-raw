    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen attempting to present an SFSafariViewController from an extension, the controller is presented, but the URL bar is blank, the navigation bar is misplaced and mis-sized, and the URL is not loaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using the attached project, run the App target (SafariViewControllerInExtension).\r\n2. Switch to Safari and open a web page.\r\n3. Tap the \"Share\" button, scroll the bottom pane to the right, choose \"More\", and enable the \"Direct Open\", \"Open with Alert\", \"Open with Action Sheet\" extensions.\r\n4. Tap the \"Direct Open\" or \"Open with Action Sheet\" extensions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari View Controller should load the web page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Safari View Controller is shown, but the URL bar is blank, the navigation bar is misplaced and mis-sized, and the URL is not loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 GM seed\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn additional extension, \"Open with Alert\", is included in the project to demonstrate the workaround I have found to enable Safari View Controller to work on iOS 10. This is obviously not ideal long-term workaround, as it requires my end users to perform an additional tap on every URL they want to open via my app's extension.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, iPad Pro, iOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SafariViewControllerInExtension.zip' was successfully uploaded."
