    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running the nscurl command in any capacity, if an error occurs, nscurl returns an exit status code of 0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch a Terminal window.\r\n2. Run the command: nscurl —ats-diagnostics example.org\r\n3. Run the command: echo $?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause the URL passed to nscurl was invalid (didn’t have http://), and nscurl reports an error to the user, nscurl should exit with a non-zero status code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnscurl threw an error, and exited with a status code of 0.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested on OS X 10.11.6 with Terminal version 2.6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is standard for bash commands to use exit codes to report whether they were able to run successfully or not. This is especially important for scripting so that a parent script can check the exit code of an executed command, and return meaningful feedback to the user in response. For nscurl I would expect any non-successful execution to return a non-zero status, even if it’s always 1.\r\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html"
