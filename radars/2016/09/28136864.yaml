    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a TestFlight build the prices for IAP products are incorrect. The correct prices will show up when the app is downloaded via the App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn iTunesConnect, set up products with these prices:\r\nXXX.monthly @ US $4.99\r\nXXX.yearly @ US $39.99\r\n\r\nRequest the products via SKProductsRequest on a TestFlight build or local build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXXX.monthly @ US $4.99\r\nXXX.yearly @ US $39.99\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXXX.monthly @ US $2.49\r\nXXX.yearly @ US $19.99\r\n\r\nIt seems the prices are half of what they should be.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has worked correctly in the past. First noticed Sept. 1, 2016.\r\nThe incorrect values are read directly from the SKProduct instances; it is not a UI issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, 6 Plus, more\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
