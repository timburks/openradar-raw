    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nGiven an application which is not localized for arabic language including a UITextField with NSTextAlignmentNatural:\r\nSystem language is set to arabic, currently selected keyboard is arabic.\r\nTapping into the UITextField displays the arabic keyboard but the cursor is aligned to left to UITextField as it would be normal for a keyboard with language writing direction Left-To-Right. Instead it should be aligned to right of UITextField because arabic keyboard is Right-To-Left.\r\n\r\nIf the current keyboard is english and you switch to the arabic keyboard after the keyboard was opened the cursor alignment switches from left of UITextField to right of UITextField as expected!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable arabic keyboard in addition to some keyboard with left to right writing direction (i.e. english) in iOS system settings\r\n2. Use 'UIKit Catalog' demo app and adapt UITextField with natural alignment in storyboard\r\n3. Run UIKit Catalog and go to TextFields section\r\n4. Tap into textfield\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nArabic keyboard opens and cursor is aligned to right of textfield\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\narabic keyboard opens but cursor is left-aligned. Only switching to other keyboard and back to arabic keyboard triggers the right align.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
