    description: "Summary:\r\nPreview crashes if you type the Command-K (Crop), Command-S (Save), Command-Shift-W (Close Selected Image) quickly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf you have multiple images open in a Preview window, and select a rectangular selection, and then run this AppleScript in Script Editor, switch back to Preview, Preview will crash when the Crop, Save, Close Tab happens in quick succession.\r\n\r\nI could not duplicate it typing the keystrokes manually, but typing the Command-Shift-W quickly is tricky.  If the command key were changed in the System Preferences, it might be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 16A320\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is very easy to duplicate.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Sierra GM\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Crash Preview.scpt' and 'Preview Crashlog.txt' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\ntell application \"System Events\"\r\n\tdelay 5\r\n\tkey code 40 using command down\r\n\tkey code 1 using command down\r\n\tkey code 13 using {command down, shift down}\r\nend tell"
