    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you add a couple of UILabel instances into a vertically oriented UIStackView IB calculates the wrong value for the height of it - which in turns leads to warnings that cannot be cleared and more importantly makes it impossible to properly layout the rest of the scene.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Uncompress that attached file\r\n2. Open the \"Main.storyboard\"\r\n3. Observe the warnings and improper layout of the UIStackView instances in both scenes (UIViewController, UITableViewController)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the layout to be calculated correctly on the screen, so I can continue the layout of the rest of my scene.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccording to the warning messages the UIStackView wants to have a huge height >400 even though there are are two small UILabel instances contained within the UIStackView instances.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1\r\nXcode 8 Beta 6"
