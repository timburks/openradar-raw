    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 9 and 10, app can execute in background (once user background the app) for more than 3 minutes. In some cases, it can be 15 minutes. This can cause excessive battery usage for certain app.\r\n\r\nWhile it is app's responsibility to control its background time, iOS should be more proactive in killing app that exec in background after 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) create a background task ID once the app goes in background, in expiration handler I can check how long this task ID has been running using the timestamp difference.\r\n2) log the timestamp difference to a server\r\n3) find in some cases, background exec is in 300-400 sec range. In one of the more extreme scenario (iPhone 6/iOS 9.3.5), I am seeing 1000 sec of background exec time."
