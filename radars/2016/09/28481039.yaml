    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 10, if you set a `PKPaymentRequest`'s `requiredShippingAddressFields` to anything containing `PKAddressFieldName`, and include a name in the request's `shippingContact`, the Apple Pay sheet doesn't appear. Instead, I see this in the console:\r\n\r\n> Failed to present in-app payment interface: <private>\r\n> Connection to remote alert view service failed\r\n\r\nOn iOS 9, the Apple Pay sheet does appear, but the contact's name won't be filled in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached example app on an iOS 10 simulator.\r\n2. Tap Buy -> the Apple Pay sheet doesn't appear\r\n3. Uncomment Line 39, setting `requiredShippingAddressFields` to `PKAddressFieldEmail`\r\n4. Tap Buy -> the Apple Pay sheet does appear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Apple Pay sheet should appear, and the contact's name should be populated with the information in the `PKPaymentRequest`'s `shippingContact`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 10, no Apple Pay sheet appears. On iOS 9, the Apple Pay sheet does appear, but the contact name isn't filled in.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 10 simulator, iOS 9.3 simulator, iPhone 6s running iOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'apple-pay-shipping.zip' was successfully uploaded."
