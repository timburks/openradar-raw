        Summary:
        When creating a new file, autocomplete will break for the whole project. I'm not sure if creating a new file is the proper trigger, but it seems fairly consistent. There's a whole thread about how autocomplete has been broken since Xcode 7.3 on StackOverflow:

        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36242732/xcode-7-3-autocomplete-issues/36530564#36530564

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new Cocoa Touch class or unit test case for iOS in Xcode 8.
        2. Autocomplete breaks

        Expected Results:
        Autocomplete should never break. It should work whenever you type code.

        Actual Results:
        Autocomplete breaks.
