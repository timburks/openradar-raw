    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe user interface freezes and no interaction is possible after the device rotates when one of its sublayer have a speed of 0.\r\n\r\nIn the provided example (in Swift 3), I have a squared view aligned in the middle of the main view using auto-layout constraints. This squared view has its layer speed property sets to 0.\r\n\r\nWhen I rotate the device (or the simulator), this squared view should go to center of its superview but it freezes. In Swift 2.2 it worked fine but now it fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Example/Petal.xcodeproj\r\n2. Runs the Petal target on an iOS simulator or an iOS device\r\n3. Rotate the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe views should layout correctly and the user interactions should be enable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe views are not layout, the interface is frozen and no user interaction is possible \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403) and iOS simulators (iOS 8.4 and over)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample project here: https://github.com/yannickl/Petal/tree/swift3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 WiFi, iPad Mini 2, iOS simulators"
