    description: "Since Xcode8 the functionality provided by this plugin (https://github.com/stefanceriu/SCXcodeEditorInset) is missing.\r\n\r\nThe feature provided is really simple. It adds a configurable empty space at the bottom of the source files so the last line of code is not at the bottom of the screen."
