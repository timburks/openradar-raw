    description: "Summary:\r\nThe autocompletion for Obj-C categories used in Swift code does not appear to work for certain classes, NSString being one of them. The code will compile correctly but beginning to type a category method on an NSString in Swift will now autocomplete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a category on NSString in Objective-C\r\n2. Add a Swift class that uses this category in its bridging header\r\n3. Start typing the function name provided in the category.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see autocompleted method names appear for the category method in Swift.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo autocompleted method names appear, but completing them manually will work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 Version 8.0 (8A218a) OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCuriously, when I tested the same methods but created a category on NSObject, the autocomplete did appear for those category methods. This appears to affect categories on NSString, and perhaps others.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
