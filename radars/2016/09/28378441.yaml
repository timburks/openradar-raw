        Summary:
        When viewing a software update in the Apple Watch app, the bottom scroll insets are wrong.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install iOS 10.0.1 on an iPhone.
        2. Open the Apple Watch app in order to update your Apple Watch to watchOS 3.
        3. Tap General → Software Update.
        4. Wait for the update info to load.
        5. Attempt to read the release notes.

        Expected Results:
        The scroll insets of the resulting scroll view are reasonable, so that you can scroll to the bottom of the scroll view and leave it there without it bouncing back.

        Actual Results:
        The bottom of the scroll view looks to be inset, I’d guess by 44 points. If you scroll down to read the bottom text, the scroll view bounces back, so that the last two and a half lines are cut off.

        Regression:
        I don’t remember seeing this for any watchOS updates installed via iOS versions previous to 10.0.1 (I was not running the iOS 10 betas).
