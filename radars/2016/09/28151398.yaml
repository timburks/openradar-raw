        On OS X 10.10.x and later, it's possible to enable automatic installation of OS X or macOS updates. After doing some research, it looks like the this function can be enabled by running the following command with root privileges:

        /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce AutoUpdateRestartRequired -bool TRUE

        However, it does not appear that I can manage this with a profile.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install profile
        2. Check AutoUpdateRestartRequired value in /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.commerce.plist

        Expected Results:

        /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.commerce AutoUpdateRestartRequired is set to True
        The "Install OS X updates" checkbox is checked in System Preferences: App Store

        Actual Results:

        /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.commerce AutoUpdateRestartRequired is set to True
        The "Install OS X updates" checkbox is not checked in System Preferences: App Store

        Regression:

        Running the defaults command listed above sets the following value:

        /Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce.plist AutoUpdateRestartRequired is set to True
        The "Install OS X updates" checkbox is checked in System Preferences: App Store

        Notes:

        I've uploaded a sample management profile in the attached enable_automatic_os_x_updates.zip
