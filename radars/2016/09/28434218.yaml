        Summary:
        The label for the message property set on a ABUnknownViewController is displayed in multiline mode only the first time after app launch. However, when scrolling the content upwards, the label is compressed and truncated to only one line.

        The next time, the view controller is pushed, the label is always displayed in a single, line in truncated form.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Run the attached sample project
        - Tap the "New Contact (legacy)" button. Note that the message label is displayed (correctly) in 3 lines.
        - Pop
        - Tap the "New Contact (legacy)" button again.

        Expected Results:
        The label is displayed in 3 lines

        Actual Results:
        The label is displayed in truncated form in only one line.

        Notes:
        As a workaround, we can specify a short message string that is never truncated.
