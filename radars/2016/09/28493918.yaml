        Summary:

        After upgrading from my original Watch to new Series 1 Watch, contacts didn’t get synced until reboot

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a fully working Watch. Make a backup of it.
        2. Restore backup to a new Watch
        3. Get a text from someone you know
        -> Notification says their phone number and not name
        4. Try to tell Siri “Text <Johny> blah blah blah”
        -> Siri says it doesn’t know who “Johny” is

        This still happened a day after upgrading.

        (Due to another issue, the heart rate sensor got stuck in the on position until my watch died — forcing a reboot, after which the issue resolved itself)
