    description: "Scheduling too many local notifications causes both iPads and iPhones to reboot on iOS 10.0.1.\r\n\r\nWith the production version of the app the number of notifications scheduled and the device still crashing is 60.  Which is less than the max number of scheduled local notifications.  This tends to differ from device to device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the LocalNotificationBug app.\r\n2. Run on a device and press schedule notifications\r\n3. Wait for a few minutes the device will crash (iPhone 6 16gb was the device that I used to test)\r\n4. If the device still doesn't crash change the number of notifications to schedule from 1000 - 10000\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device will reboot"
