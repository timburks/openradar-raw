        Summary:
        When performing a Force Touch on the notification list in watchOS 3 to bring up the option to clear all of the notifications, the haptic feedback is delayed to the point that my finger has been lifted off of the screen and ready to tap the button to clear all notifications before the haptic feedback fires.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) On an Apple Watch watch face, swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal notifications. (Make sure there are notifications to view)
        2) Force Touch the screen to bring up the Clear All Notifications button.
        3) Notice that the haptic feedback is significantly delayed.

        Expected Results:
        The haptic feedback should be delivered in a timely enough fashion to be associated with the Force Touch action as was the case in previous watchOS versions.

        Actual Results:
        The haptic feedback is significantly delayed such that it is no longer reasonably associated with the Force Touch.

        Regression:
        This behavior is new to watch OS 3.

        Notes:
        This bug is observed on an original Apple Watch Sport hardware device.
