    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I toggle \"allowsSelection\" in a UICollectionView object, it sets that object's \"allowsMultipleSelection\", overwriting the original value. That should not happen. This issue is easily fixed by reseting \"allowsMultipleSelection\" after setting \"allowsSelection\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Set a UICollectionView \"allowsMultipleSelection\" to true\r\n2 - Set that UICollectionView \"allowsSelection\" to false (\"allowsMultipleSelection\" will be set to false)\r\n3 - Set that UICollectionView \"allowsSelection\" to true (\"allowsMultipleSelection\" will remain false)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"allowsMultipleSelection\" shouldn't be change disregard of \"allowsSelection\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"allowsMultipleSelection\" is set to false\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 running on iOS 10 simulators\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached an example project that reproduces the error\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina Late-13\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Foo.zip' was successfully uploaded."
