    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using `INSendMessageIntent`, during `resolveRecipients` step, providing multiple `INPerson` for INPersonResolutionResult.disambiguation, has the Siri perform the disambiguation step, BUT after user selects a single user, Siri keeps looping, and keeps asking the user \"To whom should I send your message to?\" It doesn't stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement INSendMessageIntent\r\n2. During `resolveRecipents` step, return multiple people for disambiguation step: completion([INPersonResolutionResult.disambiguation(with: [INPerson])]) \r\n3. Open Siri\r\n4. Ask Siri to send a message to \"Bob\"\r\n5. Siri should present multiple different Bobs: \"Bob Beck,\" \"Bob Good,\" \"Bob Root.\"\r\n6. Pick \"Bob Good.\"\r\n7. Siri will populate the message UI as sending the message to \"Bob Good\", but then it will keep asking \"To whom should I send your message to?\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter I select a user during the disambiguation step, I should be able to send the message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter I select a user during the disambiguation step, Siri keeps asking to \"whom should I send your message\" and doesn't confirm the selection I made. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see this problem in a lot of popular current apps.\r\nFor example, LinkedIn and WhatsApp.\r\nNeither of those apps ever disambiguate from multiple contacts. Presumingly because they encountered this bug.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the disambiguation step is asynchronous: we make a network call to the API, and then we return results. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, AT&T"
