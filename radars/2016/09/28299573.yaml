        Summary:
        While it's pretty, the album overview (with the covers) is not:

        - easy to read
        - easy to predict
        - easy to use with voice over

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Music.app, tap Albums.

        Expected Results:
        To see a UITableView (maybe it's nice looking) that shows me at least 8 albums on a single screen, is easy to read and is easy to work even when voice over is on.

        Actual Results:
        It's a collection view which means that I constantly need to check two places on a single row, I can scroll and try to search for pictures but not all my albums have cover art and the scroll and pay attention flow is a lot harder then just paying attention to the letter.

        If you use voice over, you'll need to figure out that there are now multiple places that an album can exist, this is no problem if you let the whole page read, but if you want to use your fingers (because that's faster) to swipe over the albums, it's become a lot harder.
