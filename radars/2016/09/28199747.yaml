    description: "Summary:\r\nBeginning with the iOS 10 SDK IBInspectable properties set from interface builder are set before the view has been laid out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an extension on UIView\r\n2. In it create an IBInspectable that references `self.bounds` in the setter\r\n3. Set a breakpoint in the setter\r\n4. Create a view in the app that sets this inspectable property\r\n5. Give the view constraints for size and position\r\n6. Run the app\r\n7. When it hits the breakpoint, run `po self.bounds`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view should have been laid out already, so self.bounds should reflect the constrained size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view's bounds are 1000 by 1000\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the sample project for an example. Note the logs."
