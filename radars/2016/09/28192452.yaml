    description: "Area:\r\nNotification Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNotification center shows \"empty cells\" (could just be incorrect content size) after a great number of notifications are received in a very short amount of time. I recently saw behavior very similar to this when using NSFetchedResultsController. I think it's a bug in NSFetchedResultsController but I obviously can't be sure that's how you've implemented Notification Center.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this is an issue in NSFetchedResultsController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on iPhone\r\n2. Receive a great many independent push notifications at once (NC was not on screen at the time)\r\n3. Scroll below the visible cells to see a bunch of \"empty\" cells.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCorrect content size\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLots of empty space, as shown in the video I provided\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 beta 8\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0005.MOV' was successfully uploaded."
