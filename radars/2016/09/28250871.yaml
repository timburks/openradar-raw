    description: "Peter Steinberger11-Sep-2016 09:48 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen we create a PDF via CoreGraphics, sometimes it emits following log:\r\n\r\n<Error>: replacing +/-infinity with 2147483647\r\nor\r\n<Error>: replacing +/-infinity with -2147483648.\r\n\r\nThis log is confusing - it took me forever to figure out where it comes from, and in the end Greg Parker helped me figure this out:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/steipete/status/764446752472698880\r\nhttps://twitter.com/gparker/status/764543800496627712\r\nhttps://twitter.com/gparker/status/764543990892867584\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt's a bit tricky to provide a sample app but doing a full-text search over CoreGraphics will quickly reveal this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe log should either be silenced; or at least provide a way to set a breakpoint and write from where it comes from - this will confused many people and without any context chance that anybody figures out what to actually fix will be slim.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConfusing Log\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression; first appeared in iOS 10 betas and is still in the GM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus"
