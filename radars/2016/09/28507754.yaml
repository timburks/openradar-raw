    description: "In my project I have a UIViewController with an embedded UITableView that's also incorporating a UISearchController. When a user performs a partial swipe from the left edge (the gesture which pops to the previous view), but then cancels it, UI issues begin to crop up. \r\n\r\nIn my case, the exact sequence is that the search bar embedded in the table header view gets pushed down at first, and then subsequent cancellations of that gesture cause a black bar to appear below the table, rendering the search bar unusable.\r\n\r\nAlso of note is the fact that a private SDK class, UIViewControllerWrapperView appears to nest the entire tableview further and further with every one of these partially completed swipe actions. You can see this in the screenshots above."
