    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's currently no way of knowing why a song stopped playing. It's important to handle the UI appropriately if a song stops playing because it reached the end of the song compared to if the user was streaming and lost network connection.\r\n\r\nAVPlayer handles the above scenarios by having error handling as well as the AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotification notification. A similar notification would be a huge improvement. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm saving the current playback position and when the playbackState changes to stopped, I compare the song's duration with the last know position. If it's within a threshold, I assume it reached the end. This is not a very robust workaround.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. [[MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer] setQueueForStoreIDs:trackId];\r\n2. Let the song play to the end\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI confidently know that the song played to the end\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI only know that no song is playing anymore\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1, Xcode 8.0, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Project Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
