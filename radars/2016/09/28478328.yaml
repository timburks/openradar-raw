    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 10 and watchOS 3, notifications often are sent to the wrong device.  The way it worked in iOS 9 and watchOS 1 and 2 is that notifications would display on Apple Watch if it was unlocked and iPhone was locked.  Notifications would display on iPhone if it was unlocked or if Apple Watch was locked.  Sometimes it works this way with iOS 10 and watchOS 3, but many times it does not.  I will get notifications on my Apple Watch for an iMessage while I am actively using my iPhone.  I will also many times get notifications on my iPhone while it is locked and the screen is off instead of on my Apple Watch which is on my wrist and unlocked.  And finally, sometimes I will get a the notification displayed on both Apple Watch and iPhone a few seconds apart.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) With an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone, start an interactive conversation with a user on iMessage.\r\n2) During the iMessage conversation, switch to using other apps on the iPhone, then lock the iPhone with the sleep/wake button and set it down.  Reply to some iMessages on the Apple Watch.  Resume the conversation on the iPhone.\r\n3) In this scenario, I often get the behavior I describe with notifications appearing on both devices or going to the wrong device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the notifications to go to Apple Watch if the iPhone is locked unless the Apple Watch is lock or the iPhone is unlocked.  This worked perfectly in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome notifications will go to Apple Watch while actively using iPhone.  Some notifications will go to iPhone when it was locked causing the screen to light up and sound to play unnecessarily.  Some notification will go to both devices.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 9 with watchOS 1 and 2 worked perfectly with notification delivery.  iOS 10 and watchOS 3 does not function correctly a lot of the time."
