    description: "Summary:\r\nOn WatchOS 2, Now Playing would allow control for playing, pausing and skipping music from 3rd party music apps playing on the phone. One WatchOS 3, the volume control still works, yet the play button starts the native Music app playing and the skip and back buttons are disabled while a 3rd party app is playing music on the phone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start playing music on a 3rd party music app (like Spotify) on the phone\r\n2. Navigate to the Music watch app and tap on Now Playing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to see controls for skip, back and the currently playing song in the 3rd party app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee no current artist or current track, back and skip buttons are disabled. Volume control does work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
