    description: "Currently in order to invoke an intent in the App via Siri, the user has to explicitly mention the Bundle Display Name. This works fine as expected. \r\n\r\nComplications arise when terms used within the App becomes synonymous with App, and/or the App name itself is generally shortened or modified in colloquial use. So even though to an end user, it might seem they have summoned the correct intent for the correct App, Siri disagrees.\r\n\r\nThis situation can become somewhat aggravated if the App name is not a general used term or the pronunciation is complicated. For example, most of the times the Beta application is suffixed with the \"QA\" word. Siri doesn't quite get this name right most of the times.\r\n\r\nAs such there should be a provision to recognise the intended app the intents are fired for apart from just relying on the Bundle Display Name."
