    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an undocumented limitation for one attachment per message for Messages Extensions. \r\nIt may work good for many apps, but in some cases, this limitation leads to worse user experience.\r\nIn our app user have a possibility to scan a document containing few pages and then attach it using PDF or JPEG format. \r\n\r\nWhen JPG format is selected the only way we can provide that functionality is attach one page, ask the user to send it manually (as there is no programmatic way to send a message due to security reasons) and then repeat that for each page.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this functionality is already implemented and flawlessly work for Photos app Messages Extension, where it is possible to add few attachments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add attachment (for example 1st page)\r\n2) Add other attachment (for example 2nd page)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth attachments visible in message compose control and would be sent after user's action.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSecond attachment replaces 1st, which is discarded and can't be accessible anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1 (14A403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease find sample project attached.\r\nAfter two or more consequent presses on \"Attach sample.txt\" button only one attachment will be sent.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS Device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MessagesAttachmentNameSample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
