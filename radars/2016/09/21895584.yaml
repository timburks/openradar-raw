    description: "Opening a new tab (for instance, by cmd-clicking a link) from a tab currently on the left side of the tab bar shifts the tabs left as if to expose a new tab to the right side of the bar, even if the new tab is created at the left side.\r\nIronically, this makes it significantly more difficult to access the new tab, since it's often squeezed between the shifted full-size tabs and the always-full-size focused one."
