    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the UIImagePickerController is presented using the source UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera and allowsEditing = true (YES) the crop square is presented but when the user pans the image it will \"snap\" back to the centre when they let go of the image. This changes slightly when zooming into the image but it still snaps to within a boundary that is a lot smaller than the image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIImagePickerController, set its sourceType to UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera and its allowsEditing to YES.\r\n2. Present it and take a photo in portrait orientation.\r\n3. In the next view (\"Move and Scale\"), try to move the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image can be moved to choose what part to fit inside the square area.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image can't be moved, and bounces back.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];\r\npicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;\r\npicker.allowsEditing = YES;\r\n[viewController presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n\r\nThis is the same bug as was reported here... http://openradar.appspot.com/12318774\r\n\r\nAnd on StackOverflow here... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12630155/uiimagepicker-allowsediting-stuck-in-center\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell it was introduced in iOS 6 and never fixed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5, 6, 6S, 6+, 6S+\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PhotoPickerUsingUIImagePickerControllertoSelectPicturesandTakePhotos.zip' was successfully uploaded."
