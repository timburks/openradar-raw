    description: "MKMapView layouts with a 1,000 x 1,000 sized frame when placed into a \"small\" superview.\r\n\r\nNote how a UIView with the same superview and same constraints does NOT exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a view controller with small simulated size (e.g. 320 x 400).\r\n2. Add a Map View to the view controller and constraint it to the edges:\r\n- leading = superview.leading\r\n- trailing = superview.trailing\r\n- top = topLayoutGuide.bottom\r\n- bottom = bottomLayoutGuide.top\r\n3. Save storyboard and close project (!).\r\n4. Reopen project (and if needed, reopen storyboard)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMap View in IB with size 320 x 400 and no misplaced state or constraints ambiguity.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMap View in IB with size 1000 x 1000, misplaced state and constraints ambiguity."
