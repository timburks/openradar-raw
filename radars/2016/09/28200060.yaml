This string is a link; click it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user is taken to the page for SE-0130 <https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/545e7bea606f87a7ff4decf656954b0219e037d3/proposals/0130-string-initializers-cleanup.md>.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is instead taken to the page for SE-0101 <https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/545e7bea606f87a7ff4decf656954b0219e037d3/proposals/0101-standardizing-sizeof-naming.md>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEngineering has provided the following information regarding this issue:\r\n\r\nThis issue has been addressed.
