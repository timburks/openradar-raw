    description: "When using the Bug Reporter web UI to create a new problem, the text fields' placeholders stay visible after the user starts typing in them, and overlap with the user's input. They stay up until the user presses Return, Inspects the text field, or possibly takes a few other actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems to still be happening. It looks like the problem is due to the \"keypress\" event being used to detect when to hide the overlay, but the event either not firing properly or being captured earlier for most keys. The code in question:\r\n```\r\n    $(\"#probUpdateBox\").live('keypress', function() {\r\n        $(\"#label\" + $(\"#probUpdateBox\").attr('id')).addClass('showFalse');\r\n    })\r\n```\r\nBinding the same listener to the \"input\" event fixes the issue for me:\r\n```\r\n    $(\"#probUpdateBox\").live('input', function() {\r\n        $(\"#label\" + $(\"#probUpdateBox\").attr('id')).addClass('showFalse');\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis still happens for me on Yosemite GM Candidate 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that we cannot reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease update your bug report to let us know if this is still an issue for you, and provide any additional information.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill seeing this happen in Safari Version 8.0.2 (10600.3.5) with extensions disabled on OS X 10.10.2 (14C68m); not sure if there's any additional information I can provide.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nWe are unable to reproduce. Are you trying to input in text fields using mac dictation and not through keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I'm entering text normally with my MacBook Pro's built-in keyboard. The issue does also reproduce when using dictation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still see this issue here on Safari Version 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.8) on OS X Sierra beta.\r\n\r\nThe placeholder text vanishes if I use any cmd-shortcut, even e.g. cmd-C with no text selected."
