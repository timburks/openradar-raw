    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a tabbed tvOS app. The last tab is a search tab. If I launch the app and go to that search tab, the search bar keyboard is visible. If I navigate to another tab, edit a text field and go back to the search tab, the search keyboard is missing. \r\n\r\nI've tried things like called `becomeFirstResponder()` on the search bar and setting `active` to true on the UISearchController. Both have failed. When I investigate these values without attempting to edit them, they are both what I expect them to be. However, the keyboard is missing. \r\n\r\nI've also noticed this in Apple's own UIKit Catalog (tvOS) project (Version 1.5, 2016-09-13). The steps to reproduce below will be from that project so I don't need to create my own project and upload it here.  \r\n\r\nOn a separate note, the search tab crashes for me on anything other than tvOS 10. Which is a shame.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch UIKitCatalog (tvOS): \r\n2. Navigate to the search tab\r\n3. Notice that the search bar keyboard is present and accounted for. \r\n4. Navigate to the Text Entry tab\r\n5. Select UITextField from the left\r\n6. Select Regular text field placeholder on the right\r\n7. Enter text and press Next.\r\n8. Enter text (on Email Address screen) and press Next\r\n9. Enter number(s) (on Number Pad screen) and press Next\r\n10. Enter number(s) (on Numbers and Punctation <- misspelled screen) and press Done\r\n11. Navigate back to the search screen. \r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search bar keyboard should be visible and accessible. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search bar keyboard is missing and not accessible. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9 and tvOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround for me is to remove the search tab and rebuild it once the user has finished editing the text fields. However, this is a pain and the user loses what they had been searching for.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\ntvOS 9/10 Simulators and Apple TV devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
