        The attached screenshots include one of a contact card for “BloodWorks Northwest”.

        However, speaking “Hey Siri call BloodWorks Northwest” results in the transcription “Hey Siri call blood works Northwest” and the message “I don’t see that person in your Contacts. Should I look for locations by that name?”

        Correcting the Siri transcription to “Hey Siri call bloodworks Northwest” just short-circuits directly to doing an external directory lookup; Siri still doesn’t find the contact card.

        This organization was formerly named “Puget Sound Blood Bank,” and I just changed the name a few minutes ago. Is there a lag between Contacts changes and the time at which Siri can actually access them?
