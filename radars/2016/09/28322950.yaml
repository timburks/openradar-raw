    description: "Summary:\r\nThe stringFromDistance: method on MKDistanceFormatter crashes reliably when the phone is in Region - Paraguay and Language - Spanish. There may be other cases that cause unreliable crashes as well (such as the crash log attached), but the Paraguay/Spanish case is most reliable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload the repro app from https://github.com/zackzachariah/ParaguayRadarRepro or this Radar. \r\nRun in an iOS 10 Simulator.\r\nIt will crash immediately.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe repro app should log \"Hello world prepare to crash\" and then log \"1km\". In general, the expected result is that stringFromDistance: will return a localized string for any number of meters passed in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nstringFromDistance: crashes with an EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash."
