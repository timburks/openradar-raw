    description: "Summary:\r\nThe security command line tool does not honor the -T /usr/bin/codesign or -A (insecure but had to try) parameters when adding a certificate/private key .p12 to a keychain via the command line. When codesign attempts to use that certificate the GUI prompt for password appears, which will then allow codesign to continue. When I attempt to set the ACL in Keychain Access for a private key, the same behavior occurs. While a nuisance at best on a local development machine, this has become a nightmare scenario for CI setups when new keys are added/updated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRequirements:\r\n* a .p12 containing an iOS Development certificate & the private key used to generate that certificate.\r\n* an example project to build (can be any of the sample Apple projects, as long as you use the previously mentioned certificate above).\r\n\r\n1. In terminal run this command: `security import test.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security`\r\n2. Now run xcodebuild from the terminal - once it reaches the codesign command it will prompt you for your password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe password prompt should not appear as we're making Access Control exceptions for the private key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe password prompt appears when an \"allowed\" command attempts to use the private key.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12/16A322\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny hardware, macOS GM or greater"
