        Summary:

        After upgrading from my original Watch to new Series 1 Watch, I started a workout, which couldn’t track anything. After that, the heart rate sensor got stuck in the on position for the whole day until battery died

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a fully working Watch. Make a backup of it.
        2. Restore backup to a new Watch
        3. Next day, start the first Workout on the new device. The workout was “Indoor Running”.
        4. Watch says I should have my iPhone with me for the first 20 minutes for accuracy. I have an iPhone, so it’s cool.
        5. I run for 15 minuets. It tracked no distance, and no active calories.
        6. I then started an “Other” workout, again it tracked no active calories (even though it did note the average heart rate.
        7. After finishing those workouts, the heart rate continued to be turned on. It was stuck in the on position for the whole day, until battery ran out
        8. For the whole day, the Watch tracked 0 Move calories, 0 minutes of exercise, 0 Stand hours

        Unfortunately I did not have a heart rate logging profile installed at that time. I did trigger a sysdiagnose that day, however.

        After a reboot (forced by battery dying on me), the issue seems to have resolved itself.
