    description: "Chaoqun Zou12-Aug-2016 10:13 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis is a suggestion to support app extensions in the HomeKit framework so the HomeKit accessory manufacturer can just provide an extension to support the firmware upgrade for their products instead of providing a full app if they don't want to include other extra features. It will make the end user's life much easier since then they don't need to install an extra app for each HomeKit product they purchase. \r\n\r\nThere is a Home app on iOS 10 so in some cases actually the manufacturer does not need to provide another app if there is no extra custom functionality. However, since HomeKit requires all the accessories to be firmware upgradeable, even the manufacturer doesn't want to provide a custom app they still have to provide an app to provide firmware upgrade support.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to support app extensions and the manufacturer can just provide an app extension for the firmware upgrade and it can be launched directly in the Home app so end user doesn't need to leave the Home app for firmware upgrade. It's a time saver for both manufacturers and end users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and iPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
