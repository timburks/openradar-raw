    description: "Summary:\r\nHere's what I gobbled together based on Google; mostly thanks to WebKit being open source. (I only tested CLANG_ADDRESS_SANITIZER so far, but based on Google the other flags should work as well)\r\n\r\n// AddressSanitizer is a fast memory error detector. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.\r\n// Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is 2x.\r\n// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html\r\nCLANG_ADDRESS_SANITIZER = YES\r\n\r\n// ThreadSanitizer is a tool that detects data races. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.\r\n// Typical slowdown introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about 5x-15x. Typical memory overhead introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about 5x-10x.\r\n// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html\r\nCLANG_THREAD_SANITIZER = NO\r\n\r\n// MemorySanitizer is a detector of uninitialized reads. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.\r\n// Typical slowdown introduced by MemorySanitizer is 3x.\r\n// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html\r\nCLANG_MEMORY_SANITIZER = NO\r\n\r\nPlease document this."
