    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes a protected network handled by a hotspot helper extension will store its label, but not the password provided by the extension.\r\nWhen this happens, the system will ask for the password when the user taps on the network, instead of connecting automatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHaving a hotspot helper extension installed, handling one or more password-protected hotspots (i.e. setting the password in the reply to kNEHotspotHelperCommandTypeFilterScanList) that are not configured by the phone\r\n1. Open Settings \r\n2. Go to Wi-Fi\r\nThe handled network(s) will show with the label set by the network extension app under the SSID\r\n3. Tap on one of the handled networks to connect to it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping the network connects to it without asking for password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping the network prompts for the password\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems to happen randomly, seems related to the log entries saying \"<Warning>: __37-[WiFiManager beginCaptivePlugInScan]_block_invoke: Error: unable to find (ssid) in _networks\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nReproduced with iOS 9.3.5 (13G36) and submitted Wi-Fi logs"
