    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie.\r\n\r\nIf I run a fresh instruments (Time profiler) session, it works great. If I try again (cmd-I from Xcode) without bouncing instruments, it behaves strangely, doesn't pause reliably, doesn't show any coverage information, and generally loses its mind.\r\n\r\nThe device connected to the machine that I'm using as a profile target is an iPad 2 with iOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nThe app is a large Objective-C only app.\r\n\r\nIf you need system information, please ask for it quickly - I'm nuking and paving this machine when Sierra drops for real.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just remember to quit Instruments after every run and lose the context of prior runs but when these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh death-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant. \r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n(and of course the movie failed to upload first try)"
