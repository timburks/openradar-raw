    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Sticker Pack Application template, making changes to the Target Membership can cause issues for the project that cannot be repaired without directly altering the project.pbxproj file. Specifically, if the .app target is unchecked within the Target Membership options for StickerPackExtension.appex, checking it again will not resolve the issue that appears (App installation failed - This iMessage application is missing its required iMessage app extension).\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem because it means that the project cannot be easily repaired if it becomes unchecked for any reason (it may be inadvertent, plenty of people making sticker packs are not familiar with Xcode).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a sticker pack application project.\r\n2. Uncheck the app target in the Target Membership options for StickerPackExtension.appex.\r\n3. Re-check the app target in the Target Membership options for StickerPackExtension.appex.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be able to be built and run on device and in the simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app cannot be installed, and instead presents the error \"App installation failed - This iMessage application is missing its required iMessage app extension\".\r\n\r\nThis error can be resolved by manually editing the project.pbxproj file to configure the StickerPackExtension.appex for \"Embed App Extensions\", which requires several steps to get working correctly."
