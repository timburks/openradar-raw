        Often, developers will want to test a new version of their app on older hardware. These kinds of “smoke tests” are only to make sure there aren’t any major problems — they don’t require a debugger.

        Yet when you plug in an older device to test, the first thing Xcode does when you run the app is to download the debug symbols from the device. This is a necessary step before the debugger can start. <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19187857/processing-symbol-files-in-xcode#19706886>

        On older hardware, copying gigabytes of information over slower serial protocols results in a painfully long wait.

        Unfortunately, there is no way to cancel the “Processing symbol files” operation. If there were, the developer could save a lot of time by ending the debugging session, copy the application bundle over manually to the device, and launch it from Springboard. If any problems or crashes are encountered during the smoke test, then they’d be happy to wait for symbols to be copied over and the debugger to start normally.
