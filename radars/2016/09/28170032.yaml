    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 extensions are not able to provide default key bindings for invocation\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Build an xcode source editor extension\r\n- Try to figure out how to set a default key binding for users to invoke the extension\r\n- Fail to find API for this\r\n- Note that in WWDC video it appears users must set key bindings on each plugin\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Developers can provide a default key binding for an applicaiton\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Users must set key bindings for each source editor extension they use manually. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n(not a regression, this is a new feature)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy guess is this was implemented to prevent potential collisions of key bindings, but I think it would probably be easier for users to allow developers to set a default key binding, then present the user with a dialog to resolve any conflicts between default key bindings. In most cases the key bindings should be reasonably different, and the user would easily be able to update or ignore the key binding for any given extension."
