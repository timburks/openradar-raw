    description: "Closed as duplicate of 28170671 (Closed)\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAccording to CoreBluetooth specification, writing to a notifiable characteristic configured without response shouldn't trigger -didWriteValueForCharacteristic:error: callback. In iOS9 this seems to work according to the spec, the callback is triggered only after the writes requiring a response. In iOS10, every single write to a notifiable characteristic configured to not requiring a response leads to -didWriteValueForCharacteristic:error: being called. Mostly it fires without an error, but sometimes, after the link is fully utilized, this callback returns with the following error.\r\n\r\nError Domain=CBATTErrorDomain Code=114 \"Unknown ATT error.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Unknown ATT error.}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure a BLE connection to a peripheral device. \r\nStart writing to a notifiable characteristic without response. \r\nObserve -didWriteValueForCharacteristic:error: delegate method triggered after every write. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo callback should be triggered if writing without response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter every write, -didWriteValueForCharacteristic:error: is triggered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S, BLE peripheral based on Android 5.1"
