        Summary:
        Photos disk usage is not in its own category in System Information > Storage > Manage.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Click Apple menu in menu bar
        2. Click System Information
        3. Click Storage
        4. Click Manage
        5. Wait

        Expected Results:
        A list of categories consisting of Applications, Documents, Photos, etc.

        Actual Results:
        Photos category doesnâ€™t appear. Instead, the disk space usage for Photos seems to be bundled into Documents.

        Regression:
        In previous betas (this is beta 8?) Photos appear, but disk usage displayed is too low (~10GB when I have a 90+ GB photo library). In previous betas, the disk usage was also bundled in Documents.
