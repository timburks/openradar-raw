    description: "Peter Steinberger10-Sep-2016 10:46 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm trying to enable iCloud Drive for my Document and Desktop folder, but after working a while it fails. The dialog doesn't explain which folder is to blame or what the limits are - I have no idea what to change other than blind trial/error.\r\n\r\nAre the limits 100 files? 1000? 10.000? More? How many folders?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse macOS Sierra GM\r\nSystem Settings -> iCloud -> Check box to sync Document and Desktop folder\r\nSee error if folder is large?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nlatest gen rMBP\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-09-09 at 22.02.58.png' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/steipete/status/774337476689293312"
