    description: "When the Bitmoji app is updated to a new version, some users see our keyboard as (null) - Bitmoji when trying to switch to the Bitmoji custom keyboard.  The keyboard is no longer accessible.  The users would have to delete the keyboard and re-add it in order to access the keyboard again.  \r\n\r\nIt's not certain if the Bitmoji keyboard was the active keyboard before the app is updated."
