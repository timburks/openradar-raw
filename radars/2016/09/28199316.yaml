    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the new iOS 10 privacy features of requiring strings for permissions such as `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, TestFlight rejects uploads that don't include the strings in the app's Info.plist file, even when they are in the InfoPlist.strings file (and work correctly without crashing the app)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\r\n2. Add an InfoPlist.strings file\r\n3. Add the key NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription and value to something\r\n4. Request photo library permissions on launch\r\n5. Note that your string is displayed in the permissions modal\r\n6. Archive and upload your build to TestFlight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTestFlight accepts your app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTestFlight rejects your app after a successful upload with this error:\r\n\r\nThis app attempts to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description.\r\nThe app's Info.plist must contain an NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key with a\r\nstring value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:"
