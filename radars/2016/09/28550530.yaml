    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m trying to use a Settings bundle in my iOS app to set some user preference values for my watchOS app, as described in this document:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/Settings.html\r\n\r\nHowever, none of the modifications I make to the values in the iOS Watch app’s Settings area for this app are synced to the watchOS device—changes do not trigger KVO notifications, nor are they present at the next app launch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Follow the steps in the linked document to get an iOS app with a watchOS app embedded inside of it, both using the same App Group ID, with a “Settings-Watch.bundle” settings bundle in the iOS app with the same App Group ID in a top-level String.\r\n2. Change the preference values using the Watch app on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe changes are synced to the watchOS device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe changes are not synced to the watchOS device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nBuild machine:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 (8A218a)\r\nmacOS Sierra Version 10.12 (16A323)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSyncing of these values should work in the following directions:\r\niPhone Watch App -> watchOS Device\r\niPhone Watch App -> iOS App\r\niOS App -> iPhone Watch App\r\niOS App -> watchOS Device\r\nwatchOS Device -> iOS App (via WatchConnectivity, as the UserDefaults database is read-only on the watch)\r\nwatchOS Device -> iOS App (via WatchConnectivity) -> iPhone Watch App\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project that you can use to validate this behavior. Note that the iOS and watchOS simulators do not exhibit the same behavior as real devices.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus (128GB, AT&T), iOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\nApple Watch 42mm, watchOS 3.0 (14S326)\\"
