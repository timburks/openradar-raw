    description: "Area:\r\nFaceTime\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWifi calling allows Other Devices to be activated to be used to call non-iPhone telephone numbers via FaceTime. According to the [support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203032), iPhones are not supported as \"another device.\" However, it is possible to activate iPhones that are signed in under your iCloud account under Calls on Other Devices in iOS Settings. Nonetheless, doing so does not seem to work, at least on an iPhone without active cell service. This functionality should either work, or iPhones should not show up as options under Calls on Other Devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have two iPhones, one with active cellular service with a company that supports Wi-Fi Calling on iCloud-connected devices, and one with deactivated cellular service, both signed into the same iCloud account.\r\n2. On the iPhone with active cellular service, go to Settings>Phone>Wi-Fi Calling.\r\n3. Turn on Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone.\r\n4. Tap Phone.\r\n5. Select Calls on Other Devices.\r\n6. Under ALLOW CALLS ON, choose the deactivated iPhone.\r\n7. Attempt make a phone call to a non-iPhone phone number on the deactivated iPhone using FaceTime.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither the deactivated iPhone should not appear under ALLOW CALLS ON, or it should function properly as an 'other device' under Wi-Fi Calling.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAttempting to call a non-iPhone phone number results in the call routing to the cell phone company, and does not connect to the number."
