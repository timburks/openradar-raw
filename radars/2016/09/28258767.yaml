    description: "## Summary\n\nThe current setup for In-App Purchases makes it difficult to test them in a workflow that operates with different bundle identifiers.\n\n## Explanation\n\n### Multiple bundle identifiers for one app\n\nA relatively common workflow for iOS app development is to have different bundle identifiers for the different stages of development. This helps the developer during debugging and testing, because they can keep several copies of the app next to each other on the same device. For example, this allows to switch between app versions, to see differences in production and debug and more easily pinpoint discrepancies and bugs.\n\nTo illustrate, the sample app 'Awesome App' might have the following bundle identifiers;\n\n* For Testflight and the App Store: com.noodlewerk.awesomeapp \n* For internal beta-testing with another distribution platform: com.noodlewerk.awesomeapp.beta\n* For development and debug: com.noodlewerk.awesomeapp.debug\n\nThis is especially useful for client work, where less technically savvy clients have difficulties determining which version of the app they have installed. Deleting and reinstalling the apps is complicated for these clients, while using different bundle identifiers alleviates many of these problems.\n\n### Problems with IAP\n\nHowever, IAP products are tied to a single bundle identifier and are only available through iTunes Connect. To make the same workflow possible with an app that uses IAP, one must create multiple apps _in iTunes Connect with the same bundle identifiers_ and add the exact same IAP to each of these apps. \n\nThis crowds the iTunes Connect terminal unnecessarily and is less scalable due to the duplicate labor necessary when creating and updating the IAP products.\n\n### Possible improvement\n\nIt would be great if IAP products could also be available for Sandbox Test Users with different bundle identifiers. These bundle identifiers could for example be linked to the main bundle identifier, making it possible for StoreKit to access and purchase all IAP products during development and testing for certain known bundle-identifiers in the Sandbox environment."
