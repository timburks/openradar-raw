    description: "If an iOS has a VPN profile installed, and that VPN is set to Connect On Demand, then when the device is locked, the Wi-Fi connection will drop. It doesn't happen every single time, but it happens about 50% of the time the device is locked.\r\n\r\nThe Wi-Fi connection remains dropped until the device is unlocked and a new VPN connection is established.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install a VPN profile that includes a Connect On Demand setting (one that always connects)\r\n2. Enable the VPN\r\n3. Lock the device\r\n4. Wait a few seconds\r\n5. Turn the screen on (but do not unlock)\r\n6. Wi-Fi icon will have disappeared\r\n\r\n(Sometimes you have to do this a few times before it happens)"
