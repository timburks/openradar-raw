    description: "Summary:\r\nI keep a lot of books (PDFs and ePubs) in iBooks that were not purchased from the iBooks Store. I use iCloud to sync them between devices. After updating to macOS Sierra, I enabled the \"optimize Mac storage\" option for iCloud Drive. With this option enabled, most of my books were completely missing from the iBooks app. Files stored in iBooks don't show up in the \"iCloud Drive\" section in Finder either, so it was impossible to see them at all, much less manually download them. After turning off \"optimize Mac storage\", the books appeared in iBooks and started downloading.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a Mac with 10.11, make sure iCloud Drive is enabled for iBooks.\r\n2. Add some PDFs to iBooks on a different device. Do not download them on the current Mac. They should show up but have a download button next to them.\r\n3. Upgrade to 10.12.\r\n4. Go to System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options and confirm that \"Optimize Mac Storage\" is enabled. (I assume this is always automatically enabled, because it was even on my iMac with 250GB free.)\r\n5. Open iBooks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll of my books should be visible, whether they were purchased from the iBooks Store or added to iCloud Drive. Books that have not been downloaded should be visible, but show a download button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBooks that are stored in iCloud Drive do not show up at all unless they were already downloaded prior to upgrading.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 (16B2333a)\r\niBooks 1.7 (1253.15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
