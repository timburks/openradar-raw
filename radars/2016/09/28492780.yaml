        After upgrading my iPhone from 6s to 7, I am unable to install a development AdHoc-signed build of my app on the new phone.

        With every attempt to install the app, I get “Unable to Download App; could not be installed at this time”.

        . . .

        Regarding the upgrade:

        I suspect the issue is related to me upgrading the device. On my previous device, iPhone 6s, I had the app installed (in either AdHoc or Development configuration — not 100% sure). I created a backup in iTunes, and restored the backup on iPhone 7. The app was not present on the new device. (This wasn’t surprising since backup didn’t include apps, and the app could not be downloaded from App Store since it was a development build; but I speculate some metadata about the app might still be present in the system.)

        . . .

        Here’s what I tried:

        - I double and triple checked that I added the new device’s UDID to the provisioning profile of new builds
        - I verified that new AdHoc builds install just fine on my other devices
        - I rebooted the phone
        - I logged out and in again to HockeyApp (which I use to distribute AdHoc builds), re-registered the device with it, re-installed its configuration profile
        - I cleared all of Safari’s caches
        - I tried to first install a development-signed build of the app (which works), and then overwrite it with an AdHoc build (fails). Or install a development build, delete it, then install an AdHoc build (fails again)

        But I still can’t install AdHoc builds on my device.

        . . .

        I include a copy of system logs fetched with Xcode 8. The bundle id of the app I’m trying to install is com.nozbe.dev, its name is Nozbe Dev
