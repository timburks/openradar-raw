        Summary:
        Every build Iâ€™ve uploaded with the Xcode 8 GM has disappeared. They upload to iTunes Connect OK and start processing without issue. However, once processing completes the build disappears. No error message or logs are reported.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build, archive, and upload an app to iTunes Connect with Xcode 8
        2. Wait for the build to finish processing

        Expected Results:
        Build is available for internal testing.

        Actual Results:
        Build disappears.

        Regression:
        Xcode 8 GM
