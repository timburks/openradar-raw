    description: "Peter Steinberger13-Sep-2016 09:51 AM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUIMenuController sometimes has a bug where the mask on the blur background is cleared, making it look like the blur \"leaks out\" of the shape, which looks quite silly. This has been reported to us numerous times, and I always (wrongfully) assumed that this must be widespread and surely will be fixed. It was extremely hard to figure out how to trigger this reproducibly.\r\n\r\nIt's been bugging us in PSPDFKit since iOS 7 but without a clear way to repro, we dismissed it as \"sometimes\" and \"random bug\" and largely ignored the ticket.\r\n\r\nIt really popped up again because we're finally doing this PDF Viewer app (yay!) and quite a few people reported this bug again. So - finally spent time on it. I know, timing for iOS 10 is a but unfortunate, but since this seems to be a purely visual bug you might be able to fix it without the AppCompat team shouting at you.\r\n\r\nWe did discuss this in the UIKit labs at WWDC 2016 but didn't get much interest from the maintainer of this component to fix - potentially because you were swamped with other issues. Well - here I am again, trying once more :)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload our PDF Viewer app: pspdfkit.com/viewer\r\n\r\nselect text\r\nset any annotation via the toolbar\r\nselect the annotation again\r\n\"Type..\" to change the annotation so something different\r\nNow the toolbar is not transparent or has weird shadows\r\nSometimes the shadow is noticable, but sometimes it's just one corner that is not transparent\r\n\r\nAlternatively - you can also download a demo of PSPDFKit (attaching latest stable here), open the PSPDFCatalog, select a PDF (e.g. just choose first entry) and the follow the steps above. The flow is the same.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to come up with an isolated example, but so far did not succeed.\r\n\r\nSee the flow.gif for a visual walk-through. Also notice how the animation seems broken once the blur leaks out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blur background should stay behind the shape to keep a consistent UI component.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blur background loses its mask and the control looks weird - see screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is in the codebase since iOS 7.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus (but really, any device is affected also Simulator)"

    title: UIMenuController is leaking out blur background. Discussed at WWDC 2016. Hard to reproduce. Always sticks in the eye.
