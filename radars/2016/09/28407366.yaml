    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom time to time my keyboard stops working. I have to unplug it and plug it in again to make it usable.\r\n\r\nI am using a third party USB keyboard (the Quickfire TK from Cooler Master). I have been using this keyboard for a number of years. In macOS Yosemite it worked as expected, no difficulties. With the advent of macOS El Capitan it started failing in a way I could not reproduce. The fix was simply to unplug it and plug it in again.\r\n\r\nToday I discovered how to reproduce the error reliably in macOS Sierra, so I have decided to finally report this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug in a Quickfire TK USB keyboard to an iMac running macOS Sierra.\r\n2. Open a new TextEdit document and type a few words to demonstrate that the keyboard works as expected.\r\n3. Open the App Store application and leave it on Featured apps.\r\n4. Type a few more words in TextEdit to show the keyboard still works.\r\n5. Choose Updates in the App Store app.\r\n6. Try to type a few more words in TextEdit, these will not appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should continue to function normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard failed to type any words in TextEdit after the Updates tab in the App Store has been selected. Unpluging the keyboard and plugin it back in again will return normal function, however any time the App Store checks for updates, the keyboard will fail again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n  System Version:\tmacOS 10.12 (16A323)\r\n  Kernel Version:\tDarwin 16.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have no idea if it is only the \"check for updates\" feature of the macOS App Store that causes this USB failure or if this feature is just one of a number that trigger the problem. I do know that I generally experience the problem a couple times a day in macOS Sierra (and the same was true in El Capitan). The \"check for updates\" feature is, however, a 100% reliable way to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n  Model Name:\tiMac\r\n  Model Identifier:\tiMac12,1\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i7\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.8 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t8 MB\r\n  Memory:\t16 GB\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tIM121.0047.B23\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.71f22\r\n\r\nQuickfire TKL 6keys:\r\n\r\n  Product ID:\t0x0011\r\n  Vendor ID:\t0x2516\r\n  Version:\t1.11\r\n  Speed:\tUp to 12 Mb/sec\r\n  Manufacturer:\tCM Storm\r\n  Location ID:\t0xfd141300 / 7\r\n  Current Available (mA):\t500\r\n  Current Required (mA):\t100\r\n  Extra Operating Current (mA):\t0"
