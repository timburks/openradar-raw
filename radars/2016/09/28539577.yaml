    description: "It would be great if we could develop custom screensavers for tvOS. This could be a standalone \"screensaver app\" or a screensaver extension for an existing app. (Similar to iMessage apps.)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Slideshow that shows photos.\r\n- News apps can show the latest news.\r\n- Movie / Video apps can show trailers.\r\n- App Store can show featured apps.\r\n- Dashboard apps visualize any data.\r\n- Games could show scoreboards and/or a replay of your latest game.\r\n- Much more..."
