    description: "Summary:\r\nCertain applications, Safari included, do not always respect the Automatic Proxy Configuration proxy.pac file. In our environment (50+ Macs) this file is stored locally on each system in the /Users/username/.ssh/ directory and is referenced in system preferences by the file:/// URL protocol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install proxy.pac file for all network interfaces using a bash script (https://github.com/macmule/setAutomaticProxyConfigurationURL)\r\n2. Attempt to use internal website on Safari, unable. Attempt same website in Chrome/Firefox, able to connect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results would be that internal sites hosted on our internal domain would render in any browser as the proxy.pac file is referenced at the network interface level. Clicking on Proxy settings in Safari opens this setting in System Preferences, but fails to respect it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn Safari, after entering the URL and hitting Enter to engage, the progress bar will not move. Safari will eventually time out with a \"Safari Can't Open the Page\" error stating that \"the server where the page is located isn't responding.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chrome/Firefox the website is nearly instantaneously loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 (16A323) (app store upgrade from 10.11.6)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also noticed some crashing with references to the proxy.pac file in Outlook 2016. This is possibly related, but since the proxy file has nothing to do with our email servers (office365) it should read through and then bypass.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has been noticed on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with macOS 10.12 (16A323)"
