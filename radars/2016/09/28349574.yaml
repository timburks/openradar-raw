    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I schedule a price change for an app the wrong dates are set unless I adjust my local Mac timezone to be Pacific Time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Set timezone to Eastern instead of Pacific\r\n2) Navigate to the Pricing and Availability section for an app\r\n3) Click “Plan a Price Change”\r\n4) Choose a new price, a start date and end date\r\n5) Click “Done”\r\n6) Verify those dates have been entered corrected by examining the price schedule\r\n7) Click “Save”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThose dates will be saved and the app will change price at the start date requested.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dates are adjusted and the app will change price a day earlier than intended.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested in Safari on a Mac running OS X 10.11.6\r\nThe timezone is the critical part. I’ve reproduced with my local timezone in Europe, Eastern Time in the US, and Mountain Time in the US.\r\nIf I set the timezone to Pacific it works as expected."
