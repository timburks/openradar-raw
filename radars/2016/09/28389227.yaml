    description: "If a VPN is installed, and it is set to Connect On Demand, and I move from an area with Wi-Fi to LTE (such as when I leave the office for the day), the phone will never make the transition from Wi-Fi to LTE unless I either turn on Airplane mode and turn it off, or disable the VPN. Sometimes if I lock the device and unlock it, the transition will work, but this may be related to bug #28389138\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install a VPN profile with Connect On Demand\r\n2. Have the phone connect to a Wi-Fi network\r\n3. With the device still awake, move away from the Wi-Fi network to an area where the phone should only be connected via cellular"
