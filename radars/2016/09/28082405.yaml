    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI regularly use the presence of the alarm icon in the status bar in order to preemptively turn off alarms, so as to not bother family, coworkers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Bedtime alarm being active (which, as far as I understand, it always should be, as it actually ringing is disabled by me waking up and/or using my phone) causes the status bar icon to stick.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on alarms (include Bedtime alarm)\r\n2. Go to bed\r\n3. In the morning, use Siri to turn off all alarms.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlarms that would ring are disabled and the icon in the status bar goes away.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Bedtime alarm being active causes the status bar icon to appear. Siri does not turn off the Bedtime alarm.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 Beta 7 (14A5345a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB with Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
