    description: In our watch app when the user presses a button we reload the root interface controllers to present another screen. As soon as we initiate that reload, the sprite kit content being displayed in the current interface controller disappears. That looks very strange, because the rest of the current presented interface controller stays in place until the new screen begins to load. The sprite kit content disappears a full second before that happens. It looks really strange. See attached video.
