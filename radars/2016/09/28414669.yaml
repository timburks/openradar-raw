    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPhone, when broadcasting with ReplayKit, the device's orientation is locked, so that the video size does not change midstream. On iPad, the device's orientation is not locked when broadcasting with ReplayKit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a ReplayKit broadcasting app (e.g. Periscope)\r\n2. Install an iPad app that supports ReplayKit (e.g. Tower Dash)\r\n3. Start broadcasting via ReplayKit\r\n4. Rotate the device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI orientation should not change. This is currently the behavior on iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI orientation changes, resulting in distorted video.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad iOS 10"
