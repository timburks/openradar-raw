    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a CNContactViewController  is pushed onto a UINavigationController with a non-translucent navigation bar, the navigation bar is modified to be clear on push. The barTintColor as well as the navigation bar background image is ignored. This leads to a black navigation bar (the window's background color).\r\n\r\nThe same bug occurs when pushing a legacy ABUnknownPersonViewController.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug is new in iOS 10.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis affects us badly because we can't switch to a translucent navigation bar for various reasons."
