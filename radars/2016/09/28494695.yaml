    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven an app which uses custom entitlements for provisioning profiles, as granted by Apple, Xcode is unable to configure automatic code signing for that app.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though Xcode has no idea about the concept of custom entitlements granted to a specific provisioning profile, such as `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an bundle ID on the dev portal and an app on iTunes Connect.\r\n2. Create a provisioning profile on the dev portal.\r\n3. Give that bundle ID/app privileges for the `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning` entitlement.\r\n4. Enable that entitlement for the provisioning profile.\r\n5. Configure the entitlements for your app in Xcode to contain the `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning` entitlement.\r\n6. Configure automatic code signing in Xcode.\r\n7. Build and run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode creates and downloads a provisioning profile using the `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning` entitlement. \r\nThe build succeeds as the provisioning profile's entitlements match the entitlements included in the application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode creates and downloads a provisioning profile which does not contain the `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning` entitlement.\r\nThe build fails as the provisioning profile's entitlements do not match the entitlements included in the application.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlternatively, moving `com.apple.developer.payment-pass-provisioning` to a proper entitlement for a bundle identifier, instead of a provisioning profile, could lead to a more unified developer experience, allowing one place to configure all entitlements."
