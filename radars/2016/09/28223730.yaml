        I implemented -shouldAutorotate and -supportedInterfaceOrientations in my iMessage app in the root view controller (MSMessagesAppViewController subclass). Those two methods are never called and Messages autorotates at its own will.

        I tried to workaround the horrible Messages autorotation bugs (see rdar://28206321) by forbidding rotation but this isn't possible.
