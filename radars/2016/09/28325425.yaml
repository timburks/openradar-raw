    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nConstraints on any MKMapView in a storyboard appear not to be saved, and the map view moves to the upper left corner of the view and resizes to 1000 x 1000. Resizing the view in the Utility pane to something other than 1000 x 1000 allows the user to restore the constraints in the view to what they were when the project was saved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create sample Single View iOS app.\r\n2) Add MapKit framework to project.\r\n3) Add MKMapView to storyboard.\r\n4) Add leading, trailing, top and aspect ratio constraints\r\n5) Build and run. A map appears in the view as expected.\r\n6) Save project and close Xcode.\r\n7) Open project in Xcode. The map view has resized to 1000 x 1000 and has moved to the upper left corner of the view it is in.\r\n8) Change the size of the map view in the Utility pane to 100 x 100.\r\n9) You should now be able to revert back to the constraints set in step 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSteps 8 and 9 above should not be necessary, I should be able to open my project with constraints set as they were when I closed it."
