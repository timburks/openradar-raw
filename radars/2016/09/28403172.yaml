    description: After editing the textfield and adding emoji symbols (and they must be exactly the ones as on the screenshot - heart and sun, perhaps in sequence) the font partially changes - note that the original text before the emojis has it's original font but after emojis it's different e.g. it has serifs and the space becomes very long. When the texfield is broken this way, deleting all the characters and editing again does not fix the problem. Also the placeholder font is changed. Additionally there are some problems with the text "jumping" a little up / down while editing / ending edition. This happens in at least two exactly separate apps, and even in the system Contacts app (but in Contacts it doesn't change the font - it does not have serifs) - see the attached screenshots.
