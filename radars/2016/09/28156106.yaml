    description: "Summary:\r\nIntent example phrases, as described in Siri integration guide here: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Intents/Conceptual/SiriIntegrationGuide/CustomVocabularyKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016875-CH10-SW6\r\n\r\nThey show up in the Siri Guide on the device in debug builds but they do not show up in TestFlight builds. The app with Siri integration still shows up in Siri Guide, but with no subtitle (normally the subtitle is the first example phrase). When you tap on the app name, it just says \"UNKNOWN\" instead of showing the provided example phrases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with Intent example phrases in AppIntentVocabulary.plist\r\n2. Build and run a debug build on device\r\n3. See that the app name and the first example phrase provided shows up in Siri Guide (activate Siri -> tap on question mark -> scroll until you see the app name) and tapping on the app name shows all example phrases provided\r\n4. Submit app to TestFlight\r\n5. Repeat step 3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the example phrases to show up correctly in a TestFlight build as they do in a debug build. For an app that provides intent example phrases in AppIntentVocabulary.plist, the first example phrase should show up under the app name in Siri Guide and tapping on it should show all example phrases (grouped by intent domain).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor TestFlight builds, intent example phrases do not show up in Siri Guide at all. There is no subtitle under the app name and tapping on it shows \"UNKNOWN\" instead of the provides example phrases.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5346a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have not been able to test this for a production app from the App Store (since iOS 10 is still in beta). The only data points I have is that for the same app, this works in a debug build but does not work for a TestFlight build.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB T-Mobile, using WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
