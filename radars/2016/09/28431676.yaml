    description: "Summary:\r\nPlaying music from Apple Music using the MPMusicPlayerController class works, but when I have called [AVAudioSession setActive:YES] before calling play on the MPMusicPlayerController class, I get an AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification.\r\n\r\nI am using the applicationMusicPlayer, not systemMusicPlayer, so I expect to handle the audio session myself because of this documentation: https://developer.apple.com/reference/mediaplayer/mpmusicplayercontroller\r\n\r\n>To receive remote-control events in your app, you must use an application music player. If \r\n>you use the system music player, your app uses the Music app to play audio, which means \r\n>that the Music app is the “now playing” app.\r\n\r\nI do realize this didn't mention handling the AVAudioSession and I haven't found documentation explicitly saying whether an applicationMusicPlayer will handle the AVAudioSession for me. However, handling remote events but not the actual audio session on my behalf is unintuitive.\r\n\r\nIf what's happening is expected, this will not work for my use case as I am also playing audio outside Apple Music using URLs and other audio player frameworks that don't handle the AVAudioSession for me. It would be impossible to differentiate an interruption from the MPMusicPlayerController starting playback and another app trying to stop my app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n[AVAudioSession setActive:YES];\r\nself.playerController = [MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer];\r\n[self.playerController setQueueWithStoreIDs:@[trackId]];\r\n[self.playerController play];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification notification\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI received an AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1, Xcode 8.0, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, Project Fi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
