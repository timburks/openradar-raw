    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to the removal of implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift 3, setting up NSLayoutConstraints with visual format is now more annoying and throws an extremely unhelpful error message at runtime:\r\n\r\n-[_SwiftValue nsli_superitem]: unrecognized selector sent to instance …\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nChange the constraints of a view that is setup view @IBOutlet in a Swift class. \r\n\r\nSetup your views parameter passed to \r\nNSLayoutConstraint.constraints(withVisualFormat:options:metrics:views:)\r\n\r\nwithout any type annotation.\r\n\r\nRun the project and watch it crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally of course this would just work the way it always has but I assume that this will be tricky to do with the removal of implicitly unwrapped optionals.\r\n\r\nThe error message could be much more helpful however, it is absolutely not obvious what this has to do with an unrecognised selector or what a _SwiftValue nsli_superitem is\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt crashes at runtime.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (8A218a)"
