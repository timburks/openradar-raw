        Summary:
        didSelectMessage:conversation not called when user taps a message they previously tapped

        This is particular relevant when you consider a scenario where an app has two state, one that allows user to send content and one that allows them view received content. The app will only be told once that the user has selected a particular message, so if they minimise the app again and return to "sending content mode" the app won't be notified if they tap that episode again to view its content.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Launch app from included sample project
        2. Tap insert message
        3. Send
        4. Tap the message in the conversation view

        Expected Results:
        `didSelectMessage` is called so we can tell the user has tapped on a message so we can respond to that tap and load specific content

        Actual Results:
        Since that message has been considered selected all along there is no callback and we cannot respond to the tap
