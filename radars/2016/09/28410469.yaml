    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a PKPaymentRequest's shippingAddress is set, the Apple Pay sheet won't appear when presenting a PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController. Instead, the following appears in the logs:\r\n\r\n> <private> XPC Error: <private>\r\n> Failed to present in-app payment interface: <private>\r\n> Connection to remote alert view service failed\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on both the iOS 10.0 simulator and a device running iOS 10.0.1, but doesn't happen on iOS 9. The same thing also happens when using the new PKPaymentAuthorizationController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached example app on an iOS 10 simulator\r\n2. Tap Buy -> No payment sheet appears\r\n3. Comment out line 54 in ViewController.m, which sets paymentRequest.shippingAddress\r\n4. Run the app again\r\n5. Tap Buy -> Payment sheet appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPKPaymentAuthorizationViewController should always appear when the PKPaymentRequest has a shippingAddress.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPKPaymentAuthorizationViewController doesn't appear on iOS10 when the PKPaymentRequest has a shippingAddress.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis affects any app that hasn't migrated to using shippingContact.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 10.0 simulator and iPhone 6s running iOS 10.0.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'apple-pay-shipping.zip' was successfully uploaded."
