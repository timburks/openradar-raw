    description: "Description: \r\n\r\nOn Friday 9/23/2016, shortly after updating my iPhone 5S from iOS 10.0.1 (downloaded when it was the developer GM) to iOS 10.0.2, my phone started exhibiting some odd behaviors:\r\n\r\n* First, the phone stopped receiving iMessages. The iMessages went to my other Apple devices, but not to my phone.\r\n\r\n* Later, out of nowhere, the phone required me to enter Apple ID email address and password to \"activate\" it. After I did that, my phone still had my data.\r\n\r\n* Later, I got email saying my phone had been removed as a trusted device from two-step verification.\r\n\r\nI later realized that after I had cleaned everything up, my phone was still not receiving iMessages that were sent to secondary email addresses. I added the secondary email addresses back on my phone.\r\n\r\nI was concerned that my Apple ID had been compromised, so I changed my password and switched from two-step verification to two-factor authentication. At the helpful suggestion of the @AppleSupport Twitter account, I reviewed my purchase history and found nothing amiss.\r\n\r\nI don't know that this sequence of events is related to the iOS 10.0.2 update. I also don't know if I could possibly reproduce this behavior. I just wanted to report it.\r\n\r\nSteven Holland also reported not getting texts and iMessages after updating to 10.0.2, but no other symptoms:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/forktail/status/779891371922423809\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:  \r\n\r\niPhone 5S, AT&T, 16GB, updating from iOS 10.0.1 (installed as developer GM)\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion & Build:  \r\n\r\niOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nI didn't experience this on any other devices, but this is the only device that warranted an iOS 10.0.2 update. My other iOS devices either can't run iOS 10 or are running 10.1 beta versions."
