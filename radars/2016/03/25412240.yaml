    description: "We have an iPad which is already in use by one of our employees. We wanted to add that iPad to DEP afterwards and so we did. We checked if the DEP profile was there (it was, as well as the MDM profile) on the device and the iPad was showing up as online on the MDM. But the employee decided to restore an (pre-DEP) iCloud backup that evening and after the iPad restored, the iPad showed it was offline in the MDM (not as 'not managed', which will show if the MDM profile is deleted, but offline). We checked the iPad again and the DEP profile was also gone! (There were no profiles on the device left) This shouldn't be the case, the DEP profile should be on the device even after he/she restored a backup. Doesn't the iPad activate (and connect to the iTunes buddy) after a restore from backup? Today we restored the iPad to factory settings, set it up as a new iPad and the DEP profile showed up as should.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Grab an (DEP-cabable) iPad \r\n2. Create an iCloud/iTunes backup BEFORE adding it to DEP.\r\n3. Add the iPad to the DEP portal\r\n4. After the iPad is connected to the MDM/DEP successfully (and the profiles are there), restore the iPad with the backup we created successfully\r\n5. All profiles are gone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDEP profile should be on the iPad even after a device restore from iTunes/iCloud backup\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDEP profile is gone from the device until the iPad is restored to factory settings and set-up as a new iPad"
