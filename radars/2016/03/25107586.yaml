    description: "Summary:\nCurrently Swift extensions are shown in the document items list with a [C] next to them, however extensions can be for types other than classes. Due to the increasing popularity of using extensions to separate protocol conformance, it would also be desirable to show any protocols that the extension conforms to in this list.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nCreate a new file with an extension:\n\nextension Thing: NSCoding {\n}\n\nDrop down the document items list.\n\nExpected Results:\nExtensions should show as either the correct type they are extending (E for enum, S for Struct etc) or it might be an idea to show them with an [E] next to them to show they are an extension. \n\nAs I described it would also be nice if the above extension declaration showed up as the following in the items list:\n\n[E] Thing: NSCoding\n\nto show that the extension to Thing conforms to NSCoding\n\n\n\nActual Results:\nIt is shown in the list as:\n\n[C] Thing"
