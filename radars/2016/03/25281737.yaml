    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a dynamic notification contains a group with insets containing a label, text in that label is often cut off by the bottom of the group. It seems that the text sizing system does not respect the group's insets.\r\n\r\nA similar issue has been reported in http://www.openradar.me/20789958, with the purported workaround of setting a fixed width on the label. However that fix does not work if the group has insets defined. The attached project reproduces this problem.\r\n\r\nI've also attached a screenshot from the simulator. The cropping is even worse on device as the simulator seems to add extra padding.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the Notification scheme of the attached app on the watch simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be padding below the text \"Juventus\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text \"Juventus\" hits the bottom of the group on the simulator. On device, the bottom half of the text \"Juventus\" is cropped out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.1 (13S661)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAltering the text fixes the bug, though there are other text values that will reproduce it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Simulator Screen Shot Mar 21, 2016, 4.43.30 PM.png' and 'watch-notification-layout-bug.zip' were successfully uploaded."
