    description: "Summary:\r\nIn tvOS 9.2, in a view controller that subclasses GCEventViewController and sets `controllerUserInteractionEnabled` to `false`, setting a closure for the `controllerPausedHandler` on a `GCController` causes the UI to 'navigate back'. According to all documentation and prior versions of tvOS this is not desired behaviour. With the `controllerUserInteractionEnabled` property set to `false`, the controller events should not be propagated to the responder chain and should not trigger UIKit actions such as dismissing modal view controllers or navigating back on a navigation stack.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an MFi game controller to an Apple TV running tvOS 9.2\r\n2. Present a modal view controller that subclasses GCEventViewController\r\n3. Set it's controllerUserInteractionEnabled to false\r\n4. Set a controllerPausedHandler closure\r\n5. Press the menu/pause button on the controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe closure set as the controllerPausedHandler should be executed and it's enclosed code should execute. There should be no back action, no dismissal of modally presented view controllers etc. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe closure is executed, but the modal view controller is also dismissed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.2, Xcode 7.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis undesirable behaviour also happens when using the Siri Remote in place of a game controller.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV, with a wireless MFi controller connected\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MenuButtonTest.zip' was successfully uploaded.
