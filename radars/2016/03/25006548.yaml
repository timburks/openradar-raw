    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you run an app that uses a WKWebView to show an HTML <select> field in Slide Over on an iPad (1/3 Width), you can not select an option value. Tapping the select field invokes a modal which does not dismiss when tapping a selection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open this page in Safari on your Mac:\r\nhttps://smilesoftware.com/temp/select.html\r\n2. Choose File -> Share -> Email This Page\r\n3. Send the mail to an account you can access on your iPad\r\n4. Launch any app other than Mail on your iPad\r\n5. Invoke Slide Over and choose Mail such that Mail is showing on the right hand 1/3 of your iPad\r\n6. Navigate to the mail you sent yourself in step #3\r\n7. Tap \"Jan\"\r\n\r\nA modal view appears with Jan - Dec\r\n\r\n8. Tap \"Sep\"\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nSep is selected and the modal view is dismissed\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe modal view disappears. Unclear whether Sep is selected or not.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced in an app with just a WKWebView, but it's easier to show you a way to do it in a shipping iOS app.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be reproduced using Safari, so try this:\r\n1. Change the Slide Over app to Safari\r\n2. Open this page:\r\nhttps://smilesoftware.com/temp/select.html\r\n3. Tap \"Jan\"\r\n\r\nThe selection appears in a modal popup view.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that it's possible to work around the WKWebView bug somehow.\r\n\r\nDTS begs to differ in response 636921784: \"Our engineers have reviewed your request and have determined that you are experiencing an issue for which there is no known workaround at this time.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the modal view to be dismissed after the selection is made.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nModal view remains after the selection is made, and user can no longer interact with app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's possible to reproduce this with a basic app with just a WKWebView, so I've tested with Xcode against up to iOS 9.3b4.\r\n\r\nThis bug is a duplicate of 23810163 and 22268487. Filed at behest of DTS exchange regarding workaround.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openradar.me/23810163\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini Retina (MF086LL/A)"
