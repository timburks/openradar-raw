    description: "Safari View Controller is fantastic, giving access to useful Safari features while using other apps. It is, however, very frustrating when I hold down on a link while reading an article—expecting to be able to open it in a background tab—only to get options to either load it in the current view, add it to reading list or copy it.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, when I use Safari View Controller, it’s because I’m reading some sort of long form article. Often, these articles will include citations and footnotes. When using Safari proper, I open many of these links as background tabs to view after I finish reading the article so I don’t lose my place and focus. True, I can tap the button to send the Safari View Controller page to the Safari app, but I lose my place in the process.\r\n\r\nSafari View Controller doesn't necessarily need to allow tab switching within itself. It would be fantastic even if I could just open a new tab in the Safari app in the background. This would preserve my place and focus within Safari View Controller."
