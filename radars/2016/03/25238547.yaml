    description: "Summary:\r\nNOTE to bug screener: Please do not return this wtih a request to collect Time Machine diagnostics. This is an abstract, philosophical request to consider a technical change to Time Machine. It doesn't have to do with my specific machine or backup material.\r\n\r\nA buzz went around my Twitter circles when Michael Tsai blogged about a \"trick\" to \"massively speed up\" Time Machine: \r\n\r\nhttp://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/03/16/massively-speed-up-time-machine-backups/\r\n\r\nAs an experiment I disabled the low priority support as outlined in the post, and was curious to know whether it would affect the massive performance problems I suffer when browsing Time Machine history from my OS X Server hosted network backup volume.\r\n\r\nIt did seem to massively improve that experience.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion to the Time Machine engineering team is:\r\n\r\nIf indeed I/O priority is throttled for Time Machine, please consider disabling that throttle or raising the priority *while browsing backups*. In this modal state it would seem like a reasonable thing to consume more of the computer's I/O capacity in the name of providing a more responsive user experience.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
