    description: "Apple Developer Relations\r\n11-Jan-2016 09:52 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback, it is noted. Engineering has determined that there are currently no plans to address this issue.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments about the resolution, please update your bug report with that information so we can respond.\r\n\r\nBrion Vibber\r\n30-Sep-2015 11:11 AM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Opus audio codec (RFC 6716) is one of the standard options for WebRTC audio channels, and is often used along with VP9 video in WebM media files.\r\n\r\nAt Wikipedia we are working on modernizing our media hosting infrastructure but have been tasked by our community to stick to non-patent-encumbered formats that have kept us away from AAC, AVC, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently we use Ogg Vorbis and a JavaScript decoder (for Safari) or native-code decoder for iOS/OSX native apps; updating to Opus will give us better bandwidth usage, but currently we'll still need the custom decoders for iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great help to us for native Opus decoding to be available through Darwin system frameworks on iOS and OS X, and then to have those exposed to web content in Safari.\r\n\r\nThe decoder is the most important; we'd even be happy with Opus in WebRTC or an MP4 container, though Matroska/WebM container support would be helpful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Try to open any Opus-encoded file (in Ogg or WebM/Matroska container) in Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected results: standard audio codec should work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual results: unrecognized file\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
