        Summary:
        If setHidden:YES has been called more than two times then setHidden:NO needs to be called more than once before the subview shows again.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UIStackView with a few arranged subviews
        2. Call setHidden:YES on one of the arranged subviews within an animation block
        3. Call setHidden:YES two more times
        4. Call setHidden:NO on the subview

        Expected Results:
        The subview is visible and isHidden returns NO

        Actual Results:
        The subview is still hidden and isHidden returns YES

        Regression:
        Tested on iPhone 6S and simulator running iOS 9.2.1
