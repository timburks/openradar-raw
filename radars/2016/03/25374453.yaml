    description: "In our secondary school/high-school we have a lot of classes (or called 'clusters'), which all appear in the Classroom app. Around 100/200 clusters. (Currently we only have entered 3 test classes, as the screenshot shows) \r\nBut it would be very handy to have a search feature in the 'My Classes' selection screen (so you can search for 'DV5F', instead of scrolling through that long list of classes!) And it would be quite handy to have something like a list of favourite classes.\r\n\r\nMaybe change the My Classes screen to show the teachers favourites and add a button in the navigation bar (top-left) to show a list of all classes (with search feature).\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nTeachers in our school (Revius Lyceum Doorn in The Netherlands) have their own (base) classes/clusters, but if a teacher is ill at home, some other teacher will take over that lesson and he/she also needs access to that class using the Classroom app, without asking the IT person first to assign that class to him/her (so she can see the class in the app). So what we want to do is assign all classes to all teachers and let the teachers choose which class they need at the time. Having favourites and a search feature makes that so much easier!"
