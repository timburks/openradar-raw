    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"music screensaver\" (currently playing track artwork) on Apple TV reverts from airplay to the Apple TV's music app when displayed, interrupting music being airplayed from a device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play music from Music app on Apple TV\r\n2. Pause the track on the Apple TV & return to the home screen (leaving the Music app running but paused in the background)\r\n3. Start playing a different track in the Music app on an iPhone\r\n4. Airplay the music from the phone to the TV\r\n5. Wait 30-45 seconds for the currently playing track screensaver to kick in on Apple TV\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAirplay continues playing the track from the phone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Apple TV kills the airplay session, pausing the music on the iPhone, and continues playing the track the Apple TV Music app was previously playing.\r\n\r\nIf I kill the music app on the Apple TV (double-click home button & flick app upwards to kill it), then airplay works solidly for a few hours from the phone playing music, regardless of the currently playing screensaver.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.1.1 (13U717) / iOS 9.3 (13E5231a) [Also happens on iOS 9.2 & 9.2.1]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 or iPad Mini 3 & Apple TV running tvOS 9.1.1"
