    description: "we have some .crash files for which there is not much information other than the \"Dyld Error Message:\" quoted below.\r\n\r\nin some cases, the crash recurs repeatedly on a device until the device is reset.\r\n\r\nwe are also experiencing some crashes in applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions: where either (a) an exception is thrown for a selector for a particular class when that selector is a known good selector in a class in an embedded .framework; or (b) an EXC_BAD_ACCESS occurs in a c-style function called from obj-c, where the function is a known good function, and normally exists, but belongs to an embedded .framework.  in both of these cases, it's as though the .framework does not load.  this is not reproducible on demand, merely the results of crash logs reported from the field.\r\n\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\nDyld Message: Library not loaded: @rpath/Decodable.framework/Decodable\r\n  Referenced from: /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/A9F0345B-9FFE-43DE-880F-20AF7BE616CF/Fabric.app/Fabric\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:\r\n\t/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/A9F0345B-9FFE-43DE-880F-20AF7BE616CF/Fabric.app/Frameworks/Decodable.framework/Decodable: mremap_encrypted() => -1, errno=12 for /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/A9F0345B-9FFE-43DE-880F-20AF7BE616CF/Fabric.app/Frameworks/Decodable.framework/Decodable\r\n\r\n\t/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/A9F0345B-9FFE-43DE-880F-20AF7BE616CF/Fabric.app/Frameworks/Decodable.framework/Decodable: mremap_encrypted() => -1, errno=12 for /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/A9F0345B-9FFE-43DE-880F-20AF7BE616CF/Fabric.app/Frameworks/Decodable.framework/Decodable\r\n  Dyld Version: 370.6\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nwe don't really have steps to reproduce.  the only way we know about it is that many, many end users run the app, and we get some number of crash reports, while the rest of our end users are able to run the code just fine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nusing a dyld or a .framework loads the framework in time for use, and doesn't crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsome crash reports are occurring."
