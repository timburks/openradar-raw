    description: "Summary:\r\nThe  Developer Member Center (https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/) won't let me invite people whose names include certain non-ASCII chars. For instance, my first name Sören and a colleague's last name Çakal don't get accepted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#singleinvite. Log in with a developer account if needed.\r\n2. In First Name: or Last Name:, type a name with non-ASCII chars. For instance: Sören, Çakal, Ździarski\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to proceed to entering an e-mail address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe field gets marked red, and an error message \"[First|Last] name is invalid\" appears. It is neither clarified why the name is \"invalid\" (e.g., list possible characters), nor should this limitation exist at all, for the sake of globalization."
