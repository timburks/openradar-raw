    description: "Related to Developer Tools Radar: 25440479\r\n\r\nBased on the Apple documentation on the \"shared iPad\" feature:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/education/shared-ipad/\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/ca/education/preview/\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/education/it/\r\n\r\nWe need to implement changes to our iPad app, related to user data, to support NSSupportsPurgeableLocalStorage and NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is not clear on how to test/debug this feature, on a real iPad or in the Simulator, if we are not an education partner or part of the documentation \"preview\". \r\n\r\n\r\nWe tried to request an invite to the educationpreview@apple.com, but we just received an automated email with links to documentation we already had. Also we are a developer based in Canada, so we might not be eligible for the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
