    description: "Summary:\r\nWith a trackpad you can swipe left or right to navigate to the previous and next files that you have been editing in a stack. This is a feature I rely on, and have built muscle memory upon over the years. \r\n\r\nWith the recent 7.3 update in Xcode, activating that feature freezes the UI and appears to make the application inaccessible to interaction of any kind. The app is still running but it does not accept input. You can use Quick Open, for example, but the selection doesn't actually work. Mouse taps and keyboard actions don't do anything. The only solution I can find at present is to quit and restart Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run Xcode.\r\n2. Swipe the trackpad to navigate to the next/previous file.\r\n3. Done.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac OS X El Capitan, 27-inch Retina iMac 5K"
