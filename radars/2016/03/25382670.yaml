    description: "Summary:\r\nI've got a Swift project which uses Cocoapods and has a few Cocoapods Objective-C dependencies. The rest is pure Swift.\r\n\r\nI'm using Xcode 7.3 (7D175) on iPhone 6s Plus (iOS 9.3) or the iPhone 6s 6.3 simulator. It's reproducible on both systems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce the issue please checkout this repository (github public):\r\nhttps://github.com/relayable/rel-client-ios\r\n\r\nNow switch to this revision:\r\n\r\ngit checkout b4524344cf2502cb986d9137263439b2bfbd993a\r\n\r\nThen try to build it using the Xcode mentioned above and run it on an iPhone 6s 9.3 simulator. You'll see a EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception be thrown at start\r\n\r\nNow checkout this revision:\r\n\r\ngit checkout 52180f484abd3a5642d3458c2240996baeec7571\r\n\r\nYou'll see that the app start correctly.\r\nIf you take a look at the diff you'll notice that `KeychainModel` is the first property in `RESTClient` and it crashes on runtime while it's a struct, now the second commit makes it an NSObject which lints the crash. \r\n\r\nThe bug can be reproduced (and linted) by going back to the first revision above, then adding an arbitrary property, e.g.:\r\n\r\nlet iAmUseless = \"\"\r\n\r\nas a first property in `RESTClient`, then the app also starts fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app starts independently of the first property's type.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app throws a runtime exception if a classes first property is of non-Objective-C type.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, Xcode 7.3 [7D175]\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nrelayable  29-03-2016, 7-54 AM.crash"
