        This is design and usability feedback only; from a technical perspective, the UI appears to work as intended.

        iOS devices have historically had terrible color rendering; white has always been the clear blue of an uncorrected and uncalibrated display. Therefore, I really like Night Shift, not because of the “doesn’t keep you awake at night” aspect, but because a small, always-on correction does a lot to neutralize the typical blue cast of an iPad or iPhone’s screen.

        In previous betas, I left Night Shift on all the time. But it seems that this option has been removed. I now have to awkwardly work around this using an always-on schedule. So part A of this feedback is: please bring back the “turn on and leave on forever” option!

        Ideally, I’d like a small correction during the day and a more significant shift at night. Currently, there is no way to achieve this effect automatically. So part B is:  allow the correction level for both the “off” state and the “on” state to be set. Yes, this would mean that Night Shift is always on in some sense. But if the default correction is zero, this could probably be worked into the UI without introducing additional complexity.

        I would imagine that Night Shift might have some power consumption implications, not only because it requires a mapping table, but also because the subjective brightness is lower at a given backlight level. Just to be clear, I’m totally OK with this. I’m willing to spend additional power on correcting the display.
