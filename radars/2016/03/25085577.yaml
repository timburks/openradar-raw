    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app is seeing sporadic crashes on launch when using dynamic libraries. This is only when running the app store release on device. \r\n\r\nThe problem is described in detail here: https://github.com/artsy/eigen/issues/1246\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere is no simple way to reproduce. It appears to happen on devices that are memory-constrained, as freeing up RAM on the device causes the app to no longer crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app doesn't crash on launch\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes and produces a log similar to the one attached to the radar:\r\n\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\nDyld Message: Library not loaded: @rpath/MoPub.framework/MoPub\r\n  Referenced from: /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/theScore\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:\r\n\t/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/Frameworks/MoPub.framework/MoPub: mremap_encrypted() => -1, errno=12 for /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/Frameworks/MoPub.framework/MoPub\r\n\r\n\t/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/Frameworks/MoPub.framework/MoPub: mremap_encrypted() => -1, errno=12 for /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/Frameworks/MoPub.framework/MoPub\r\n\r\n\t/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/5D64892C-E1A7-4BCE-9154-E28B397C7258/theScore.app/Frameworks/MoPub.framework/MoPub: mremap_encrypted() => -1, errno=12 for /private/var/mobil\r\n  Dyld Version: 370.6\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis only seems to occur on iOS 9.1 and greater.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor some reason the app will successfully launch when opened via a push notification (?!)."
