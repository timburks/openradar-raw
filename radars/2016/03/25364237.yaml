        Summary:
        Trying to edit certain view controllers in the Main storyboard file in the attached project (extracted from an active project and never modified outside Xcode) causes a lock icon to appear over the Xcode UI and prevents any editing. Meanwhile, the console is filled with “Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool” assertion failures.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached Xcode project
        2. Open Main.storyboard
        3. Attempt to edit or delete, for instance, the rightmost “String View Controller”

        Expected Results:
        The edits succeed, Xcode works normally

        Actual Results:
        A lock icon in an overlay HUD is shown, no changes are applied to the storyboard, and the system log is flooded with the following over 100 times per second:
        3/25/16 2:34:50.494 PM Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool[12715]: assertion failed: 15E65 13E230: libxpc.dylib + 27596 [66C28065-C9DB-3C8E-926F-5A40210A6D1B]: 0x8d

        Sometimes Xcode settles down and becomes responsive again until another item in the storyboard is edited. Sometimes it remains unresponsive until force quit.

        Regression:
        This problem appeared concurrently with Xcode 7.3, but I am also able to reproduce it on Xcode 7.2.1. I am not sure if it is related to system tools included with Xcode 7.3 that are also used by 7.2.1 or not.

        Notes:
        The attached storyboard includes references to classes that are not included with the project, but the problem persists in the original project as well.
