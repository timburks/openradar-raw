    description: "Summary:\r\nUIStackView documentation lists simple use cases for stack view layout under Common Stack View Layouts: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIStackView_Class_Reference/index.html\r\n\r\nThe first bullet of that section describes two labels in a horizontal stack view pinned to the corner of the view, such that the stack view hugs the labels. I've reproduced that layout in a sample project and added another stack view pinned to the opposite corner. In such a basic case, Interface Builder is producing unresolvable layout warnings. I believe this has something to do with Xcode running in Hi-DPI mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 7.3.\r\n2. Open the attached sample project.\r\n3. Open View.xib in Interface Builder\r\n4. Observe that the constraints pin the left stack view 50 points from the top and left pin the right stack view 50 points from the bottom and right.\r\n5. Observe the layout warnings. Try to resolve them by updating frames of the stack view and subviews.\r\n6. Run the app in the simulator. Observe that layout is correct at runtime.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInterface Builder should be able to resolve every warning with these constraints by updating frames.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI was unable to resolve every warning. When I updated frames on one view, another view would gain new warnings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug reliably occurs when I launch Xcode after configuring my primary display at a Hi-DPI resolution. A reliable workaround is to configure my primary display with a @1x resolution before launching Xcode.\r\nI think I observed a similar issue in Xcode 7.2.1, but I was new to stack views and thought it was my fault at the time.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.4.\r\nMy secondary display is configured for the default resolution for a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), which is a Hi-DPI mode.\r\nMy primary display is a Dell p2715q configured to 1920x1080@2x, connected by DisplayPort."
