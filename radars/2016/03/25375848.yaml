    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari should support \"Content-Encoding: br\" for better performance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLoad a resource that is brotli-encoded, e.g. https://bayden.com/test/brotliimg.aspx\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect: resource displays properly after being decompressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nResource fails to render\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBrotli is a new compression format supported by Firefox and Chrome; it's the underlying compression engine used by WOFF2 as well. It offers 15-20% better compression than gzip with low CPU requirements and thus is ideal for textual web content like CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Serverside implementations are available and leading edge CDNs now support it. \r\n\r\nhttps://textplain.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/brotli/\r\nhttp://caniuse.com/#search=brotli\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Safari, Mac OS X Safari."
