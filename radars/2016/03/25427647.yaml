        Summary:
        I have smart playlists that filter to a specific play count. As I play songs in that playlist, their play counts are going up from 1 to 2, and all are remaining in the playlist.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a Smart Playlist with the condition Play Count = 1 that contains 90 songs
        2. Start playing songs on the list
        3. Wait for 10 songs to finish playing

        Expected Results:
        The playlist only contains 80 songs

        Actual Results:
        The playlist contains all 90 songs, eventually going down.

        Regression:
        Older versions of iTunes didnâ€™t do this. Not sure if it was introduced in 12.3.x or earlier, though
