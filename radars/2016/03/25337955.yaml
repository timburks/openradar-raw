    description: "Summary:\n\nUICollectionViewController supports animated cell selection via its selectItemAtIndexPath:animated: method. The “animated” parameter is however not conveyed to the selected UICollectionViewCell. Instead just the regular setSelected: method is called, regardless if the selection was to be animated or not. If the selection is animated, the method is called inside a UIView animation block. \n\nWhile this works in some cases, there are other cases, where the implicit animations that UIView animation blocks provide do not suffice (complex custom CAAnimations). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nNot needed / apparent form the API. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nThere should be a setSelected:animated: method on UICollectionViewCell that could be used instead of setSelected: if needed.\n\nActual Results:\n\nOnly setSelected: is available via public API.\n\nRegression:\n\nAll iOS versions. \n\nNotes:\n\nThere is an existing private UICollectionViewCell method named _setSelected:animated:. This one creates the animation block and calls through to setSelected:. That might just need to loose that _ prefix. \n\nThere a ways to determine if we’re currently inside an animation block. However some of those methods are not available on all but the most recent iOS versions and others can cause serious problems (e.g., rdar://25337014)."
