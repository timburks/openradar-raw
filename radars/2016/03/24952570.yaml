    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a view controller that prefers the status bar hidden over a view controller that prefers the status bar visible, the status bar is hidden/shown without animation.\r\n\r\nThis is the same the other way around, when presenting a view controller that prefers the status bar visible over a view controller that prefers the status bar hidden.\r\n\r\nThis has 2 implications:\r\n1. This doesn't look good, the UI looks like it 'jumps'.\r\n2. In custom transitions, calculating view coordinates can be off by the status bar height (+- 20pt).\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs in iOS 9.3, the status bar animates properly in prior versions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a view controller that prefers the status bar visible\r\n2. Create a second view controller that prefers the status bar hidden\r\n3. Present one of the 2 view controllers over the other.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status bar should hide/show in an animated fashion.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe status bar hides/shows without animation."
