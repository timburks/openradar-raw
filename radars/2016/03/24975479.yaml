    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a generic struct (WeakContainer<T>) where the generic type needs to inherit from AnyObject, it can't be created by passing a protocol (declared with inheriting from `class`) for the generic type T, although no other object than one that inherits from AnyObject can implement said protocol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a generic type (e.g. struct WeakContainer<T: AnyObject>) with a generic type that needs to inherit from AnyObject\r\n2. Create a protocol which inherits from class (e.g. MyDelegate: class).\r\n3. Try to declare a variable of the generic type passing the protocol as generic parameter (e.g. WeakContainer<MyDelegate>)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should work without any errors since the only objects which are able to implement the protocol (e.g. MyDelegate) are classes which also implement AnyObject.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead Xcode shows an error stating that the protocol can't be used as a concrete type conforming to AnyObject. (e.g.: Using 'MyDelegate' as concrete type conforming to protocol 'AnyObject' is not supported)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.2.1 (7C1002)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA playground has been attached showing the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
