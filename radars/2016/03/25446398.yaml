    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iTunes with Apple Music subscriptions or music saved onto your Mac. If you select an album and press the \"Add To Playlist\" button next to the Albums name via the 3 dotted button and choose \"New Playlist\", a new playlist is created with all the songs listed inside the playlist and after a few seconds the individual songs are removed but the playlist remains.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Select an Album (either from Apple Music or your Library)\r\n3. Press the (***) button next to the albums name\r\n4. Choose \"Add To Playlist\"\r\n5. Choose \"New Playlist\" from the next menu shown\r\n6. You are taken to the newly created playlist; watch them disappear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you add an entire album to a new playlist the expectation is that all songs from the album would remain in the playlist until manually removed by the user. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen an entire album is added to a new playlist, after a few seconds the individual songs are removed from the playlist but the Playlist remains.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.12.3.17, Mac OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you create a playlist from an individual song, or drag-and-drop individual songs to a new playlist, the issue does not occur. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" (MacBookPro11,3) 16GB RAM, OS X 10.11.4"
