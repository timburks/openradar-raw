    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the additional notes section below I've linked to my github project which nicely formats the various conditions that I'm talking about here. It can also be found in the README of the project zip I attached.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that UITableViewController (or UIScrollView) isn't allowing the contentOffset to be properly used when (1) the estimatedRowHeight is set to a fixed number (as opposed to UITableViewAutomaticDimension) and (2) there aren't enough cells on screen to fill the entire display.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to hide the search bar above the navigation controller until the user pulls down on it (just like the Mail app). I'm setting the contentOffset and that works almost all the time except in the case that there aren't enough cells to fill the screen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in my project I'm using custom cells and to have them layout properly I have to set a fixed height for estimatedRowHeight in order for auto layout to properly lay them out.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think there is one, possibly two, bugs (my main concern and this radar is for the first one):\r\n\r\n1. ScrollView doesn't behave properly when the contentOffset is set, there aren't enough cells to fill the screen, and a fixed height is being used for estimatedRowHeight.\r\n2. Autolayout isn't properly laying out custom cells when estimatedRowHeight is set to UITableViewAutomaticDimension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile app for iPhone 6 (this is just to make sure the screen is small enough to see the formatting issues)\r\n\r\nProblem 1:\r\n2. Click on \"Basic Cells\" > \"Few w/o automaticDimension...\"\r\n\r\nProblem 2:\r\n3. Go back and click on \"Custom Cells\" > \"Few w/ automaticDimension\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProblem 1: Expected the search bar to be hidden\r\n\r\nProblem 2: Expected text in the last cell to be wrapped\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProblem 1: Search bar is displayed\r\n\r\nProblem 2: Text in the last cell is cut off at one line"
