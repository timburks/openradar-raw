    description: "Summary:\r\nA xib file from an older OS X Mac app that I'm updating to require modern tools has a xib file that poses problems for Xcode 7.3. Although 7.3 is able to open and edit the xib file without complaint, any save to the xib file produces a file that is no longer openable, causing an unarchiving exception to be logged to the console.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached Preferences.xib in 7.3.\r\n2. Save to commit automatic updates Xcode has made to the xib.\r\n3. Reopen the saved xib in 7.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSaves should round-trip from 7.3 and be re-openable. The poor innocent xib should suffer no harm.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe xib has been corrupted such that it can no longer be opened. Xcode declares an error:\r\n\r\nThe document \"Preferences copy.xib\" could not be opened. The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.apple.InterfaceBuilder error -1.)\r\n\r\nThe console log shows:\r\n\r\n3/25/16 10:20:19.172 AM Xcode[31399]: -[NSTaggedPointerString string]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3015\r\n3/25/16 10:20:19.172 AM Xcode[31399]: Exception raised while unarchiving document objects - -[NSTaggedPointerString string]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3015\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Preferences.xib' was successfully uploaded."
