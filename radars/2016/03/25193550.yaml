    description: "Summary:\nWhen viewing an artist’s page in Apple Music with iTunes there is a section for Top Songs. Playing a song here enqueues the rest of the tracks listed. You can drill down to the Top Songs page, which often lists more tracks. Playing a song from this dedicated Top Songs page does not enqueue the rest of the tracks.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSearch for a new artist\nView artist page\nHover over the album art\nClick the play button \nNotice that all Top Songs are enqueued to Up Next\n\nClear everything\nView artist page\nClick Top Songs link\nView Top Songs page\nHover over the album art\nClick the play button \nNotice that all Top Songs are enqueued to Up Next\n\nExpected Results:\nNo matter which list of tracks you’re playing the rest should always be enqueued.\n\nActual Results:\nThere is inconsistency between these pages: On the artist page they are enqueued, but on the Top Songs page they are not.\n\nNotes:\nI was trying to listen to the Manic Street Preachers’ fuller list of Top Songs."
