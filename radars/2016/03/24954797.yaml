        Summary:
        Three times now, on reboot of my machine my “Reduce transparency” setting in Accessibility has been cleared. The first time I noticed happened after the reboot when upgrading 10.11.2 to 10.11.3, it has happened one other time the details of which I don’t recall, and this time I rebooted because Xcode was hanging while trying to compile my xcdatamodel.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Not sure. I don’t believe it’s happening every reboot.

        Expected Results:
        I expect settings configured in System Preferences to persist across reboots.
