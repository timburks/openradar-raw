    description: "Summary:\nSearching for an app by it's bundle identifier from the main search at the top of \"My apps\" will filter correctly by bundle identifier and/or app name. When accessing an app and selecting the name to get the mini search popover, using this search functionality will only search by app name and not bundle identifier resulting in an inconsistent experience.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open iTunes Connect\n2. Go to \"My apps\"\n3. Type in the bundle identifier for an app that is in your account\n4. Witness that app is visible\n5. Select any app \n6. Select the app name in the nav bar at the top of the page to activate the search drop down/app list\n7. Type the same bundle identifier\n8. See that no results are found\n\nExpected Results:\nResults should contain apps with the bundle identifier\n\nActual Results:\nNo results are returned"
