    description: "Summary:\r\nThe visual debugger fails because of an assertion in UIKit's UITextView when auto layout is not used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun sample in Xcode 7.3. Select view debugger. Observe assertion in the log and no working view debugger.\r\n\r\n2016-03-23 10:05:17.963 AutoLayoutViewDebuggingIssue[83786:1782898] *** Assertion failure in -[UITextView _firstBaselineOffsetFromTop], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/UIKit_Sim/UIKit-3512.60.7/UITextView.m:1683\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView debugger should work. Nothing should throw up in the log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSadness. No view debugger. Me going back to Reveal, then getting curious and spending an hour on this radar :)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work, could be a regression in Xcode 7.3 OR in UIKit 9.3? I’ve checked my decompiles for UIKit and it doesn’t seem like it’s a recent UIKit change, so pretty sure it’s a recent Xcode change instead.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee my workaround in ViewController.m via adding useless constraints to satisfy the check in the method that asserts. Rather not do that but don’t see another way."
