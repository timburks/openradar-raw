        Summary:
        Closing the virtual keyboard with an attached inputAccessoryView + rotating the iPad: inputAccessoryView remains in view-hierarchy

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached project
        2. Execute it on a simulator / iOS device
        3. Tap into the text-view
        4. You should now see the virtual keyboard with a red view attached as inputAccessoryView
        5. Tap the key in the keyboard to close the virtual keyboard and rotate the iPad
        6. The viewcontrollers view itself should be OK now, but when you rotate the iPad again, you should still see the red inputAccesoryView beyond the view
        7. Leave the app by pressing the home-button
        8. Re-enter the app by tapping the icon on the springboard
        9. The inputAccessoryView should now be visible

        Expected Results:
        The inputAccessoryView should no longer be existent at all, neither should it be visible below the viewcontrollers view nor it should be visible when the app is re-entered.

        Actual Results:
        It seems like that the inputAccessoryView is not removed like it should.

        Regression:
        Only thing i know is that it also didnâ€™t work properly in iOS 9.2.
