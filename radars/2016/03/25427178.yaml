    description: "I used the \U0001F62D emoji in an IM conversation, and got this response:\r\n\r\n> I wish you could Quick Look emoji, I have no idea what that face is.\r\n\r\nThat's a fantastic idea! I tried ⌃⌘D when hovering over the emoji, but the \"define\" popover just says \"No Results Found\". I would love to see a few things:\r\n\r\n• A larger representation of the glyph. Emoji can often be hard to see, especially on non-retina displays, and/or with small fonts.\r\n• The Unicode name of the glyph, in this case \"Loudly crying face\".\r\n• Some details about meaning/context/synonyms. For example: http://emojipedia.org/loudly-crying-face/\r\n\r\nOS X offers details from Wikipedia today, surely Emojipedia isn't out of the question. \U0001F603"
