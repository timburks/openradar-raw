    description: "Summary:\r\nI was trying to get Xcode to reveal the location of a playground document, so I cmd-clicked in the Playground's document name in the title bar area of a window, and dragged as if to select from the popup that might appear. Instead of a popup appearing, the window shrinks down as if to arrange it in \"Spaces\" or something, and after releasing Xcode crashes shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nThis is 100% reproducable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new playground document, e.g. \"MyPlayground\" and save it.\r\n2. Hold the command key and click in \"MyPlayground.playground\" in the title bar area of the playground window.\r\n3. Hold the click down and drag causing a miniature version of the window to appear.\r\n4. Drag it around and then let go.\r\n5. Wait a few moments and Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWell, I expected to get a popup to reveal the document ;)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrazy micro window dragging and a crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Xcode_2016-03-25-131423_Macho.crash' was successfully uploaded."
