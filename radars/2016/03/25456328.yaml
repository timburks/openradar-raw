    description: "Summary:\r\nMy wife is in my address book with her phone number and email address. I have her number starting with the country code (+1). Some iMessages I've written to her on my Mac, others on my iPhone. On the Mac, they're properly threaded all together. On my iPhone, I have two separate threads (see attachment, esp. [Redacted]). I cannot tell what addresses or numbers are used by the threads, I'd love to be able to, might help to figure out why they're separate. But it looks like some are to her email address, and some are to a phone number. On the Mac, Messages thinks her phone number does not include the country code. I added a second phone number for her to her Contacts card, without the +1 prefix, but they're still separately threaded. I can't tell what might be the difference between the two threads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Exchange messages with a single recipient on OS X and iOS, perhaps using different addresses and/or phone numbers.\r\n2. Look at how messages are threaded.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMessages exchanged with a single recipient should appear in a single thread on iOS and OS X if all recipient addresses and phone numbers (with or without the country code) are included contact card for that recipient.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages exchanged with a single recipient appear in one thread when on OS X, but two threads on iOS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n13E233\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iOS 9.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_2159.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
