        As both desktop and mobile devices (e.g. iMac and iPad Pro) are starting to get wider color gamuts, it would be advantageous for the developer to be able to select a color gamut in the Responsive Web Design Mode.

        The current pop-up menu with 1x, 2x and 3x affects the media query for the device pixel ratio. I propose another pop-up that would let the user select “sRGB”, “DCI-P3” and “Rec. 2020” to adjust the media query for “color-gamut”. This would let the developer check their media queries.

        Changing the pop-up could also alter the display profile used by Safari. Of course, the color rendition would not be correct if the developer was using an sRGB display and selected “DCI-P3”. But the relative color renditions would be the same. You can get an approximation of how this feature could work by using System Preferences > Display > Color and switching between “sRGB” and “Display P3” while viewing a page in Safari.

        In addition, it would be very helpful for developers who target platforms without any color management at all *cough* Android *cough* to disable ColorSync while rendering. This would also aid developers on iOS who are targeting devices prior to iOS 9.3 and want to see how wider gamut images will be rendered.
