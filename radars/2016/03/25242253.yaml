    description: "Summary:\r\nThe app I work on requires a shipping address when checking out with Apple Pay but does not require shipping methods because it is a delivery service so there is no shipping. However, when implementing the `didSelectShippingContact` delegate of `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` if it returns `[]` for shipping methods, then PassbookUI crashes with the attached log.\r\n\r\nSample project as well is here https://github.com/keithnorm/apple-pay-crash\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. either download and configure my sample project to work with your apple pay merchant, or create a basic apple pay button that opens a `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController` whose delegate implements this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    func paymentAuthorizationViewController(controller: PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController, didSelectShippingContact contact: PKContact, completion: (PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus, [PKShippingMethod], [PKPaymentSummaryItem]) -> Void) {\r\n        completion(.Success, [], [PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: \"summary 1\", amount: 10.0)])\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. run the app, hit \"Buy with Apple Pay\"\r\n3. select shipping address, hit back\r\n4. Apple Pay modal crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally returning an empty array for shipping methods would not crash and would not render an empty row in the apple pay modal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncrashes on 9.2, renders empty row on other versions"
