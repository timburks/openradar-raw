    description: "Summary:\r\nThe virtual-keyboards leak memory, some of them more, some of them less. When they leaked too much, the app crashes due to low memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project\r\n2. Perform it on an iPad, preferably on an iPad 3 (on Retina Devices it leaks more memory than on non-Retina devices, and the iPad 3 only has 512MB Ram) \r\n3. Tap on the textfield\r\n4. To crash the app the fastest way, select the “Chinese (Simplified) - Handwriting”-keyboard. I didn’t try all the keyboards, Emoji seemed fine on the first look.\r\n5. Rotate the iPad until it crashes\r\n\r\nYou may use the “testCrash”-UI-test that is contained inside the app that rotates the iPad constantly.\r\nI also attached a screenshot of instruments, as the keyboard has eaten up 3GB inside our app until the App crashed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVirtual keyboards should not leak memory. It is fine that they cash their appearance once, but it is no ok that they don’t release old memory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOver the time, they eat more and more space until they may crash your app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
