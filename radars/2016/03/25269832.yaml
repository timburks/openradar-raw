    description: The only reason I can't leave Chrome is its custom search engines. I have tons of search engines for lots of internal tools at my job, and I have shortcuts for things like 'weather' (which immediately pulls up the NWS's page for Boston). I'd like a similar feature in Safari, at which point I'd ditch Chrome for good. I use Mobile Safari on my phone, so I'd like to switch to it on OS X in any case.
