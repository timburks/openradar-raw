    description: "Disk Utility's erase sheet has two typos:\r\n\r\n1. The first sentence should read \"....destroy all of the data.\" It currently transposes \"all\" and \"of.\"\r\n2. \"Enter a name, choose a format\" is a comma splice. Break it into two sentences or use a semicolon.\r\n\r\nAn image can be seen here: http://d.pr/i/17h4X\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Disk Utility.\r\n2. Select a drive.\r\n3. Hit the Erase button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDialog boxes — especially when talking about erasing data — should be crystal-clear to understand.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe language is full of errors, making it confusing and makes the user wonder what else is wrong in Disk Utility."
