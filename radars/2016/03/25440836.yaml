        Summary:
        Prior to Xcode 7.1ish, one could discard unneeded breakpoints by dragging the breakpoint's icon from the breakpoint navigator into an empty space. Later versions require the user to drag the breakpoint's label, and in fact until I started composing this radar I didn't even realize it was possible.

        Please restore the ability to drag a breakpoint by its icon. It is far more intuitive than dragging the label.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. create a breakpoint
        2. open the breakpoint navigator (CMD-7)
        3. try to click and drag on the breakpoint icon

        Expected Results:
        Breakpoint icon is draggable

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens

        Regression:
        I believe this was broken in Xcode 7.1
