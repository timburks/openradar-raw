    description: "The more passes you add to Wallet, the more it will eventually get clogged up with expired passes that you definitely don't want and even can't use again in the future. Deleting the expired passes requires four clicks, which means that deleting several expired passes takes a long time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpired passes should be moved in some kind of archive folder automatically."
