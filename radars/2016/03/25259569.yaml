    description: "Summary:\r\nAbsolute links (http://example.com) in Mobile Safari do not open any more for me. Relative links (such as /page.html or page.html) still work.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation and looking at the system log of the iPhone, I find that swcd is constantly crashing, every 10 seconds below errors are in the log. Unfortunately, there is no crashlog available.\r\n\r\nswcd seems to be the shared web credentials daemon, and it might play a role in opening links, which doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nSyslog snippet:\r\n\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S diagnosticd[90] <Error>: error evaluating process info - pid: 1023, punique: 1023\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S ReportCrash[1024] <Notice>: Formulating report for process[1023] swcd\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.swcd) <Notice>: Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds.\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S UserEventAgent[26] <Notice>: jetsam: kernel termination snapshot being created\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S ReportCrash[1024] <Warning>: report not saved because it is non-actionable\r\nMar 20 01:07:21 Alexs-iPhone-6S ReportCrash[1025] <Warning>: report not saved because the limit of 25 for 298 logs has been reached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open Mobile Safari or Chrome\r\n2. search for anything with DuckDuckGo or Google\r\n3. tap on a link in the search results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLink opens, new page is shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. Only the tapped link is underlined and the address bar (if previously minimized because one has scrolled down on the page) shows, but it does not show the new link or page, no progress bar, nothing.\r\n\r\nTap and hold (to get the options like \"Open in new tab\"), Safari freezes. This part works in Chrome.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAsked for help here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231581/safari-on-ios-9-2-1-wont-open-links\r\n\r\nI have the impression this appeared after a couple of app updates. About 20, too many to pin point one, release notes no help. A day before that, I noticed the new Wikipedia app version, which started to support deep linking, aka open all wikipedia.org in the app instead of Safari. After I had the problem, I uninstalled the Wikipedia app, to no success.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S 128GB MKR72LL/A"
