    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS simulator 9.3, the UIDevice method \"identifierForVendor\" does not consistently return the same value if called at the beginning of the app lifetime from a background thread. If called in the background near app startup, it returns a different value then it does when called on the main thread or when called in the background at a later point in the app lifetime.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the attached code in an app's AppDelegate.\r\n2. Run on a iOS Simulator 9.3.\r\n3. Observe the two printed values are different.\r\n\r\nNote that the values printed will be the same if you either uncomment the sleep or run on iOS simulator <= 9.2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the simulator, vendor id should be the same on every call in a single app launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe value returned early in the app life on a background thread is different then when called later or when called on the main thread.\r\n\r\nattachment:\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\r\n{\r\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{\r\n//        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1];\r\n        NSLog(@\"vendor id background: %@\", [[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]);\r\n        \r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    NSLog(@\"vendor id: %@\", [[[UIDevice currentDevice] identifierForVendor] UUIDString]);\r\n    return YES;\r\n}"
