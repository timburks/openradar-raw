    description: "Please implement an API in tvOS to query and enforce HDCP status directly. This API would allow apps to play DRM-encoded video on the Apple TV which cannot be played with AVPlayer/FairPlay.\r\n\r\nWith an API for HDCP, an Apple TV app can implement the DTCP-IP specification and become DTLA certified to play DRM-encoded video. Such video is usually sourced from a networked cable/antenna tuner on the local network, and requires a custom video player as it is not compatible with the codecs supported by AVPlayer.\r\n\r\nA similar private API currently exists in MPAVController as `BOOL shouldEnforceHDCP`"
