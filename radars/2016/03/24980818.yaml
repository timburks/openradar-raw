        Summary:
        The Keychain Access password dialog cannot be pasted into and the password generator cannot be copied from.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Keychain Access
        2. Select a private key
        3. Select File->Export Items
        4. Pick a destination
        5. Try to paste a password into the password dialog (you can't)
        6. Swear under your breath
        7. Click the Key icon to bring up the password generator
        8. Try to copy the generated password (you can't)
        9. Try to drag the generated password (you can't)

        Expected Results:
        You absolutely should be able to paste text into a password dialog. At the very least you should be able to copy a generated password and get it into the password dialog somehow.

        Actual Results:
        As described above. It's impossible to add a password without manually typing it twice.

        Regression:
        I don't know at what point this changed but both of these behaviors used to work.
