    description: "Summary:\n\nCode provided by Fix-It does not compile \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nThe following code results in the error (see attached screenshots):\n\n    if let item = item as? String\n    {\n        // self.wormlog.log(\"Got item as string: \\(item)\")\n    }\n\n(There was code in a conditional that was commented out.)\n\nThe suggested, incorrect, Fix-It is:\n\nif (m as? String) != nil\n\nWhich results in the error:\n\nUse of unresolved identifier 'm'"
