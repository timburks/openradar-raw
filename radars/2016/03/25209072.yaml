        Summary:
        In HomeKit there is a certain security-based category of accessories that automatically provider banner feedback when their state changes. This should be extended to allow users to be notified when user-defined conditions are met by the state of accessories in their home.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a valid instance of `HMActionSet`
        2. Select the option to be notified when the action has been completed
        3. Notice there is no option to be notified


        Expected Results:
        Users should be allowed to be notified when an action set has completed

        Actual Results:
        Users do not have the option to be notified
