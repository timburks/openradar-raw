    description: "Summary:\r\nAsking Siri to send a tweet and then including the word “Siri” in the tweet body causes Siri to try to parse the tweet as a command.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Plug in your iPhone (maybe optional?)\r\n2. Activate Siri and say “send a tweet”\r\n3. When Siri asks what you want to tweet, say “Can I ask Siri about directions to my next appointment?”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should ask the user to confirm that the tweet should be “Can I ask Siri about directions to my next appointment?”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri tries to parse the tweet body as a command and will, for example, check your calendar for future appointments."
