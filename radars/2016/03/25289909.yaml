        Summary:
        The MKMapSnapshot/UIImage created by MKMapSnapshotter doesn’t align exactly with a MKMapView with the same MKMapCamera.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Xcode, create a new iOS single view project.
        2. Add both a MKMapView and UIImageView to the view.
        3. Create a MKMapCamera, and set the MKMapView’s camera property.
        4. Create your MKMapSnapshotOptions using the same MKMapCamera.
        5. Create the MKMapSnapshotter and start the snapshot.
        6. When the snapshot is rendered, set the image to the UIImageView’s image property.

        Expected Results:
        In a side-by-side comparison, the map region of both the image and map views are exactly the same.

        Actual Results:
        There is a slight offset between the image and the map view.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Please see attached sample project (screenshot included in root of archive of issue on iPhone 6, running iOS 9.3).
