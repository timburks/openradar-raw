        This was resolved in 10.11.0 and 10.11.1, but is now reproduce-able in 10.11.2 and 10.11.3

        Summary:

        Attempting to bind to Active Directory when in a AD site that contains a RODC as the primary DNS server for the site results in a failure to bind to active directory with an unknown error being reported by directory utility.


        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install OS X and update to latest shipping version (10.11.3)
        2. Attempt to bind to AD from a AD site that has a RODC as primary DNS server
        3. Directory Utility fails with unknown error (10001) If using the CLI and dsconfigad to bind, the output is dsconfigad: The plugin encountered an error processing request. (10001)
        The exit code for dsconfigad is 70


        Expected Results:

        As per previous OS version 10.11.0 and 10.11.1 and 10.8.5, AD Plugin should attempt to locate a RWDC in the DNS service records and bind to that RWDC


        Actual Results:

        Directory Utility reports an unknown error and the bind is unsuccessful
        dsconfigad also reports an error and returns error code 70 and the following error message to stdout: dsconfigad: The plugin encountered an error processing request. (10001)


        Regression:

        10.7.0 - > 10.7.2 exhibited this issue, however 10.7.3 resolved the issue. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202278
        10.8.x does NOT exhibit this issue at all.
        10.9.0 -> 10.9.5 DOES exhibit this issue
        10.10.0 -> 10.10.5 (14F25a) DOES exhibit this issue
        10.11 betaâ€™s do NOT exhibit this issue
        10.11.0 does NOT exhibit this issue
        10.11.1 does NOT exhibit this issue
        10.11.2 and 10.11.3 DOES exhibit this issue


        Notes:

        Attached open directory debug log for the period of time during a bind attempt
        Note the site this machine is binding in to is called Mount Warrigal PS and the RODC server for this site is 4395dip000dc001.detnsw.win with IP address 10.158.176.34
