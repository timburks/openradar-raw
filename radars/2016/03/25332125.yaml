    description: "Summary:\r\nSyncing music with Watch is broken. Watch.app is displaying Syncing... 99% and stocks in this state. At this state, on watch itself, music metadata is being displayed correctly but all music is greyed out and not playing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect Watch to power.\r\n2. Launch Watch.app on phone.\r\n3. Navigate to Music > Synced Playlist\r\n4. Select playlist (Apple Music is on, all songs on are on phone/downloaded).\r\n5. \"Sync Pending...\" appeared.\r\n6. In a moment \"Sync Pending...\" becomes \"Syncing... 99%\".\r\n7. Nothing else happens, watch is displaying metadata of music but all songs are disabled (greyed out).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Syncing... X%\" should progress, and upon finishing music should be available for playback on Watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEverything jumps immediately to \"Syncing... 99%\" (without progress) and everything stops here. (App and devices are responsive, but nothing else happens.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2.2 (13V144), Stainless Steel.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMusic size limit is set to 1GB, playlist attempted to sync is 605MB\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E234), iPhone 6S Plus"
