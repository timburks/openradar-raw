    description: "Summary:\r\nPhotos app on iOS devices saps all available upstream bandwidth when backing up photos to the iCloud Photo Library. This effectively neuters the network for all other devices as they have trouble communicating anything upstream to initiate downloads, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave photos/videos on an iOS device not yet uploaded, iCloud Photo Library enabled, wifi enabled, and plug it in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe upload should not use ALL available upload bandwidth. If possible, it should determine the max and dial it back a few notches.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt uses all the upstream bandwidth.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPhotos.app on the Mac at least has the ability to pause for a day, so that would be at least a minimum level of improvement. Scheduling and bandwidth throttling would be ideal."
