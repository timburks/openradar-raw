    description: "Summary:\nUsing xcodebuild 7.3 (Build version 7D175), I am now unable to run tests in certain situations.\n\nMy tests were executing fine with Xcode 7.2\n\nWhen running the following command:\n\nxcodebuild -scheme 'MMEcommSDK' -project 'MMEcommSDK/UAEcommSDK.xcodeproj' -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=AB1B7477-BA8B-45C0-90EE-CD889E0D49A0' build test \n\nI get the following error along with a simulator that appears to never finish launching (it shows a black screen forever).\n\niPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.\n\nIf I remove `build` from that command list, and run \n\nxcodebuild -scheme 'MMEcommSDK' -project 'MMEcommSDK/MMEcommSDK.xcodeproj' -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=AB1B7477-BA8B-45C0-90EE-CD889E0D49A0' test \n\nThe simulator correctly launches and my tests pass. Note that when this command finishes, the simulator is left open. I can then rerun the original `build test` command, and it passes.\n\n\nI have attached a zip file containing a few logs:\n- fastlane_console.log: The terminal output for running fastlane\n- Simulator_Diagnostic_Log.log: The diagnostic log referenced in the fastlane output\n- Xcodebuild.log: The raw log generated by xcodebuild.\n\nI’ve been able to confirm the following:\n* This is not a fastlane problem, since I can resort to running purely xcodebuild commands, and generate the failure\n* This doesn’t happen on all of my machines, just a few.\n* I can work around this issue for now by removing the build command\n* The simulator UUID I’m passing into Xcode build is correct. (An iPhone 6s 9.3 Simulator)\n\nThere are other people reporting similar issues in this thread:\nhttps://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/3921"
