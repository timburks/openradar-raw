    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a development build of our iOS app on a real device, from Xcode, with the debugger attached, we often get error `-34018` when trying to read from the keychain.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the issue described in this thread on the Developer Forums: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4743\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen our app launches, we want to read a saved authorization token from the keychain, so we can connect to our server.  We do this on the main thread, directly within `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSuccessfully read from the keychain, to get the saved auth token.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe get error -34018\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnce we hit this error, it seems all attempt to access the keychain will fail (with the same error).\r\n\r\nIf we simply relaunch the app, it will often succeed.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
