        Summary:
        Currently structs are shown in the document items list with a [C] next to them.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new file with a struct:

        struct Thing {
        }

        Drop down the document items list.

        Expected Results:
        Structs should be distinguishable from classes. Probably using [S] for struct and keeping [C] for class.

        Actual Results:
        Structs and classes are both shown with a [C] next to them.
