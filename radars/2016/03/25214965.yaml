    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Xcode feature where ‘Open Quickly…’ shows the Swift generated interface when opening an Objective-C header from a Swift file is more annoying than useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project with mixed Objective-C and Swift source.\r\n2. Open a Swift source file in the editor.\r\n3. Use ‘Open Quickly…’ (shift-cmd-O) to open an Objective-C header file (I guess it could be a C header file too).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor the editor to show the Objective-C header file I opened. So I can read the code I wrote, and edit it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode shows the Swift interface generated from the Objective-C header file. This is annoying because:\r\n\r\n- I can’t edit the code.\r\n- It’s easier to find my way around when what I see is exactly what I wrote.\r\n- Generating the Swift interface is not as quick as opening the Objective-C header. The delay is less than a second, but is quite noticeable on my MacBook Air.\r\n\r\nTo open the Objective-C header I need to press shift-cmd-O again then return.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2.1 (7C1002) and 7.3 beta (7D152p)\r\nOS X 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
