    description: "Description:\r\n\r\nWhen doing UI testing on an app which uses two entitlements that require user permission, say location and notifications, it is not possible to dismiss the second and subsequent alerts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have a sample app but it fails to upload every time I attach it.  I will attempt to add it as an edit after I submit this report, but if there is still no attachment when you receive it, please contact me at <redacted> and I will send it to you.\r\n\r\nI have used addUIInterruptionMonitorWithDescription to implement monitors which are supposed to fire when an alert dialog is displayed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe interruption monitor functions should be run for each alert that is presented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe first alert is dismissed correctly by the appropriate interruption monitor;  all of them are run.  The second one is left open even after the test is done and the app has exited, because the interruption monitors do not run a second time.\r\n\r\nThe UI test, which does nothing but tap a button (this is necessary for the interruption monitors to run at all), exits with this error:\r\n\r\nUI Test Activity: \r\nAssertion Failure: UI Testing Failure - No matches found for \"Allow “UITestSample” to access your location even when you are not using the app?\" Alert\r\nQuery input was {(\r\n    Alert 0x7fb33a85f210: traits: 72057602627862528, {{52.5, 242.5}, {270.0, 182.0}}, label: '“UITestSample” Would Like to Send You Notifications'\r\n)}\r\n\r\n(note that nowhere in my code am I telling it to look for either of these alerts by label.  The first alert to show, which is properly dismissed, is the one about location.  The second one, which is not dismissed, is the one about notifications.)\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThis may go without saying, but you do need to delete the app completely from the simulator before each run in order to see the full behavior.\r\n\r\nThis problem is not unique to my code;  there are reports of it all over the place, and no solutions."
