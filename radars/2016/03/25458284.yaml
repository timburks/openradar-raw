        While working on a project, I accidentally discovered that "white star" (☆ unicode U+2606) and "black star" (★ unicode U+2605) have what I believe is a bug: when rendered with the `sans-serif` font-family, they are different sizes.

        See https://jsfiddle.net/oadj0Lkd/ (screenshot attached)

        I verified that this issue did not exist on previous versions of OS X.

        My guess is that this is related to the system-wide change to San Francisco, but I’ll let you guys figure it out.
