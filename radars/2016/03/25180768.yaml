    description: "Cocoa networking APIs should provide a means to disable automatic content decoding of responses with a Content-Encoding: gzip header.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature provided by other major networking libraries, such as libcurl and OkHttp, and it is essential for acceptable performance of certain use cases, e.g. downloading a compressed representation of a resource to disk.\r\n\r\nA private API exists to accomplish this (_CFURLRequestSetProtocolProperty + kCFURLRequestDoNotDecodeData); please consider making it public."
