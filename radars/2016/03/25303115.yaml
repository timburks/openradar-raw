    description: "Summary:\r\nPopulating a UICollectionView with cells which have width and height calculated via AutoLayout can cause an infinite loop crash in UICollectionView _updateVisibleCellsNow:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UICollectionView with a single cell prototype\r\n2. Constrain the cell prototype to be sized with AutoLayout based on some variable attribute (for instance a multiline UILabel)\r\n3. Set a reasonable estimatedItemSize on the UICollectionViewFlowLayout\r\n4. Provide input data which will cause some of the cells to wrap lines and become taller than others, and contains more items than fit on a single screen\r\n5. Run on an iPhone simulator or device, scroll the collection view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe collection view correctly sizes all of its cells based on their constraints\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes in an infinite loop inside _updateVisibleCellsNow:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached project for a quick example with extremely minimal code. Example text from a prototype social media app. Simply build and run in an iPhone simulator and scroll down."
