    description: "When you have a project inside of a workspace that creates frameworks that an application target uses, warnings do not show up when compiling the application target - but only warnings in files directly linked with the application target appear.\r\n\r\nYou can see the warnings in the framework if you select its scheme and compile it, instead of the app target.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in Xcode 7.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup cocoapods with use_frameworks! flag\r\n2. Create warning in a local (development) pod file (unused variable or something)\r\n3. Build main app target\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo see the warning generated in the local file when building the main app target\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly files directly linked with that target (not files in frameworks) are shown in issue navigator\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)"
