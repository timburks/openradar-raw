    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the Twitter app is installed, but no accounts are configured and you try to tweet something using SLComposeViewController, the alert saying “No Twitter Account” doesn’t offer an action button “Settings”. If you press “OK”, the tweet compose view stays open, but you can’t tweet as there are no accounts, of course.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI use the following code for Twitter sharing in my app:\r\n\r\nSLComposeViewController *twitter = [SLComposeViewController composeViewControllerForServiceType:SLServiceTypeTwitter];\r\n[twitter setInitialText:@\"some text\"];\r\n\r\ntwitter.completionHandler = ^(SLComposeViewControllerResult result)\r\n{\r\n    // do something...\r\n    [topViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\r\n};\r\n[topViewController presentViewController:twitter animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n\r\nNow, if there are no Twitter accounts set up and if the Twitter app is not installed, I get an alert “No Twitter Accounts” with the actions “Cancel” and “Settings”.\r\nIt does exactly what it should, pressing \"Cancel\" closes both the alert view and the Twitter compose view. Pressing \"Settings\" also closes both views and opens the settings. Nice.\r\n\r\nNow, if there are no Twitter accounts set up, but the Twitter app is installed, I get an alert “No Twitter Account” (singular) with the only action “OK”.\r\nf pressed, the alert view disappears, but the Twitter compose view stays there with the \"Post\" button grayed out. So the user is left to press \"Cancel\" again to close the compose view and to go to the settings herself. Not so nice.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo matter whether or not Twitter is installed, the alert should always show a “Settings” button. If canceled, the compose view should be closed automatically, as it can’t be used anyways.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on iOS 9.2.1, iPad Air (2nd gen) & iPhone 6 Plus. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the related question on StackOverflow:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/36007768/slcomposeviewcontroller-different-behavior-of-no-twitter-accounts-alert-depen"
