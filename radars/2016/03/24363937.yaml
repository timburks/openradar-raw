    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Location Services settings, the different options are \"Never\", \"Always\", and \"While Using\". However, for some applications (eg: Waze), there is no option for \"While Using\".\r\nI understand this is the developer's choice. However I don't think it should be. I, as a user, should be able to say \"NO\" to an application using my location in the background. Instead here my only choice is \"Never\".\r\nPlease, allow each application to have the 3 options, regardless of what the developer configured!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Waze\r\nGo the privacy settings\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNever, Always, While Using\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNever, Always\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 13C75\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
