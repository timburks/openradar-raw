    description: "Summary:\nUniversal links fail to open the app when a redirect is involved and the original link was tapped from somewhere other than Safari\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nReceive an email containing a URL that redirects to a valid universal link URL. From the iOS mail app, tap on the URL\n\nExpected Results:\nThe appropriate app for the universal link should open. \n\nActual Results:\nCode in the universal link page to handle pre-iOS 9 clients redirects the user to the app store\n\nRegression:\nRedirect links followed from mobile safari are unaffected. This only affects links tapped in apps that themselves open a browser\n\nNotes:"
