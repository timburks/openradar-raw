    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen interactively moving cells around, the collection view flow layout keeps asking the delegate for `collectionView:layout:sizeForItemAtIndexPath:` with the index paths for the current UI representation. This results in cells jumping in size while one cell is being moved.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the sample project\r\n- Run the sample project\r\n- Tap and hold on one cell for 0.5 secs\r\n- Drag that cell around for reordering.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll cells remain in their initial size and move along the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCells jump in size whenever there are cells of different size involved.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis can be fixed by implementing `collectionView:targetIndexPathForMoveFromItemAtIndexPath:toProposedIndexPath:` and keeping track of the current movement. With that information one can do a mapping inside the `collectionView:sizeForItemAtIndexPath:` method and return the correct size. However other delegate methods like `collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:` do not require this mapping as new cells enter the screen while moving objects around. So that definitely does not look like the intended approach.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project: https://github.com/michaelochs/radars/tree/master/25235459%20-%20CollectionViewMovementSizing"
