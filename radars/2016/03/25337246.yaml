    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen e.g. creating an outlet via drag and drop from interface builder into the code, making an undo afterwards only reverts the part of the action of the currently focused view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Look at the screencast\r\n— or —\r\n1. In Xcode open a ViewController and its corresponding storyboard side by side.\r\n2. Right click and hold on a button of the view controller in the storyboard\r\n3. Drag over to the interface or category of the view controller source code to create an outlet\r\n4. Give the outlet a name and confirm the dialog\r\n5. Undo\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The created outlet in code should be gone\r\n- The reference to that outlet in the Storyboard should be gone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Depending on which view was in focus during the time you triggered undo, only one of the expected results is the case.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Using undo from the menu makes it more clear what happens, even though it is not ideal, however when using +Z to undo you don’t notice what is going on. Especially when the focus is on the source code, you see the source code changing and think everything worked. However at runtime of your code you will then experience a crash because the xib wasn’t able to connect the outlet that you thought you reverted.\r\n\r\nOpen Radar Sample Video can be found here: https://github.com/michaelochs/radars/blob/master/25337246%20-%20XcodeUndo.mov"
