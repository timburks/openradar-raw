    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen listening for UIKeyboardWillShowNotification notifications, the keyboard frame found in the userInfo dictionary with key UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey is inconsistent when toggling the software keyboard from show to hide. It works fine when dismissing the keyboard by calling resignFirstResponder on the active UITextField.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRunning the app from the attached project:\r\n1. Tap in the text field\r\n2. If the keyboard did not appear because a hardware keyboard is detected, toggle the software keyboard manually\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The UIKeyboardWillShowNotification is sent only once because the keyboard is only displaying once, not hiding and displaying.\r\n2. The CGRect given by [[notification.userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] CGRectValue] has the height of the keyboard and is consistent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The UIKeyboardWillShowNotification notification is received twice even though UIKeyboardWillHideNotification notification is not received in between those two notifications.\r\n2. The height of the keyboard found in the CGRect [[notification.userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] CGRectValue] is different both times the notification is received. One of the values is the value expected, but the other is consistently less.\r\n\r\nThe notification is only received once when hiding the keyboard by resignFirstResponder and the value received for the end keyboard height is as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.4 and 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 5s and 6 Simulators (not able to test on a device without bluetooth keyboard hardware) running in Xcode 7.2.1 on OSX 10.11.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Keyboard Height Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
