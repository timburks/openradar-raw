    description: "The Apple Developer site for Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles allows a Team Member to start the process of creating an app identifier. On pressing the “Continue” button, an alert is shown with a fairly generic message:\n\n\nAn unspecified error occurred.\nPlease refresh and try again.\n\n\nAfter going back, trying again, refreshing the page, quitting and relaunching Safari, I figure I should check my team status and find out some information.\n\nIt seems my client has only given me Team Member status and according to documentation[1], I don’t have the permissions needed to create a new app identifier. This is fine and clearly the system is protected. However it would be *really* handy and such a time saver to have either or both of the following:\n\n1. A message at the top of the page saying “Hey you’re only a lowly Team Member and you need to be a Team Admin to register a new App ID” \n\n2. Any information at all in the alert error that would allow the user to conclude that it’s a permissions problem.\n\n\n[1] https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ManagingYourTeam/ManagingYourTeam.html"
