        When recording a screen movie of an iOS app using QuickTime on the Mac, the status bar is set to hide the carrier name, set the clock to 09:41 and the battery level to 100% - all nice and fine.

        However, the battery is painted green whereas the real iOS displays a black and white battery as soon as it's fully charged.

        It's only a small detail but this green battery always sticks out a bit odd in App Store preview movies.
