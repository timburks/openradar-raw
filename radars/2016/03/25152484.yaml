        Summary:
        Deletion of an app not submitted to the App Store is not possible. This means that apps created for client work and eventually published  on a different iTunes Connect account end up cluttering up the app listing forever.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Follow the steps here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html

        Expected Results:
        A delete button to be available.

        Actual Results:
        No delete button.
