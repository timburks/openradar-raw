        Currently it is possible to comment and uncomment a line via Editor -> Structure -> Comment Selection. I want to be able to toggle the comment / non-comment status of multiple lines. (Maybe just by also holding the option key).

        So when I select those two lines and trigger the option:
        DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf;
        //DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf-with-dsym;

        The output should then be:
        //DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf;
        DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf-with-dsym;

        So all commented lines get uncommented and all uncommented lines get commented.
