    description: "When using “Attach Files” to attach a file to an email, Quick Looking a file loses the focus on the file list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen composing a message:\r\n1) Select \"File > Attach Files…\" \r\n2) In the Open File dialog that appears, highlight an existing file in the file list. \r\n3) Press the Space bar to Quick Look the highlighted file. \r\n4) Exit Quick Look to return to the Open File dialog.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect OS X to return the focus to the file list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 4), the focus is no longer on the list of files. The selected file that I just Quick Looked is highlighted in GREY instead of the foreground highlighting colour (blue). And I have to click on the list of files again to bring it back into focus.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs in Mail, but also in Nisus Writer Pro and in Office 2016 apps, but not in other apps.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNew in El Capitan."
