    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using an iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard. I had a support question and tried to do a support chat. After initiating the chat on the Apple Support site the web page told me that I needed to be in portrait mode. Obviously this is inconvenient/impossible with the Smart Keyboard connected. I then disconnected the Smart Keyboard but the software keyboard did not become active and I had to terminate the attempt to chat with support.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee Description. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that I could do a support chat in landscape mode with the Smart Keyboard connected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee description. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nIPad Pro with Smart Keyboard connected."
