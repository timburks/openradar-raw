    description: "Most movies are shot at 24 frames per second. Apple TV cannot send 24 Hz video to the TV, even if the TV natively supports this output format. This can result in jerky video as some frames from the 24 fps video are shown for longer than other frames.\r\n\r\nPlease support native 24 Hz video output from the Apple TV. All tvOS applications (e.g., Plex, Infuse, DS Video, etc.) should be able to change the video output settings as they see fit when showing video files.\r\n\r\nEven the ~$35 Raspberry Pi supports this feature. The Apple TV should too."
