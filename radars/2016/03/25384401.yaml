    description: "Summary: Rotating from portrait to landscape loses position by quite a few pages (sometimes up to 20 pages)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: - Open a book in iBooks (a few externally added EPUBs in this case, other formats not tested)\r\n- Have scroll view enabled instead of pages\r\n- Scroll to some position (or read a few pages)\r\n- Rotate the device to landscape\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Ending up at the same position/page before the rotation\r\n\r\nActual Results: Ending up a few pages ahead of the old position, manual scrolling back and finding the current reading position is required\r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 9.3 (13E234)\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- EPUBs externally added (not tested with ebooks bought from the iBooks store)\r\n- Scrolling instead of paging"
