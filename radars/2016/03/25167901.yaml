        Summary:
        Returning NO from textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: is ignored when the keyboard is chinese handwriting.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the attached project
        2. Execute it on an iPad
        4. Tap the textfield
        5. Change the keyboard to “Chinese (Simplified) - Handwriting”
        6. Have fun drawing some things on the keyboard
        7. You will see that symbols are inserted into the textfield
        8. Close the keyboard
        9. iOS calls the textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString:-delegate-method, which returns NO, but the symbols are still inside the textfield

        Expected Results:
        The symbols should have been removed by iOS, as the textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: clearly said NO

        Actual Results:
        The symbols stay inside the textfield

        Regression:
        -
