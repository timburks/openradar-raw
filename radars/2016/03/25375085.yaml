    description: "Summary:\r\nif I starting typing the new folder name too quickly after pressing command-shift-N to create the folder in El Capitan’s Finder, OS X ignores the first few keystrokes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open a window in the Finder showing a folder inside which you can create a new folder.\r\n2) Press command-shift-N to create a new, untitled folder.\r\n3) IMMEDIATELY after pressing command-shift-N, start typing the name of the new untitled folder\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect OS X to register ALL my keystrokes, no matter how soon after pressing command-shift-N I type them.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf I start typing too soon after pressing command-shift-N, the Finder IGNORES my first keystroke and only starts registering my typing with the second character I type.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI didn’t notice this problem before El Capitan, so it might be a new problem in El Capitan. Not sure if it was there before 10.11.4 (current version). \r\n\r\nAlso, you need to type FAST. If you wait even a fraction of a second after typing command-shift-N, the problem won’t occur (see Notes below).\r\n\r\nBut there’s no way that a 2014 Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM is NOT FAST ENOUGH to keep up with my typing, no matter how fast it is. If the Finder cannot process the keystroke immediately, it should at least keep it in a buffer in order to preserve it!\r\n\r\nI have attached a Keyboard Maestro macro I created to test this, with two steps:\r\n\r\n1) type the command-shift-N shortcut\r\n2) insert “My new folder name” by typing\r\n\r\nUnless I put a pause of 0.3 SECOND between step 1 and step 2, the Finder fails to register the typed text string at all. If I put a pause of 0.2 second, I get “older name” typed out in the folder name. If I put no pause or a pause of 0.1 second, I get NOTHING.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2014 Mac Pro with 32 GB of RAM running OS X 10.11.4 + Sharp PN-K321 Display and Apple Cinema HD Display"
