        Summary:
        When listening to music and the iPhone is switched to silent with the silent hardware switch, it still ducks the played audio to a bluetooth speaker when a notification is received and it vibrates.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Listen to music over bluetooth speaker (eg Bose Soundlink Mini 2, maybe this bug will get you one for your office :D), switch iPhone to silent with the ringtone switch. Receive iMessage. iPhone will vibrate but also duck the audio though itâ€™s supposed to be silent.

        Expected Results:
        I expected the iPhone to just vibrate and not duck the music on my speaker.

        Actual Results:
        iPhone ducked the music

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
