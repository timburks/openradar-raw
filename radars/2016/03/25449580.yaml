    description: "Summary:\r\nXcodebuild often hangs when multiple instances of the xcodebuild process are running concurrently with the following arguments:\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -project PROJECT -alltargets -showBuildSettings\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 7.3\r\n2. Extract the attached archive into a temporary folder\r\n3. Open Terminal.app\r\n4. CD into the folder where you extracted the archive\r\n5. Execute `test.py` (it will try to reproduce the bug by running multiple instances of xcodebuild with the above mentioned arguments concurrently)\r\n6. If `test.py` exists successfully and does not hang, try executing it again many times â€” at some point it should hang (this is a concurrency bug, after all)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNone of the xcodebuild processes should not hang\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften some of the xcodebuild processes will hang\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\nOS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding the arguments CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO and CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO seem to work around this issue, which indicates that the hang is due to some feature in xcodebuild related to code signing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs with Xcode 7.3, for Xcode projects that contain more than one target.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'XcodebuildConcurrentHangRepro.zip' was successfully uploaded."
