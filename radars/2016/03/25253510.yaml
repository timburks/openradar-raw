    description: "Currently, there is no way to cancel a build that is processing for TestFlight. If processing takes a long time, a build may become out of date and superseded before it has finished processing, causing an even longer delay for the newest build to be released, as well as encouraging users to test already-out-of-date versions. Allowing developers to cancel/reject processing builds would alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\nFor example, we currently have three builds of one of our apps processing for TestFlight. The oldest was uploaded seven hours ago, and has been superseded by two newer builds, the newest of which was uploaded about an hour ago. The newest build has significant changes and fixes compared to the oldest. When the oldest build finishes processing and becomes available, (internal) beta testers are likely to download it and complain about already-fixed bugs. If we could reject these older builds and only allow the newest build to be released, this wouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a way to reject processing TestFlight builds much the same way a developer can reject an app that is waiting for app store review."
