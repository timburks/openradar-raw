    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven two .pem files.\r\n\r\nDrop one on Keychain Access.  Click View Certificate.\r\n\r\nDrop the second pem file on Keychain Access.  Click View Certificate.  \r\n\r\nBoth are visible, but you can no longer cancel and close both.  Force Quitting Keychain Access is the only solution at this point."
