    description: "Performance launching apps on iPhone 5 is painfully slow. The app icon gets the dimmed \"touched\" appearance for 10 seconds before any on-screen change appears. Not acceptable performance. Built-in apps launch much faster, so they are getting preferred treatment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install any third party app, e.g. Twitter, Dropbox, Tweetbot.\r\n- Make sure app is not running in background\r\n- Tap icon on home screen\r\n\r\nResolved in 9.3\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpeedy launch screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app icon gets the dimmed \"touched\" appearance for 10 seconds before any on-screen change appears."
