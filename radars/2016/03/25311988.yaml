        In Metal, there is currently no API to determine total GPU memory for an MTLDevice, we have to revert to OpenGL API for that. This is cumbersome, and can be problematic if we cannot assert that the Metal renderer corresponds to the GL renderer being inspected.

        Tuning algorithms & size of textures depending on VRAM amount is *very useful* as you can imagine, especially considering the larger variability of GPUs on Mac.

        Please consider adding specific API to retrieve total (and possibly available, if that makes sense) VRAM amount.
