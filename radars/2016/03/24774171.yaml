    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if there was a way to detect when someone starts typing on an external keyboard, without having a textfield as first responder.\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to do this: We enter a view, with a search box textfield at the top, but text doesn't have the focus yet. Then if we start typing, it automatically focuses the textfield and accepts the text input.\r\n \r\nWe know of they keyCommands method, but i don't want to create a keyboard short for every character of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n NA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n  NA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n  NA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.2.1 iPad Pro with Apple external bluetooth keyboard"
