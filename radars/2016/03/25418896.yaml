        Summary:
        While testing a Mac App Store app, and entering in my sandbox account’s Apple ID credentials, I get prompted with “This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store” and need to fill in a bunch of information. The only workaround I could find (described in this Stack Overflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/34716634/105717) involves killing a few daemons (storeaccountd, storeassetd, storedownloadd) and removing their caches in ~/Library/Caches. I reported this as rdar://25418688

        That fixes the issue at hand, but then as soon as iTunes finished playing the song it was in the middle of at the time, it hung. I’ve attached a sysdiagnose report taken while it was hung. I can’t be sure they’re related, but it’s the only thing I did that’s out of the ordinary.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Play a playlist in iTunes
        2. Launch a MAS-ready app signed with the 3rd Party Developer certificate
        3. When prompted for Apple ID credentials, enter a sandbox testing account
        4. After getting told “This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store”, quit (not force quit) the following processes with Activity Monitor: storeaccountd, storeassetd, storedownloadd
        5. Trash the directories with those names inside ~/Library/Caches
        6. Wait for the song to finish

        Expected Results:
        The next song plays

        Actual Results:
        iTunes hangs
