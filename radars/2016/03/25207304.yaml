    description: "Summary:\r\nI get a weird popup when opening gmail from Safari that's very user-unfriendly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Open mail.google.com\r\n3. Get a weird popup:\r\nhttp://f.cl.ly/items/1W020S0p2B2j2J011v42/IMG_0293.PNG\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Popup language responds the following questions:\r\nHow's showing me this? Is it Google or Apple?\r\nWhat's a database?\r\nWhy didn't I see this on other sites?\r\nWhat happens if I don't?\r\nWhat happens if I do and want to revert it?\r\nCan I get more help?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Pop up uses technical and incomplete language.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can't make a full picture of what this means with a background of 15 years of coding, of which 7 were on iOS. I can't imagine a regular user understanding the reach of these options.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 3.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
