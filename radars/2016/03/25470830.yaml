        Summary:

        Since iOS 7.0, we have been able to set a UILabel’s display style for Dynamic Type via the Font panel of Interface Builder. This style information is available via `label.font.fontDescriptor[@"NSCTFontUIUsageAttribute”]` but the key is not exposed as public API, risking App Review rejection due to claims of private API usage.

        Access to this key would allow developers to implement proper updates to labels after receiving UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification without having to hardcode the styles in code, instead being able rely on the Interface Builder-specified styles as the sole definition of what style the label should be. Without access to the key, the point of setting it in Interface Builder seems almost useless since it will have to be implemented in code anyway.
