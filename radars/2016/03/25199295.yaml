    description: "The Night Shift control labeled “Manually Enable Until Tomorrow” turns itself on whenever Night Shift is activated according to a user’s schedule. In that situation, it appears to have the opposite function — manually disable until tomorrow — when manually turned off.\n\nGiven the actual behavior, the label “Manually Enable Until Tomorrow” is misleading and, well, outright wrong half the time. Even “Manually Override Until Tomorrow” would be wrong, since the control state doesn’t correspond to whether the schedule is currently overridden. \n\nBetter: just label this control something like “Night Shift Active Now”, and whenever the current setting disagrees with the scheduled setting, expose a note that says “Night Shift will return to the regular schedule tomorrow.”"

    title: Night Shift "manually enable" really means "manually disable" when Night Shift is active
