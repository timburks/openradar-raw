        SecKeyRawVerify, SecKeyRawSign, kSecPaddingPKCS1SHA256 and more are available on iOS, and are marked as “available from Mac OS X 10.7 and newer” in the iOS SDK, yet these symbols are completely missing from the Mac OS X SDK Security.framework headers. Providing copy-paste externs for them seem to work, so it seems like it’s just a missing export in the header.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. #import <Security/Security.h>
        2. Use SecKeyRawVerify in iOS projects
        3. Be happy!
        4. Use same source file in Mac project

        Expected Results:
        5. Still happy!

        Actual Results:
        5. Get error that the symbol is missing
