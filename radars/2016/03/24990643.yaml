    description: "In my iOS app I have a navigation controller and in the view of the rootViewController of that navigationController I am adding a UIWebView as a subview and passing a video URL to that UIWebView.\r\nThe iPhone app is only supporting the Portrait orientation mode.\r\nSo When I am playing the video from the WebView the player comes to fullScreen and the view can be rotated into the Landscape mode also.\r\nWhen the player is in Landscape mode press the done button of the playerControls.\r\nYou will see that the height of the navigationBar has been reduced. But ideally it should remain the same.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the sample app\r\n2. Keep the device in portrait mode\r\n3. Play the video\r\n4. While video is playing rotate the device in Landscape mode.\r\n5. Now while remain in Landscape mode close the media player.\r\n6. Now observe the navigation bar height, it will be reduced.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNavigation bar height should remain same after closing the player in landscape mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation bar height reduces after closing the player in landscape mode"
