    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nEditing the text for labels in a view controller that uses Auto Layout causes Xcode to become unresponsive. The \"Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool\" saturates one core of the CPU and appears to be stuck in IBAutolayoutEngine. That, in turn, is stuck in UIView(AdditionalLayoutSupport) and the iterative solver (NSISEngine). See the attached Spindump.txt\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open the attached Start.storyboard\r\n2) Edit the label text so that it matches Edited.storyboard (use your favorite diff tool to verify that only the text was edited)\r\n3) Eventually, Xcode will hang\r\n\r\nAlternatively, just open Edited.storyboard. Make sure to save your work first, Xcode will hang as soon as you do this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able replace Lorem ipsum with some real text for a help page in my app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI have had to force quit Xcode about 193 times in the last 12 hours. And Iâ€™ve given up on making the layout in my app nicer.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe design I'm trying to achieve here isn't particularly complex. I just want a column of text with a minimum width (300 pt) and a maximum width (500 pt) that maintains at least a 10 pt margin.\r\n\r\nXcode just can't handle it, even if I try to modify the storyboard by hand with text editor.\r\n\r\nIf you can suggest a workaround, I'd love to hear it. As is, I have to provide a crappy layout to my customers who are on iPads.\r\n\r\nAttachments: http://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/AutolayoutHang.zip"
