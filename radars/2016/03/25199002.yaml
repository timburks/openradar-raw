        I want Night Shift on all the time as a form of color correction. I filed a separate bug about that.

        This report is about the scheduler. If you set the From and To values to the same time of day, Night Shift interprets this as “never on.” I claim that this is a bug.

        From == To could be interpreted as either “always on” or “never on,” with equal plausibility. But because there is a separate on/off switch for the schedule as a whole, it doesn’t make any sense to interpret this configuration as “never on.” If you don’t want scheduled activation at all, you’d just leave the master switch off. In the current system, there is literally no way to achieve an “always on” effect.

        Of course, there’s a work-around, which is to define the schedule as something like 5:00am to 4:59am, limiting the Off period to one minute each night. But this is an inelegant hack, and one that points to shortcomings in the existing UI.
