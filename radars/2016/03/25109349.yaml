    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari's standalone mode for iOS 9, every page load decreases performance. I am assuming it is a memory leak.\r\n\r\nAfter 100 - 200 page loads in one standalone mode session you will begin to notice dragging is less responsive and button clicking has become delayed.\r\n\r\nAfter 400+ page loads the webpage will basically become frozen and scrolling is impossible.  \r\n\r\nThis performance lag only occurs in standalone mode for iOS 9.\r\nIt does not occur in the default SafariMobile browser on iOS 9 or on iOS 8 in standalone mode.\r\n\r\nI have attached two basic html files that I have used to reproduce the issue. The second file includes some javascript to automatically submit the page and track your current page count.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a basic webpage that includes the standalone meta tags, a form (that submits back to the same page) and a submit button. You can use the files I have attached.\r\n\r\n2. Open the webpage on an iOS 9 device and save the page to the home screen.\r\n\r\n3. Tap the home screen link to open the webpage in standalone mode.\r\n\r\n4. Repeatedly tap the submit button, which will essentially reload the page.\r\n\r\n5. Notice that touch actions will gradually become less responsive.\r\n\r\n6. Once the device is unresponsive press the home button and reopen the webpage in standalone mode, the page will be fully responsive again.\r\n\r\n7. Repeat steps 4 & 5 to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth, fluid flow when scrolling. \r\n\r\nResponsive to touch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDelayed and laggy response.\r\n\r\nIgnored touch actions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*I will upload the html files (that I attached to my apple bug report) to Github shortly because I cannot attach them to this radar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2, iPad 4, iPhone 5"
