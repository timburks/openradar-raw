    description: "Summary:\r\n* A colleague ran into a situation where the app would crash on launch. Important to note is that she was _also_ seeing it with other apps, such as LinkedIn.app.\r\n* A restart of her device ‘fixed’ the issue.\r\n\r\n## Info about the errors\r\n\r\n```\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\nDyld Message: Library not loaded: @rpath/CocoaLumberjack.framework/CocoaLumberjack\r\n  Referenced from: /var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/D693664B-F6D0-43CB-A839-358E15CAF9E6/Artsy.app/Artsy\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.
