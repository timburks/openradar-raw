    description: "Description:\r\n\r\nI live in the Cayman Islands where we don't follow Daylight Savings Time. All of the iOS devices and  Macs in our household are set to adjust the Date/Time automatically based on current location.\r\n\r\nThis morning all the devices displayed the wrong time (1 hour later than it actually was) probably because they believed we follow DST. Going to Settings > Date & Time and toggling the \"Set Automatically\" setting fixed it.\r\n\r\nSo the system was smart enough to fix the problem, but not smart enough to avoid it in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on Settings > Date & Time > Set Automatically on an iOS device\r\n2. The day before DST goes in to effect, Travel to a country that doesn't follow DST e.g. the beautiful Cayman Islands. Also bring an analog watch and set it to the same time.\r\n3. Go to sleep\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe next morning the time on the iOS device and analog watch will be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe next morning the time on the iOS device will be incorrect (1 hour later) and no longer matches the analog watch.\r\n\r\nHilarity ensues with your friends and family who all run into the same bug but aren't aware of it."
