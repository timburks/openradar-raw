    description: "Summary:\r\nIn many managed OS X environments, logout hooks have been used to run scripts at logout/reboot.  A good example is a school lab.  Admins would use a logout hook to do cleanup activities when Macs are rebooted.  \r\n\r\nLogout hooks are deprecated, and there is no supported replacement for this feature. \r\n\r\nLink: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CustomLogin.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNeed a supported method of triggering events at logout/restart\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.3 +\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is a regression, since Logout Hooks have been deprecated with no supported replacement feature."
