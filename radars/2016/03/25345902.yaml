        Summary:
        When creating an iOS “Master-Detail” project from the new project template, Xcode shows a warning for using a string-based selector ("insertNewObject:”), which was deprecated in Swift 2.2.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Xcode 7.3, create a new Project
        2. Choose iOS > Master-Detail
        3. Give it a name, and ensure the project is in Swift.

        Expected Results:
        Project template is applied and there are no warnings.

        Actual Results:
        A warning is immediately shown for the new code: “[path to project]/MasterViewController.swift:22:90: Use of string literal for Objective-C selectors is deprecated; use '#selector' instead”
