    description: "Summary:\r\nIn what is likely a dupe of rdar://25085577, I’m seeing crashes-on-launch from many apps on my device. See attached crash reports and related console log output.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI’m seeing this issue for the first time. Others (via rdar://25085577 & Twitter) relate it to RAM pressure. But force-quitting all applications did not solve the issue for me. Deleting and reinstalling affected apps did not fix the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApps don’t crash on launch\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps crash on launch with logs similar to those attached to this radar\r\n\r\n[openradar note, they mostly looked like this:]\r\nDyld Error Message:\r\nDyld Message: Library not loaded: @rpath/TFNLoggingKit.framework/TFNLoggingKit\r\n  Referenced from: /var/containers/Bundle/Application/C678B808-1508-4C1E-9EAC-565834D2C974/Twitter.app/Twitter\r\n  Reason: no suitable image found.

But I did not attempt to launch all 313 apps on my phone to confirm that (or do I *really* remember what I did and didn’t launch earlier in the day).\r\n\r\nAlso, a few apps (such as ExpediaBookings) would hang on their launch screen instead of crashing back to SpringBoard. In those cases hitting the home button would do nothing, but hitting the lock button would lock the device. When the device was unlocked I was back at the home screen.\r\n\r\nAnother note: All apps that were signed with development certs launched just fine. The three apps I have installed via TestFlight launched just fine (two of which I launched recently, one that hadn’t been in launched a few weeks).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 64GB (9.1GB free)"
