    description: "Summary:\r\nI invited a \"Julian\" from my contact book to a calendar event. Instead, the invite was sent to the mail address \"Julian@***.com\" and not to my friends E-Mail account. I have never added another Julian into my address book, nor have I ever been in contact with someone with that email address\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts\r\n2. Add \"Julian\" as a contact with an email address\r\n3. Open Calendar\r\n4. Add Event\r\n5. Add that \"Julian\" from your contacts as a member\r\n6. Invite gets sent to Julian@***.com, not to the Email address of the \"Julian\" contact\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour contact Julian should get an invite, not Julian@***.com\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWell, the owner of julian@***.com gets bothered by me accidentally."
