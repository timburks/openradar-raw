    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an iOS app that implements filling in a login form with Safari Saved Password using the `SecRequestSharedWebCredential` API.\r\n\r\nSecRequestSharedWebCredential works most of the time, but I got a report from a user that got the Safari Saved Password pop-up with a \"Passwords not saved\" output. I've attached a screenshot of how this looks.\r\n\r\nThe documentation does not mention the possible \"Passwords not saved\" output of the Safari Saved Password dialog. It should.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've tried reproducing this issue by saving a login without a password to my iCloud keychain, but failed. The result I got is that the password was /empty/.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the user has their \"passwords not saved\", then the Safari Saved Password dialog should never pop-up. Instead the SecRequestSharedWebCredential API should return a relevant error that indicates this exact problem.\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be expanded to talk about why the \"Passwords not saved\" error can surface, and steps to take to remedy it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI saw \"passwords not saved\" in the Safari Saved Password pop-up on iOS. I've attached a screenshot of it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
