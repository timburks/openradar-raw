        Currently, all HKHealthStore objects point to the system health store. This makes automated testing of HealthKit code extremely difficult. There is no automated way to reset the health store to a known state, and granting authorization requires UI interaction, greatly complicating test cases.

        It should be possible to create a temporary, in-memory HKHealthStore that automatically grants authorization when requested.
