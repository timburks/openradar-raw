    description: "Summary:\r\nPrior to iOS 9, UIKeyCommands could be created and used for the hot-key combinations CMD-B, CMD-I, CMD-U (typically used for bold and italic text) for use in UITextViews and other UITextInput controls.\r\n\r\nStarting with iOS 9, UIKeyCommands can still be assigned to these key combinations, but will be ignored by iOS.\r\n\r\nInstantiating and returning these UIKeyCommands works fine, so there is no way of knowing they will fail.\r\n\r\n1) These should work as they did prior to iOS 9.\r\n\r\n2) If they do not work, UIKeyCommand should return nil or error of some sort creating UIKeyCommands that the system will ignore so the app can be aware they will fail and take appropriate action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open included sample project\r\n- Run app on device running iOS 9 or greater with external bluetooth keyboard attached.\r\n- Focus one of the UITextViews\r\n- Hit cmd-b, cmd-i, cmd-u â€“ these keyboard shortcuts will be ignored.\r\n- Hit cmd-e, cmd-p - see output in console log.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncmd-i, cmd-b, cmd-u (and possibly other combinations reserved by the system) do not fire UIKeyboardCommands returned by the app...they should fire.\r\n\r\nIf the system is reserving keyboard shortcuts, there should be a way to know what those are so the app can act accordingly to prevent use of invalid key combinations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeyboard commands are ignored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 or greater\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese key commands DID work prior to iOS 9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny with external keyboard\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BUG_KeyCommand.zip' was successfully uploaded."
