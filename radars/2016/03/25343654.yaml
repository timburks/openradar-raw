        Summary:
        After upgrading to iOS 9.3, my app first started reporting HealthKit errors when calling HKHealthStore’ method, and now started reporting it doesn’t have HealthKit access at all. I connected to the device in Xcode and didn’t see any logs, but i saw that health is crashing. I’ve attached the crash log.

        I’m also currently unable to see any data or sources in the Health app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use a HealthKit app to save a data point

        Expected Results:
        The action succeeds, like it did on 9.2 and earlier

        Actual Results:
        The app is unable to talk to HealthKit

        Regression:
        This started in iOS 9.3
