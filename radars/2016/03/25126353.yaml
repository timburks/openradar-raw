    description: "I would like to share the very poor experience I have with writing text on iOS devices when I write in 2 (or more) languages in the same text. Hardware keyboard don't solve it as you would expect it, it's actually worse, leaving no usable option for that use case.\n\n- No multilingual support with iOS keyboards. Too bad as most iOS users use 2+ languages daily. I write in FR and EN, in the same text.\n- SwiftKey is much better for multi-language tasks (and possibly prediction too), but you lose force touch scroll/selection.\n- which is probably the most useful force touch thing in iPhone 6s, bringing so much editing power to touch keyboards.\n- You say, OK, I'll use a bluetooth h/w keyboard then. But you really can't. Auto correction screws your dual-language writing. \n- The procedure with BT keyboard is to show the s/w keyboard, pick the other language, hide it and then use it.\n- Or to go to settings and disable predictive globally, which is not what you want.\n- But then, if like me you use AZERTY layout for FR & QWERTY for EN to differentiate -> it uses those layout for the h/w one too! \n- So you're screwed too, because the h/w one has only one layout (AZERTY for me). \n- You thought h/w keyboard would give you more control, but it doesn't. It's not usable if you write in 2 languages.\n\nHope this helps."
