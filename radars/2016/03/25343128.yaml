    description: "#Description\r\nApple TV3 does not support the built-in two-factor authentication system now integrated in iOS 9.3 and OS X El Capitan 10.11.4. When I attempt to login to iCloud on Apple TV, I get a prompt to put in my *four-digit* authentication code; the new authentication system sends *six-digit* codes, which don't work with Apple TV.\r\n\r\n#Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Navigate to Settings > iCloud, and select Sign In.\r\n2. Instructions say \"Do you want to use your apple ID to sign in to iCloud.\" Select Yes.\r\n3. Type in password in the password field.\r\n4. iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4 devices then produce a prompt saying \"Your Apple ID is being used to sign in to a new device.\"\r\n5. Click Allow.\r\n6. Those devices create a six-digit code. A similar prompt to enter a verification code appears on Apple TV.\r\n7. But Apple TV only accepts four-digit codes, presumably from the older, two-step verification system. Verification fails when typing the first four digits of that six-digit code, so it is not possible to login to iCloud.\r\n\r\n#Expected results\r\nAbility to login to iCloud on Apple TV using verification code sent to other devices.\r\n\r\n#Actual Results\r\nApple TV only accepts four-digit codes, presumably from the older, two-step verification system. Verification fails when typing the first four digits of that six-digit code, so it is not possible to login to iCloud.\r\n\r\n#Model Information\r\nApple TV Model A1427, running software 7.2.1 (8011); iOS 9.3; OS X El Capitan 10.11.4"
