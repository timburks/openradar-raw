I have copied the relevant steps into this radar for your convenience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStarting from a state, where one cell is already selected (and the table view only allows single selection). Cell A is the selected cell and Cell B is the new cell that will be selected.\r\n\r\nOn iPhone:\r\nTouch down:\r\nCell B -> set highlighted to YES\r\nTouch up:\r\nCell B -> set highlighted to NO\r\nCell A -> set selected to NO\r\nCell B -> set selected to YES\r\n\r\nOn iPad:\r\nTouch down:\r\nCell B -> set highlighted to YES\r\nCell A -> set selected to NO\r\nTouch up:\r\nCell B -> set highlighted to NO\r\nCell B -> set selected to YES\r\nCell B -> set selected to YES\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect only one cell to be highlighted at a time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result is, that on the iPhone the currently selected cell stays selected until the touch ends.
