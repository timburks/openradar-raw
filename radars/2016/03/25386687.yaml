    description: "Summary:\nIn Xcode 7.2, you used to be able to filter your list of issues to only Errors when not specifying filter  text in the navigation panel.  This default filtering no longer works in Xcode 7.3\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  Write horrible code with lots of warnings and a few errors.\n2.  Click on the Alert icon in the top of the navigation panel to show Issues.\n3.  Click on the stop icon in the bottom filter, ensure that there is no filter text. visible. \n\nExpected Results:\n1.  Only errors should be shown in the list of issues.\n\nActual Results:\n1.  Both warnings and errors were displayed in the list of issues.  \n2.  If I actually typed something in the filter at the bottom, then the filter does the right thing and only errors matching the filter are displayed.\n\nRegression:\n1.  This worked properly in Xcode 7.2\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
