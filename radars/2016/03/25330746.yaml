    description: "Summary: When attempting to execute all tests, XCTest internally obtains all XCTestCase subclasses using the Objective-C runtime. It crashes here, inside the objc_copyClassList call.\r\n\r\nI found a problematic Swift class in a mixed codebase with OBJC_PRINT_CLASS_SETUP but have yet to narrow it down to a definitive cause with that file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 0. Create new iOS app project.\r\n1. Add Swift class with unknown problem to main app target.\r\n2. Run unit test target.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Tests start running.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Test process crashes before running any tests.\r\n\r\nVersion: Xcode 7.3/7D175\r\nOS X 10.11.4/15E65\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis doesn't occur when running individual tests, since it doesn't trigger the problematic code that finds all the tests at runtime."
