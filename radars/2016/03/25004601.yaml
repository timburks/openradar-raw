        Changing the value of UIPrintInteractionController's property showsPageRange does nothing.

        As long as the document you are trying to print matches the following conditions:
        - it has more than one page
        - it can show a preview in the print interaction controller
        - printItems is nil
        - _printState is non-nil
        the page range option will always be shown.

        There seems to be a simple error in -[UIPrintInteractionController _canShowPageRange] where there is a check if either showsPageRange is YES OR it can show a preview. I guess that should be an AND instead of an OR.
