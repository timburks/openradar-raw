    description: "Currently when a user is in Safari, he/she can use Handoff on another Apple device to take that same open web page and bring it onto another device through NSUserActivity. The same functionality would be quite useful through SFSafariViewController, so through a URL open in an app a user would be able to handoff that URL directly to their Mac or other iOS device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an instance of SFSafariViewController in any app that supports it\r\n2. View the areas on iOS and OS X in which Handoff can be seen (bottom left corner of lock screen on iOS/ Multitasking on the bottom, App Switcher/Dock on OS X)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActivity item appearing through Handoff from the currently open instance of SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo Handoff activity appears when using SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 and greater"
