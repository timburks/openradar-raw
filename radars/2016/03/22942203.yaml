    description: "Summary:\r\nVersions of OS X prior to 10.11 are not available for download on Apple's Developer site. This is problematic for folks who develop apps that are backwards compatible to previous versions of OS X.\r\n\r\nIn past years, previous versions of OS X have been available for download on Apple's developer downloads page (developer.apple.com/downloads/), but this has not been the case since OS X started to be distributed through the Mac App Store. Luckily, I can still download older versions of OS X from the Purchased tab in the App Store app - but if any versions aren't purchased from my account, I won't be able to download them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit https://developer.apple.com/osx/download/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to download versions of OS X older than the current version, so that we can test our software's backwards compatibility in case users are stuck on older versions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOlder versions of OS X are not made available here.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
