    description: "Summary:\r\nRealized by myself and colleagues as of a half an hour ago, none of us can get key repeating functionality to work as expected. OS X users inside and outside our environment are also affected. We have all checked and our key repeating functionality in System Preferences is turned on, as it always was.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hold down any character producing or character deleting key to repeat that character (e.g. hold down 'f' key and expect 'f' character to automatically repeat; hold down 'delete' key to continuous delete characters to the left of the cursor)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPressed character creation or character deletion key will produce that character repeatedly until unpressed. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe character will type once and not repeatedly type itself until unpressed. Characters with diacritical options will produce the diacritical menu for that character.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.4 Beta (15E61b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is happening to multiple people I know on the current, stable 10.11.3 builds. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll text input conditions."
