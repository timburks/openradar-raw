    description: "Based on the Apple documentation on the \"shared iPad\" feature:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/education/shared-ipad/\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/ca/education/preview/\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/education/it/\r\n\r\nWe need to implement changes to our iPad app, related to user data, to support NSSupportsPurgeableLocalStorage and NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.\r\n\r\nWe tried to request an invite to the educationpreview@apple.com, but we just received an automated email with links to documentation we already had. Also we are a developer based in Canada, so we might not be eligible for the program.\r\n\r\nSince we are not able to setup an actual iPad as \"shared\", it would be nice to be able to force a local data \"purge\" through Xcode on an actual device or in the simulator, to be able to test/debug our app with the changes needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
