    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple documentation at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GameKit/Reference/GKMatchRequest_Ref/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/GKMatchRequest/playerGroup says: \"Setting the playerGroup property to 0 allows the player to be matched into any waiting match.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think this is what is really happening. I have tried a whole bunch of different scenarios for the turn-based match and found that if you set player group to 0, it only finds other players with playerGroup set to zero. It does seem to be matching people based on the playerGroup otherwise.\r\n\r\nI guess I was expecting playerGroup=0 to be a kind of \"Don't care\" when it comes to the different rule sets. That is, I was expecting you could create a game with any rule set you want. Then, if a second player gives the \"don't care\" option (which would set playerGroup = 0), then it would go ahead an match them with any existing game waiting for a player.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it isn't working this way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using a simple turn-based game example, make an app capable of setting the playerGroup. Load the app on two devices.\r\n2. Have the first device start a match with a non-zero value for playerGroup. Finish at least one turn.\r\n3. Have the second device try to join a match with a zero value for playerGroup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBased on the documentation, I would expect the playerGroup=0 on the second device to allow a match with any existing match.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt seems that a GKMatchRequest with playerGroup=0 is only matching with other matches with playerGroup=0.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTests on iOS8 and iOS9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny (various physical devices and simulators)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
