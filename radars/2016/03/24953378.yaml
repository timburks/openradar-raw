    description: "Summary:\r\nSee project test6 attached.\r\n\r\n-Run on iPad/Simulator that supports SlideOver in iOS9.2 (or 9.3b) (not SplitScreen)\r\n-run test6 app in SlideOver on the right\r\n-click Test button on it's left side (just to the left of the first \"T\"), notice that it's even it called \"actionTest\"\r\n-click Test button on it's right side side (to the right of the \"e\"), notice that it's even is not called, but instead the appdelegate  \"applicationDidBecomeActive\" is called\r\n\r\nOnly happens in SlideOver.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n-is this intended behaviour?\r\n-is this documented anywhere?\r\n-is it possible to disable/workaround this? \r\n\r\n-In our app as a workaround we used a UIGestureRecognizer that still seems to work in that zone, and pass the UITouch event to the view.\r\n\r\n-tried to disable the view/window's layoutMargins, but that didn't help\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Air (iOS 9.2.1)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air (iOS 9.2.1)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'test6.zip' and 'Simulator Screen Shot Mar 3, 2016, 10.42.04 AM.png' were successfully uploaded."
