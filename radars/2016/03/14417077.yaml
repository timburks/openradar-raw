    description: "Summary: If you have a button that is a different size than its image, and you render the superlayer in a graphics context, the button in the image gets a white artifact on it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open and run the sample code. The button in the storyboard is smaller than the image it contains, e.g. as the result of a miscommunication between the designer and the developer, so the graphic is getting resized. This is not desirable for a shipping app, but it is correct for this demonstration.\r\n\r\nLook at the storyboard. It contains an empty UIImageView below a button. When the app runs, the view controller's view's layer is rendered into a graphics context, and the resulting image is set as the image view's image.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button in the screenshot looks exactly like the live button in the UI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button in the screenshot gets a white artifact at the bottom.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works correctly in the iOS 6 SDK running on iOS 6, but breaks when run on iOS 7 (using either the 6 or 7 SDK).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS 7's new -[UIView snapshotView] method does not suffer from the artifact problem, which you can see if you comment the first block of code and uncomment the second block of code in the attached project. This is only an issue for apps that need to support versions of iOS prior to iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSample project at http://cl.ly/fOxy"
