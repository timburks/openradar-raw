    description: "Summary:\r\nThis issue has been ongoing for several months but I've been working around it by exporting within Xcode and then uploading via the Application Loader, which does work.  I'd like to be able to upload directly from Xcode.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing it with all my apps, not just Conference Pad which is the one seen in the attached screenshot. The error message mentions macosx but the apps are iOS, which might be related to the root of the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build -> Archive in any project associated with my iTunes account\r\n2. Upload to App Store\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWorks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n'iTunes Store operation failed'\r\nNo version found for 'adamId - platform' (xxxxxxxxx-Mac OS X App).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.2.1 (7C1002), Mac OS X  10.11.3 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n• If I export for distribution and then use the Application Loader application, it works without error\r\n• Referred to submit a radar on this by Steve with App Store Developer Support - case #1053357387\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nalways occurs on my development machine (Macbook Pro Early 2011)"
