        The Financial Reports status email contains a link labelled “To view and download your reports, go to Payments and Financial Reports on iTunes Connect.” The link is:

        https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/da/jumpTo?page=paymentsAndFinancialReports

        That is the old URL to the financial reports. The new link is:
