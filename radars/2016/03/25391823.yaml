    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIScrollView supports three default styles. Since the UIScrollView indicators are UIImages under the hood, it's possible to tint them by setting the image mode to UIImageModeAlwaysTemplate and applying a tintColor to the scroll indicator view/image view.\r\n\r\nThis is a hack, involving view hierarchy traversal, and isn't necessarily safe for future SDK releases.\r\n\r\nThat said, tinting the scroll bars is a really common area for subtle design  and it would be really awesome if this were made official.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIScrollView (or subclass)\r\n2. Set its tintColor\r\n3. Scroll so that the indicators appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scroll view indicators should match the tintColor of the UIScrollView.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey remain black or white, depending on the indicatorStyle property of the UIScrollView.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3"
