    description: "When going to file a bug about iTunes, I wanted to see the version number. I use the about window to do this in other apps, so I opened iTunesâ€™ About window to find that not only is the version number not selectable for copy and paste, it also scrolls meaning I need to remember the lengthy version number listed.\n\nExpected Result: \nNo scrolling\nSelectable to copy and paste\n\nActual Result:\nScrolls into a faded haze"
