    description: "A 64GB iPhone 6 attempting to authorize an in-app purchase on an internal TestFlight build is consistently unsuccessful. Authenticating with a finger causes the Touch ID prompt to disappear, and no further store action occurs. The purchase does not process.\r\n\r\nRepeating the purchase attempt and utilizing a password instead of Touch ID results in success.\r\n\r\nThe affected device is running iOS 9.3 beta 4. A 64GB iPhone 6 running iOS 9.2.1 (13D15) can use Touch ID for an in-app purchase in the same app with no problems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Set-up a device to allow Touch ID usage for iTunes purchase\r\n2.  Install an app build published on TestFlight for internal testing\r\n3.  Initiate a consumable item purchase\r\n4.  Use your finger to authorize the IAP\r\n5.  Notice the prompt disappears with no further action\r\n6.  Initiate again the bundle purchase, but choose to enter the password manually instead, and notice that the IAP succeeds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTouch ID finger authorization results in successful purchase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTouch ID finger authorization results in dismissal of prompt with no finished purchase action.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 beta 4 (13E5214d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMajority of internal testers report no issues, but the affected device is the only one running a 9.3 beta.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64GB using WiFi"
