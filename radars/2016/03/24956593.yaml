        Summary:
        Navigating within the jump bar from the keyboard should be better. Triggering the dropdowns with ^6, ^5, ^4 and typing to filter are great ways to interact. However I should be able to use ^p and ^n or whichever keys I have bound to moveUp: and moveDown: to change my selection without having to use the up and down arrows. Spotlight respects these commands, and itâ€™s great.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the jump bar with ^6.
        2. Press ^n
        3. Press ^n again
        4. Press ^p

        Expected Results:
        ^n should advance the selection in the dropdown menu.
        ^p should go back

        Actual Results:
        The selection jumps to an apparently arbitrary item and stays there
