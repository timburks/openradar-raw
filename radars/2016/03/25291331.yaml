    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the iPad is connected to the Internet via Ethernet, the \"My Music\" tab in the Music app only shows music which has been saved for offline listening.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn off Wi-Fi (and cellular, if applicable).\r\n2. Connect a USB Ethernet adapter to the iPad using the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter (Model A1619). \r\n3. Open Music app.\r\n4. Go to \"My Music\" tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContents of entire iCloud Music Library should show up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly songs saved for offline viewing show up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 [13E233]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther parts of the Music app (such as the \"For You\" tab) function as expected and will stream music. Also, I have verified that the \"Only Downloaded Music\" toggle is off. It appears that the \"My Music\" section of the Music app does not check for Ethernet connectivity when assessing if an Internet connection is available.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" Wi-Fi, 128 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
