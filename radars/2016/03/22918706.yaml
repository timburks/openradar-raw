    description: "Summary:\r\nVP9 video is supported by Chrome and Firefox and is being implemented in Windows 10 for future versions of the MS Edge browser.\r\n\r\nAt Wikipedia we would love to use a consistent free format for video across all platforms; patent concerns have kept us away from H.264. (Currently we provide basic playback in Safari with a JavaScript decoder, which has performance limitations and currently requires us to use a second, lower-quality codec.)\r\n\r\nLow-level VP9 codec support, whether in Matroska/WebM container (preferred) or in fragmented MP4 container (which we could work with if necessary), would be very useful for us when exposed to higher-level components like Safari, or even in native iOS apps via CoreMedia.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any WebM VP9 video in Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile should play\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFile type unrecognized\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
