    description: "Ian Fuchs02-Mar-2016 08:28 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen viewing images in the photos app, if a .gif file is in your image library and contains movement/animation, the image is locked on the 1st frame of the animation and there is no way to play through the animation.\r\n\r\nThis means there is no way to know if an image is actually an animated .gif, or a static image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Save animated .GIF file to camera roll\r\n2. Open photos app on iOS device\r\n3. View photo in photos apps\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.GIF image plays/loops it's animation when opening/viewing the image\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage is static and shows no context or indicator of being animated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3 (13E5225a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is not specific to any version/build.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus, Verizon Wireless\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
