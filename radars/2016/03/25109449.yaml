    description: "I constantly forget stopping Workout mode on my Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't it detect that automatically?\r\n\r\nI disabled standing reminders but I assume it could detect automatically when I'm sitting, not working out. Then it could send a notification \"Are you still working out?\" with an option to stop the workout.\r\n\r\nSee this Twitter conversation: https://twitter.com/ortwingentz/status/708297222522322944"
