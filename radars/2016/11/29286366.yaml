    description: "Swift Playgrounds on macOS are an amazing way to quickly try a snippet of code or to demo something. \r\nUnfortunately even for the former case you still have to name and save the Playground somewhere on the system, which slows down the process and clutters up the system with 1-time snippets of code.\r\n\r\nMy enhancement request would be akin to Pages and Keynote that allow you to start an \"untitled\" document with an option to save to disk when/if required."
