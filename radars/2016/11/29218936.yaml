        Summary:
        Allow the user to specify a backup directory for a single specific backup.

        Notes:

        As phone sizes are increasing and Mac HD's are not increasing fast enough, it's no longer practical to keep the backups of your phone on your Mac.

        I do want to keep a backup of my phone with all my things somewhere, so at the moment I need to:

        - do housekeeping on my Mac to free enough space
        - make a backup
        - manually move that backup to an external HD

        Now suppose we accept that some users (e.g. me) want to still make a manual backup, it would make sense to have an option-click on "Manually Back Up now" prompt you for a directory. That way I could specify the external HD and be done with it.

        (The other solution would be to start making Macs great again, but that's a whole other discussion)
