    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have received two spammy text messages in the past two days. Despite the \"Filter Unknown Senders\" option being enabled in Settings > Messages, the spammy text messages were not categorized under \"Unknown Senders\" despite the origin of the text messages being obviously unknown.\r\n\r\nThe text of the most recent text message I received is:\r\n\r\nSender of message: bxxewynlf60@ppccinst.n...\r\nBody of message: ((646) 863 4985) IT'S BEEEN A BIT HIT ME UP PLS\r\n\r\nI have no idea who is sending this message, or how they're sending it. But the Messages app categorized it under \"Contacts & SMS\". Does that mean it was sent via SMS? If so, why can't Messages still filter unknown senders when the message is sent via SMS?\r\n\r\nIn other words, how can I have messages like this automatically filed under \"Unknown Senders\"? I can find no way to do it. That means in the middle of the night, random people in the world can cause my phone to chime, vibrate, and light up.\r\n\r\nPlease help! Surely this isn't the best that can be done by the Messages app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI do not know how to reproduce these kinds of messages. But I know they are always getting past the \"Filter Unknown Senders\" message. Perhaps they are being sent via SMS?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen \"Filter Unknown Senders\" is enabled, I expect it to do exactly that: when the origin of a text message is unknown, the message should be filtered such that it does not chime, vibrate, and light up my phone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText messages from unknown senders are causing my phone to chime, vibrate, and light up despite the \"Filter Unknown Senders\" option being enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 (14B100)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n[none]\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64 GB Verizon\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n[none]"
