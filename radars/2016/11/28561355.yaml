    description: "Summary:\r\nOther hebrew letters with vowels show up ok, but when you have a יִ it gets replaced with a circle.\r\nOther vowels with a yud (e.g. יֲ יֵ יֹ) show up OK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDisplay text in UI label\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the correct letter with its vowel (יִ)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA circle.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\nIt seems this is partially due to a custom font we have.\r\n\r\nBut on the default iOS font, the chirik is getting put in the wrong place, which is probably what's causing this issue.\r\n\r\nThe dot under the first letter of the 3rd word from the right (יִצְחָק) should be at the bottom in line with the other vowels, but it's actually showing up directly under the י.\r\n\r\n---------\r\nThis was submitted on the apple bug report a months ago and got only 1 response from apple and then radio silence."
