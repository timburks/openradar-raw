    description: "Summary:\r\nGiven a regularly used iOS device, I should be able to easily find and clear the data for an individual website.  Either a search function is needed, or alphabetical ordering is needed, with an alphabetical index on the right (as you usually find in `UITableViewController`).  The websites are currently sorted by size of website data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings -> Safari -> Advanced -> Website Data.  Select “Show All Sites”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to quickly find an individual website to clear its data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s very difficult to find an individual website to clear its data, given the results are shown in order of size of data shown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the attachment for an example of how difficult this set of data is to search."
