    description: "Summary:\r\nThis bug is seen on iOS 10.x (10.0.x and 10.1.x)\r\n\r\nI have a tableview which expand cells when they are selected. To do so I track the selected cells and I call the `beginUpdates`/`endUpdates` methods inside an UIView animation block. The cell heights are given by the `heightForRowAt` delegate method.\r\n\r\nDoing this animate properly the cell's frame, but the contentView's frame jumps immediately to the new position. There is no animation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn an XCode 8 project:\r\n\r\n1. Create a table view\r\n2. Add a view to one of the cells with edge constraints (or with autoresizing masks)\r\n3. Animate the cell height change with beginUpdates/EndUpdates\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCell, content view, and subview all animate the height change together.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS 10.x, the cell and subview are animated. The content view immediately jumps to the end position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 8.x / iOS 10.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith the given project example, run the TableViewCellHeightAnimation scheme with an iOS 10.x device or simulator and select a cell.\r\n\r\nYou should see the subview jumps directly to its end position.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 10.x simulators and devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableViewCellHeightAnimation.zip' was successfully uploaded."
