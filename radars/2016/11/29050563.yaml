    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a returning method has a @try/@catch construct, Xcode/clang does not treat a missing return statement as an error.\r\n\r\nThe attached project contains sample code illustrating the problem. Inside ViewController.m there is a method called tryCatchWhoops which does not have a return statement after the @catch, causing an undefined value to be returned to the call in viewDidLoad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a method which returns a value, e.g. - (NSArray *)foo {}\r\n2. Xcode/clang will mark the function with an error indicating that control reaches the end of a non void function.\r\n3. Add a minimal @try/@catch construct to the function, e.g. @try {} @catch (NSException *e) {}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect Xcode/clang to still have an error indicating that control reaches the end of a non void function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode/clang no longer indicates that control reaches the end of a non void function, allowing the erroneous function to be called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.1 (8B62)\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2555)"
