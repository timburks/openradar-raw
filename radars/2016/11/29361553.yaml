    description: "Summary:\r\nI have some button subclasses that end up drawing their custom bezels/background images upside down. I wanted to create the simplest possible sample code that demonstrates the problem. I've included a sample project that demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open included sample xcodeproj.\r\n2. Go to Assets.xcassets and click on 'ugly_button' image.\r\n3. Note how it has some lines at the top of it.\r\n4. Compile and run (on Xcoade 8.1)\r\n5. Notice how both buttons draw the image upside down and now lines are at the bottom.\r\n6.Check out each NSButton subclass. One draws in drawRect: and the other uses NSCell's drawWithFrame:inView:.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDraw the image not flipped would be good. The workaround I found was to implement -(BOOL)isFlipped { return NO; } in my button subclass. But then you need to adjust the title since it gets moved too.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUpside down drawing of images.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1 8B62\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI tried this on my 10.11.6 Mac (15G1108) and 10.12 (16B2657)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PopoverAndCustomButtons.zip' was successfully uploaded."
