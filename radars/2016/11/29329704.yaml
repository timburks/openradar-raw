    description: "Summary:\r\nIn 10.9, Apple finally added a long-overdue native library import mechanism to their venerable AppleScript language, for which we are grateful. However, this library system would be vastly more useful if macOS would also include a small set of standard libraries that add commonly-needed general-purpose commands not provided by AppleScript itself.\r\n\r\nSuch a library has been proposed in rdar://28465563."
