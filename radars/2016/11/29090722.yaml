    description: "When loading a scene archive using the new GKScene loader for automatic entities/components initialization, the GKSKNodeComponent is not properly initialized when another archive-defined Component tries to reference it during its didAddToEntity() call.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps:\r\n1. Open the sample project (A game template project with a simple GKComponent added with a didAddToEntity() implementation that references the GKSKNodeComponent's node and adds the project template's Pulse action to run continuously during its didAddToEntity() implementation, with that component then added to the GameScene.sks archive for the helloWorld label)\r\n2. Run it, see the crash\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe \"Hello World\" label continuously pulses.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe application crashes. GKSKNodeComponent does not have a reference to it's associated node, though it shouldn't have been able to be initialized or added to the entity without it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to track for the first update(:) call when the need exists for node-based initialization, but that adds expensive checking logic in to every game loop."
