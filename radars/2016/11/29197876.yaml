    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur CarPlay integration (Berlin Philharmonics - Digital Concert Hall) is broken when the iPhone runs iOS 10.0 or iOS 10.1. The main menu cells show no title and no disclosure triangle. After dragging the cells outside and inside of the visible rect the titles and disclosure triangles become visible. Seems there is a cell reuse problem. When selecting a cell, loading always fails with \"There was a problem loading this content.\" When running the app on iOS 9.3.5 everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start an app with CarPlay integration on an iPhone with iOS 10.0/10.1 or on the iOS Simulator with iOS 10.0/10.1\r\n2. Tap/Select a cell on the main menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCarPlay integration shows main menu item titles and disclosure triangles. Submenus are getting loaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCarPlay integration doesn't show titles and disclosure triangles on main menu cells. Submenus aren't loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone running iOS 10 / iOS Simulator running iOS 10\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
