    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter adding a Complication Bundle to my iOS app, I found that localized text was displayed in the wrong language anywhere the complication was shown in the Watch app on iPhone. When the sample placeholder template was displayed on the Watch itself, it was translated correctly. After some experimentation I discovered that even though my base language was English, it was ignoring the strings file in Base.lproj. Adding another copy of the strings file in en.lproj fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the attached app on an Apple Watch with watchOS 3\r\n2. Add the \"Complicated\" complication to a Modular face in the center (large) position\r\n3. Make sure the language is set to English\r\n4. Open the Watch app on the iPhone and look in the \"My Faces\" section or \"Face Gallery\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should display in English—the second line should read \"iPad Pro 9.7 and Apple Pencil\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Japanese localization is displayed, \"9.7インチiPad Pro、Apple Pencil\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.1.1 beta 2 (14S5869b) and iOS 10.2 (14C5069c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached screenshots IMG_0168.PNG and IMG_0169.PNG show the problem. Screenshots IMG_0170.PNG and IMG_0171.PNG demonstrate how the same code produces the correct results on the Apple Watch itself.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
