        Summary:
        When you create SFSafariViewController during controller presentation and then later try to present that SFSafariViewController, then the presented SFSafariViewController is blank.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        See attached sample project.

        Expected Results:
        Presented SFSafariViewController should be properly presented.

        Actual Results:
        Presented SFSafariViewController is blank.

        Notes:
        Looks like the underlying SFSafariViewController remote child view controller is not added to the window.
