    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://29403930\n\nSummary:\r\ncsrutil does not have an option to reset the SIP status back to \"All On\".\r\n\r\nIf you are already booted, there's absolutely no automated way to re-enable SIP on a device, or even at all without NetBoot, which doesn't work with 802.1x. \r\n\r\ncsrutil should allow you to re-enable (only) SIP despite being logged in. It would provide enterprise a way to guarantee SIP gets enabled even if someone disables it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable SIP from Recovery Partition.\r\n2. Restart and log into mac OS 10.12 as normal.\r\n3. `sudo csrutil enable`\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSIP should be re-enabled on next reboot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`csrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration. This tool needs to be executed from the Recovery OS.`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1 16B2555\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs in every 10.11 and 10.12 install with SIP."
