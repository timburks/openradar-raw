Launch Siri\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should connect to remote servers, and the user should be able to ask questions to which Siri responds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri cannot establish a connection and advises to wait a few moments and try again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.1/16B2555\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis stackoverflow thread also discusses this issue:\r\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253843/siri-on-macos-behind-a-corporate-proxy\r\n\r\n<included a tcpdump of a Siri request>\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue does not occur when the system is NOT behind a proxy.\r\n\r\n* Apple asked for further follow up by providing a sysdiagnose dump after installing using the SiriDebugLogging.mobileconfig profile"
