    description: "I used to be able to click on the Flagged entry in the Mailboxes and see all flagged messages.  With Sierra, you have broken them up into multiple mailboxes, but clicking on Flagged should show the union of all of them, not just am mysteriously empty mailbox folder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail 10.0 3226 Sierra 10.12.0"
