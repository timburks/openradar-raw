    description: "Summary:\r\nI don't know if this is a bug or just incomplete documentation. The method localizableTextProviderWithStringsFileTextKey: works when I use it to generate a template that's used to create a Complication Bundle. If I use to generate a template with live data then it does not work—it simply returns the supplied string. There's nothing in the documentation or header file to suggest it should only be used for Complication Bundles.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the attached app on an Apple Watch with watchOS 3\r\n2. Add the \"Complicated\" complication to a Modular face in the center (large) position\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second line of the complication should read \"The complication is loaded now\" if the language is set to English, or \"象は鼻が長い\" if the language is set to Japanese.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe key \"Modular_Large_Entry\" is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 through watchOS 3.1.1 beta 2 (14S5869b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Complicated.zip' was successfully uploaded."
