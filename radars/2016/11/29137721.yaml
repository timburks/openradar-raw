    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous iOS SDKs, it was possible to set an accessibilityLabel on a view controller's tabBarItem.  If you did so, then the UITabBarController would use that accessibilityLabel as the accessibilityLabel of the button in its tab bar corresponding to that view controller.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 8.1, you can still set the accessibilityLabel, but it is not used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set an accessibilityLabel on a view controller's tabBarItem to a value different to its title.\r\n2. View the corresponding button in accessibility inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccessibility inspector should show the given accessibilityLabel\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccessibility inspector shows the object's title\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.1 (8B62)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe behaviour is the same whether using the iOS 8.4 or the iOS 10 simulators.\r\n\r\nFor an example project, please see https://github.com/percysnoodle/tab-bug-tester"
