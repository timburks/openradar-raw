    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"keystroke\" function of System Events using AppleScript or from Objective-C with the ScriptingBridge framework, lowercase letters followed after an uppercase letter or symbol that requires the press of the shift key modifier appear as uppercase or mixed case.\r\n\r\nThis happens even though no modifier keys are pressed on the keyboard while executing the script. In fact no keys are pressed on the hardware keyboard at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, the actual output is different each time.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample script that illustrates the problem and a short video recording of my screen when the issue happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Script Editor\r\n2. Either open the attached sample script or paste this:\r\ntell application \"Terminal\"\r\n\tactivate\r\n\ttell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"This is a test\"\r\nend tell\r\n3. Watch the output in Terminal.app\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script should properly print each entered character in the correct casing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe casing is different from what was entered and differs with each run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta (16C41b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApproximately every 10 runs the output is actually correct.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Keystroke Test.scpt' and 'SystemEvents_Keystroke_Bug.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
