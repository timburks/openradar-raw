    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of our apps crashes after it has presented and used UIImagePickerControllers many times in a single session. When connected to Xcode 7.3.1, Xcode tells us that the device disconnected at the time of the crash. No crash log is produced, but the following appears in the console just before the crash:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the ImagePickerTest.xcodeproj in Xcode 7.3.1, and build and run it on a device with iOS 10.0.2 installed.\r\n2. Press the Camera button, and then Use Photo.\r\n3. Repeat step 2 until it crashes. On my device (an iPhone 6 Plus), this happened after about 70-80 uses.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user should be able to repeat step 2 without ever experiencing a crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs described above, the app crashes after about 70-80 uses of the camera button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2 (14A456)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn example app that demonstrates the problem is available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lolay/ImagePickerTest\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, 128GB"
