    description: "Summary:\r\nMy complication shows a countdown to a specific day using CLKRelativeDateTextProvider. For my Complication Bundle I supply a date that is 3 days in the future. When the complication is viewed in the Watch app on iPhone, it shows some other number of days, like \"44DAYS\" or \"51DAYS\". When the same placeholder template displays on Apple Watch, the expected \"3DAYS\" count is shown.\r\n\r\nThis does a poor job of illustrating how my complication might be useful. Showing something a few days away is helpful, showing something a month a half away is far less so. I could supply static text for the Complication Bundle, but as far as I can tell there's no way to get it to display correctly. The system uses small caps for \"DAYS\", and I don't know of any way to do that with static text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the attached app on an Apple Watch with watchOS 3\r\n2. Add the \"Complicated\" complication to a Modular face in the center (large) position\r\n3. Open the Watch app on the iPhone and look in the \"My Faces\" section or \"Face Gallery\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first line should say \"3DAYS\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe results are inconsistent but it has always been some other, usually much higher number for me, like \"51DAYS\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.1.1 beta 2 (14S5869b) and iOS 10.2 (14C5069c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached screenshots IMG_0168.PNG and IMG_0169.PNG show the problem. Screenshots IMG_0170.PNG and IMG_0171.PNG demonstrate how the same code produces the correct results on the Apple Watch itself.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Complicated.zip' was successfully uploaded."
