    description: "Summary:\nWhen logging in to bugreport.apple.com and 2FA is enabled for your account, you have to enter the 6-digit verification code sent to one of your devices every single time. \nOther Apple-ID-related services such as iCloud offer a checkbox to remember the browser, but bugreport.apple.com (or idmsa.apple.com which seems to be handling the login process) doesnâ€™t.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Log in to bugreport.apple.com with an account that has 2FA enabled\n2) Wait for the timeout to log you out or hit the logout button\n3) Log in again\n\nExpected Results:\nSince this browser has already been verified you should not be prompted for the 2FA-code again\n\nActual Results:\nYou are prompted to enter your 2FA-code every time you log in"
