    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an AVPlayerViewController is presented from a UIWebView, after dismissal, the lock screen / command center will play the dismissed video even if the app plays separate audio via AVPlayer or similar.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the app playing audio in addition to the video presented by UIWebView, the video is re-presented and the audio plays along side the other AVPlayer audio\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee example app:\r\n1. Launch app, music begins to play\r\n2. Drag open the control center and pause the audio\r\n3. Dismiss control center\r\n4. Launch YouTube video after it loads in the UIWebView\r\n5. Dismiss YouTube video\r\n6. Drag open the control center and hit play\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app's audio continues playing (radio stream)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dismissed AVPlayerViewController presented by the UIWebView is re-presented and begins playing the YouTube video as well as playing the radio stream.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 and above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditionally, the UIWebView doesn't send an Audio Interrupt to give the app a chance to stop / restart its own audio. Notifications on UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification and UIWindowDidBecomeHiddenNotification are required to catch the presentation and dismissal of the video controller from UIWebView\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WebViewAVPlayerBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
