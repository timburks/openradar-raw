    description: "Mark Dalrymple30-Nov-2016 10:53 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a real-world problem with retain cycles. \"I'll use the cool memory graph tool that made good demo at WWDC\"\r\n\r\nSee attached gif file. It's a pain to navigate around because there is no zoom (to get a higher-level view of what's going on), and no scroll bars to scroll with.  Requiring freakton of click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag click-drag  to do anything.\r\n\r\nSo I'd love to have the ability to zoom.  And also scroll bars.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.1 (8B62)\r\n10.12 (16A323)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'cycles.gif' was successfully uploaded."
