        Summary:
        <AdSupport/ASIdentifierManager.h> doesn't specify nullability of +sharedManager or -advertisingIdentifier

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open ASIdentifierManager.h in Xcode

        Expected Results:
        +[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] should return `_Nonnull`. (I assume. There is no documentation that indicates what the nullability should actually be.)
        -[ASIdentifierManager advertisingIdentifier] should return `_Nullable` because of the following documentation:
        > In iOS 10.0 and later, the value of advertisingIdentifier is all zeroes when the user has limited ad tracking.
        > If the value is nil, wait and get the value again later. This happens, for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has unlocked the device.

        Actual Results:
        Nullability is unspecified.
