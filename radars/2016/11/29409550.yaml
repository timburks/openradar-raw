    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the date and time on an iOS device that has had a significant change to its date configuration, you cannot quickly change the year without connecting the device to iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Completely discharge the battery of an iPad or iPhone\r\n2. Charge it up\r\n3. Power it on\r\n4. Go to Settings\r\n5. Go to General\r\n6. Go to Date & Time\r\n7. Turn off 'Set Automatically'\r\n8. Spin the Month/Day dial.\r\n9. Keep spinning, repeatedly.\r\n10. Stop, look at the year, and get really annoyed because the year is now 2030.\r\n11. Spin backwards to set.\r\n12. Stop, look at the year, and get really annoyed because the year is now 2005.\r\n13. Start spinning forward again.\r\n14. Stop, look at the year, and get really annoyed because the year is now 2020.\r\n15. Rinse, repeat, and continue getting irritated because this should such a simple thing to do without plugging into a damn computer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen manually setting the date and time, a user should be able to trivially specify the year, the day, the month, and the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot set the year trivially because the UX doesn't let you actually specify a year.\r\nTo fix this, the user has to plug the device into a computer with iTunes.\r\nThis is not always an ideal situation to be in, as the user may not have a computer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll iOS versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n<Uploaded a video demonstration of the issue>\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device."
