    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have a UITextView and a block of attributed text that has a background and both indent and spacing in its paragraph style, typing return at the end of a line makes the caret disappear, until you start typing or change selection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the attached sample project, or set the text viewâ€™s attributtedText to a string with a background color, and a paragraph style with spacing and indent.\r\n2. Move the cursor to the end of any line.\r\n3. Type return\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe caret should be visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe caret disappears until you type or move the cursor. Deleting the newline also makes the caret disappear. Depending on the specific attributes, the caret may be partially seen blinking *behind* the background color.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
