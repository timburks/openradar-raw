    description: "Summary:\r\nCasting an NSMutableSet to a Swift Set<AnyHashable> generates the warning “Cast from ’NSMutableSet’ to unrelated type ‘Set<AnyHashable>’ always fails”, however the cast succeeds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPaste this code into a playground:\r\n\r\nimport UIKit\r\nlet stuff: NSMutableSet = [\"a\", \"q\", \"fourteen\"]\r\nlet q = stuff as? Set<AnyHashable>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warning is generated, as NSMutableSet can be cast just like an NSSet\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA warning is shown which contradicts the cast’s visible success\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have been introduced with the new automatic Foundation to Swift Stdlib conversion in Swift 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis warning does not happen for an NSSet, only NSMutableSet. See attached playground for an example. This occurs in stable Xcode 8.1 as well as Xcode 8.2 beta (8C30a)"
