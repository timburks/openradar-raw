        Summary:
        With iOS 10 or a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, Mail can predict where you want to move a message, which is a very useful feature. However, if your MacBooks does not have a Touch Bar this feature is not available. I suggest adding the intelligent “Move To“ button to Mail’s toolbar.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1.) Launch Mail on a MacBook with Touch Bar
        2.) Note the “Move To” button in the Touch Bar

        Expected Results:
        You should also be able to add the “Move To“ button to Mail’s toolbar

        Actual Results:
        The “Move To” button cannot be added to Mail’s toolbar

        Regression:
