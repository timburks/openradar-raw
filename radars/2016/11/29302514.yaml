    description: "Summary:\r\nIt appears that a Senior Engineer in Apple Automation has been fired. His interview contains some ominous suggestions at what Apple may be considering with regard to the future of automation and command line tools on macOS.\r\n\r\nSee http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/16/sal-soghoian\r\n\r\nThe comments in this interview strongly suggest that automation tools, including but not limited to UNIX CLI (shell, python, ruby, perl), System Services, Apple Events (JavaScript, AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, Scripting Bridge), Automator, Apple Configurator (AppleScript, Automator), and Application scripting support in Photos, iWork, Finder, Mail, and other Apple applications are in imminent danger of being eliminated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect to be able to access the command line, use Perl, Python, Ruby, Perl, sed, awk, grep, vi, and other, well-vetted and useful tools on an on-going basis. Indeed, it is the compelling reason that we, and all of our clients, choose the Mac as a platform.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThat will depend on Apple.\r\n\r\nPreferred results would be that the automation tools and workflows that entire industries depend on are preserved.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFuture versions and builds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe number of Macs affected by this for us would number about 200. But in total, the number of Macs affected by this that we don't manage, that developers don't write code on and use automation on, where automation is not an essential part of what both we and they do on a daily basis, would be innumerable.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
