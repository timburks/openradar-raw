    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"artworkUrl*\" fields returned from the iTunes Search API use http, not https. Just replacing the protocol with https results in a certificate error due to a host name mismatch (host is is4.mzstatic.com but the certificate has a248.e.akamai.net).\r\n\r\nOur backend uses the iTunes Search API then serves some of that data to our iOS app. Due to the coming changes with iOS ATS policy in January, this may not work. Yes it's possible to setup an exception but not following the policy defeats its purpose.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ncurl https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=302053341\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImage resources with https URLs\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nImage resources with http URLs"
