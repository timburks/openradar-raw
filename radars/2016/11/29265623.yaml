    description: "Area:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe are using iBeacon for our app to trigger events when entering or leaving the region of a specific iBeacon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nApp registers for monitoring iBeacon region with specific UUID, major and minor values.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEvery event of entering or leaving the region of the configured iBeacon should be fired and trigger the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it works as expected for some time but after some hours no events are triggered anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen iBeacon monitoring stops working as expected it sometimes helps to do one of the following:\r\n- Turn Wireless Networking Off/On\r\n- Turn Bluetooth Off/On\r\n- Reboot Device\r\n\r\nSometimes we get inside/outside region notifications when doing a phone call or when disconnecting from the car bluetooth connection - even when we were inside the iBeacon region the whole time.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
