    description: "Voiceover automatically expands \"Gov.\" to \"Governor\" – presumably to handle cases like \"Gov. Jerry Brown\". However, it does this even if the period is followed by further alphabetical characters as in \"GOV.UK\" or \"GOV.AU\" – which seems to be a common pattern for (e.g.) government websites.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Voiceover on iOS 10.1\r\n2. Visit https://www.gov.uk/\r\n3. Instruct Voiceover to read the page content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceover would read:\r\n\r\n[Skip to main content, link]\r\nGov UK, [link, banner, landmark]\r\nWelcome to Gov UK\r\nThe best place to find government services and information\r\nSimpler, clearer, faster\r\nSearch Gov UK\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nOr a sensible variant thereof (e.g. pronouncing the period in GOV.UK as it would in a url)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceover reads:\r\n\r\n[Skip to main content, link]\r\nGovernor, UK, [link, banner, landmark]\r\nWelcome to Governor, UK\r\nThe best place to find government services and information. Simpler, clearer, faster.\r\nSearch Governor, UK.\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 [14B72]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCannot reproduce on on OS X 10.11.6 (15G1108) or macOS 10.12.2b (16C48b) – this only appears to happen on iOS.\r\n\r\nWe believe (anecdotally) that this may have been happening since at least iOS 9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, Voiceover enabled, Daniel (Enhanced) Voice"
