    description: "Summary:\r\nSee title. I maintain an app that lets users import their Health XML data to their iPhones (http://lionheartsw.com/software/health-importer/). Due to this limitation, this app is unable to import all of their data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the HKActivitySummary documentation. Link: https://developer.apple.com/reference/healthkit/hkactivitysummary\r\n2. Look for documentation on this page on how to save activity summaries to the user's local health store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is documentation and an an API that allows developers to write Activity Summaries to Health.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou cannot save HKActivitySummary types to Health.app. From the documentation: \"You can instantiate your own HKActivitySummary objects (if needed), but you cannot save HKActivitySummary objects to the store.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64 GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
