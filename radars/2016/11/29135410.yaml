    description: "Peter Steinberger07-Nov-2016 09:04 AM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSpotlight was first created on the mac and brought to iOS in iOS 9, in the form of CoreSpotlight.framework. This is very useful.\r\n\r\nWe run almost all of our tests for the mac to be prepared for future things, and just discovered that CoreSpotlight is only a private framework on the Mac. it seems that at some point it was planned to be public but didn't made it based on https://twitter.com/steipete/status/795530512202952704\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCheck CoreSpotlight.headers\r\nFind that it's there on iOS but not on the mac.\r\nCheck Mac for CoreSpotlight in Private Frameworks\r\nDisassemble and check that it really is the same\r\nCry a little bit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCoreSpotlight should be accessible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCoreSpotlight is not accessible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCoreSpotlight must exist on the Mac for a while. I see that we can write custom importers but this is really archaic and CoreSpotlight is much more powerful - can be driven by an XPC process with much more control than dropping a binary into the Spotlight folder and asking the user for a restart...\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina MacBook Pro 2015\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
