    description: "Summary:\r\nIn watchOS 3.1.1 (14S5875b), the control centre screen no longer has the lock button. I don't see another way to lock the watch anymore. (Other than of course taking the watch off and putting it back on again). The button existed on the previous version.\r\n\r\n*Note, the reason I use this button, is because I sleep with the watch on. With the watch unlocked, I'll accidentally trigger all kinds of taps on the device (sometimes with my face).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to the control centre screen on an Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould have a button to lock the watch in order to prevent accidental taps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo lock button anymore."
