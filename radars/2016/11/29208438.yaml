    description: "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen using incremental link-time optimisation in Xcode, breakpoints won’t trigger…\r\n\r\nThe program will execute as if no breakpoints were set.\r\n\r\nThis only happen when LTO is set to incremental.\r\nTargets without LTO or with the old monolithic LTO are not affected.\r\n\r\nThis is always reproductible, no matter which language is used.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAttached is an example Xcode project which demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nIt only consist of a `main.m` file, with a “hello, world”.\r\n\r\nTry putting a breakpoint somewhere in the `main` function.\r\n\r\nNow there’re two schemes you need to test:\r\n\r\n\tLTO - With link-time optimisation.\r\n\tBreakpoint won’t trigger.\r\n\t\r\n\tNO-LTO - Without link-time optimisation.\r\n\tBreakpoint will be hit as expected.\r\n\r\n## Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe breakpoint should be hit with both schemes.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results\r\n\r\nBreakpoint is not hit when using the scheme with incremental LTO.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe issue always occurs when using incremental LTO.\r\n\r\n## Xcode Version/Build & OS X Version/Build\r\n\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta (16C41B)\r\nXcode version 8.1 (8B62)\r\n\r\nNote that the issue is also reproductible with Xcode version 8.2 beta (8C23)"
