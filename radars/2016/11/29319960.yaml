        Summary:
        In-App Purchases is a better way for developer to make money because App Store doesn't allow trials. However, Volume Purchase Program doesn't support In-App Purchases. I've already lost thousands of potential purchases due to this limitation.

        So I'm asking for In-App Purchase support in Volume Purchase Program.
