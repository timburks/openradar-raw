    description: "Summary:\r\nI have found that Xcode 8 frequently (but not always) crashes when I click the green zoom button to exit full screen mode.  \r\n\r\nWhen this happens, if I relaunch Xcode, then immediately click the green zoom button, I am able to leave full screen mode. The problem generally occurs after working with Xcode in full screen mode for some time.  I cannot make it happen \"on demand\", which is why I have entered \"Sometimes\" for \"Reproducibility\", but I can state that it happens quite frequently, perhaps several times a day.  (Checking my DiagnosticReports folder I see that it has happened three times already today, for instance.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 8 and enter full screen mode.\r\n2. Work for some time.\r\n3. Click the green zoom button to exit full screen mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode 8 exits full screen mode without crashing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode 8 crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1 (8B62)\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2657)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem existed in Xcode 8.0, and appears to exist in the current Xcode 8.2 beta as well.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro11,5 \r\n16 GB RAM\r\n512 GB SSD\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2657)"
