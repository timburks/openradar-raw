    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nRecently I’ve started receiving calendar spam via GMail. Even though I’ve deleted the appointments from the web interface, they remain on my iPhone and I continue to get alerts for them on my Apple Watch. This is annoying and a poor user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Send yourself a calendar invitation\r\n2. Observe there is no way to delete the invitation without responding (declining calendar spam confirms your account as active)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to delete calendar appointment invitations without responding\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to delete calendar appointment invitations without responding\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.
