    description: "Summary:\r\nFinder will not display newly create normal (i.e. non-hidden) files until machine is rebooted, or Finder relaunched (via CMD+OPT+ESC)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create screenshot with default settings\r\n2. Look for screenshot on Desktop (can see it by performing `ls` on ~/Desktop)\r\n3. Relaunch Finder, screenshot appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNaturally, newly created (by any means), normal files should should up instantaneously in Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNewly created files are not visible in Finder until a relaunch is performed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI just attempted to recreate the issue and it did occur, however I am not sure what relevant logs you need for me to provide to show.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt is not constant, however, it occurs more often than not. For a short time after a reboot or relaunch, it acts as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
