    description: "When executing UI Automation tests, by using xcodebuild command, around test 170 - 180 executions fails due an error:\r\n\r\n>     t =     6.05s             Wait for app to idle\r\n>     t =   126.71s                 App event loop idle notification not received, will attempt to continue.\r\n>     t =   126.71s                 App animations complete notification not received, will attempt to continue.\r\n\r\nAll next test cases will not execute and all will have this error message:\r\n\r\n>     t =     4.43s             Waiting for accessibility to load\r\n>     t =    64.65s                 Assertion Failure: testUITests.swift:21: UI Testing Failure - App accessibility isn't loaded\r\n\r\nThis issue also exists if the tests were started from Xcode. Issue may be similar to 29393034, where (probably) some resources are not released after tests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using terminal go to folder where the attached project was extracted\r\n2. Execute UI tests using:\r\nxcodebuild -project test.xcodeproj -scheme test -destination \"platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6s,OS=10.1\" test\r\n3. Tests should fail after `testExample70`\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n1. Open attached project using Xcode.\r\n2. Run tests on scheme test.\r\n3. Tests should fail after `testExample70`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll test should be executed and finished\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter reaching test (around) 170 all next tests are failing due assertion \"App accessibility isn't loaded\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmasOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\nXcode 8.1 (8B62)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached logs from xcodebuild command, Xcode and compressed project with tests."
