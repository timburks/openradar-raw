    description: "macOS has supported 10-bit color since 10.11.2 (per https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_11_2.html) and this was further refined in 10.12 Sierra.\r\n\r\nI am using a supported device (iMac, Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and I see a pixel depth of ARGB2101010 in System Information.\r\n\r\nHowever, screenshots created with the built-in Grab tool, the screencapture command-line tool, and keyboard shortcuts are always reduced to 8-bit depth.  In addition, both the built-in Digital Color Meter application and the Pixie developer tool show banding in gradients.  Third party tools also show banded gradients, which I assume is due to a reduction to 8-bit depth.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a screenshot on a Mac which supports 30-bit depth.  This can be done using Pixie, Grab, screencapture, Digital Color Meter, third party tools, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreenshot doesn't lose color depth fidelity.  Gradients are smooth.  Screenshot file is saved as a 16-bit PNG.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreenshot gradients have slight banding.  Screenshot file is a 8-bit PNG.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2\r\n10.12 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac, Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n––––\r\n\r\nNote: I filed 26885406 to cover the lack of 10-bit in public API.  This bug is about Apple's own programs having the same issue."
