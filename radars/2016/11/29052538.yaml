    description: "We have been try to put together a more modern build script for producing an Enterprise distributable ipa. Our current system uses the ‘scrum PackageApplication’ mechanism; but this is now deprecated and has bugs with the ‘Resource Rules’ flag. The plan is to adopt an xcodebuild archive & exportArchive approach; but the exportArchive phase always produces an \"No applicable devices found.\" error. \n\nIf I import the produced build script xcarchive into Xcode and do the Enterprise export manually, then it works as expected.\n\nI put together a sample Xcode project (the default iOS template) and included a minimal build script to show this problem. Running ./build.sh will perform an xcodebuild+archive and xcodebuild+export. The export fails. The project signing & provisioning will have to be modified to match what you have available.\n\nI also included the xcdistributionlogs from a sample build. These note a failure in a ruby script (fileutils.rb); but I’m not sure if that is related to the export failure."
