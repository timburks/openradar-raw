    description: "Summary:\r\nA `com.apple.product-type.bundle.unit-test` product type is considered by Xcode's scheme UI to actually be of type `com.apple.product-type.framework`. This leads tools that rely on Xcode's interpretation of product types to have incorrect results. Such as Carthage: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Realm.xcodeproj: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa.\r\n2. Notice that the `ObjectServerTests` target has a product type entry of `com.apple.product-type.bundle.unit-test` in its `project.pbxproj` file: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/v2.1.0/Realm.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj#L1745-L1765\r\n3. Open Realm.xcodeproj in Xcode.\r\n4. Notice that the \"Object Server Tests\" scheme has the same icon as framework schemes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScheme should be considered by Xcode to be a unit test bundle product type.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScheme was considered by Xcode to be a framework product type.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis causes Carthage to build Realm's Object Server Tests unit test bundle as if it was a framework, causing Carthage's build time to grow beyond reasonable expectation. I only reference Carthage and Realm as real-world manifestations of this Xcode bug, not that Apple is responsible for the maintenance of those projects."
