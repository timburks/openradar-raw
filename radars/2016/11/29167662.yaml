    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://25557754\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPlease create a tool similar to createinstallmedia that generates an Apple Package that when installed, runs an automated OS X install. Perhaps 'createinstallpkg'. Currently, createOSXinstallPkg has the functionality required, but may stop working with future SIP updates. See https://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg for more specifics.\r\n\r\nThis tool should:\r\n\r\n1. Build a standard Apple package that is used to update OS X on either the current boot drive or the target that the package is installed to.\r\n2. Allow for additional Apple packages to be specified and run after the OS X install is complete (JAMF QuickAdd, Munki, Puppet, Chef, etc).\r\n\r\nThe resulting package which this tool creates must:\r\n\r\n1. Install like a standard Apple package and stage files for the OS X install\r\n2. Upon next reboot, start a fully automated OS X installation on the target drive (even if not the originally booted drive)\r\n3. This *must* work on a system with SIP enabled (10.11+)\r\n\r\nThis will immediately affect 150 Mac we manage.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFuture releases of the OS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
