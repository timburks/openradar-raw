        Summary:
        It is possible for an application to create a MPMediaPlaylist using `getPlaylist(with:creationMetadata:completionHandler:)` and to add items to the playlist but it's not possible to remove or reorder existing items.

        The ability to remove and reorder existing items would be very useful for applications that help users construct playlists (e.g. our applications: WeddingDJ and PartyMonster).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Fetch a playlist using `MPMediaLibrary.default().getPlaylist(...)`
        2. Attempt to modify the returned playlist

        Expected Results:
        An API should be available for removing & reordering items in a MPMediaPlaylist.

        Actual Results:
        No API exists.

        Regression:
        No API exists as of iOS 10.1.1
