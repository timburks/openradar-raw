    description: "A developer has already begun work on a version of this:\r\n\r\nhttps://hhas.bitbucket.io/welcome.html\r\n\r\nand is willing to turn over his work to Apple.\r\n\r\nThis would allow Apple to phase out AppleScript (or move it to legacy status) which has many problems and deficiencies and replace it with a modern solution to user automation using a new Apple-created programming language that already is growing rapidly in popularity. This would also have the potential to greatly increase the number of people using Macs for automation due to the large number of developers already using Swift."
