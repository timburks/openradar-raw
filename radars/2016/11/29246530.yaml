    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen resizing a webgl context on a MacBook (Pro, air) with ONLY integrated intel graphics (several different versions have been tested), memory seems to leak.  This has been tested in multiple browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox), leading me to believe it could be a leak in the integrated graphics driver using system memory.\r\n<< code >>\r\n                        var container = document.getElementById(\"container\");\r\n                        var canvas = document.createElement(\"canvas\");\r\n                        container.appendChild(canvas);\r\n                        canvas.width = 500;\r\n                        canvas.height = 500;\r\n                        var delta = 100;\r\n                        canvas.getContext(\"webgl\")\r\n                        animate();\r\n                        function animate() {\r\n\r\n                                requestAnimationFrame( animate );\r\n                                canvas.width += delta;\r\n                                canvas.style.width = canvas.width;\r\n                                canvas.style.height = canvas.height;\r\n                                delta *= -1\r\n                        }\r\n\r\n<< end code >>\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Open Activity Monitor, and switch to the memory tab\r\n2.  Ensure the Memory Used line at the bottom stays visible during the test\r\n3.  Open the web page in the attached tarball in a browser\r\n4.  The Memory Used line grows very rapidly, until it gets close to physical memory, at which point compressed memory begins growing.  Eventually this can cause the browser to crash.  This memory usage does not seem to be attributed to the specific browser process.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect memory to remain stable and the browser to not crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4.  The Memory Used line grows very rapidly, until it gets close to physical memory, at which point compressed memory begins growing.  Eventually this can cause the browser to crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on 10.10 -> 10.12.  I am currently running on a macbook air using 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis seems to be tied to Intel integrated graphics across all recent versions of OSX we managed to test ( a customer tested Sierra ).\r\n\r\nMy MacBook Pro that has NVidia + Intel graphics, the browser never crashes and I don't seem memory creep.  I also attempted to use the program gfxCardStatus to lock it to the Intel, but I still did not see the problem."
