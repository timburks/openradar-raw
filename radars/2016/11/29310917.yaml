    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://23012739\r\n\r\nIn Mail, when you swipe to view actions, you can continue swiping to activate the default action. However, the equivalent UI in UIKit, UITableViewRowAction does not support this behavior, even though there is a default style. When the default style is selected, continuing to swipe should activate the right most action.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile you're at it, please also consider adding an icon as an alternative to the string title. Mail.app uses icons and this useful for 3rd party apps, too! See rdar://17360460"
