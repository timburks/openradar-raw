    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"Add to Notes\"-command in iOS Mail on a PDF attachment, Notes only saves the first page of the PDF.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a 2-page PDF in Mail\r\n2. Click Share > Add to Notes, Save\r\n3. Open Notes and the newly created note\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe note should have the exact same file as an attachment as the email attachment from which it was created\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe note only contains the first page of the attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 (14B100)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAt first glance this looks like a serious data loss issue, however it's simply a matter of poor UI. When the user opens the new note, there is absolutely no indication that the attached file has multiple pages. The user is supposed to know to double-tap the attachment. Either make single-tapping the PDF display the whole document or create a visual cue that there are more than one page.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S 64GB"
