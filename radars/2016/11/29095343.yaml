        Summary:
        We created two new apps in iTunes connect as the owner/admin of the account. Those apps did not show up in the app list AND we weren’t able to create any other apps with the app id’s we used for the ones that disappeared

        Our app ids:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ljr6yjzpxe6vin/Screenshot%202016-11-03%2013.41.12.png?dl=0
        App list: https://www.dropbox.com/s/oyswfxbvhrz7ikw/Screenshot%202016-11-03%2013.42.42.png?dl=0
        New app id selector: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cizflp2bonmfowu/Screenshot%202016-11-03%2013.43.05.png?dl=0

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create an app in an iTunes connect account.  Not sure what other criteria to reproduce as this has only happened to me once before

        Expected Results:
        That you can see apps you create

        Actual Results:
        You cannot see the app
