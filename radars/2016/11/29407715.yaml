    description: "Internet Recovery only applies the current macOS InstallESD.dmg to Touch Bar MacBook Pros. \r\n\r\nGiven that internet is required to facilitate this, Internet Recovery should also download/install/activate the EFI Embedded OS component for Touch Bar MacBook Pros.\r\nReproduce steps\r\n1. Boot into Internet Recovery with Touch Bar MacBook Pros\r\n2. Open Disk Utility and wipe entire drive\r\n3. Re-install macOS Sierra 10.12.1\r\n4. Upon finished installation, Setup Assistant will ask you to install a Critical Update and connect to Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\nInternet Recovery should intelligently contact gs.apple.com, download the preflight package and re-install/activate the TouchBar EFI partition.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nSierra SetupAssistant asks to install a Critical Update and connect to WiFi"
