    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UIImagePickerController is used to take a photo using the camera, it resets [UIApplication idleTimerEnabled] to YES, even if the app had set it to NO before.\r\n\r\nThis causes the screen to auto-lock when that behavior is not what the developer intended. At best, this is annoying to the user; at worst, it's a serious safety hazard (e.g. for navigation apps).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached sample project.\r\n2. Tap \"Take Photo\" and take a photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label shows \"Idle timer disabled\", since that is what the app had set it to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label shows \"Idle timer enabled\", which is not what the app had set it to.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.5, iOS 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nStack trace where it's reset:\r\n#7\t0x000000018a8490bc in -[CMKCaptureController _resetIdleTimer] ()\r\n#8\t0x000000018a844aa8 in -[CMKCaptureController stopPreview] ()\r\n#9\t0x000000018a7f987c in -[CMKCameraView viewWillBeRemoved] ()\r\n#10\t0x000000018a834954 in -[CMKCameraViewController viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#11\t0x000000018c4f488c in -[PLUICameraViewController viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#12\t0x0000000186801434 in -[UIViewController _setViewAppearState:isAnimating:] ()\r\n#13\t0x0000000186879024 in -[UIViewController __viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#14\t0x00000001868c5100 in -[UINavigationController viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#15\t0x0000000186a68330 in -[UIImagePickerController viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#16\t0x0000000186801434 in -[UIViewController _setViewAppearState:isAnimating:] ()\r\n#17\t0x0000000186879024 in -[UIViewController __viewWillDisappear:] ()\r\n#18\t0x0000000186b4827c in __56-[UIPresentationController runTransitionForCurrentState]_block_invoke ()\r\n#19\t0x0000000186a9b0c8 in _runAfterCACommitDeferredBlocks ()\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImagePickerSample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
