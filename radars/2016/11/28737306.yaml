    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a S/MIME encrypted message which contains attachments is opened, the attachments are not properly displayed upon decryption.\r\nWhen trying to save the attachments to the Desktop they contain gibberish.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if instead of the body data of the decrypted mime part correlating to the selected attachment to be saved, the body data of the encrypted mime part correlating to the selected attachment is actually saved.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- Receive a S/MIME encrypted message with one attachment being an image\r\n- Upon decryption the attachment is visible but it's not displayed inline as expected. After saving the attachment, it appears as if the S/MIME encrypted body is saved as content of the attachment instead of the attachment included in the decrypted body.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if the MCAttachment is not connected to the decrypted mime body but rather to the encrypted mime body which leads Mail.app to access the right mime part but on the wrong mime body.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start composing a new message\r\n2. Select a sender and receiver which you have an S/MIME certificate for\r\n3. Insert an image into the message\r\n4. Send the message\r\n5. Open the message and allow Mail.app to decrypt the message\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the proper inline presentation of the image within the decrypted message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee a broken image icon (\"question-mark-icon\") instead of the inline presentation of the image.\r\nTry to save the image attachment and try to open the image in Preview -> will fail since the saved file contains the encrypted body instead of the image.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 10.0/3226, macOS 10.12 Sierra/16A323 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nfrom the code it appears the parsedMessage would have to be called on decryptedMimeBody instead of the original mime body.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on MacBook Air 13\", 2Ghz Intel Core i7, 8GB DDR3 Ram"
