    description: "Summary:\r\nFiles that are \"ineligible\" for iCloud Drive storage (e.g. image files in an Xcode Asset Catalog) are lost without warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" in iCloud Drive preferences\r\n2. Create an Xcode project on the Desktop\r\n3. Add assets to the project's asset catalog\r\n4. When the machine's local disk space gets low, the system will \"purge\" the project folder from local storage and make it available to download from iCloud Drive when needed.\r\n5. Download the project from iCloud Drive to local storage and open in Xcode; the asset catalog will be empty.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers should be able to store files of any kind in iCloud Drive with the confidence that they won't be corrupted or lost by the service â€” especially when this is the default behavior of the system.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the system must warn users when ineligible files are added to iCloud Drive, informing them that when the system reclaims local storage space, ineligible files will be lost.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCloud Drive does not warn the user of ineligible files, allowing files to be lost entirely when local disk space is reclaimed.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, an Xcode asset catalog can be downloaded from iCloud Drive, but each \"ineligible\" file contained in the catalog has been renamed \".filename.extension.icloud\" and can no longer be opened.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese files couldn't be restored on iCloud.com. Settings > Restore Files completely failed to load with the error \"There was a problem loading restorable files.\""
