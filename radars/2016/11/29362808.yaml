    description: "Summary:\r\nAn AVPlayer instance does not resume the playback of an audio livestream after pausing it for at least 120 s or more. If AVPlayer.play() or AVPlayer.rate = 1.0 is called, nothing happens. Checking AVPlayer.reasonForWaitingToPlay is always AVPlayerWaitingToMinimizeStallsReason while AVPlayerItem.isPlaybackBufferFull is true. AVPlayerItem.status is ReadyToPlay. There is also no error that is pointing to a problem.\r\n\r\nI've attached a Playground to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVPlayer instance using an audio livestream url\r\n2. AVPlayer.play()\r\n3. AVPlayer.pause() after 15s \r\n4. AVPlayer.play() after 120s\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe instance should recover and play or at least it should report an error to give the developer a chance to handle it himself\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe instance is waiting forever to minimize stalls while PlaybackBufferFull = true and status = ReadyToPlay \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 Xcode 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoesn't matter which device you are using. It's happening in a playground, on the simulator and on a real device as well.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Player.playground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
