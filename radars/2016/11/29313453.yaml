        Summary:
        MPMusicPlayerController doesn't expose any API to make modifications to the queue after it has been set without submitting an entirely new queue (which interrupts playback if the MPMusicPlayerController is currently playing).

        Using MPMusicPlayerController, it should be possible to:
        1. Add items to the queue at any position
        2. Remove items from the queue at any position
        3. Move an item from one position to another position in the queue

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to add, remove, or reorder items to MPMusicPlayerController that is currently playing an item

        Expected Results:
        API should exist to add, remove, and move items in the MPMusicPlayerController queue.

        Actual Results:
        No API exists. A new queue must be set on the MPMusicPlayerController using one of the `setQueue...` methods (which interrupts playback)

        Regression:
        This API doesn't exist as of 10.1.1

        Notes:
        This functionality would be useful for apps that want to implement behaviour similar to the "Play Next" and ‚ÄùUp Next" reorder feature found in the system Music app on iOS.
