    description: "When observing viewControllers content of UIPageViewController from delegate's method `pageViewController:didFinishAnimating:previousViewControllers:transitionCompleted:` we can see that it contains the wrong controller when scrolling to the first/last page with bouncing (it happens on UIPageViewControllers that are not full screen width)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI provide a sample project where this can be easily reproduced:\r\n1. Run project PageControllerScrollIssue on iPad simulator\r\n2. Drag page controller from the right side and scroll to the left until it bounces\r\n\r\nYou can also reproduce by running UI tests provided with the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen scrolling with bouncing to first/last page, I expect to see the page control updated reflecting the page you end in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page control is not updated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9 and iOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt looks this has already been reported, see https://openradar.appspot.com/23856708\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PageControllerScrollIssueProject.zip' and 'pageviewcontroller-scrolling-issue.gif' were successfully uploaded."
