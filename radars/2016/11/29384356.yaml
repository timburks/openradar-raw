    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a view controller is presented using UIPresentationController it is still possible to focus Voice Over on the elements bellow the modal (dimming view). This is especially confusing if the modal uses custom size and allows background content to be partially visible (for example presenting over a table view).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn Voice Over OFF\r\n2. Launch the app\r\n3. Tap the \"Show modal\" button\r\n4. Turn Voice Over ON after the modal has been presented\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoice Over won't allow focusing (by accidentally tapping) on the \"Show modal\" button or the \"Make sure to...\" label when the modal is presented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoice Over allows focusing on any element that's accessible within the initial screen (bellow the modal).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe sample project is also available on GitHub - https://github.com/dusi/accessibility\r\nThe recorded demo is available at - https://github.com/dusi/accessibility/blob/master/Accessibility/demo.MOV\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis problem can be consistently reproduced on iPhone & iPad devices with iOS 10.\r\nThis problem doesn't seem to happen on 5.5\" devices (iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus)"
