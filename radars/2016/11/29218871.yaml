        Summary:
        In the column, you can't actually click on your device to show the device settings. You need to click the smaller icon in the (unnecessary) bar.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try clicking the device listed under "Devices"

        Expected Results:
        To see the overview screen of the device.

        Actual Results:
        It just opens the accordeon below the icon.

        Notes:
        Make iTunes great again!
