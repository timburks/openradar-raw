    description: "A scene loaded using GKScene(fileNamed:) does build/load entities and components from scenes referenced through SKReferenceNodes.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps:\r\n1. Open attached project (using the base game template, create a sample component that adds the pulse animation action, rigged it to a Green SKSpriteNode in the GameScene, created an additional scene containing a Red SKSpriteNode with the same sample component, and used that scene as a reference node in GameScene)\r\n2. Run the project\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nBoth Green (local node) and Red (referenced node) boxes should be pulsing.\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nOnly the Green box pulses.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLoading the referenced scene instead of the GameScene confirms that the Red box is configured properly, as it does pulse in that manner. Print statements are added in the sample component's didAddToEntity() that confirms only one component is created when loading the GameScene, where the expectation is that two would be."
