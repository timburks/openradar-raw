    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen pairing a second watch in addition to one already paired, and enabling Activity on that second watch, all achievements are wiped -- only on the iOS Activity app, however. History and workout data remains intact, however, the achievements appear as though they are able to be completed, but after completing an achievement you had completed before (i.e. \"First Workout\" for certain category), no achievement is rewarded. The watch still thinks that the achievements are there, but the iOS Activity app doesn't.\r\n\r\nIf you go to a day that you earned an achievement, i.e. Thanksgiving Day, for the Thanksgiving 5K achievement, the \"Achievements\" section is shown under the rings and move/exercise/stand data. This should show the achievement that was completed on that day. However, the section is blank. It knows you've completed an achievement that day because otherwise the section wouldn't be visible at all, but the achievement just flat-out isn't there.\r\n\r\nThis is a MAJOR issue for users of multiple watches! I can no longer earn many achievements that I had already earned before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair an Apple Watch to an iPhone using the \"Watch\" app included in iOS.\r\n2. Set up Activity.\r\n3. Complete an achievement.\r\n4. Set up another Apple Watch and pair it to the same iPhone.\r\n5. Set up Activity on that watch.\r\n6. Achievement data disappears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe achievement data should still be intact from the first-paired watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe achievement data is not intact from the first-paired watch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nFirst-paired watch: Apple Watch Series 2 (42mm) - watchOS 3.1 (14S471)\r\nSecond-paired watch: Apple Watch Sport (38mm) - watchOS 3.1 (14S471)\r\n\r\nPaired to iPhone 7 - iOS 10.1.1 (14B150) (also tested on iOS 10.2 beta 4 (14C82) - same issue)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has occurred every time it has been tested.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
