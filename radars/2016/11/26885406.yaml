    description: "Summary:\r\nSystem Information states that my iMac's display is using a Pixel Depth of 30-bit color:\r\n\r\n  Pixel Depth:\t30-Bit Color (ARGB2101010)\r\n\r\nIn addition, several applications have windows which are reporting 16bpc (although some application windows are 8bpc).\r\n\r\nWhen the main display is operating in non-8bpc mode, I would expect the screencapture command-line tool, CGWindowListCreateImage, and CGDisplayCreateImage to all return CGImage objects with >8 bits per component.  Currently, the returned images are always 8bpc.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to create accurate color meter tools or screen capture tools.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a screenshot, use CGWindowListCreateImage, or use CGDisplayCreateImage on a 10-bit display in the P3 color space.\r\n2. The resulting image file or CGImage correctly has the P3 color space assigned, but has a depth of 8-bit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 Beta (16A201w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
