    description: "iTunes cannot reliably stream music to an Apple TV via Airplay, when iOS Music.app and macOS System Sound Preferences can.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen attempting to stream music from iTunes via Airplay, it allows you to select the Airplay device (in this case, Apple TV). Upon selecting \"Play\", it then waits with a message \"Connecting to Apple TV\". After a couple of minutes. it fails to connect, giving \"An error occurred when connecting to the Airplay device Apple TV. The network connection timed out\". \r\n\r\nAirplay streaming works fine from iOS 10.11.1 Music.app to the same Apple TV, same wifi network.\r\n\r\nSelecting the Apple TV as the system sound output in audio Output Device preference also works fine, indicating that there is nothing wrong with the Apple TV or the network.\r\n\r\nRestarting the Mac will fix this, until the error happens again.\r\n\r\nIf there is just a single Apple TV on the network, or if there are multiple Airplay receivers on the network, regardless, iTunes will not connect to any of them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMusic should stream to the Apple TV via Airplay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMusic does not stream to the Apple TV until you reboot the computer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.5.3.17 for macOS (also happened with previous iTunes versions, previous macOS versions)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nscreen capture video of the bug in action https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1517/iTunes_Airplay-fail.m4v\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro10,1\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i7\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.3 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t6 MB\r\n  Memory:\t8 GB\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tMBP101.00EE.B0A\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t2.3f36\r\n\r\nWifi network 802.11n, Sky Broadband 5GHz, Channel 36, 40MHz spread, \"excellent\" connection.
