    description: "In a modest poll of colleagues, friends, family and follows; every person indicated that the App Size in the App Store indicates how much data it will take to download the file.   But this is not true.\r\n\r\nPeople care about a few specific things in determining a download:\r\n1) how will this impact my data plan if I'm on cellular\r\n2) if I have auto-updates enabled for cellular, I care even more\r\n3) how long will it take to download the bytes (they already can guesstimate their speed, they just need the download size to guess at how long it will take)\r\n\r\nI would ask for a reconsideration in how App Size is presented in the App Store.  Either change the \"Size\" to be for download size, or split the \"Size\" to be \"Download Size\" and \"Install Size\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn an iPhone 6\r\n\r\n1) Open App Store\r\n2) Find Twitter App\r\n3) Open Twitter App's page\r\n4) Examine Size Information\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"size\" indicates download size (43.3MBs)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"size\" indicates install size (84.9MBs)"
