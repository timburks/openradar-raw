    description: "Summary:\nAttempting to authenticate to a http/https proxy server using NTLM (SPNEGO) results in a complete failure to load web pages\nAuthenticating to the same web proxy array using basic authentication is no problem and works as expected\nOur proxy servers are bluecoat appliances authenticating to Active Directory\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Restore iPad with iOS 10.2b2 (14C5069c)\n2. Fill out setup assistant and connect to wifi network\n3. Configure proxy server address for wifi network - in this case 'Auto' PAC URL is distributed via DHCP (Pac file attached)\n4. Open Safari\n5. Receive prompt to enter proxy authentication details\n6. Enter in account credentials to authenticate to proxy server\n7. Open safari, attempt to load a http or https website. \n8. Note that no web pages load.\n\nExpected Results:\nAfter entering account credentials to authenticate against the proxy server http and https web pages should load immediately in safari.\n\nActual Results:\nWeb pages do not load and instead the requests time out and safari presents a unable to connect to server message\n\nRegression:\nProblem does _not_ occur in the production release of iOS 10.1.1 14B100\n\nNotes:\nAttached packet capture obtained from wireshark on an iMac with iPad connected via USB and using the RVI interface to capture all packets from the iPad from a clean restore.\nAttached proxy.pac file which contains our PAC file \nAttached dhcp packet.txt showing dhcp packet information for the iMac, this will be very similar to the dhcp packet received on the iPad"
