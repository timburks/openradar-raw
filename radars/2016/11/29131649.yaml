    description: "Peter Steinberger06-Nov-2016 10:03 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRadarWeb should offer to remember the browser when 2-factor authentication is used. Currently I have to enter the 6-digit code *every* single time I log on. This is time consuming and fankly somewhat annoying. Other parts offer to \"Remember the Browser\" however RadarWeb does not offer that, neither with latest Safari, Chrome now Firefox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog into radar.apple.com with an account that has 2-FA auth enabled\r\nObserve that you have to enter the 6-digit code\r\nLog out, log in again. See that you have to enter a 6-digit code - again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRadarWeb should offer to remember the browser when 2-factor authentication is used. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently I have to enter the 6-digit code *every* single time I log on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.1, latest Safari\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina MacBook Pro 2015\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
