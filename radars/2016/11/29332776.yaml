    description: "This request has previously been filed by another user. Please see:\r\n\r\nhttp://openradar.appspot.com/28465563\r\n\r\nThis user has already started a standard library they will be happy to turn over to Apple, making it a cheap investment for the company. And it would be a tremendous addition to AppleScript saving users time and making the language more capable. It would be great to see this happen for the next version of MacOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe use AppleScript extensively in our design department. We have several scripts that save us a tremendous amount of time and write new scripts as appropriate situations come up. \r\nAdding a standard library would address one if its long standing deficiencies."
