    description: "Summary:\r\nTest coverage bar for 99% is not different than 100%, and you cannot resize that column. So there is chance to miss the most critical \"if\".\r\n\r\nYou can see the number in the tooltip but this is very inconvenient when your project is not a demo.\r\n\r\nPlease change the bar to number or make it yellow when not 100%, or make green when 100%. Add anything but help us to spot the missed case immediately without expanding and tooltips.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run your Tests\r\n2. Open Report navigator\r\n3. Choose the latest Test\r\n4. Open Coverage tab in the Editor\r\n5. Find the image attached to this Radar which lacks information\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. There must be a column with a number or any other indicator that all code was run by Tests, at least make that column resizable so we can make it wider\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. There is no 100% indicator and all bars are blue, so you cannot find the difference between 99% and 100% without the mouse over\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra, Xcode 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAccording to https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/weve-got-you-covered/ this is a duplicate of rdar://21531774\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina 15\""
