    description: "Summary:\r\nI have multiple SpriteKit scene files. One of them fails to open and completely freezes Xcode when attempting to do so. Waited 5 minutes, nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThis happens on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with 16GB of memory and GT 750M GPU with either Xcode 8.1 (8B62) or 8.2 beta (8C30a) on macOS 10.12.2 Beta (16C48b). \r\nI can however open the very same file perfectly fine on a 2015 12\" Retina MacBook with the exact same software configuration. \r\n\r\nWhen the freeze occurs, hundreds of similar lines show up in Console.app: \r\nfault    09:29:05.284206 +0100    kernel    virtual IOReturn IOGraphicsAccelerator2::newUserClient(task_t, void *, UInt32, IOUserClient **): Too many contexts (0) or command queues (266) created, possibly leaking?\r\n\r\nFollowed by this: \r\ndefault    09:29:52.427902 +0100    kernel    stalling for detach from nvAccelerator\r\n\r\nOther (smaller) scene files load just fine and if I remove several nodes on the computer that can open the file, I'm also able to open it on the one that's having the issue.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the problematic sks file here: http://www.lemonmojo.com/temp/LMLevel5Scene.sks.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust open the .sks file in Xcode. Doesn't matter if it's being opened from within the project or just the file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe scene editor should be able to load the scene.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.1 (8B62) or 8.2 beta (8C30a) on macOS 10.12.2 Beta (16C48b).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with 16GB of memory and GT 750M GPU with either Xcode 8.1 (8B62) or 8.2 beta (8C30a) on macOS 10.12.2 Beta (16C48b)."
