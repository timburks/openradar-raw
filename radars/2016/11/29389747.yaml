    description: "Summary:\r\nToday, I received an invitation to an \"event\" from an unknown sender. The title of the event is \"$19.99 Ray-ban&Oakley Black Friday In-Store & Online\". It seems like there is no option to prevent such spam by blocking the author or any systems that detect such spammy invitations.\r\n\r\nThis issue is seems to occur more often recently: http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=calendar+spam\r\n\r\nI guess that if nothing is done against it, more and more spam will be sent like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI don't want to receive such spam. Maybe the spam-filters for iCloud e-mails could be applied here."
