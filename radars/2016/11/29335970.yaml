    description: "Summary:\r\n“if we're in the real pre-commit handler we can't actually add any new fences due to CA restriction” message in the console when rotating the device or simulator\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new single view project using Xcode 8 (I used Version 8.1-8B62)\r\n2. Run in simulator (tried 5s, 6, 6s plus), or on device (on 10.1-14B72 or on 10.0-14A345)\r\n3. Rotate device or simulator\r\n4. Look in the debug console for messages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI did not expect any message to be there, especially not in a near-empty project\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message “if we're in the real pre-commit handler we can't actually add any new fences due to CA restriction” appears in the debug console.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs both in the simulator or on the device, using various devices (didn’t try them all, but 5s, 6 and 6s Plus all have the same problem, so I don’t think it’s device specific).\r\nOccurs when running on iOS 10.0 (14A345) or 10.1 (14B72) - does not occur when running on iOS 9.3.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
