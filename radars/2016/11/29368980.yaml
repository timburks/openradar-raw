    description: "In system apps such as Mail and Safari as well as in own apps, typing a command key combination such as Cmd-R (in Mail) or Cmd-F (in Safari) on an external keyboard doesn't work when typed initially after launch (in case of Safari before the last viewed website finished to load). \r\n\r\nThe next time it does work.\r\n\r\nI tested on iPad Pro 9.7\" with Bluetooth Apple Keyboard as well as on the Simulator (in my own app)."
