    description: "Summary:\r\ncsrutil is not marked as restricted to the dynamic linker, and will use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH overrides if defined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in environment variables, for example, one that includes /opt/local/lib.\r\n2. As an example, libJPEG.dylib is included under /opt/local/lib.\r\n3. Run csrutil status, and receive an error if the third-party libJPEG.dylib isn't compatible.\r\n\r\n$ csrutil status\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart\r\n  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\r\n  Expected in: /opt/local/lib//libJPEG.dylib\r\n in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\r\nAbort trap: 6 (core dumped)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n$ csrutil status\r\ncsrutil is restricted, and uses the right dylib. Then produces SIP status.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n$ csrutil status\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart\r\n  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\r\n  Expected in: /opt/local/lib//libJPEG.dylib\r\n in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\r\nAbort trap: 6 (core dumped)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n16B2659\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is defined, third party libJPEG.dylib exists under DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
