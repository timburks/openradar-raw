    description: "Area:\r\nHomeKit (Home app)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nImmediately after launch, the Home app presents a view (seen in the attached screenshot) that says \"Loading Accessories and Scenes.\" There is an activity indicator, but the view never finishes loading, and the app can't be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Home app\r\n2. Immediately, the app will present a loading view\r\n3. Wait for the app to finish \"loading accessories and scenes\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should open and present the \"get started\" view, and allow you to begin setting up and using HomeKit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app presents the \"Loading Accessories and Scenes\" view, and is unable to move any further.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is also present on iPhone 6s. Both devices are signed into the same iCloud account, and iCloud Keychain is enabled. Both devices have the \"Home\" switch in iCloud settings enabled. Signing out of iCloud does not resolve the issue, and restoring either device does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2, 16GB, WiFi\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0119.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
