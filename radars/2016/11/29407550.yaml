    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app uses an NEPacketTunnelProvider to provide a custom VPN client to our users.\r\n\r\nIf the VPN is on at the time of an App Store or TestFlight update, the update will *always* hang, and I am aware that this is a known issue so I will not file yet another duplicate issue on that.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that sometimes, after a failed, and then subsequently succeeded update (by temporarily disabling the VPN), the VPN profile for our NEPacketTunnelProvider will disappear entirely. This doesn't happen every single time, but it happens often enough that our users are reporting it in increasing numbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app that provides an NEPacketTunnelProvider and saves it in VPN settings\r\n2. Make sure the VPN is enabled (we used ConnectOnDemand for this)\r\n3. Trigger an update via App Store or TestFlight\r\n4. App update will hang\r\n5. Temporarily turn off the VPN by disabling \"Connect On Demand\"\r\n6. App update will succeed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVPN profile is preserved\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVPN profile *sometimes* disappears (but not every time).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
