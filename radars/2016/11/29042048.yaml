    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a repository is used as a submodule in more than one location in the project repository structure, Xcode Server only checks it out in one location. As an abstract example, imagine I have an application repository A and two framework repositories F1 and F2. \r\n\r\nIn repository A, I add F1 and F2 as submodules.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that F1 depends on F2 and so F1 has also added F2 as a submodule.\r\n\r\nI apologise for my awful ascii art, but the repository structure is something like the following:\r\n\r\nA\r\n- F1\r\n  - F2\r\n- F2\r\n     \r\n\r\nThe isssue is that Xcode Server only checks out F2 once in one place, even though it is required in two locations.\r\n\r\nFor a more concrete example, I use git submodules to link frameworks that I have made into my apps. My applications and frameworks all use a shared set of configuration files to set Xcode build settings. These configuration files are added as a submodule to the app and framework repositories.\r\n\r\nAll of my frameworks use this shared set of configuration files. I also have one framework which links to another one as a submodule (as per the more abstract example above). Because of this, I have never been able to use Xcode bots for these projects, even though I have had great success with them using test projects and for building and testing the frameworks separately. I would love to use bots for my application projects!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have made an example repository that demonstrates this problem, so you can simply add it to Xcode bots and watch it fail to clone. It is a test application with one framework, with both the application and framework using a configurations submodule.\r\n\r\nAll the repositories are read-only so you won't need to set up any SSH keys. :-) \r\n\r\ngit://github.com/danielctull-playground/Application.git\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClone succeeds and building is able to occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error, probably about missing platform specification â€“ in this case because one of the configuration file sets is missing."
