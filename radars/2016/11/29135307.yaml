    description: "Peter Steinberger07-Nov-2016 08:51 AM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis bug is in macOS/OS X for years. I never bothered to write a radar because I have no idea how to reproduce, but it's extremely annoying and the only way to get rid of it is to reboot. Force-restarting Finder does not help. This is basically the single largest reason why I reboot macOS, and I got used to it as this bug exists for years now.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse macOS for a while/a few days. I use Xcode a lot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Finder Favorites section should always be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder Favorites section randomly disappears, making navigating extremely annoying and hard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHappened in 10.10. and 10.11 sporadically as well.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRetina MacBook Pro 2015\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsuccessfully uploaded."
