        Summary:
        Using MPMusicPlayerController, it's not possible to fade out playing music when pausing. This functionality is desirable when the application doesn't want to abruptly end playback (e.g. in the context of a wedding or party).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to fade out a playing MPMusicPlayerController on pause programatically

        Expected Results:
        An API should be available for fading out on pause with a duration. e.g. `pause(fadeoutDuration:)`

        Actual Results:
        `pause()` is the only API available and it pauses playback immediately

        Regression:
        This API doesn't exist as of iOS 10.1.1

        Notes:
        This functionality is desired in our applications WeddingDJ and PartyMonster.

        Using AVPlayer/AVAudioPlayer APIs is not a valid workaround because not all MPMediaItems can be played back with those APIs (e.g. Apple Music items)
