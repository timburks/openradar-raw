    description: "Peter Steinberger06-Nov-2016 10:12 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAVFoundation.h checks for watchOS via the existance of <AVFoundation/AVAnimation.h>. This file does not exist for watchOS, but does exist in watchSimulator, resulting in compile errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake any watchOS project. Include AVFoundation. Observe that it now compiles on watchOS, but fails in watchSimulator with 'CoreMedia/CMTime.h' file not found\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny code that compiles on watchOS should also compile on watchSimulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwatchSimulator can't compile code wheras watchOS as target can do.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has been observed by other people as well. https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/64649\r\n\r\nWe simply delete the file manually to patch up watchSimilator. There are more bugs so the patch is a bit larger. https://gist.github.com/steipete/fc633fe4ac812f5c696c3db6554509a9\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.1GM\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
