    description: "In Sierra there is new feature: Caps Lock can switch language for Hebrew, Chinese and other languages. But that doesn't work for Russian, Greek, Ukranian. Maybe for others too. I think that is a bug and should be fixed. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. add \"USA\" and \"Russian\" to \"Input Sources\" under \"Keyboard\" settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be checkmark \"Use Caps Lock to change input source\". Like for Hebrew or for Chinese\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such checkmark and Caps Lock doesn't switch language."
