    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Watch simulator does not present a permissions alert when requesting authorization. However, the behavior works as expected on actual hardware.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Apple's PotLoc sample project (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/PotLoc/Introduction/Intro.html)\r\n2. Open the project in Xcode\r\n3. Select the \"Potlock WatchKit App\" scheme \r\n4. Run the project on the simulator\r\n5. From the Apple Watch tap the \"Request\" button\r\n5. Tap the \"Request Location\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn the Apple Watch I should be told to accept permissions on my phone, and the phone should should display the Core Location permission alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've tried various permutations of operating systems on the Apple Watch and iPhone simulators, and end up with the same results."
