    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no API to know if accessories in a home can be accessed remotely using an Apple TV or iPad which reside at home. Such API would be useful to make sure that triggers are executed as expected. If accessories are not accessible remotely, a user should be informed to setup remote access.\r\n\r\nThe new Home app in iOS 10 tells the user to setup remote access on an Apple TV or iPad when the user tries to setup a trigger. I want to do the same.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be an API to tell if a home is remotely accessible (e.g. HMHome.isRemotelyAccessible)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no API available to tell if the accessories in a home are remotely accessible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
