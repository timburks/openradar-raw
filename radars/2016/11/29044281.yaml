    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice if we were able to prevent a notification from displaying in our UNNotificationServiceExtension implementations. Currently, if I override the -didReceiveNotificationRequest:withContentHandler: method and pass nil to the contentHandler block, the original notification is displayed to the user. It would be useful if there was some parameter I could pass to the contentHandler that would prevent *any* notification from being displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an app with a UNNotificationServiceExtension extension target\r\n2. In the extension's override of -didReceiveNotificationRequest:withContentHandler: call the contentHandler and pass it nil for its argument\r\n3. Send a push notification with the mutable-content field set to true\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo notification is displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe original notification is displayed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 (14B72)"
