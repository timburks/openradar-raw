    description: "Summary:\r\nOur project has a PCH file which includes macros which are used throughout the project.  While editing, Xcode shows errors for \"use of undeclared identifier\" or \"implicit declaration of function\" whenever these macros are used, even though the project builds successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project which uses a PCH file (earlier versions of Xcode did this automatically)\r\n2. Create a header file which defines a macro\r\n3. #include the header file from the PCH file\r\n4. Use the macro in your project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error should show in the sidebar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nErrors show in the sidebar"
