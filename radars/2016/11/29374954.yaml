    description: "On iOS 10 if titleView has some constraints set on its subviews, navigationbar shows some weird behaviour. Assume you set allVisible to splitViewController and place expand button to the left items:\r\n\r\nself.splitViewController?.preferredDisplayMode = .allVisible\r\nself.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = self.splitViewController?.displayModeButtonItem\r\nself.navigationItem.leftItemsSupplementBackButton = true\r\n\r\nAfter launching UI displays fine, but if a user taps expand button, then the button dissapears completely, instead if displaying back arrow button (but user can still tap that button). And furthermore, when a user taps the collapse button, you can notice, that instead of just one expand button, a user sees expand button AND backBarButtonItem, ignoring leftItemsSupplementBackButton is true.\r\n\r\nIt a titleView does not contain any constrains, everything works as expected.\r\nOn iOS before 10.x navigation bar works fine with and without constraints.\r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/Sega-Zero/ios10-expand-bug"
