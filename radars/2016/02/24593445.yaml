    description: "Summary:\nThe class ViewController behaves differently when run in the iOS Simulator and an Xcode 7.3 Playground liveView. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nExecute the class MyViewController in an Xcode Playground and the iOS Simulator.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe Xcode Playground liveView *should* display a red square at position 0,0 and size 100,100.  This works as expected in the iOS Simulator.\n\nActual Results:\nThe Xcode Playground liveView does *not* show a red square because itâ€™s size is now 0,0 see the 3rd console log print statement.  This works as expected in the iOS Simulator.\n\nNotes:\nSee the screen shot from the Xcode Playground and iOS Simulator in the attached zip file along with the ViewController.swift."
