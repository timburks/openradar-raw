    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like to be able to add music from my iCloud Music Library to the up next queue on Apple TV Music App. While right now one can AirPlay music from one's device, the music will play from that device to the Apple TV and is reliant on the stream between the device and the Apple TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music\r\n2. Tap the 3-dot button next to a song\r\n3. Find no option to add to the Up Next queue of an Apple TV's music app on the network\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdding to the Up Next Queue of an Apple TV's music app would be an option in the UIAlertController (action sheet) that appears when you tap the 3-dotted button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo option exists to add to the Up Next queue of an Apple TV on the network's music app."
