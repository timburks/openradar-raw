    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the Mac, I can set an EFI password to prevent people from messing with my computer's firmware or boot loading.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if I could set a password on my phone to do something similar with DFU mode, for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an iPhone\r\n2. Annoy the US Government for some reason (valid or otherwise)\r\n3. Have the FBI seize my phone\r\n4. Wait for the FBI to subpoena y'all at Apple to help break into my phone\r\n5. ???\r\n6. ??????\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo one should be able to see the pictures of my puppy besides me. He's too cute.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTheoretically, if someone had unrestricted physical access to my phone, they could boot to DFU and force an OS upgrade to an OS that lets them see pictures of my puppy without my permission. The results of that would be devastating.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
