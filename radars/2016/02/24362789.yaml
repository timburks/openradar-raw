    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating a UISplitViewController fully programmatically has layout issues when using a UINavigationController on both primary and secondary views. The view on the secondary side extends under an *opaque* UINavigationBar until the screen is rotated.\r\n\r\nI have sample code and screenshots to provide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a view controller and add it as a root view controller of a UINavigationController. Set the UINavigationBar's translucent property to *false*. Present the navigation controller using *showDetailViewController*. Use the 3d view debugger and see the secondary view extending under the opaque navigation bar. Rotate the screen and then rotate it back to the original orientation. Inspect using the 3d view debugger again to see it no longer under the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe layout not to extend under the opaque navigation bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layout does extend under the opaque navigation bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSent DTS ticket regarding problem. DTS confirmed it is a bug and requested I file a radar. DTS ticket 635211153.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Simulator iOS 9.2"
