    description: "When conducting a search from the address field, the search text is displayed, but when this is copied, this unexpectedly is changed to the URL text. This is counterintuitive, and highly inconvenient if one is copying the text in order to check another search engine for better results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Conduct a search via the Safari address field (e.g. 'test').\r\n2. Highlight the address field using control + L.\r\n3. Copy the selected text ('test').\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text is copied as displayed ('test').\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe URL is copied ('https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=test&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=3EfMVrrjNPDS8AfQ1YGoAg')."
