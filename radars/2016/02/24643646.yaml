    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you want to add a child pane to an iOS settings bundle, the convenient way to add this would be to add an item in the plist and set the type to be \"Child Pane\" in the drop-down menu for the item. However, there is no such option, and you have got to manually edit the plist in a text editor to set the item type to \"PSChildPaneSpecifier\" to do this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee screenshot -- after manually editing the type in the plist, it shows up correctly as the type, but observe that it's still not an option in the drop-down menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Child Pane\" should be present in the drop-down menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Child Pane\" is not present in the drop-down menu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.2.1 (7C1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-02-13 at 13.17.00.png' was successfully uploaded."
