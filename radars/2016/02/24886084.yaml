    description: "Summary:\r\nI added the LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace key to my Info.plist file in order to support opening documents in place.\r\n\r\nWhen I now use the iCloud Drive app, many files, including Pages and Numbers documents are opened in my app when I tap them. Instead, it should display a preview of the document or open it in Pages/Numbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- add LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace YES to the Info.plist of my app and install it on an iOS device\r\n- launch the iCloud Drive app\r\n- tap on a Pages document\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- it should display a preview of the Pages document or open the document in Pages\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the Pages document opens in my app instead which cannot handle it\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI tried changing the LSHandlerRank of registered CFBundleDocumentTypes, but that didn’t change anything for me.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy app (Textastic Code Editor) registers support for many file formats in the CFBundleDocumentTypes key including „public.text“ and things like „public.image“ in order to appear in the „Open In“ menu. Yet, I do not want it to be the default iCloud Drive handler for ALL text and image files.\r\n\r\nI think there needs to be a way to limit the document types that the iCloud Drive app uses to open documents in an app by default.\r\n\r\nI’ve added Textastic’s Info.plist file that contains all exported type UTIs so you can have a look at it."
