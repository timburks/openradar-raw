Did you forget to end it?'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWorkouts that don't run on for an extra hour because I forgot to end them when I got home.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get workouts that are too long sometimes when you forget to end them properly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0.1 (13S428)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
