    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nSafari installs an expired version of the WWDR certificate, and then claims there's \"no Safari extensions certificate\" because of the broken chain of trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1. Open Extension Builder in Safari\r\n2. Check an extension's certificate status line\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nMy Safari extensions certificate is acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\nI get a \"no Safari extensions certificate\" message. Opening the keychain reveals that Safari has re-installed an expired WWDR certificate and then insist on using that instead of the newer valid WWDR certificate, which is also in my keychain. Deleting the expired certificate doesn't help, because Safari caches it.\r\n\r\nRe-launching Safari and re-opening Extension Builder after deleting the expired certificate re-installs the expired certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nConsidering the number of emails Apple sent reminding everyone to update their WWDR certificates, this is somewhat amusing."
