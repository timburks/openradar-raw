    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a custom keyboard opens and the status bar has the In-Call status, the keyboard is shifted down.\r\nThe bug can be reproduced on both real devices and iOS Simulators.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project. It's basically the Custom Keyboard template code.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3wqCukAP9PXcm1rZDlzbmp5d2M/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Toggle the In-Call status bar\r\n2. Launch the Custom Keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard to have a proper layout.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeyboard's content is shifted down by 20 points.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 and iOS 9.1. Not present in iOS 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's off-topic, but...\r\nPlease provide a better way to set a custom height to a custom keyboard. The current API(injecting a layout constraint) is hacky and the functionality gets broken with every major iOS update.\r\nAnd it also looks jumpy and weird.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll the real devices and the iOS Simulators."
