        Summary:

        I renamed and moved a workspace file. Now it’s broken.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Move your workspace file to a different directory. I did this after a rename of the project.

        Expected Results:

        It should just work.

        Actual Results:

        It uses absolute paths and fails.

        Notes:

        If the location to the xcodeproj file was relative to the workspace file, it would still work.

        Whenever possible, please refactor Xcode to use *relative paths*.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <Workspace
           version = "1.0">
           <FileRef
              location = "group:/Users/aral/ind.ie/products/OldName/app/OldName/NewName.xcodeproj">
           </FileRef>
        </Workspace>

        (The actual file is now at /Users/aral/ind.ie/porducts/NewName/app/NewName/NewName.xcodeproj”)
