    description: "Summary:\r\nThe task server will often be unresponsive after a couple days of inactivity. The task server scanner feature in ARD will often be empty and not display known hosts. Computers that are already registered do not display their current status properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the Remote Desktop app to create an ARD task server.\r\n2. Quit Remote Desktop and logout.\r\n3. Set the Remote Desktop app on another Mac to use the remote task server from step 1.\r\n3. Add some Macs (I had 11).\r\n4. Make sure the machines you added appear when using the Task Server Scanner.\r\n5. Quit the Remote Desktop app and wait a couple of days (at least 42 hours).\r\n6. Launch Remote Desktop and attempt to use the task server scanner again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Macs added in step 3 should appear as they did in step 4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nList will be empty. Clicking the stop/refresh button has no effect. Computers already registered will also not update their status. Will often show only \"Authenticating\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe task server scanner will fail to respond whether a user is logged in or not. Logging out or logging in will cause the task server to resume operation.\r\n\r\nsysdiagnose_2016.02.11_16-01-18-0500.tar.gz was taken while a user was logged in at the console and the scanner was unresponsive.\r\n\r\nsysdiagnose_2016.02.13_09-23-10-0500.tar.gz was taken while no user was logged in at the console and the scanner was unresponsive.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHardware Overview:\r\n\r\n  Model Name:\tXserve\r\n  Model Identifier:\tXserve3,1\r\n  Processor Name:\tQuad-Core Intel Xeon\r\n  Processor Speed:\t2.26 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t8 MB\r\n  Memory:\t6 GB\r\n  Processor Interconnect Speed:\t5.86 GT/s\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tXS31.0081.B06\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.43f4\r\n  LOM Revision:\t1.1.9\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2016.02.11_16-01-18-0500.tar.gz' and 'sysdiagnose_2016.02.13_09-23-10-0500.tar.gz' were successfully uploaded."
