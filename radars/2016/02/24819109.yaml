    description: "When one clicks on a website button to upload and image, or one uses a menu command in an OS X application the standard OS X file browser appears in a modal dialogue box. At the very bottom of the sidebar is an item called \"Photos\" under the heading of \"Media\".\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to provide access to one's Photos (formerly iPhotos) collection. But unfortunately if you just took a photo with your phone to upload chances are it will never appear until you gave up on it appearing there. You are forced into exporting to a file (because Photo obtusely hides all source images from users in it's infinite wisdom thereby adding this oft required step) and navigating to it and uploading the file. Many website and applications preclude a drag and drop of an image file from the Photo application.\r\n\r\nOut of desperation I opened Photo and forced the upload from my iPhone (because even that seems to be a random success rate in spite of WiFi syncing supposedly switched on). I located the recent file and copied it's filename. I enter a search in the OS X file browser modal dialogue for the filename, zero hit. I navigated to \"Latest\"  subcategory in Photos options for file browserâ€¦ nothing there either. Did same in the Photos app itself, there's the image under \"latest\"\r\n\r\nThis shit has been going join as long as i remember. so much for *just works*, that seems to have passed on long ago (apologies to the man who coined that term).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a photo with iPhone\r\n2. Wish it into your Mac Photo apps because that's got as much chance of getting it there.\r\n3. Open Photos and force it to upload the image if it isn't already there. Quit Photos.\r\n4. Open Safari and open Facebook in a new tab\r\n5. Click on the Camera icon for uploading images.\r\n6. Locate \"Photos\" under the \"Media\" heading at the bottom of the Left File Navigation Sidebar and click on Photos.\r\n7. Flick open the \"Albums\" sidebar at then click on the \"Latest\" item: it will not be there if you have my luck, Latest will be empty.\r\n8. Flick open \"Years\": it will not be there. You photos will be in some random order with NO freaking YEAR divisions around photos which kind of makes that feature as useful as tits on a bull. If you flick open \"Years\" and select the current year many of your most recent photos will not be there. who the hell knows why?\r\n9. Flick open Collections or Moments, it won't be there either.\r\n10. reopen Photos and copy the filename. Return to file browser in Safari and paste filename into the search field, it will not be found.\r\n11. Wonder why it took you so many years to report this in the vain hope somebody at Apple would also get sick to death of this just never works BS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJust Works. read steps for expectations.\r\n\r\nscreenshot of image in Photos> Latest::\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lliorlj6h02i3ss/Screenshot%202016-02-25%2003.15.49.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust Never Works. read steps for results.\r\n\r\nscreenshot of no image in Safari image upload modal dialogue ::\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/af98uhjprqs1iob/Screenshot%202016-02-25%2003.15.39.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos Version 1.0.1 (215.65.0)\r\nDOn't know if its iLife product of not but you didn't list Photos in the software choices did you?\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMBP Late 2015 model and 2010 17\" MBP both on 10.10.5"
