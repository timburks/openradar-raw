    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen my computer (config below) wakes from deep sleep with my 4k display (Dell P2415Q) connected via either mini-DP port, it suffers from screen tearing. unplugging the monitor from the computer and plugging it back in fixes the problem. I do not see it when using the HDMI out\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. connect to Dell P2415Q via the mini-displayport on the mac + the full size DP on the monitor\r\n2. put the computer to sleep (I do not know how long it takes to enter deep-sleep, but this only happened when several hours passed while the computer was asleep) do not close the lid\r\n3. wake the computer. the monitor will show screen tearing (especially visible while switching spaces quickly)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nno screen tearing on the display\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nscreen tearing on the display\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X El Capitan (10.11.3)\r\nMacbook pro (retina 13-inch, late 2013)\r\n2.4ghz Intel core i5, 8GB ram, Intel Iris pro GPU\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nboth displays set to default scaling\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOnly happens with the Mini-display port on the mac, not HDMI. did not test with the mini-DP on the monitor because I do not have a cable of that type, only full size to mini. \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
