    description: "Summary:\r\nEntries with long lines in /etc/hosts lead to very slow host resolution.\r\n\r\nFor example an entry like this:\r\n\r\n123.123.123.123 long.list of.host.names at.least.20.com ... example.com\r\n\r\nis really slow when asking for example for \r\ncurl --head http://example.com/somefile.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an entry to /etc/hosts like this: 123.123.123.123 long.list of.host.names at.least.20.com ... example.com\r\n2. Request a file from one of the hosts there, in my example it is curl --head http://example.com/somefile.png\r\n3. watch the slowness\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be _FAST_. No Network communication is required to resolve this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is _SLOW_ as molasses. Interestingly this doesn't seem to happen for all urls that I ask for, and I haven't yet found the pattern.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround of sorts is to split long lines like this into something like this:\r\n\r\n123.123.123.123 foo bar baz\r\n123.123.123.123 foo.bar bar.bar baz.bar\r\n123.123.123.123 foo.baz bar.bz baz.baz\r\n\r\nwhich is much, much faster, if you ensure that every line has at most 10 entries.\r\n\r\nBUT: why the heck do I have to deal with this?\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not the first person to find this problem.
