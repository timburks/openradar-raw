    description: "Summary:\nWhen turning on code coverage and running unit tests, the following content is logged to the console\nprofiling: REDACTED/AppKit.gcda: cannot merge previous GCDA file: corrupt arc tag (0x65537463) // or some other memory address at the end.\nAfter that, the test run gets terminated with EXEC_BAD_ACCESS.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. have a mac app with working unit tests (no 3rd party libs)\n2. enable code coverage \n3. CMD - U to run the unit tests\n\nExpected Results:\nTests are run and we get code coverage.\n\nActual Results:\nAll tests are run as expected, but generating the coverage report spews in log messages in the Console and we receive the \n\nRegression:\nAll versions of Xcode 7 including 7.2.1\n\nNotes:\nThe following workaround solves the problem but breaks code coverage:\nIn your main target (be it a framework, or an app) set:\n     Enable Code Coverage Support to YES\n     Generage Legacy Test Coverage Files to YES\n     Instrument Program Flow to NO\nFor my purposes I only did this for Debug builds, but your needs may vary.\n \nThen in your Tests target set:\n     Enable Code Coverage Support to NO\n     Generage Legacy Test Coverage Files to NO\n     Instrument Program Flow to NO"
