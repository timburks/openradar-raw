    description: "Summary:\r\nThis has happened to my iPhone 6s multiple times recently. I tweeted about it and one of my followers had a solution: turn off Siri, turn off Phone, turn on Phone and then turn on Siri again. This does work but a few days later we are back in the same state again. I'm not willing to accept turning everything off and on again every few days to get Siri working again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sorry not sure how it started and why it happens.\r\n2. All I know is Siri becomes basically useless and whatever I ask (send text, play music, create reminder) she says 'Sorry something went wrong. Please try again').\r\n3. This happens both at home and out (so both wifi and LTE).\r\n4. Turning off Siri, Turning off phone and then turning them both on again seems to temporarily fix the issue.\r\n5. But then I'll be driving or something and try and use Siri and she returns to the 'sorry can't do anything at all' state.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect that Siri would work properly. I've never seen this on any of my other devices I've had previously. No one else in my family has had this problem either.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri fails. Fails to play music. Fails to text. Fails to create reminders. There might be other things that it'll fail on but those are the main things I use Siri for.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI connected my phone to my Mac and looked at the console output when I said 'Hey Siri' and then 'Play me some music'. Didn't see any errors output to the console when Siri failed. I'll include the output as an attachment.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iPhone6sOutputHeySiriFail.txt' was successfully uploaded."
