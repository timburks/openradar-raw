        I appreciate the value of being able to go far back in the app use history without a lot of tedious scrolling. However, the current timings in 9.3 beta 2 seem off the mark. The jump to “blindingly fast” scrolling happens too early, to the point that it’s hard to return to ~5 apps ago without setting off a runaway stampede.

        It seems to be a bit better than beta 1, perhaps, but still too aggressive.

        The attached video shows what it looks like on my iPad. This isn’t me trying to race as fast as possible - I’m just trying to scroll at about the pre-9.3 rate. But you can see that the animation jumps out of control on several occasions. (And, this is after using 9.3 for a couple of weeks; if it were just an adjustment issue, I would think I would have gotten a bit better at it by now…)
