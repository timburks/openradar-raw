    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have any Swift protocol and try to extend specific UIControl(such as UISegmentedControl) with it, any UISegmentedControl on InterfaceBuilder attributes tab loses sent actions chapter. Also it becomes impossible to drag IBAction to view controller - only IBOutlets and IBOutletCollections are shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nprotocol Foo {}\r\nextension UISegmentedControl: Foo {}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUISegmentedControl has actions ( ValueChanged, OnTouchUpInside etc) in attributes inspector in Interface Builder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActions are hidden, unless extension is commented out.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2.1\r\nOS X 10.11.3"
