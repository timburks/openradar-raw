    description: "Summary:\r\nTo make the video in an AVPlayerLayer fullscreen you change the videoGravity property.\r\n\r\n- (void)setVideoFillMode:(NSString *)fillMode\r\n{\r\n    _videoFillMode = fillMode;\r\n\tAVPlayerLayer *playerLayer = (AVPlayerLayer*)[self layer];\r\n\tplayerLayer.videoGravity = fillMode;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// This transition is animated\r\n- (void)toggleMediaPlayerZoom\r\n{\r\n    [UIView beginAnimations:@\"movieZoom\" context:nil];\r\n    [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut];\r\n    if (self.mPlaybackView.videoFillMode == AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspect) {\r\n        self.mPlaybackView.videoFillMode = AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspectFill;\r\n    } else  {\r\n        self.mPlaybackView.videoFillMode = AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspect;\r\n    }\r\n    [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.5];\r\n    [UIView commitAnimations];\r\n}\r\n\r\nBut the subtitle (layer) does not take this property into consideration.\r\nAnd will remain at the initial position after changing the videoGravity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart a video with and make sure the subtitles are active.\r\nNow change the videoGravity.\r\nYou will see the video to go fullscreen but the subtitle will remain where they were.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe subtitles should scale together with the video.\r\ne.g. remain at the bottom and increase font size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subtitle remain where they were.\r\ne.g. in the center with same font size.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be useful if there was a method with which you could influence the subtitles.\r\ne.g. when you want the subtitle to remain visible so that they can be put higher or lower depending if the UI is visible or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'subtiles in wrong position.mov' was successfully uploaded."
