    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be very useful if we as an MDM can set the value of the \"Block Pop-ups\" to false. Some web apps require popup blockers to be disabled, this requires a lot of manual steps for the students. As an MDM, currently we can only ENABLE and LOCK this item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn extra configuration key where it's possible to set the current value to either true or false\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe option can only be set at true, and with that it's also locked. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (build: 13E5191d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
