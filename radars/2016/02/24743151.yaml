    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an app that uses SLComposeViewController with the service type of SLServiceTypeFacebook and attaches an image, the image does not appear sized correctly when the SLComposeViewController is presented in the app. However, when posted to Facebook from the view controller, the image appears normal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Allocate and create a SLComposeViewController with Service type: SLServiceTypeFacebook\r\n2. Attach an image  using the `addImage:` API\r\n3. Present the view controller in your app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result would be that the view controller shows an accurate representation of the attached image, not a cropped image. This can lead to user confusion.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe attached image appears zoomed in and larger than fits on the modal view controller that is presented. Giving the impression that the photo did not attach correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus (MKTQ2LL/A) and iPad Air 2 (MGKL2LL/A)"
