        Summary:
        When implementing key commands in my app I would like to test the action as well, the current implementation of UIKeyCommand does not support that. Testing the action is important because the key command is not available when the action is not implemented in the controller

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Implement key commands in your view controller
        2. Try to test the action of a UIKeyCommand

        Expected Results:
        UIKeyCommand responds to `action` or inherits from `UIControl`.

        Actual Results:
        `action` is inaccessible and not testable
