    description: "Summary:\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate is used to store when a document was last opened (I'm using this data for research purposes, but the problem arises also when searching using finder).\r\n\r\nIf an item is downloaded from the internet, OS X sets the flag \"com.apple.quarantine\"\r\nto the downloaded file. This flag prevents the kMDItemLastUsedDate from being set appropriately. This prevents files downloaded from the internet from being shown as spotlight search results based on last opened dates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download a file from the internet (call this \"somefile.pdf\")\r\n2. Open the given file using Preview\r\n3. In terminal type mdls somefile.pdf\r\n4. The kMDItemLastUsedDate metadata item does not show as one of the available metadata items, even if the file was opened recently\r\n5. In terminal, type xattr -d com.apple.quarantine somefile.pdf\r\n6. Open the file using Preview\r\n7. In terminal type mdls somefile.pdf\r\n8. kMDItemLastUsedDate is now correctly shown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate should have appeared in step 4 above (immediately after opening file), but did not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nkMDItemLastUsedDate only appears after the com.apple.quarantine is removed from the file using xattr, but not before.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis seems to occur on every software and hardware configuration"
