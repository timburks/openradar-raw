    description: "Summary:\r\nYou should be able to see what time it is no matter what you are doing.\r\nI am often out walking and have the workout app running. I'd still like to be able to see the current time without having to press any buttons or leave the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a walking workout on your watch.\r\n2. Wait a few seconds and the current time will fade away and not come back.\r\n3. Only way to see current time is to press digital crown to leave the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPretty sure you could display the time. If anything fade away the 'Outdoor Walk' text on the left. I don't think I'm going to forget what kind of workout I started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0.1 (13S428)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
