    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Settings.app, there is an easy-to-discover toggle for Siri in the General section. When disabling it, a new VOICE DIAL ONLY section appears, but only lets you configure the language. This makes it appear as though Voice Dial cannot be turned off, when in fact, a toggle does exist in the Passcode / Touch ID section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Settings\r\n2. Go to General, then Siri\r\n3. Disable Siri\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA link and/or explanation appears on how to disable Voice Dial, if so desired.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA section VOICE DIAL ONLY appears, but its only option is the language. The UI makes it look as though it's not possible at all to disable Voice Dial."
