    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes when I read the e-mails in my \"Unread\" Smart Mailbox, they’ll stay in the mailbox, even badging the icon, when in the UI they’re clearly read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Smart Mailbox for unread mail (see screenshot).\r\n2. Read messages in it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe messages are removed from the mailbox the next time you open it, and only actually-unread messages appear and badge the icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are e-mails in the mailbox that appear to be read in the message list, but the icon is badged as if they’re unread. See screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail Version 9.2 (3112)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have a Gmail account and a Google Apps account in Mail. I have only seen this issue with Gmail-backed mailboxes.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround, but it’s painful: go to the All Mail folder, and select Mailbox -> Rebuild. This re-downloads every message, which means they get copied to my Time Machine drive again, as well as to online backup.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)"
