    description: "01-Feb-2016 10:33 AM\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOur app has a DocumentPicker extension that uses a FileProvider. Our App, DocumentPicker, and FileProvider all belong to an app group in order to access a shared container. \r\n\r\nSometimes the FileProvider is not available and we see the following message in the log:\r\n \"error\" => <string: 0x126d2b370> { length = 128, contents = \"cannot obtain executable path for plug-in DocumentPickerFileProvider(67EC5411-4C98-4A20-8E05-3E0161C3D523)\"\r\n\r\nWe have only seen this issue on iOS 9.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though our configuration is correct as most of the time the DocumentPicker and FileProvider work but we are seeing this issue where the FileProvider is invalidated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn an iPhone running iOS 9.2.1 without the app installed:\r\n1. Reboot the phone\r\n2. Install app\r\n3. Launch app, login\r\n4. Launch iOS Mail app\r\n5. Create a new email, long press and choose \"Add Attachment\"\r\n6. Choose app Location\r\n7. Select any file, it will download and fail to attach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn an iPhone running iOS 9.2.1 with out the app installed:\r\n1. Reboot the phon\r\n2. Install app\r\n3. Launch app, login\r\n4. Launch iOS Mail app\r\n5. Create a new email, long press and choose \"Add Attachment\"\r\n6. Choose app Location\r\n7. Select any file, it will download and file is attached to email\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee the following error in the log:\r\n fileproviderd[31] <Warning>: Communications error: <OS_xpc_dictionary: <dictionary: 0x126d26e60> { count = 2, contents =\r\n      \"errorcode\" => <uint64: 0x126d291d0>: 4\r\n      \"error\" => <string: 0x126d2b370> { length = 128, contents = \"cannot obtain executable path for plug-in DocumentPickerFileProvider(67EC5411-4C98-4A20-8E05-3E0161C3D523)\" }\r\n   }>\r\n\r\nThe DocumentPicker is unable to get the documentStorageURL from the FileProvider.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 6s\r\n\r\nThis looks like a similar issue:\r\nhttps://issues.labcollab.net/browse/CDALL-27675"
