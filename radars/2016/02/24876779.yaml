    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter using dictation to reply to a text/iMessage from the lock screen, if the dictated text exceeds two lines (at standard font size), the \"Send\" button is hidden and cannot be pressed (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a text or iMessage while iPhone is locked.\r\n2. Swipe the message and choose the Reply option to reply from the lock screen without unlocking phone.\r\n3. Activate dictation (tap the microphone icon next to the spacebar when the keyboard appears) and dictate enough text that the text will occupy more than two lines in the message reply area.\r\n4. Tap \"Done\" to cease dictation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe various views would resize properly upon completion of dictation so that the \"Send\" button would be visible (as would all/the final line of the reply text).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Send\" button is obscured (as is one or more lines of text) and is inaccessible even when using the loupe to place the cursor on the final line of text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTapping the Delete button on the keyboard does appear to trigger an update of the layout and make the Send button visible again.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 16 GB, Verizon, using either Wi-Fi or Cellular\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_2789.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
