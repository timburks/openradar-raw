    description: "Summary:\r\nThe animations that happen when a row is removed from NSStackView look pretty bad. Rows that shouldn't even move slide and then move back to where they should be when other items are deleted.\r\nPerhaps there's some constraint I should be setting but I don't know about? \r\nThis is default behavior of just adding a NSStackView into NSPopover and NSWindow and letting them animate when rows are deleted. NSStackView is pretty cool but for some things it just doesn't work very well (this being one of those).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile example app.\r\n2. Click 'Popover' or 'Window' button.\r\n3. Click the Delete/- button for any row that isn't the first row.\r\n4. Ponder the very slowed down animations and what is happening.\r\n5. Meditate for a minimum of 15 minutes.\r\n6. Again ponder why auto layout + NSStackView doesn't work well when shrinking while also shrinking its host window/popover.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the animations look nice while window or popover resizes to show only the remaining rows. In the case of being inside the window it would be good to not reload everything and have existing rows slide to where they should be.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPoor animations during window/popover/stackview resize.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 7C68, 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is likely to just use a NSTableView instead of NSStackView.\r\nIgnore the split view and visual effect view in the app. They are there because I'm going to use the same project to submit another bug.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOnly tried on 10.11.3 (15D21).\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PastebotPlayground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
