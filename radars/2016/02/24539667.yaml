    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you open the Clock app and go to world clock, tapping on the Analog clock, switches to digital mode; in this mode, the time is frozen at whatever time you are seeing until you switch tabs or switch back to analog mode. Homing out and coming back doesn't update the time either, assuming viewDidLoad or similar is not called by design, so the ViewController is not aware of this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPreCondition: Make sure you have Auto-Lock set to Never (or enough time so you can see that a couple of minutes have passed without your screen turning off automatically)\r\n\r\n1. Open Clock.app\r\n2. Tap World Clock (and make sure you have a couple, but this may not be needed, you need at least one. I tested with 4 cities)\r\n3. tap the Analog clock so it switches to digital.\r\n4. Leave the phone on and wait two minutes and notice time hasn't moved. \r\n5. Try switching to another tab (like alarm) and back. Or tap the digital clocks to go back to analog mode (and then back to digital). In both cases the time updates (but gets stuck again). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach tableView cell should keep track of the current time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe displayed times are frozen at the time they were created. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1(13D15)"
