    description: Persian language, Persian keyboard and Persian calendar exist in OS X. They've also were in iOS 5 but I don't know why you guys removed it. Now that we have iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard there is no way to type Persian (Farsi) on iPad. You guys introduced RTL Layouts in iOS 9 but there is no Persian Language on iOS 9.
