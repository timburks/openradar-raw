    description: "Summary:\r\nThe tooltips for auto layout constraints in Xcode’s Size Inspector fade out more than three times more slowly than normal system tooltips.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a xib or storyboard that has Auto Layout constraints.\r\n2. Use Command-Option-5 to show the Size Inspector panel on the right size of the interface.\r\n3. Select an element in the interface that is participating in layout (i.e. it has constraints).\r\n4. In the Size Inspector, hover the mouse cursor over a constraint. You might do this absentmindedly while reading the text on the screen, or perhaps you are using the cursor to hold your place as you read down the list, looking for an out-of-place constraint.\r\n5. Notice that a large tooltip appears, describing the available NSLayoutConstraint-related methods. This tooltip seems unnecessarily wordy, and it doesn’t show specific information about the constraint, which could be useful, but let’s assume it’s supposed to be there.\r\n6. Attempt to read another item in the list, but discover that you can’t because the tooltip is covering much of the list.\r\n7. Move the cursor off the Size Inspector so that the tooltip will hide.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tooltip hides in the amount of time it usually takes system tooltips to hide, which in my measurements is about 0.74 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tooltip takes 1.40 seconds to hide - over three times longer than the standard tooltip! It quickly becomes aggravating to have to wait through that slow animation again and again if you’re interacting with the data in the Size Inspector. The underlying text doesn’t even become readable until more than a second into the fade-out animation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown how long this bug has existed. It is present in Xcode 7.2 and 7.3 beta (7D129n)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screen recording for a demonstration Also uploaded at http://cl.ly/f5Xi. My math:\r\nNormal tooltip takes 26 frames to fade out. QuickTime tells me that the screen capture is 54.9 fps, so that works out to 0.47 seconds for the normal tooltip fade.\r\nSize Inspector tooltip takes 77 frames to hide, which works out to 1.40 seconds. I judge the text to be readable no earlier than 60 frames, or 1.09 seconds, into the animation."
