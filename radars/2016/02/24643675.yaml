    description: "Summary:\r\nSharing an album from Apple Music on Twitter is a less than delightful experience. Please consider the following changes:\r\n1. Attached artwork must have a decent quality. I've seen as small as 100x100px.\r\n2. The link should be internationalised. Mine are being created as itun.es/ar/tZnSp. (notice the \"ar\" for the story)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes.\r\n2. Select an Apple Music album.\r\n3. Click Share...\r\n4. Select Twitter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. Artwork is of a decent quality.\r\n6. Links can be opened all around the world.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. Artwork quality is *bad*.\r\n6. Links are specific to a country store.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.3.2.35.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
