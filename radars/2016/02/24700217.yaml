        Summary:
        If the environment contains an environment variable with garbage and LSOpenFromURLSpec is called, the calling program crashes.
        This is security relevant because in certain cases the environment might be attacker controlled (for example CGI).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a Terminal with /bin/bash as the shell
        2. export THIS_IS_GARBAGE=$(echo f210ee5ed81dc98acc0a | xxd -r -p)
        3. /usr/bin/open http://apple.com

        Expected Results:
        Browser opens http://apple.com

        Actual Results:
        Open crashes with signal 5 (SIGTRAP) and a crash report is generated.
