    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a sign in form with one text field, and one secure text field (email and password respectively). My UI test is \r\n1. tap email field \r\n2. typeText in email field\r\n3. tap password field\r\n4. typeText in password field\r\n\r\nSteps 1-3 are successful, but 4 fails\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a simple UI with 2 text fields, one secure and one not, and run the following as part of a UI test \r\n\r\napp.textFields[\"email_field\"].tap()\r\napp.textFields[\"email_field\"].typeText(\"test@email.com\")\r\n        \r\napp.secureTextFields[\"password_field\"].tap()\r\napp.secureTextFields[\"password_field\"].typeText(\"password\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should be entered in both fields\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText is only entered in the non-secure (email) field, though the tap is successful on password (i.e. it becomes the first responder)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a workaround I am using the clipboard approach described here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/5910\r\n\r\nThat thread also mentions a bug being made so this is a duplicate, but I don't know the original number \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.2.1, iPad Air 2 (9.2)"
