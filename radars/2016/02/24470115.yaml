    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UIAppearance is implemented, Interface Builder configuration isn't respected.\r\n\r\nThis may well be a documentation issue, considering UIAppearance is a proxy and is implemented in a runtime fashion, whereas Interface Builder is implemented in a compile-time fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd argue that a change needs to occur, to move towards one of two outcomes:\r\n-Interface Builder's internals are modified, such their generated config is respected when UIAppearance configuration is implemented\r\n-This behavior is more clearly documented around official documentation and, perhaps, even the Xcode interface\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: implement the following set of directives:\r\n\r\nUIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(UIColor.blueColor(), forState: .Normal)\r\nUIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(UIColor.blueColor(), forState: .Highlighted)\r\nUIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(UIColor.blueColor(), forState: .Selected)\r\nUIButton.appearance().setTitleColor(UIColor.blueColor(), forState: .Disabled)\r\n\r\n2. In Interface Builder, configure the root view controller to display a UIButton in its view\r\n\r\n3. Set that UIButton's titleColor for every state to Red Color, in Interface Builder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIButton's title color is red\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIButton's title color is blue\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
