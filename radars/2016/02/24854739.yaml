    description: "I have about 2000 documents (mixed ePub and PDF) that I used to keep on my iPad with pretty good performance. As of iOS 9.3, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with moving them to iCloud. \n\nStartup remains very slow even in beta 4. As you can see in the attached video, it takes a full minute to launch iBooks. This is without any changes to the book inventory in iCloud."
