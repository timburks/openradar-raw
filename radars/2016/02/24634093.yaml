        Summary:
        Espescially on Mac OS, my notification center often has huge amounts of old messages. This is also true for iOS. It should give me the option to „always clear out until only the last 24 hours are shown“. I don’t want to have to delete all notifications to get rid of them nor do I want to click on every single one of them.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Get notifications throughout an extended period of time on your device.

        Expected Results:
        They should clear out, as a default maybe after 24 hours (or on Macs maybe 36 or 24 hours of real usage time.

        Actual Results:
        Cluttered notification center with no real relevance as there are huge amounts of old notifications

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
