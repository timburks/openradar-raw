    description: "On an iPad, if I request a snapShot size of 1024:1024 and set the region span to something really small such as 0.006:0.006 for some locations the completion handler never returns.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the span or decreasing the image size does allow it to work, however there is no way to calculate a working combination of values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached sample app\r\n2. Tap the \"SnapShot\" button in the upper right of the screen\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should see the snapShot image appear in the lower portion of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe completion handler never gets called, so its impossible to display an image or see an error indication."

    reproducible: AlwaysWhen the "+" (plus sign) is used in a query parameter it needs to be percent encoded, but NSURLComponents does not do that. The result is that when sent to a web server the "+" gets erroneously interpreted as a "space" character when decoded.
