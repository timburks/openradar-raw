        Summary:
        As new platform support has been added to Xcode (first Mac & iOS, then watchOS, tvOS, etc.) the size of the Xcode application has ballooned rapidly to over 10 GB. For those of us who only develop on one of these platforms (in my case, the Mac), every time we download a new Xcode beta requires downloading, verifying, decompressing, copying, and Gatekeeper-ing a huge amount of data that we don’t need, and wasting a lot of time. I’m typing this bug report as I wait for Xcode 7.3b4 to copy over from the disk image (10 minutes remaining…).

        Xcode has added support in past versions for downloading particular SDK versions and documentation sets, which helped with similar problems. I would like to see this extended to be able to opt out of downloading anything involving a platform that I don’t need. In my case, only needing the Mac platform, this would cut over 7 GB out of the Xcode application bundle. Similar savings could be seen for iOS-only developers who don’t need the Mac, watch, and/or Apple TV platforms.
