        Summary:
        Touch ID for apps sometimes stops working until a hard reboot of the device. Touch ID to unlock the device keeps on working, tho.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) have an app that uses Touch ID
        2) invoke the Touch ID function (using LAContext or Touch ID protected key chain items)
        3) get unlucky and trigger this bug
        4) Touch ID does nothing and returns a errSecItemNotFound issue

        Expected Results:
        Touch ID keeps on working

        Actual Results:
        Touch ID stops working within 3rd party apps. The following line shows up in the console when this happens:

        kernel[0] <Notice>: AppleKeyStore: operation failed (pid: 99 sel: 43 ret: ffffffff '-1')

        Regression:
        This is hard to trigger, but once it happens, Touch ID stops working in apps completely. A hard reboot of the device fixes it.
