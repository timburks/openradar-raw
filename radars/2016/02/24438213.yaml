    description: With 7.1 and 7.2 on 10.11 machine we are unable to connect to dev accounts via Xcode.  This machine setup is based on an enterprise environment which requires Xcode to be "proxy aware".   It works fine on a personal machine which doesn't require a proxy aware machine setup.  This issue also looks like it requires both a certain version of Xcode and El Capitan.
