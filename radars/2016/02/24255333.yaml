    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen my AppleWatch app is running (include inactive state),\r\nHKStatisticsQuery does not call completionHandler that was executed in Glance.\r\n\r\nAfter the AppleWatch app terminated explicitly, it will be come back.\r\n\r\nI think that HKStatisticsQuery should work after AppleWatch app becomes inactive state.\r\nThis issue occurs even \"Complication\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install the attached application\r\n2. Show Glance of this app\r\n    (At this time, HKStatisticsQuery work successfully.)\r\n3. Launch the Apple Watch app by tap to glance\r\n4. Show again the Glance\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n Step Count label shows number of your steps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep Count label couldn't show steps.\r\nBecause, CompletionHandler has not been called.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinue to do the following steps,\r\n\r\n5. Terminate the Apple Watch app\r\n6. Show again the Glance\r\n\r\nThen, Query results will be come back.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS2 ver 2.1 (13S661)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXCode ver7.2(7C68)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'HealthTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
