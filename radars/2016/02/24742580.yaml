        Summary:
        Swift has excellent documentation comment support and Xcode displays them beautifully in things like the quick documentation popover. While you can link to websites, and embed images from the web, it would be very useful to be able to link to things in the same project like Github does with it’s README markdown files (https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files).

        In particular, I use Facebook’s snapshotting tools in my unit tests, and would love to be able to link to those snapshots in the documentation for the views.
