    description: "Summary:\r\nSay you are typing something in Terminal (any app will do though). In the background some app requires access to a keychain entry so it pops up a window. Suddenly your typing from Terminal goes into this new window that just appeared. Surely you could wait until I was done typing before displaying this new 'hey I need your password' window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. See included screenshot.\r\n2. I was typing something in Terminal.\r\n3. accountd decided it needed my password so it pops up a window to get it\r\n4. I start typing into the window that just appeared.\r\n5. I curse and get angry because this happens often especially when you've just logged in.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be great if the system would delay popping up the 'hey I need your password' windows if you are already typing and wait until you are done.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy typing that should have been directed at Terminal ends up in the 'hey I need your password' window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.11.1 (15B17c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe picture is worth at least 1000 characters, no?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt has occurred for many versions of Mac OS X including 10.11.1 (15B17c). Not sure if this was added in 10.6 or earlier.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TerminalTyping-DemandPassword.png' was successfully uploaded."
