    description: "When extending a protocol bridged from Objective-C and using self in the extension method, the Swift compiler may crash with a segmentation fault if whole module optimization is enabled. The issue was originally reported to the major open-source framework at https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1109 .\r\n\r\nI've attached a reduced project (edit: https://github.com/Adlai-Holler/ASDKWMOTest ) that reliably crashes the compiler both Xcode 7.2.1 and 7.3 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to build the project under Xcode 7.2.1 or 7.3 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Swift compiler crashes and a build error is generated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.2.1 and 7.3 beta 2"
