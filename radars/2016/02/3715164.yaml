    description: "SUMMARY\r\nWhen a site for a domain is not found, Safari tries www.domain. A better approach is to check for SRV records of type _http._tcp.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Go to srvtest.macfreek. (without the http:// part).\r\n3. Safari will first check for an A (or CNAME) record for srvtest.macfreek.nl, and if that fails for an A record of www.srvtest.macfreek.nl.\r\n\r\nEXPECT RESULTS\r\nI expected Safari, when no A record was found, to check the _http._tcp.srvtest.macfreek.nl SRV record, which points to mickey.macfreek.nl currently (may be removed by the time you read this report).\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS\r\nSafari seems to check only the domain, and www.domain, but not the services listed in the SRV records.\r\n\r\nSTANDARDIZATION INFORMATION\r\nThe SRV records are described in a Standards Track document of the IETF, RFC 2782.\r\nCurrent usage for webbrowsers is hardly existant, but usage of SRV records in general is increasing (including anti-spam SMTP verification, ZeroConf -RendezVous- and to find LDAP servers). This _http._tcp server is in fact mentioned in draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt (work in progress) as an example. Why not implement it? It's not so hard!"
