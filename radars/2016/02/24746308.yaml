        Summary:
        CPU, Memory, and other in-Xcode reports should stay on screen if the app is terminated due to memory pressure.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to determine reproducibility of a memory crash. Don’t want to incur the performance hit of using the Allocations Instrument - just want to get a general sense of the memory usage graph, so use the Memory report under the Debug navigator.
        2. App is terminated due to memory pressure.
        3. Try to see what the Duration, High, and Low points were during the run.

        Expected Results:
        The report stays up on the screen. Best case, it allows you to scroll through the entire history but at minimum it should show the final state of the report when the app was terminated.

        Actual Results:
        The report is cleared from the screen when the app is terminated.

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        As a workaround, I’ve been using QuickTime Player to to record the graphs, so that once the app is terminated, I can play back the memory graph over time. Obviously, it would be better if Xcode supported this directly.
