    description: "Summary:\n\nFeature Request: Please make a native bug reporting app for non-beta (current) iOS and Mac platforms.\n\nMany times when I have a bug, Apple engineers request photos, videos, or files to help reproduce the problem. The current websites for submitting bugs are very sluggish (bugreport specifically) and are hard to use.\n\nToo many clicks, too many fields, too much wait time on submission.\n\nGathering the required data, images, and videos to make a good bug report is already time consuming (it doesn't help that the current OS fails to transfer files with Air Drop, email, and Dropbox).\n\nI would submit more bugs if the tools to submit were native to the platforms.\n\nNote for the development team: I will not participate in a beta version of OS X or iOS because I need application stability. I don't have time to deal with beta bugs on top of current OS bugs.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Encounter a bug on your iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV.\n2. Try to capture what happened with text, video, images\n3. Start a bug report on bugreport.apple.com\n4. Click too many times on too many forms and wait forever (i.e. non-Apple internet speeds)\n5. Upload files slowly\n6. Press submit\n\n\nExpected Results:\n1. I should be able to file a bug report from my iPhone or Mac directly using a native app.\n\nActual Results:\n1. I have to submit bug reports using a system that hasn't been modernized\n2. bugreport.apple.com has major usability issues. too many clicks, too many delays, too frustrating to use.\n \n\nRegression:\nAll Apple platforms are affected by copious amounts of software bugs. \n\nYour developers are not testing their code, or they're moving to different projects and not providing good support to current apps.\n\nNotes:\nbugreport.apple.com and apple.com/feedback are not effective tools for capturing bug reports using multimedia.\n\nApple's software QA has gone downhill significantly since iOS 7. Too many bugs, too frequent, across all platforms."
