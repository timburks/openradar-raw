        It would be useful if XCode server would allow to specify secrets in the Keychain on the server.

        I am looking to use it for things like password/API Tokens for the build process and pre-post processing scripting, e.g. to notify a bug tracker or to download resources from a server.

        I would be happy to get it via environment variables in that are passed to the script, however Iâ€™d prefer if there would be a more elegant way, so that not all sub-processes have access to them.
