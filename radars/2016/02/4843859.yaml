    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen \"Sticky Keys\" in universal access is on, the Finder ignores the alt key when dragging files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Universal Access in the System Preferences\r\n2. In the Keyboard tab, turn Sticky Keys \"On\".\r\n3. Go to the Finder, and press the alt (option) key\r\n4. An alt symbol is displayed on screen, symbolizing that during the next key or mouse event it behaves as if the alt is down\r\n5. Select a file with the mouse, and key the mouse button down\r\n6. Drag the file to another folder\r\n7. Observe that the alt symbol is still shown and the cursor displays a \"+\" sign, symbolizing that the file is to be copied (as is the behaviour when holding down the alt key while dragging a file)\r\n8. Release the mouse button\r\n\r\nExpected result\r\nI expect the file to be copied, just as if I drag a file while holding down the alt key\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe file is moved, not copied (which is the behaviour when the alt key is not pressed while dragging)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks for universal access! Great job! I broke my arm, and it is real useful when typing with one hand! (My arm is getting better, I expect to use it in a week or two. Thanks for asking :-) )\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nPress the alt key twice, making it \"locked\" (kept down) in Sticky Keys implementation. Now the Finder adheres to the alt key."
