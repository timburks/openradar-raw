    description: "Apple Developer Relations04-Feb-2016 09:40 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed. \r\n\r\nThe open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow \"Duplicate of XXXXXXXX\" section of the bug reporter user interface. This section appears near the top of the right column's bug detail view just under the bug number, title, state, product and rank.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please update your report directly here: http://bugreport.apple.com/.\r\n\r\n\r\nNima Hoda\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I'm editing a pdf in one program and viewing it in Preview at the same time, whenever I save (or rebuild) the pdf, Preview reloads the file when I switch focus to Preview.  This is good and expected, but in the continuous scroll view the pdf is returned to the first page upon reload.  This is annoying and was not the behaviour in previous OS X releases (e.g. Snow Leopard).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a multipage pdf that you can edit or rebuilt (e.g. from latex source) in Preview in continuous scroll view (Cmd-1 in Preview).\r\n2. Scroll down to some page other than the first page.\r\n2. Modify and save or rebuild the pdf using another application.\r\n3. Switch focus to the pdf window in Preview.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected:\r\n4. Preview reloads the file but maintains the current position (current page and ideally also maintains the position in that page as well).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Preview reloads the file and scrolls back to the top.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI frequently edit latex on mac.  This bug really disrupts my workflow since I upgraded from Snow Leopard."
