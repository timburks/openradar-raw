    description: "Summary:\r\nI updated my multiple devices to iOS 9.2.1, since than I am unable to run any application from Xcode\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1-Attach iPhone with iOS 9.2.1 to my Mac Mini.\r\n2-Build App (in development)\r\n3-Run App\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected my app to run on iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode shows warning \"dyld_shared_cache extract_dylibs failed\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode : Version 7.2.1 (7C1002)\r\nOSX : El Capitan Version 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMost common solution found on forums.apple was to delete the developer disk image of iOS on my device from the location : \"/applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/platforms/iphoneos.platform/Devicesupport\" but problem is that there is no disk image for 9.2.1 and if delete 9.2 (13C75), I start getting Developer Disk image not found which is quite obvious. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is always happening with devices running iOS 9.2.1. I have tested iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. I also tried different apps under development.\r\n\r\nThis does not happens with devices running iOS 9.2. I have tested iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. All app, I have, under development are running as expected. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'9.2 (13C75).zip' was successfully uploaded."
