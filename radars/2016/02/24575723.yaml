        I consistently see a flash of completely black screen when using four-finger swipe in beta 3. This happens 100% of the time and seems to be new with this beta update.

        I tried to make a QuickTime movie of the effect, but oddly enough, it does not show up in the captured video. So Iâ€™m attaching a camera video so that you can get an idea of what it looks like.
