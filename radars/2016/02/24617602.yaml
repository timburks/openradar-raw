        UIStackView automatically removes hidden views from its layout. This behavior is very useful. However, currently, it's not possible to set a view as hidden for a certain size class in Interface Builder. This would allow easily e.g. hiding non-essential UI elements on smaller devices.

        The existing "installed" checkbox doesn't play well with views in a stack view.
