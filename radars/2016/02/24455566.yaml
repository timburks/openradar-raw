        Summary:
        Our application prompts the user for their location when the app starts up. Based on their action, a couple of different routes are taken. With the current set of UI Tooling I do not see a way to be able to reset the app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have an app under UI testing that prompts for the user’s location, then performs different actions based on whether the location was successfully retrieved or not. Have two UI tests, the first to test when the user accepts the prompts, the second if the user does not. The first test can pass, as the app prompts for location services access, the second does not.

        Expected Results:

        UI testing should provide the ability to either:

        1. Uninstall the app, so as to wipe the application OS level settings
        2. Reset the app back to “fresh install” state

        Actual Results:
        There is no way to reset the app.
