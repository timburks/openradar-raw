    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI’d say probable half of the time in a medium-size Swift project this occurs. I pause at a breakpoint, click to see back a few frames from the current breakpoint, and it crashes. That’s exactly what happened here.\r\n\r\n- I set a breakpoint\r\n- Ran app in iPhone 6s 9.2 sim\r\n- Xcode paused at the break point as expected \r\n- I pressed Command + 6 to see the paused stack\r\n- I clicked 2 frames back from the one at the top of the stack\r\n- Xcode crashed."
