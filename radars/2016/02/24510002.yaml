    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a bunch of files in my workspace that are not interesting, in general, for global search results. They are components to libraries that comprise my app, so they are useful to have in the workspace (and sometimes I even want to search them!) but they are not as a rule files that I want to include in default searches.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Xcode's nicely generalized search scope functionality provided for adding \"exclusionary\" rules such that I could for example define a search scope for items whose:\r\n\r\n[Location] is [Within the workspace]\r\n[Location] is [Not within the folder] [BigOldIgnoredFolder]\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 beta (7D129n)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Exclude.png' was successfully uploaded."
