    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app is emailing audio attachments, however if the attachment is large and the email body has an HTML link, the attachment fails. Simply removing the link from the body of the email allows the attachment to be successfully delivered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the EmailAttachmentProblem app that has been supplied. (Attachment supplied to Apple)\r\n\r\n1. There are different audio files in the list, along with their size.\r\n2. Select any of the first 5 files that are under 1MB in size.\r\n3. Set the recipient in the email TO and send. This will work. \r\n\r\nNote, there is a link \"Apple\" that points to the apple website.\r\n\r\n4. Select any of the last 2 files, that are 5.4MB in size.\r\n5. Set the recipient TO and send the email. This will fail\r\n\r\nNote: The recipient will receive an email with no content in the body of the email, and no attachment.\r\n\r\n6. Select the same large file as in step 4.\r\n7. Set the recipient TO in the email, but also DELETE the \"Apple\" link from the body of the email.\r\n8. Send the email - this time the attachment will work fine.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should be able to send large attachments even if there is an HTML link in the body of the mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email fails to send correctly. The email body is empty and the attachment is missing or zero size, if it was a large attachment and the body had an HTML link."
