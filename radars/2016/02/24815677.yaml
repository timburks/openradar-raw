    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running UI tests in the iOS simulator, the test will hang and time out if Optimize Rendering for Window Scale is disabled in the simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(Watch the attached video for a full demonstration.)\r\n1. Open the attached sample code in Xcode 7.3b4.\r\n2. Run the app in the iPad Pro iOS 9.3 simulator, and make sure it builds and runs OK.\r\n3. Use Command-4 to scale the simulator to 33%.\r\n4. Disable “Optimize Rendering for Window Scale” under the Debug menu in the Simulator app.\r\n5. Open PadiddleUITests.swift in Xcode.\r\n6. Click the Run arrow next to testToolbarStaysHiddenWhileRotating() to run just that test, or use Command-U to run all tests.\r\n7. Observe that the test passes.\r\n8. In the Simulator, enable “Optimize Rendering for Window Scale” in the Debug menu.\r\n9. Re-run the same test again.\r\n10. Observe that the test hangs after this line: XCUIDevice.sharedDevice().orientation = .LandscapeRight\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test passes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test times out because it is unable to get a screenshot after the aforementioned line.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a problem because I’m trying to run these tests on Xcode bots, and it keeps timing out. I can’t figure out whether bots always use full resolution, or whether they optimize rendering for window scale.\r\n\r\nWhile the test is hanging, if you switch to the simulator and disable “Optimize Rendering for Window Scale”, the test will immediately finish and pass.\r\n\r\nI’ve attached a system report of my Retina MacBook Pro, but I also reproduced the issue on a non-Retina Mac mini (Late 2012) with the same software stack.\r\n\r\nVideo: http://cl.ly/fEk1\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/fEuw"
