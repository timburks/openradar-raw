    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a script that goes through all the messages in a mailbox and then uses some GUI scripting to perform some actions on them. I've discovered that script no longer works correctlyâ€”\"set selected messages of message viewer 0 to aMessage\" is selecting the wrong message. It always selects the message after the one I tell it to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Mail.\r\n2. Select a mailbox with at least two emails.\r\n3. Open Script Editor.\r\n4. Paste in this script:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Mail\"\r\n\tset theMailboxes to the selected mailboxes of message viewer 0\r\n\tset aMailbox to item 1 of theMailboxes\r\n\tset theMessages to messages of aMailbox\r\n\tset aMessage to item 1 of theMessages\r\n\tset theSubject to subject of aMessage\r\n\tset selected messages of message viewer 0 to aMessage\r\n\treturn theSubject\r\nend tell\r\n\r\n5. Run the script.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script gets a reference to the first email in the selected mailbox. It then uses the same reference to get the subject of the email, and tells Mail to select that message. After the script is run, the selected message in Mail should match the subject text that Script Editor returns.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail always selects the message that comes after the message it's told to select.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 Beta (15E49a). Mail 9.3 (3124).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI first noticed the bug in 10.11.3. Last year I had no problems with whatever version of Yosemite was current at the time. The latest 10.11.4 beta hasn't helped.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n4GHz i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, M295X\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
