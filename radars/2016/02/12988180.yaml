    description: "Summary:\r\niCal does not recognise emails with text/agenda (MIME) attachment as a agenda invitation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send an email as given in the attached file.\r\n2. Open iCal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected iCal to read the account, and present me with an invitation request.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCal does not present me with an invitation request\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n* Calendar on the iPhone (iOS 6.0.2) does recognise the email as invitation request\r\n* iCal on Mac OS X does recognise other requests which are sent by Outlook, and are formatted as some inline request (it has a link to https://webmail.sara.nl/owa?ae=Item&amp;a=open&amp;t=IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request&amp;id=RgAAAADt%2FhNRxRYQQovxyxI9mPYtBwCu8LU7UyUYQ4BIHdsiyOebAHr4Ysv0AAB8Tgw2iDctTqKGGub7K6G6AAAJ%2BcxLAAAL)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have not tested this on Mac OS 10.8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK by Apple Developer Relations:\r\n\r\nWe only process iMIP invites automatically if that preference is turned on in Mail/iCal, is it turned on?\r\n\r\nWhen processing iMIP invites (if that checkbox is on), we will never import iCalendar data with attendees into an Exchange account.  Do you have local or CalDAV calendars set up?\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK by Bug reporter (Freek):\r\n\r\nThe setting \"Automatically retrieve CalDAV invitations from Mail\" (iCal > Preferences > Advanced) is indeed on.\r\n\r\nI can not see any other relevant configuration settings (Note: this is iCal 5.0.3). I do not understand your remark on importing iCalendar data into an Exchange account. The source of data is a Exchange mail account. The destination is the calendar associated with the same Exchange account."
