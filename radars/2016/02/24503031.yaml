    description: "Summary:\nI (and my designers) would love to be able to use SVG rather than PDF for resizeable assets. The advantages of SVG over the current PDF solution are significant: \n\n- SVG is a standard which is already supported for export from most design programs. Getting PDFs exported that work correctly on iOS requires tweaking. \n- Significantly smaller file sizes than PDF. \n- New screen sizes could be supported automatically without requiring recompiliation, as would currently be required with the PDF solution since PNGs are generated by Xcode at 1x, 2x, and 3x to be used within the app. \n- The same SVG could be used for different sizes of image (for example, large and small versions of a logo), whereas the PDF solution requires different PDFs rendered at whatever the “1x” size for each image. \n- SVGs are already heavily in use on the web, so being able to use them on iOS would reduce the amount of work our designers need to do to export assets since they could use SVG for both web and iOS.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Attempt to add SVG to asset catalog as universal size image.\n2. Have sad when that doesn’t work.\n\nExpected Results:\n1. Attempt to add SVG to asset catalog as universal size image.\n2. It is added. \n3. Image is rendered properly at any size (preferably accessible as a UIImage or NSImage)\n\nActual Results:\n(see “steps to reproduce”)\n\nRegression:\nNot a regression - this would be a new feature.  \n\nNotes:\nThere’s a couple of libs out there that attempt to do this to varying degrees of success, but direct asset catalog support would be REALLY helpful. Please? :)"
