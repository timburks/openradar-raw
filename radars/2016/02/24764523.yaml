    description: "Summary:\r\nI got my iPhone 6s on launch day, and I set it up as a new iPhone using an existing Apple ID. I have yet to be able to get it to sync to iTunes. Every time I plug it in, iTunes recognizes it as a device that has yet to be set up. It prompts me to restore it from a backup (and it doesn't list any recent backups that I've been doing nightly to iCloud) or set it up as a new device\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot for exactly what I see when I plug in my iPhone\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get new iPhone 6s\r\n2. Set it up as a new device\r\n3. Plug it into a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2013 model\r\n4. iTunes 12.3.2.35 opens automatically and cannot recognize the iPhone as being already set up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should recognize that I set up my iPhone months ago.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes does not recognize that I've set up my iPhone\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.3, iTunes 12.3.2.35, iOS 9.2.1"
