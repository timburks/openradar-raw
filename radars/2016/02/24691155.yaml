    description: "Summary:\r\nDeleting a folder on a remote server via Finder won't retain the current view, forcing you to recreate the path you traveled to where that folder lived.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to an external AFP/SMB server.\r\n2. Navigate several directories in from the share point.\r\n3. Delete a folder there.\r\n4. Observe that Finder will kick you all the way our of your path, back to the share point.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeleting a folder on a server should act the same as a local disk and not kick you back out of the path you traveled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder will kick you all the way our of your path, back to the share point.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.3"
