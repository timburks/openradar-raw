    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iBooks app in iOS doesn't respect the Title set during the InstallMedia MDM request. Instead, the books name defaults to \"Untitled\". After the first time you open the document, the name will change to the name that's set in the document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find an enterprise document\r\n2. Install it using the \"InstallMedia\" MDM request and set the \"Title\" parameter to something other than the documents title\r\n3. Open iBooks on iOS. Notice that (after downloading has completed) the name of the document is \"Untitled\". \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iBooks app should display the Title that's pushed using the InstallMediaMDM request OR the title of the document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe document name is set to \"Untitled\". If you open the book and return to the library, the name is set to the name of the document.. NOT the name that's set during the InstallMedia MDM request. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niBooks version 4.7 (build 3463.10.71)\r\niOS version 9.3 (build 13E5191d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screenshot before opening the document.png', 'Screenshot after opening the document.png' and 'MDM Request.xml' were successfully uploaded."
