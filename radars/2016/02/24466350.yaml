        Summary:
        I’m making a search field that should allow only numeric input, and I want to use a custom keyboard like MMNumberKeyboard, but UISearchBar’s .inputView is readonly.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Try to set .inputView on a UISearchBar.

        Expected Results:
        Compiles without error. Shows a custom input view when the search bar becomes the first responder.

        Actual Results:
        Compilation error because UISearchBar’s inputView property is readonly.

        Regression:
        As far as I know, this has never worked.

        Notes:
        It’s possible if you traverse subviews and set the inputView on search bar’s private label, but obviously that’s pretty fragile. It would be nice if this were supported.
