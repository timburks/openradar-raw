    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt is far too easy to orphan an apple watch when restoring an iCloud backup on the iPhone it is pared with. I’ve had to help over 5 people with this issue since the device came out; all when they got new phones whether due to repair or a new purchase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Restore a phone backup without unpairing your watch, because nothing in that process suggests that might be a good idea\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe watch shouldn’t be orphaned without any objection\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe watch is orphaned without any objection\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nLatest releases\r\n\r\nNotes:"
