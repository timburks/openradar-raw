    description: "Summary:\r\nMany schools ask us if it's possible to organise iBooks (both Enterprise and iBooks Store) documents by adding them to a new or existing collection. Currently this is not possible, it would be great that the MDM protocol gets extended to it's possible for the MDM to add the book to a new or existing collection in the iBooks app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Push an enterprise or iBooks Store document\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdd the document to a custom Collection\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe document is added to the default \"Books\" or \"PDFs\" collection. Instead, we would like to be able to create a Collection by the MDM and add documents to it. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
