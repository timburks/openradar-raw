    description: "Brandon Carpenter05-Feb-2016 04:23 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter getting into the bad state, a UINavigationController's navigationBar will initially show the correct UINavigationItem, but then will revert to the previous UINavigationItem every time a UIViewController is pushed onto the stack.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Push a UIViewController onto a UINavigationController stack\r\n2. Set navigationBarHidden = YES on the navigation controller\r\n3. Push another view controller onto the navigation stack.\r\n4. Begin an interactive pop transition and then cancel it.\r\n5. Pop back to the previous view controller\r\n6. Set navigationBarHidden = NO on the navigation controller\r\n7. Attempt to push a view controller onto the stack\r\n\r\nThe attached sample project has step by step instructions as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation controller's navigation bar displays the current topViewController's navigation item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe navigation controller's navigation bar displays the current topViewController's navigation item while transitioning, but then reverts to the previously shown navigation item when the animation finishes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nLooks like -[UINavigationBar _cancelInteractiveTransition] is getting called, even on push transitions after getting into this state? I can set a breakpoint on that symbol, and the navigation bar shows the correct navigation item before it and the wrong navigation item afterwards.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s 16GB AT&T, using WIFI\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Sample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
