    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://17284891\n\nSummary:\r\nSuppose you have a variadic function:\r\n\r\n    func sum(x: Int…) …\r\n\r\nAnd you have a matching array in your code:\r\n\r\n    let vars = [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nSwift should have a mechanism to pass the array to the function by unpacking the array into the argument list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Write a variadic method, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    func sum(xs: Int…) -> Int { return reduce(xs, 0) { sum, num in sum + num } }\r\n\r\n2. Declare a variable containing an Array with a matching type, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    let vars = [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\n3. Try to call the function with the array, using some appropriate syntax, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    sum(vars)\r\n    sum(*vars)\r\n    sum(vars…)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is some way to do this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to do this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe current best suggestion is to provide another version of the function that accepts an array:\r\n\r\n    func sum(vars: Int[]) -> Int { return reduce(xs, 0) { sum, num in sum + num } }\r\n    func sum(vars: Int…) { return sum(vars) }\r\n\r\nThis does work, but it’s kind of clunky.\r\n\r\nThe * syntax is based on Ruby and Perl 6. The … is my own suggestion, meant to match the … in a variadic signature. However, I actually think … might be better for indicating currying; I’ll file that bug eventually."
