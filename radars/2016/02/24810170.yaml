    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a push notification is received while wearing Apple Watch, the paired phone does not vibrate or make sounds. There are many cases where a notification is received (triggering a wrist tap) and it would be easier to look at my phone which is docked or laying within view. The phone display should turn on without vibrating to make it easy to view the notification.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a notification while wearing Apple Watch.\r\n2. Get tapped on wrist by the watch (possibly hidden by a long sleeve)\r\n3. Look at phone to see the notification\r\n4. The phone screen does not turn on\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone screen turns on to display the notification.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe phone screen remains off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, AT&T"
