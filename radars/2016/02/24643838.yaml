    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://23062925\n\nSummary:\r\nIt would help developers *a lot* if there was a way to trigger a snapshot (screenshot) in the UI Tests. \r\n\r\nWhy is it useful\r\n- Allows us to generate screenshots when we need them\r\n- Allows us to debug issues if we're unsure what's happening on the screen (e.g. on a build server)\r\n\r\nAlternatively it would be good if there was a `xcrun simctl screenshot` command to take a screenshot of the currently running simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be very useful for the https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot project, to enable developers to automate the generation of screenshots\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
