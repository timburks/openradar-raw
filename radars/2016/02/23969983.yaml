    description: "Summary:\r\nI exported a bunch of images out of Photos for Mac to construct some panoramas and in many of my groups images were cut off before they finished exporting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Well I'm using raw images from my Canon T2i.\r\n2. I choose between 5 and 20 pictures to export.\r\n3. Command-shift-E to export (a screenshot of the images settings is included in the zipped images I'll attach to this bug report)\r\n4. Choose a folder. Wait until the export is complete.\r\n5. Check the zip file I attached for results of one of the exports.\r\n\r\nThis happened many times. I exported probably 12 groups of images today for various projects and in almost every single group there was between one and five images that were just cut off at various stages of export.\r\nIf you'd like the original files just let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould be great if I didn't have to re-export individual pics in order to fix the problem the first time. Every time I exported one pic at a time I had no issue. I re-exported the images that were cut off and the second time they all exported fine (but again only exporting one at a time).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee some of images in the included zip file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos for Mac 1.3 (350.23.0), Digital Camera RAW 6.18 (828)\r\nDigital Camera RAW Support 6180 (204)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've only tested this on my MacBook Pro 2012 retina. Running 10.11.2 (15C50). Using iCloud Library.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Take 5.zip' was successfully uploaded."
