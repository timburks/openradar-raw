    description: "Summary:\r\nExample:  Hitting the mic button on an iOS keyboard is an opaque operation, for the most part in that the developer doesn't get access to the voice audio captured by the dictation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. tap in an editable text field or text view\r\n2. tap the mic button on the keyboard\r\n3. tap \"Done\" when finished dictating.\r\n4. at the delegate method dictationEnded(), provide a reference to the audio buffer property that was captured for a given dictation phrase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to be able to save off the actual audio of a dictation, not only the resulting text of a dictation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot asking for any structure within the audio (e.g., time ranges mapped to each spoken/translated word), just the audio as a blob of audio data.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
