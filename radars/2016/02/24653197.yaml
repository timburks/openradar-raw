    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using imageFlippedForRightToLeftLayoutDirection to flip image in RTL languages for attributed string the image wonâ€™t be flipped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. switch the device to RTL language (Arabic or Hebrew)\r\n2. Run the Attached sample project \r\n3. observe the two sample labels with text and image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Arrow on both labels should point to the left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Arrow on first label that used imageFlippedForRightToLeftLayoutDirection is pointing to the right (WRONG).\r\n2. Arrow n the second label that is using CGIImage flip is pointing to the left (CORRECT).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happen on all iOS devices when using RTL language.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are using the CGImage as a workaround until this is fixed."
