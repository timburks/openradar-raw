        Summary:
        NSSearchField restores deallocated first responder using an internal instance variable _previousResponder

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I will add a demo application
        1. NSSearchField is the first responder
        2. Open a NSPopover, which has a view like NSTextView, by clicking on a button
        3. Close and deallocated the popover
        4. NSSearchField will the the first responder again, and stores the deallocated first responder in _previousResponder
        5. Switch to a different application
        6. Switch back to the application, bad access because of the restore deallocated first responder

        Important is that the NSSearchField doesnâ€™t use the centered lock.

        Expected Results:
        No crash.
        The reference _previousResponder should be weak

        Actual Results:
        Bad access
