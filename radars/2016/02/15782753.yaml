    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to empty the trash that includes a recently watched TV show Finder complains about an open file. After quitting/restarting iTunes emptying trash works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a TV show in iTunes\r\n2. Stop playback\r\n3. Delete file from iTunes\r\n4. Try emptying trash\r\n5. Get error message about open file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmpty trash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRemoving file from trash doesn't work\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.2 (13C32)\r\niTunes 11.1.3 (8)\r\n\r\nNote: This also happens with the latest public release of OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI see this happen with other files and apps (like Preview) as well. Even though the recently viewed file has been closed and is in trash, it isn't possible to empty the trash without quitting the app (Preview for example) first.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro with Retina Display, 13-inch, Late 2013\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
