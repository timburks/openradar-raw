    description: "Summary:\nFinder provides an AppleScript dictionary. Because this dictionary has never been updated with access groups like some other system-provided applications (e.g., Mail), interfacing with it requires using the temporary entitlement “com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events”. Apps using this entitlement are rejected:\n\n2.31\n\nWe've determined that one or more temporary entitlement exceptions requested for this app are not appropriate and will not be granted:\n\ncom.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events - com.apple.finder\n\nWe understand this may prevent the app from being approved for the Mac App Store. We encourage you to investigate other ways of implementing the desired functionality. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create an app with the entitlement “com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events” for “com.apple.finder”.\n2. Try to get it to pass App Review.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe ability to interface with Finder using the entitlement “com.apple.security.scripting-targets” and pas App Review.\n\nActual Results:\nThe app was rejected."
