        Summary:
        There is no easy way to detect if you are inside a test without resorting to launch arguments and other trickery.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Find that some code needs to behave differently in a testing environment.
        2. Attempt to wrap that code in a conditional check for logic or UI tests.

        Expected Results:
        There is an easy way to do this, such as a property on NSProcessInfo that tells you whether you’re in an app-hosted test, logic test, UI test, or not testing, perhaps using an enum.

        Actual Results:
        There is no easy way to do it. You have to resort to a combination of (NSClassFromString(“XCTestCase”) != nil), launch argument hackery, and witchcraft.

        Regression:
        -
