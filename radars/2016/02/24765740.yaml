    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an app that supports upside down orientation in said orientation and receiving a notification (such as iMessage) that supports quick reply it is impossible to reply as the keyboard presents from the top of the screen upside down and covers the notification and input field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app that supports upside down orientation (I used Waze)\r\n2. Turn phone upside down\r\n3. Have someone send an iMessage to the phone\r\n4. Notification centre pops down from the top as expected with the message\r\n5. Pull down on the notification to get the quick reply field\r\n6. Keyboard is presented over top of notification upside down\r\n7. Cannot reply, only way to get out is to press home button to dismiss the keyboard/notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard should present from bottom of screen in correct orientation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeyboard is presented from top of screen down as if the phone is in portrait mode the right way up.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have only been able to test this on my iPhone 6s on iOS 9.2.1 but I am able to recreate every time"
