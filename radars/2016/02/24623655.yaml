    description: "Summary:\r\nAn Apple Music link copied from iTunes and pasted into Messages will display as hyperlinked text. If the recipient of the iMessage is on an iOS device, they will be unable to act upon the link – it will simply display as text on their end.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch iTunes and navigate to an album in Apple Music\r\n2. Click the Sharing button and select “Copy Link”\r\n3. Switch to Messages and paste the link in a new message.\r\n4. Send the message to an iOS device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLink within message is just a plain bare http:// link, maybe with a title (“Message in a Bottle”: http://itun.es/ca/)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s just text on the recipient’s end (“Message in a Bottle”) and cannot be acted upon\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNot sure whether this is an iTunes, Messages, or iOS bug, but I feel like iTunes should be copying links that are more universal. Also, this is a chain of Apple products, from iTunes on OS X to iMessage to iOS, and it doesn’t function correctly? Weird."
