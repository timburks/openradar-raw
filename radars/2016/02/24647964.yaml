        Summary:
        Unable to select Xcode and/or start Xcode service in OS X Server.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Install OS X Server application.
        2. Open Server.app.
        3. Select Xcode service from the Services list on the left panel.
        4. Press the “Choose Xcode…” button. The open dialog appears.
        5. Find and select the Xcode application in the list of the apps. Press “Choose” button in the dialog.
        6. Next the following scenarios are possible:
        	Scenario 1
        	6.1. “Enable Accessibility access for UI Testing?” dialog appears.
        	6.2. Press “Request Access” button. System Preferences app opens the “Security & Privacy” screen on the “Privacy” tab.
        	6.3. Unlock the access by pressing on the lock button in the lower left corner if necessary.
        	6.4. Find Xcode Helper in the “Allow the apps below to control your computer” list. Check the checkbox next to the Xcode Helper.
        	6.5. Close the System Preferences app. Switch back to the Server.app.
        	6.6. Nothing happened. Xcode service is still not turned on. Pressing “Chose Xcode…”  button starts the Scenario 1.
        	Scenario 2
        	6.1. Xcode opens. No user agreement is shown.
        	6.2. Switch back to the Server.app.
        	6.3. Nothing happened. Xcode service is still not turned on. Pressing “Chose Xcode…”  button starts the Scenario 2.

        Expected Results:
        Server.app allows me to select the Xcode and turns the Xcode service on.

        Actual Results:
        Server.app doesn’t turn the Xcode service on. Sometimes it asks to enable accessibility access for UI testing. Enabling the access does nothing. Sometimes it asks for accepting Xcode user agreement. Opens Xcode, Xcode doesn’t show any user agreement and Server.app is just waiting. Even accepting the user agreement from the command line does nothing.

        Regression:
        The workflow worked fine with the same environment, but for Xcode 7.2.
