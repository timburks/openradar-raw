    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I go for a bike ride I end with nothing for cycling distance and extra steps I didn't actually take. I don't care so much about the cycling distance if you happen to want to leave that for 3rd parties but it is annoying that after a long bike ride it instead says I've done 20,000 extra steps that I didn't actually take. Phil got on stage at the iPhone 6 introduction and said 'your phone can tell when you are walking and when you are biking'. If that's the case then please don't count steps when I'm not walking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Grab an iPhone 6.\r\n2. Turn on steps in the Health app so it shows up in the dashboard.\r\n3. Note current number of steps for today.\r\n4. Go for a long bike ride.\r\n5. Thank me that you got to go outside and enjoy a bike ride in order to reproduce this bug.\r\n6. After bike ride notice how many steps Health app thinks you took that you really didn't. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCycling should not change the number of steps you've taken unless you have to get off your bike to walk across a busy street. :-)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou end up with an inflated number of steps because the app chooses to ignore that your current motion activity is cycling.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReproducibility: every single time I go biking.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
