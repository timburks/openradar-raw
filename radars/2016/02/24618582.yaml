        Summary:
        Generating launch images using a launch screen .storyboard or .xib is very useful. However, changes made to a launch-screen’s assets are not reflected after an app’s launch image has already been cached by Springboard. This makes it difficult to test changes while running debug builds from the Simulator or on a device. (App Store distributions are not affected)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        (see attached sample project)
        1. Create a new iOS project (Single View template).
        2. Find a cool image for the launch screen.
        3. Configure the LaunchScreen storyboard to include a centered image view with the cool image.
        (the included sample has done up to here)
        4. Run the project from the debugger using the Simulator or a device.
        5. Change the cool image to some other image.
        (In the sample, duplicate Thumbs-Up.png to Assets.xcassets/Thumb.imageset/Thumb.png)
        6. Run the project again from the debugger using the Simulator or a device.
        7. Watch for the launch image to display (it will go by quickly). The Image is not updated.

        Expected Results:
        Changes to the LaunchScreen’s assets should invalidate the cached launch image.

        Actual Results:
        A LaunchScreen’s assets are cached for a (indeterminate) long amount of time.
