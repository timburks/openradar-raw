    description: "[This is a duplicate of rdar://24607701. We're affected in our Where To? app as well where I can reproduce the crash 100%. Maybe also related to rdar://16002125]\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen triggering a page change through `setViewControllers:​animated:​completion:​` on a UIPageViewController while the controller is animating (e.g. showing a bounce animation)​, the controller crashes (most of the time)​.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:​\r\n0. Open the example project\r\n1. Run it on an actual device\r\n2. Scroll to the previous page (there is no, so the page view controller starts bouncing)​\r\n3. Try to go as far into the bounce as possible for a higher success rate\r\n4. Lift your finger so that the bounce animation starts\r\n5. Immediately (while the bounce animation is playing)​ tap the 'Next Page' button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe next page is shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 6 iOS 9.2 /​ iPhone 6s iOS 9.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample Project: https://github.com/michaelochs/radars/tree/master/24607701%20-%20PageViewControllerCrash\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 & iPhone 6s"
