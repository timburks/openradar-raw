    description: "Summary:\r\nSince I got my iPhone 6s on launch day in 2015, I haven't been able to activate iCloud Keychain by tapping \"Approve with Security Code\". If I tap it, it prompts me to sign in to iCloud, and then it asks for my security code. I do both of those things, and then it texts a verification code to my phone number.\r\n\r\nI enter the verification code, and after spinning for about 15 seconds, I get a \"Could Not Set Up iCloud Keychain\" error message every time I try to do this.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying because I frequently get alerts on restarting my phone telling me to do this process all over again, and it never works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to  Settings > iCloud > Keychain\r\n2. Tap \"Approve with Security Code\" with the iCloud Keychain switch turned on\r\n3. Sign in to iCloud\r\n4. Input iCloud security code\r\n5. Receive verification code text\r\n6. Input verification code\r\n7. Get \"Could Not Set Up iCloud Keychain\" error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to set up iCloud Keychain (I've been able to do this on every previous phone since the feature was introduced), or at the very least I should get a descriptive error message about what is going wrong.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a \"Could Not Set Up iCloud Keychain\" error message, with no other hints about what to do\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 64 GB, Verizon, Wi-Fi"
