    description: "We are experiencing seemingly random errors from keychain access methods like SecItemCopyMatching() -- in cases where we know there's a value stored, we instead get the return code -34018 which is not a documented error code.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, we can quit and run the app again, and the same code will instead return the correct value and no error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall SecItemCopyMatching() with a valid dictionary to request access to an existing keychain item, fails with error -34018 some of the time.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeychain methods should only return documented error codes, so should never return this error code.  If there is a problem accessing the keychain, there are existing error codes to communicate the reason for the failure.  In our cases, the keychain methods should return correct values in all cases that we see the -34018 code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe are getting error code -34018.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMultiple versions up to and including iOS 9.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is likely the same issue being discussed on the Internet, like here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/4743\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMultiple devices, including iPhone and iPad"
