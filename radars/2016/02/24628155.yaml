    description: "Summary:\nWhen bringing up the keyboard, by tapping on a text field, for the first time after an app launch, there is a huge delay. Even on the iPad Pro there is a delay of multiple seconds before the keyboard shows.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen the attached Xcode project, build and run. Tap the text field on the screen.\n\nExpected Results:\nKeyboard appears really quickly.\n\nActual Results:\nYou wait and wait, realistically you tap it a few more times. Eventually the keyboard shows up.\n\nNotes:\nThis test application worked fine on an iPhone 5s. \nOn an iPad mini 2 and iPad Pro, the were delays of multiple seconds."
