    description: "Summary:\r\nHi there please hear me out because this should take priority if you ever want VR mainstream on Safari and IOS. \r\n\r\nSafari on IOS and OSX have a severe flaws with CORS security for html5 video which is completely crippling Webgl and therefore VR video support.\r\n\r\nIt has been like this for years . \r\n\r\nThere is a webkit issue for this but they have treated it with nothing but contempt. It has been sitting there since July 2014 with nobody assigned to it. \r\n\r\nAlso we need a way to get video playing inline on Iphone to display the Webgl canvas. \r\n\r\nEven with CORS support finally added in that doesn't need dodgy reverse proxy hacks Iphone will be completely useless for WebVR until it can play inline. \r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135379\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/0agb03Ld/17/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNeeds to handle \r\n\r\nvideo.crossOrigin = \"anonymous\";\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCross domain security errors\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX / IOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe work around is evident on my VR video demo page. It requires an Nginx or Apache reverse proxy to the video stored on cloudfront. This is bad for production purposes and will not scale. I have a similar solution for 2D canvas drawing but loading one frame of a video is different to playback. \r\n\r\nhttps://flowplayer.electroteque.org/vr360/fp6\r\nhttps://flowplayer.electroteque.org/snapshot/fp6"
