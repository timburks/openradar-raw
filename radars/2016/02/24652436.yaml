    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter changing a UILabel to be attributed instead of plain in IB, the performance of the inspector degrades significantly, often causing the main thread in Xcode to be unresponsive for several seconds. This happens over and over again if you take any action within the label’s inspector, including just scrolling the inspector to view all of the properties.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a storyboard\r\n2. Create a view controller\r\n3. Add a UILabel to it\r\n4. Change the label to be attributed instead of just plain using the label’s inspector\r\n5. Try to perform any other action in the inspector, including just scrolling the inspector or trying to change the text of the label while it is attributed. The UI is painfully slow.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is reproducible with a single UILabel, but it really starts to show its effects when you have multiple elements. I've added two attributed UILabels in the example project. Try changing the text of the labels, scrolling their inspectors, and switching back and forth between inspecting the two labels\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect a snappy UI whether the label is attributed or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe inspector is perfectly snappy when the label is plain, but when it is attributed, it blocks the main thread considerably. Performance is awful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.2 (7C1002)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X El Cap 10.11.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Attributed Label Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
