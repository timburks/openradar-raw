    description: "We believe the iPhone 6 Plus, on iOS 9.2 and later, has a bug in its OpenGL implementation, this causes significant memory growth and the OS kills the app eventually. We're seeing this issue in both GPUImage and Core Image implementations of our app.\r\n\r\nThe basic problem manifests itself as so:\r\n1. Editing a photo on the iPhone 6+ is extremely sluggish after chaining enough CoreImage filters together, and eventually crashes with memory issues\r\n2. iPhone 6, 6s and 6s+ don’t have any of these issues and editing photos is extremely fast with CoreImage Filters\r\n3. There comes a point when we got warning messages about Framebuffers, and all of a sudden, the iPhone 6+ would work brilliantly just like the other devices. We’re unable to trace it as the code gets down to the CIContext and EAGLContext layer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nrun the attached sample app, on any phones other than iPhone 6+, such as iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, the \"before\" and \"after\" NSLog timestamps are very close, therefore the CIFilter chain filters the image quickly.\r\n\r\ndo the same on a iPhone 6+, it takes half a second to filter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nit should not be this slow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\neach filter chain pass takes 0.5 second.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2.1 (13D15)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis example app doesn't really show the problem very well, it shows performance issues but it doesn't crash. The commented out code shows the original intent of the app, but using the full CIFilter chain is slow even on the 6s.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6+ Verizon 16GB"
