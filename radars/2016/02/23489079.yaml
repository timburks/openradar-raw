    description: "Add and remove cells so that a collection view redraws.\r\nOn iOS 9 you will see that cells with empty labels will flicker between 0pt and 1pt in height. This was always 0pt in height in iOS 8.x which is the correct behaviour â€“ since there is no text on the label.\r\n\r\niOS 9 simulator and devices running iOS 9.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations, 18-Nov-2015 01:52 AM\r\nPlease verify this issue with iOS 9.2 beta 3 (Build: 13C71) and reply back with your results.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMohsan Khan, 21-Nov-2015 11:56 AM\r\nNope, the issue is still there.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMohsan Khan, 13-Dec-2015 00:08 AM\r\nThis bug still exists in iOS 9.2 (13C75) !!"
