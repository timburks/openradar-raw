    description: "Filing this as bug report after following up with Apple DTS:\r\n\r\nI have an app in the store that uses the directory returned by `-containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:` for certain data. This works well and the app is live, I'm throwing an exception in case this method returns nil.\r\n\r\nNow I've got a couple of crash reports, stemming from my exception, meaning for a few users (15 of ~70k) this method returns nil. According to Crashlytics, about ⅓ of these users have a jailbreak. I'm not sure if the other ⅔ also have a jailbreak but Crashlytics doesn't detect it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe exception in question:\r\n\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\r\n    NSURL *shared = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:kMCSharedGroupUserData];\r\n    if (!shared) {\r\n        [[NSException exceptionWithName:@\"MCSharedGroupUserDataNotAvailable\" reason:@\"The container URL for shared group user data is not available\" userInfo:nil] raise];\r\n    }\r\n}"
