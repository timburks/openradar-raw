    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode and Simulator won’t work at the same screen in split view mode introduced in El Capitan. It would be nice to to have simulator being able to work side-by-side with Xcode. (very much like playgrounds but with actual app running in simulator and code available in Xcode.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode and Simulator side-by-side when both in full screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode when in full screen won’t accept Simulator window on same screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
