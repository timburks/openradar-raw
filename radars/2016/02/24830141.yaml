    description: "In the interest of encouraging complex passcode use, the passcode entry keyboard should simplify entering mixed alphanumeric and special characters by including rows for both numbers and special characters, in addition to letters, on a single keyboard.\r\n\r\nRequiring the use of the keyboard toggle button to change keyboard modes can inhibit users from using numbers and symbols due to the additional time required when switching keyboards and reorienting to the layout change."
