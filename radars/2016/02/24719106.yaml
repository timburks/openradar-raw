    description: "Summary:\r\nWe use network account hosted via LDAP server with NFS homes.\r\nWhen computer in classroom starts (OS X is on SSD), there is brief moment at loginwindow when we can see red dot with message \"Network accounts are unavailable\".  This is expected behaviour (rdar://19810230) because our boot is so fast. OS X possibly does not have enough time before loginwindow to fire up Ethernet and LDAPv3 OD connector.\r\n\r\nHowever if user starts typing into username and password fields before  \"Network accounts are unavailable\" message appers and disappars there is nasty side effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot OS X from very fast SSD\r\n2. At loginwindow start typing username -> tab -> password\r\n3. \"Network accounts are unavailable\" message appears during typing user credentials\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser can continue typing his credentials without any problems. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen \"Network accounts are unavailable\" message appears next keystroke results in clearing current text field (with focus).\r\n\r\nWhen user is in the middle of typing his username or password he loses first half and must start typing username or password again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI think this is related to fact that message \"Network accounts are unavailable\" comes with small red dot which can gain focus (username -> tab -> red dot -> tab -> password)."
