    description: "If would be helpful to be able to have access to the separator to perform a slide over and/or split view actions as it is to change the device orientation. \r\n\r\nIn our case we have a very differentiate layout per size class so it's really helpful to test it to cover future changes.\r\n\r\nWhen we record the action looks good but when we run the test we always get the same error: \"No matches found\""
