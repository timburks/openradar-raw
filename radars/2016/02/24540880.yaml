    description: "Summary:\r\nNotes app is great for writing notes including images, drawings and rich text. When I am finished writing notes I would like to send them to a friend or a coworker as a PDF. Right now this is impossible. The only solution is to use a Mac and iCloud Sync to get a PDF out of Notes app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a note including inline images\r\n2. Tap share button and try to export\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can export a PDF as an action\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can only save images that are not the actual representation of the document, the only action that shows the right result is AirPrint which is useless if you donâ€™t have a printer.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
