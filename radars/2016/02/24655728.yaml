    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://24654192\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPresenting a UIAlertController on a modal view controller breaks the tint color of all the subviews of the original presented view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the example project\r\n- Note that in AppDelegate.m the window’s tint color is set to red\r\n- Note that in the Main.storyboard the tint color of the two segmented controls in the last two screens is set to green\r\n- Run the app either on simulator or device\r\n- Tap the ‘Present Screen’ button to get the app in a modal ui state\r\n- Note that the buttons on the next screen are red, as it’s the window’s tint color and the segmented control is green as in the storyboard.\r\n- Tap on ‘Show alert’\r\n- Dismiss the alert\r\n- Tap on ‘Push’ while looking at the segmented control\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The green segmented control stays green and the next screen has a green segmented control as well\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The segmented control turns red as you tap on the push button.\r\n- The segmented control on the next page is red as well\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis does not happen if you don’t open the alert but instead directly push the next screen.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a screencast and a sample project attached to this radar.\r\n\r\nSee the screencast. It showed the issue on a simulator there because I can point with the mouse to the area where something unexpected happens, but it is reproducible on the device as well.\r\n\r\nThis may be related to rdar://18365720 but I am unsure, so I file this as a new radar.\r\n\r\nFor OpenRadar please find the sample at https://github.com/michaelochs/radars/tree/master/24654192%20-%20TintColorWithAlertViewBroken"
