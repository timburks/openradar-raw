    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes t.co links from Twitters url shortener don’t work in Safari. When pasting the same url into Chrome it always works and I’m redirected to the target url immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open a t.co url in Safari, e.g https://t.co/AN7cVsrU1n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* redirected to target url\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* page loads indefinitely, redirect to target url never happens\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe behavior is rather new, but I can’t pinpoint when it started happening\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve seen occasional reports from other Safari users on twitter complaining about the same issue\r\n\r\nWorkaround seems to be to close the tab in which the url is loading, open a new tab an paste the url there. But this doesn’t always solve the issue.\r\n\r\nAttaching a sysdiagnose after just having the problem."
