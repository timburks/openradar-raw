    description: "Summary:\r\nThe genstrings utility searches source files for uses of NSLocalizedString(), extracting the key and other information out to a .strings file for localization and internationalization. genstrings can be run on Swift files in addition to Objective-C .h and .m files.\r\n\r\nHowever, invocations of NSLocalizedString() in Swift seem to only be supported by genstrings if they provide a key and a comment, but no other arguments. For example, NSLocalizedString() supports a `value:` argument in Swift; if this is given, an invocation of genstrings on that Swift file will fail, producing the error \"Argument is not a literal string.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached Swift file\r\n2. Invoke genstrings on this file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ngenstrings runs without error. A file Localizable.strings is generated with two keys: \"foo\" and \"bar\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ngenstrings runs, but produces an error for the NSLocalizedString() invocation that provides a value. A file Localizable.strings is generated with only the key \"foo\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D141l) / OS X 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://www.openradar.me/22133811 seems to indicate this has been a problem since at least Xcode 7.0. I tested with Xcode 7.2 and 7.3b3; both produced the same error.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on a mid-2015 MacBook Pro with Retina with a standalone Swift file, but I believe this applies on any project with Swift code, regardless of platform or device."
