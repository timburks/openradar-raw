    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have several reports of the audio being paused without input from the user. Users have noticed that it seems to be related to the display of an iAd. We notice in the forums that others have also seen this behaviour with respect to playing of Google Ads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnable to reproduce as we can not control the iAd banner that is being displayed in the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niAds should not impact the playing of audio within the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOccasionally, the audio pauses when an iAd banner is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVarious\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is an intermittent problem that several users have reported, but we unfortunately don't have control of the iAd banners so can not verify the problem. We are trying to work around the problem by turning off the Google Ads, which we have noticed others reporting as the cause of this problem. Please let us know if there is any way for us to verify which iAd banners are causing the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVarious models\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
