    description: "When a web page with URL A containing a Universal Link B is opened in SFSafariViewController, it opens the associated app when clicking the link to B. However, when B is opened directly in SFSafariViewController, this does not happen. This is inconsistent and makes universal links much less useful.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a universal is posted on a social network, a social networking app using SFSafariViewController doesn't open those universal links in the native app even if it's installed.\r\n\r\nI understand it might be a bad user experience if SFSafariViewController is displayed and immediately dismissed when detecting a Universal Link. So why don't you implement it like in Safari by displaying a small banner at the top of the web page?\r\n\r\nWe'd even add such a banner by customizing our web page. However there's no way I'm aware of to differentiate requests from Safari and SFSafariViewController."
