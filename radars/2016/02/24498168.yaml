    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode will fail to build a project if you reference a nested type that was declared in an extension, if the file that is doing the referencing comes earlier in the Compile Sources Build Phase than the file in which the nested type is declared in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n```\r\n// AFile.swift\r\nextension MyStruct.InnerStruct { }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// ZFile.swift\r\n\r\nstruct MyStruct { }\r\n\r\nextension MyStruct {\r\n    struct InnerStruct { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. Add the 2 files mentioned above\r\n4. Make sure AFile.swift comes above ZFile.swift in the Comile Sources step in the Build Phases\r\n5. Try to compile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project to compile\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt errors out on me\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.2.1 (7C1002)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe use a script[1] to sort our Xcode project to make merges and things easier to handle. As a result, everything is alphabetized. That's not the problem, but it's how we discovered it.\r\n\r\nIf AFile.swift comes before ZFile.swift in the Compile Sources Build Phase, you will be presented wth an error \"'InnerStruct' is not a member type of 'MyStruct'\"\r\n\r\nPut ZFile.swift above AFile.swift, and everything builds smoothly.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/adobe/webkit/blob/master/Tools/Scripts/sort-Xcode-project-file"
