    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery year around tax time I export all my email receipts as PDFs so I can file them away with all my other tax documents. This year I'm running into a lot of issues with that. Frequently the Export as PDF option will render an incomplete version of the email, in some cases only the headers, or in other cases completely blank.\r\n\r\nI've found that some \"Your receipt from Apple\" emails in particular fail consistently and repeatedly. Others seem to work fine if I just try again. If some cases choosing Print and then Save as PDF seemed to work better, but with this Apple email not even that works. I'm attaching one of the emails that fails repeatedly—both an .eml and the .pdf I get, as well as the console output during the export.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select an email in Mail\r\n2. Choose File > Export as PDF…\r\n3. Save the file wherever\r\n4. Open the file in Quick Look or Preview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PDF should look roughly similar to the actual email as viewed in Mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the PDF is cut off partway down, shows only the headers, or is completely blank.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 Beta (15E49a). Mail 9.3 (3124).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI first noticed the bug in 10.11.3. Last year I had no problems with whatever version of Yosemite was current at the time. The latest 10.11.4 beta hasn't helped.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n4GHz i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, M295X\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
