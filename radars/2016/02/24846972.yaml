        Summary:
        If a view controller is pushed onto a navigation controller that is inside of a UISplitViewController, hidesBottomBarWhenPushed is ignored and the tab bar is shown regardless. While this property likely should be ignored when both view controllers of the split view are being shown, on most iPhones and even the iPhone 6 Plus in portrait, it makes sense for the tab bar to be hidden.

        Unfortunately there is no way to hid a tab bar besides the hidesBottomBarWhenPushed property, so there is no way to override this behavior.
