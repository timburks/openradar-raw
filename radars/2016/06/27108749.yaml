    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a JavaScript in conjunction with FogBugz to facilitate quickly opening several bugs in a list in separate tabs. I've noticed since OS X Sierra Beta 1 that the script no longer behaves correctly: the first of several tabs opened, instead of loading the desired/expected URL, is titled \"parent-tab://\" and contains the content of the original URL that was open when the script was run.\r\n\r\nI've narrowed the problem down to an apparent issue with rapidly opening multiple URLs in succession. If only one new URL is opened, it loads fine, but if multiple URLs are opened in succession, the first one gets the bogus treatment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new bookmarklet in Safari, or otherwise arrange to have run:\r\n\r\njavascript:window.open(\"http://www.apple.com\",%20\"_blank\");%20window.open(\"http://www.red-sweater.com\",%20\"_blank\");\r\n\r\n2. Arrange for an open Safari window to have only one opened URL (no tabs).\r\n\r\n3. Run the script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo new tabs should appear, one with the contents of apple.com, and one with the contents of red-sweater.com.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the red-sweater.com tab loads, with the tab for apple.com showing \"parent-tab://\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 (12602.1.32.7)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMy MacBook Pro running OS X Sierra Beta\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
