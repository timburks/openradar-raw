    description: "Summary:\r\nVoiceOver appears to be losing track of the items in its buffer and, after browser repaint/setting of focus, still maintains a reference to the element which has been removed. When Accessibility Inspector asks what it believes currently has focus, VoiceOver is setting focus to the closest previous item which is still present in its buffer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing VoiceOver, visit:\r\n1. http://ember-a11y.github.io/ember-a11y/\r\n2. Click the \"Messages\" link.\r\n3. Click the \"Conversation with Jimmy\" link.\r\n4. Click the \"Back to message list.\" link.\r\n\r\nCan recreate the issue using vanilla JavaScript (without Ember) as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe focus should be reset to the header, not remain highlighting the previously focused link.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser focus is set to the proper area, VoiceOver reads the correct content, but the VoiceOver cursor position remains the non-existent previous link, and the Accessibility Inspector believes that the focus is the closest prior element which still exists in the browser DOM.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.*\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFull details, including a step-by-step analysis in Accessibility Inspector can be found here: https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y/issues/1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUse VoiceOver on El Capitan and test in Safari."
