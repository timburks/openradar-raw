    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of iOS < 10, if I had a saved peripheral identifier and I called this method, I would be returned an array of peripherals that had that identifier and that were previously paired with the phone. It doesn't seem to work anymore since I installed iOS 10.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run attached sample project.\r\n2. Modify with proper peripheral services so that the app can connect to it.\r\n3. Pair with peripheral.\r\n4. Check logs output and see that retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers returns empty.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nretrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers should return with the previously connected peripheral\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nretrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers returns empty\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI made the sample project with bare minimums to reproduce the issue. It doesn't save the identifier in memory for later retrieval, but it does check after succesfully connected to the peripheral. In my bigger app, the retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers returns empty no matter when I call it."
