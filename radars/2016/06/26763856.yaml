    description: "We have users reporting issues when using an external hardware keyboard and while trying to email a document, they are not able to type.\r\n\r\nWe tried to reproduce and it indeed is reproducible even with the iPad Pro (with a Apple keyboard and Logitech keyboard).\r\n\r\nOne of our user's who reported the issue initially, is using iPad Air with a Zagg Rugged Book.\r\n\r\nVideo Of the Issue : https://app.box.com/s/v53uhhzmj63eyh9jpzj3tqha84v01i0r\r\n\r\nChecking the code, here is the snippet, that is presenting the MFMailComposeViewController,\r\n\r\n-(void)showEmailComposer\r\n{\r\n\r\n//This method also does other things like attaching the file. to the email. But I have commented out all that part to make sure that its not causing the problem. The bare minimum of code that presents the mail composer is here and even with only these few lines of code the problem is reproducible.\r\n\r\nif ([MFMailComposeViewController canSendMail]) {\r\nMFMailComposeViewController *mailComposer = [[MFMailComposeViewController alloc] init];\r\nmailComposer.mailComposeDelegate = self;\r\nmailComposer.navigationBar.tintColor = [UIColor whiteColor];\r\n\r\n//_pdfViewController is the reference to a UIViewController displaying the PDF. This method that shows the email composer is in a different class that is handling all the sharing.\r\n\r\n[_pdfViewController presentViewController:mailComposer animated:YES completion:^{\r\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];\r\n}];\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround that makes it work,\r\n\r\n1. Click the home button. This will put the app in the background.\r\n2. Now tap on the SignEasy app again. (You can even select the app from the multitask window by double clicking the home button)\r\n\r\nThe above steps, somehow make the keyboard function again.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to figure out what could be causing the problem. It would be wonderful if you could help me figure out and fix this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a signed document from SignEasy app on iPad (Use the external keyboard)\r\n- Click on share/Export icon on the top right corner.\r\n- Select email.\r\n- Start typing - It will not type.\r\n- Click the home button. This will put the app in the background.\r\n- Now tap on the SignEasy app again. (You can even select the app from the multitask window by double clicking the home button)\r\n- Now the Keyboard will start functioning."
