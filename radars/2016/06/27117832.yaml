    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 10, widgets appear in the Notification Center on a page to the left of your notifications. But when you're on the home screen, the widgets aren't there.\r\n\r\nPresumably the widgets aren't included in the Notification Center in order to force users to learn that the widgets are now present on SpringBoard's \"search\" page. But, having the widgets be inconsistently accessible in the Notification Center is bad for muscle memory and will end up confusing more than it educates.\r\n\r\nI don't think users will make the connection in their heads as to why the widgets show up in NC at some times but not at others. They will perceive it as widgets showing up unreliably and will learn to ignore the widgets rather than learn the behavior.\r\n\r\nI think an appropriate solution is to put the widgets in both the Notification Center and in the search page. As long as it's consistent, users will learn the behavior over time, especially since the widgets are conveniently accessible from the lock screen using the slide-right gesture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go into any app\r\n2. Pull down Notification Center and slide to the left to see your widgets\r\n3. Dismiss Notification Center and press the home button to go to the home screen\r\n4. Pull down Notification Center again and try to access your widgets\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe widgets should be there, as one would expect\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe widgets are not accessible, which is inconsistent and confusing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1"
