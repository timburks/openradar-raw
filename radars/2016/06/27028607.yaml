    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I edit my contact card in Contacts app, and open my card again, I can't see any changes I've made.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts app\r\n2. Navigate to top to open user's contact card. Marked as \"My Card\"\r\n3. Tap \"Edit\"\r\n4. Delete one of email addresses\r\n5. Tap \"< Back\"\r\n6. Open the card again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeleted email should disappear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeleted email appearing again like nothing happened.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso tested on my wife's iPad with different Apple ID - same problem. Contacted to good Wi-Fi. I'm not sure but I think sometimes it works and changes appear on the next day. Could be that your iCloud overrides changes made on the device. \r\n\r\nProblem affects only user's card, editing other card works good. \r\n\r\nThis is very frustrating. Please contact me, I am here to help you with untying I can do. I am experienced iOS developer.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Black 64 GB"
