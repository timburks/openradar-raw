    description: "Summary:\r\nnsurlsessiond does networking operations on behalf of other processes, which makes it hard to tell what might cause it to be sending/receiving large amounts of data. Activity Monitor should be able to display a breakdown of the sent/received data by app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use something that utilises nsurlsessiond, eg, upload photo library to iCloud\r\n2. Open Activity Monitor\r\n3. Select Network tab\r\n4. Sort by sent bytes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTop result is Photos or a Photos agent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTop result is nsurlsessiond.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12 (16A201w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
