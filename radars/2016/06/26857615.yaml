    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease add an option to automatically change between the light and dark user interface like night shift does in iOS 9.3. Maybe just using fixed times or the sunrise/sunset. Because it's very annoying to always change the user interface in the settings, just when it's after sunset and vice versa. Many people are using their AppleTV in the living room and want use both options depending on the time of day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. use your AppleTV during the day, with light user interface enabled\r\n2. come back after sunset\r\n3. get dazzled by the shining white\r\n4. change user interface to dark to avoid dazzling\r\n5. come back after sunrise\r\n6. get depressed by the dark black and change user interface to light again..\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe AppleTV nows the time of the day and if the option to automatically change the user interface is enabled, does so, right before it wakes up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user has to change the user interface manually.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 10.0 Beta 1 (14T5253s)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppleTV 4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
