    description: "Peter Steinberger20-Jun-2016 10:54 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe file a lot of radars here at PSPDFKit. Yet we need to use openradar.appspot.com and https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com because one team member can't see the radar status of another team member.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File a radar as person A\r\n2. Try to see radar as person B, same Enterprise Team\r\n3. Radar will not be found.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRadars should be viewable within the same team so we do not need to copy the information into other places to have something shared.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRadar is not visible. This really confused me the other day because there is no difference between a radar not accessible and radar not found and I almost thought there's data loss going on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
