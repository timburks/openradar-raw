    description: "# Title\r\niOS App with no required permissions still shows in Settings on install when location services is turned off\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nI noticed all apps still show in the Settings app when installing while location services is turned off. I tried in iPhone 6S 9.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Turn off location services\r\n2. Install app with no permissions (either from App Store or Xcode; it doesn't matter)\r\n3. Check the list of apps in the Settings App\r\n4. The app shows. On open of the app entry, it shows a location permission that is set to Never.\r\n5. Turn on location services.\r\n6. The app is still there, but tapping on it shows an empty screen.\r\n\r\n# Expected Results\r\nThe app should not show as an entry in the Settings app if it does not have the any required permission.\r\n\r\n# Actual Results\r\nThe app shows as an entry in the Settings app even if it does not have required permission.\r\n\r\n# Version\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\niPhone 6S 16GB A1688, iPad Air 2 16GB A1566"
