    description: "Area:\r\nAPNS (Notifications)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile the new notifications menu is very helpful with notification actions, sometimes I still want to enter the app as if I had just performed a slide gesture over the notification (i.e. \"open\" the notification). After force-touching the notification however, I cannot see a way to just regularly open it. Instead, the only action available is to dismiss the notification, leaving me no way out without performing a (mildly) destructive action.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion therefore is to automatically provide an additional \"Open\" Notification Action for all notifications, therefore allowing users to open a notification from its detail view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a notification that does not provide any Notification Actions\r\n2. Force touch the notification on the Home Screen\r\n3. Try to open the notification instead of dismissing it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA button or action is available, allowing users to open the notification in its app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo action is available to open the notification\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone OS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone8,2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
