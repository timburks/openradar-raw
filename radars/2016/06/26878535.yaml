    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a swift class that subclasses a class written in objc, defined in another module, when you convert your swift code to 2.3 or 3.0, the converter will incorrectly remove @objc while leaving the (ClassName) behind, when it should leave that whole annotation alone. \r\n\r\nI'm not certain if the objc class needs to be in another framework/module for this to happen, but it's the scenario that I ran into and it's the scenario I've reproduced with the attached project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached project (created with Xcode 7.3.1) in Xcode 8 beta 1\r\n2. Choose to convert to swift 2.3 or 3.0 when the dialog prompts you to.\r\n3. Let the converter do its work, and note the only change it tries to make in ViewController.swift, which is to change\r\n        @objc(MySubclassFoo)\r\n        class MySubclass: MyClass {}\r\n    to\r\n        (MySubclassFoo)\r\n        class MySubclass: MyClass {}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo modification should be made to the @objc annotation on the MySubclass swift class\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"@objc\" was removed from the annotation, leaving behind (MySubclassFoo)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTo my knowledge this did not happen when converting to swift 2.2 from an earlier version."
