    description: "I have an iOS app with watchOS 2.2.1 and another one with watchOS 2.0.1. I been working on updating the info between the iOS and watch app with 'updateApplicationContext', 'transferUserInfo', and 'sendMessage' methods. However it looks like the watchOS 2.2.1 does not update as expected. Info from the iOS app is send but is never received by the counterpart watch app. On the other hand the watchOS 2.0.1 does update consistently.\r\n\r\nI tested other projects (really simple ones) from https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/WatchConnectivityUserInfoDemo and https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/WatchConnectivityApplicationContextDemo and the info does not arrive to the watch app\r\n\r\nSometimes a restart of the watch works"
