    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot play audio from the Music Player or WWDC app through my headphones. I even restarted the iPad and the issue still persists. Iâ€™m using Shure SE215 with the microphone attachment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to play a video or audio on the iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio should play.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a bit of a click with white noise following for a second and then complete silence.\r\n\r\nNotes: I would really appreciate at least a temporary workaround as I was trying to watch WWDC videos on my iPad!"
