    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUITextField has placeholder, attributedPlaceholder, and related methods for prompting the user about what they should type. UITextView should have a similar facility.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Desire to prompt the user to type in a long-form text view by showing some grayed out text. The blinking cursor shows up at the beginning of the text, and when the user edits the text of the text view to something other than nil or the empty string, the placeholder text is hidden.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUITextView has placeholder, attributedPlaceholder, and other related properties for positioning and so on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUITextView has no such properties, causing countless developers to rewrite their own placeholder text for UITextView over and over.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nall of them\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iOS device ever\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
