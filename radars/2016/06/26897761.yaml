    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboard\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe current \"pistol\" emoji is a realistically rendered lethal weapon. As the spec doesn't require it to be this way, Apple would be doing a service to society by changing this image to a plastic toy gun, such as a bright pink or green water squirter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType the \"pistol\" emoji.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmoji should not be a reminder of the weapon causing tens of thousands of deaths in the US every year.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmoji is a reminder of a weapon causing tens of thousands of deaths in the US every year.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf it's true that Apple has pushed for the emoji set to exclude the proposed \"rifle\" image, I hope they will consider this bug and see it as part of the same issue."
