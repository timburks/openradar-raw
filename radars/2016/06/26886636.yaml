    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 2.3 we noticed that some @IBOutlet annotations were removed from outlets with custom classes where the class lived in the same module.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an outlet with a custom class\r\n2. Migrate to Swift 2.3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe outlet is left untouched\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `@IBOutlet` portion is removed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are able to reproduce this 100% on our codebase, but haven't been able to isolate."
