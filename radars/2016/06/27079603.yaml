        Summary:
        I use a 3rd party library called PureLayout (https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout) to simplify programmatic auto layout code. It is written in Objective C and includes functions like

        - (NSLayoutConstraint *)autoMatchDimension:(ALDimension)dimension toDimension:(ALDimension)toDimension ofView:(ALView *)otherView

        Swift 3 correctly imports this as
        func autoMatch(_ dimension: ALDimension, to toDimension: ALDimension, of otherView: UIView) -> NSLayoutConstraint

        However at the callsite Xcode’s Fix It suggested an incorrect replacement.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have an Objective C function named as above and run the Swift 3 migrator

        Expected Results:
        Callsites of the function in Swift would be correctly updated to
        autoMatch(…, to: …, of: …)

        Actual Results:
        The following problems occurred when running the Swift 3 migrator:
        - the migrator didn’t automatically change all my callsites of these functions
        - Xcode’s Fix It suggestion (post-migration) suggested an incorrect replacement:
        “Replace autoMatch” with “autoMatchtoof”
        - upon clicking Fix It my code got replaced with
        autoMatchwidthDimension(.…, toDimension: …, ofView: …)
