    description: "Summary:\r\n+[UIApplicationShortcutIcon iconWithTemplateImageName:] takes a filename for the image to load, but if the image is in an XCAsset file, then the Asset must be in the Application's mainBundle, and not a separate resource bundle.  It would be useful to be able to pass the bundle to search as well, so I can keep the shortcut icon in a separate resource bundle with the rest of my images.\r\n\r\ni.e. please give us +[UIApplicationShortcutIcon inconWithTemplateImageName:inBundle:]\r\n\r\nUse case:  I have one app that that I ship 7 customized versions of for different customers.  All the shared resources are kept in a shared resource bundle that only gets built once and then included in all the apps.  Since UIApplicationShortcutIcon cannot search in bundles other than the main bundle, I currently have to keep them in a separate XCAsset file that gets rebuilt with each app even though it's identical.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. call UIApplicationShortcutIcon iconWithTemplateImageName: with the name of an image in a xcasset within a resource bundle (not main bundle).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. image loads.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. image fails to load.  Search header for api that lets you specify the bundle.  find it lacking.  file a radar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (Xcode 7.3.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 128GB AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
