    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode projects containing lots of targets (e.g., Cocoapods workspaces) are annoyingly hard to update the team specified for Code Signing. Each target's team needs to be configured individually, so for projects with many targets, this can be incredibly tedious. I propose that the team be configured on a workspace or project basis. I can't envision many scenarios where the signing team will be different between targets in the same project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download sample code.\r\n2. Observe that project does not compile, since each framework in the Pods project requires a development team.\r\n3. Go through each project and select the development team.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly a few clicks are required. The development team can be configurable on the project-level.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user must click through to each target and configure the Code Signing team individually for each one. This takes a long time and might put the developer in a bad mood.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee screenshots for additional information."
