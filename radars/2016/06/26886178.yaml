    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently submitting radars, especially in bulk can be extremely cumbersome on the website. This is compounded when you attempt to mirror your radars to http://www.openradar.me/ so they can be publicly accessible. Currently many people use QuickRadar https://github.com/amyworrall/QuickRadar/ which provides an OS X app to do this. Unfortunately because there is no API, this app is built on hacks related to parsing the returned HTML from radar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to create a script which create radars\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a nice JSON API to do this with\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSuffering and pain ensues.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
