    description: "Norio 野村02-Jun-2016 09:30 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\"OBJROOT\" on `xcodebuild install` is different from the one on `xcodebuild clean`. So, `xcodebuld clean` does not properly clean directory that used on `xcodebuild install`.\r\n`xcodebuild -showBuildSettings install` also incorrect settings that actually used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip attached XcodeBuildSettingsTest.zip\r\n2. run `collect-settings.sh` that collect environment variables in run script and -showBuildSettings into logs\r\n3. Check diff between environments-in-run-script-on-install.log and showbuildsettings-on-install.log\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"OBJROOT\" will have same value between environments-in-run-script-on-install.log and showbuildsettings-on-install.log, as same between between environments-in-run-script-on-build.log and showbuildsettings-on-build.log\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"OBJROOT\" will have difference value between environments-in-run-script-on-install.log and showbuildsettings-on-install.log\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) w: OS X OS X 10.11.5 (15F34).spx - configuration file has been successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'XcodeBuildSettingsTest.zip' and 'MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) w: OS X OS X 10.11.5 (15F34).spx' were successfully uploaded."
