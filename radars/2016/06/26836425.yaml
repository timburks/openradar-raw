    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI’ve connected to my wireless network at home using iOS 10. The router is an Archer C9 and the network is visible. After connecting, I see a “Security Recommendation” and drill down to view it. iOS appears to think the network is hidden, when it is not, and displays a suggestion to “broadcast this network”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigation to Wi-Fi settings in Settings.app.\r\n2. Connect to wireless network.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo recommendation should appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotice that a “Security Recommendation” appears. iOS thinks the network is hidden and displays a suggestion to make it public, even though it is already public.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 [14A5261v]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee screenshots for additional info.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 / 16GB - MGLW2LL/A"
