        iOS 10 beta 1 seems to do a lot of extra Auto Layout work which causes a severe regression over iOS 9 in UITableView scrolling performance.

        Our use case is a UITableView with many different reuse identifiers and using rowHeight=UITableViewAutomaticDimension, a defined estimatedRowHeight and -heightForRowAtIndexPath: not implemented.

        We profiled our app while scrolling and noticed that there are calls to -[UITextView intrinsicContentSize] even though the messaged textView is hidden (the textView is a subview of a cell previously on screen and currently in the cell reuse pool). I attached the backtrace.

        This behavior is new in iOS 10 beta and makes scrolling on an iPhone 6s Plus unbearably slow.
