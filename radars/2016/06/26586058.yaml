    description: "Summary:\r\nXCode's syntax highlighting and autocompletion stop working systematically when opening files in the https://github.com/artsy/eidolon project and occasionally when working on other project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/\r\n2. Open Kiosk.xcworkspace\r\n3. Open any source file\r\n4. See the syntax highlighting flicker on and off\r\n5. Try to use autocompletion... \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect syntax highlighting and code completion (the most basic functions of any IDE) to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSyntax highlighting flickers on and off.\r\nCode completion doesn't work.\r\nXCode tells me that \"An internal error occured.\" and that \"Source editing functionality is limited\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 7.3 (7D175)\r\nOS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's impossible to properly work with this bug constantly popping up each time I open a source file/write some code. Please DO something!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs all the time. Tried on a Macbook Pro and a Hackintosh.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
