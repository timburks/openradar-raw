    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a developer of a train time app it would be great to be able to set the maps that I display stations on to transit mode to highlight the train lines across the country. Currently there is no way to access the train routes that are drawn on the map in the Maps app which makes it impossible to have nice train routes represented in third party apps. \r\n\r\nIdeally it would just be another MKMapType or perhaps a property like \"showTransitLines\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMKMapView has a property or mode that allows the map to display transit lines just as pressing \"Transit\" in the maps app does\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMKMapView does not have the transit mode functionality publicly exposed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
