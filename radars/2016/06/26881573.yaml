Try to use night mode in Maps Framework\r\n2. Realise it's marked as private\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevelopers should be able to use Night mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevelopers cannot use night mode\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll Devices\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
