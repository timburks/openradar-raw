    description: "The new Unified Logging introduced in Session 721 of WWDC 2016 is cool. However, its current design renders it useless for 3rd-party developers collecting logs from normal users because the steps needed to send logs to developers are impractical for most people.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest logs can be written to custom files so can be sent directly as email attachments or by other file transfer means."
