    description: "We are seeing a memory leak in Swift string interpolation in Alamofire. We've built a sample project that produces the leak. We've also switched over to using string concatenation temporarily as a workaround.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/Alamofire/Rdar-StringInterpolationMemoryLeak\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open the attached sample project\r\n2) Run it within Leaks\r\n3) Watch it leak when printing out the `Timeline` object\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo leaks would appear in the Leaks Instrument.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeaks are appearing in the Leaks Instrument.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3 (7D175) and Xcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) on OS X 10.11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'String Interpolation Memory Leak.zip' was successfully uploaded."
