        Summary:
        The text area where the artist and song title are displayed shifts by a pixel or two during playback.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Begin playback of a song
        2. Observe artist and title shifting

        Expected Results:
        Text stays centered during playback, not shifting.

        Actual Results:
        Text position shifts

        Regression:
        Did not observe this occurring in previous versions of iTunes.

        Notes:
        Song playing while this was observed was Nirvana’s “Where Did You Sleep Last Night” from the Unplugged in New York album.

        A movie of this is attached to the issue. GIF version available here: http://i.imgur.com/dbvY5dB.gif
