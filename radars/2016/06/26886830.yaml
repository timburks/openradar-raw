    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 3.0 we noticed that code we had inside a `#if DEBUG` was not migrated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add some code inside an `#if DEBUG`\r\n2. Migrate the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code inside the `#if` is migrated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code around it is migrated, but not the code inside it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may be expected since it would be hard to guess whether or not that code could compile. It would possibly be nice if we could define the flags used during migration, since in this specific example everything inside `#if DEBUG` would definitely compile."
