    description: "Douglas Beal17-Jun-2016 06:17 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nProgramming books on iBooks resort to images to display code with correct formatting and hi-lighting. This makes it horrible from an Accessibility point of view. \r\nDRM and Store integration for Playgrounds would provide a platform well suited for programming content, specifically:\r\n\r\n* increase the value produced by authors with only a little additional work]\r\n* bring full Accessibility to programming oriented texts\r\n* improve educational outcome by providing live interactive examples\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
