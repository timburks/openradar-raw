    description: "Summary:\r\nEmbedding a long UITextView in a cell in UITableView has some issues:\r\n1. Content offset is not correct after text view becomes first responder.\r\n2. Can not scroll up to reveal the bottom of text view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample app on iOS 7.\r\n2. Scroll to the bottom.\r\n3. Tap the bottom of text view and let it become the first responder.\r\n4. See the keyboard come up and text view scroll up â€” initially scroll up enough to reveal the cursor but then scroll down a bit to an incorrect position. \r\n5. Try scrolling manually up, to no avail.\r\n6. Run it on iOS 6 and repeat 2~5 to compare.\r\n\r\nCode: http://cl.ly/240R052Y2I2K"
