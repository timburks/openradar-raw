    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you update iOS, In my example, going from iOS 9 to iOS 10, any active content blockers stop working once update is completed. When you check the settings, it does still show as enabled but when you use Safari, it is not blocking anything. To fix, toggle off and on again in the content blocker settings of settings.app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have content blocker installed and enabled\r\n2. Update iOS to a newer version \r\n3. Test if content blocker is still working after update by testing in Safari. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce update is complete, any previously active content blockers should remain active within Safari. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAny previously active content blockers still show as active in Settings > Safari > Content Blockers, however when you browse with Safari, you find that nothing is being blocked. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
