        Summary:

        Currently, unless-domain and if-domain in content blocking rules match exact subdomains. This is a a huge problem when, for example, we want to block trackers from large companies like Google and Yahoo.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Create a content blocking rule to block third-party loads of yimg.com (see https://better.fyi/trackers/yimg.com/). This domain and subdomains of it are is used by Yahoo for serving pixel bugs as well as other, more legitimate assets.

        Go to Yahoo.com (itâ€™s broken).

        So our task is to not block yimg.com if the call is coming from a Yahoo property (as that is basically first-party, even though the domain is different).

        Expected Results:

        I should be able to do (pseudo code):

        unless-domain: .*yahoo.co.*

        Actual Results:

        Instead, I have to do (pseudo code):

        unless-domain: yahoo.com, login.yahoo.com, edit.yahoo.com, advertising.yahoo.com, answers.yahoo.com, autos.yahoo.com, celebrity.yahoo.com, yahoo.match.com, developer.yahoo.com, downloads.yahoo.com, finance.yahoo.com, www.flickr.com, groups.yahoo.com, help.yahoo.com, local.yahoo.com, mail.yahoo.com, messenger.yahoo.com, mobile.yahoo.com, music.yahoo.com, my.yahoo.com, news.yahoo.com, search.yahoo.com, security.yahoo.com, shopping.yahoo.com, smallbusiness.yahoo.com, connectedtv.yahoo.com, sports.yahoo.com, toolbar.yahoo.com, www.tumblr.com, weather.yahoo.com, ar.yahoo.com, au.yahoo.com, be.yahoo.com, fr-be.yahoo.com, br.yahoo.com, ca.yahoo.com, cz.mail.yahoo.com, cl.yahoo.com, co.yahoo.com, de.yahoo.com, ee.mail.yahoo.com, es.yahoo.com, espanol.yahoo.com, fr.yahoo.com, hr.mail.yahoo.com, in.yahoo.com, id.yahoo.com, ie.yahoo.com, it.yahoo.com, lv.mail.yahoo.com, lt.mail.yahoo.com, hu.mail.yahoo.com, en-maktoob.yahoo.com, malaysia.yahoo.com, mx.yahoo.com, nz.yahoo.com, at.mail.yahoo.com, pe.yahoo.com, ph.yahoo.com, xp.mail.yahoo.com, qc.yahoo.com, ro.yahoo.com, sg.yahoo.com, si.mail.yahoo.com, sk.mail.yahoo.com, za.yahoo.com, se.yahoo.com, uk.yahoo.com, www.yahoo.com, ve.yahoo.com, vn.yahoo.com, gr.yahoo.com, bg.mail.yahoo.com, rs.mail.yahoo.com, ua.mail.yahoo.com, il.mail.yahoo.com, maktoob.yahoo.com, th.yahoo.com, hk.yahoo.com, tw.yahoo.com, yahoo.co.jp

        Notes:

        * The same thing is true for Google and, for example, their tracking domain gstatic.com (see https://better.fyi/trackers/gstatic.com/)
        * Publishers who also run behavioural advertising trackers might also catch onto this tactic of serving legitimate assets used by their properties and serving tracking code accessed by other third-party sites on the same subdomains, thereby making it more difficult to write blocking rules. Having wildcard and/or regex support in unless-domain and if-domain rules would make our lives much easier.
