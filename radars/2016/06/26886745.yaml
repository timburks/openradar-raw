    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing a sticker pack, stickers remain in the recents tab after uninstalling your sticker pack. Then if you install it again and use them they appear twice in recents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a sticker pack\n2. Use a sticker in conversation\n3. Uninstall the sticker pack.\n4. Reinstall the pack\n5. Use it again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step 3, the sticker does not appear in recents. After step 5, it should not appear twice.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sticker appears in recents after uninstall, and is duplicated in recents after re-install.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe first behavior of keeping recents around after uninstall may be intentional. But the duplication after re-install definitely doesn't seem like it."
