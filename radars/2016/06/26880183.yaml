    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAs a new user to the platform I am not likely to discover that the camera is accessible from the lock screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock the screen\r\n2. Look at the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to have a visual cue (icon, text, etc) that tells me that swiping right to left will take me to the camera app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am told that I should press the home button to unlock the iPhone.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving this visual cue from iOS 10 may confuse even the users who update from iOS 9 as it could be interpreted as removed functionality."
