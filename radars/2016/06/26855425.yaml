    description: "When you have a screen share where macOS 10.12 is the target and you try to drop a file from the viewing machine into the target the file will not transfer and operate as OSX 10.11 does. The file will drag in a selection box or highlight everything in whatever application was closest to the edge of the shared screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have two Macs on same network with one that is running macOS 10.12 (Mac-B)and has screen sharing enabled.\r\n2.Login to Mac-A\r\n3. Find a shared Mac-B in finder and connect via screen share.\r\n4. Drag a file from Mac-A desktop to Mac-B desktop to transfer the file.\r\n5. Observe the failed behavior\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDrag and drop file betwee two machines should initiate a file transfer as it does in OSX 10.11.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file will drag in a selection box or highlight everything in whatever application was closest to the edge of the shared screen.\r\n\r\nClosed as duplicate of bug number 26588784"
