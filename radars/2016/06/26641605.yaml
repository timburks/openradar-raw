        Summary:
        When tagging an album just added to iTunes, I can’t drag a cover picture from Safari. I have to copy and paste it

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add an album of mp3 files into an iTunes playlist
        2. Select the album’s tracks
        3. Press Cmd+I to Get Info
        4. Browse to the album’s cover in Safari (e.g. http://www.albumartexchange.com/covers.php?id=160016&q=kills+pressures)
        5. Drag the cover from Safari into the cover image well at the top of the Get Info window

        Expected Results:
        The cover (and whole top of the Get Info window) reflect the cover dropped

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens

        Regression:
        This has always worked correctly in prior versions of iTunes

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
