    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 2.3 we noticed that when you have a custom subscript with a argument label, the argument label was stripped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define a function such as in Swift 2.2:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic subscript(safe index: Int) -> Iterator.Element? {\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Migrate it to Swift 2.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing else with a line calling this would change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `safe:` is removed, and replaced with the default subscript syntax.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn our case this is a very frightening bug as the resulting code would still compile correctly, but would no longer be \"safe\""
