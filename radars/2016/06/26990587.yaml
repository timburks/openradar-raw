    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new class reference format that arrived alongside iOS 10 lacks the revision history available in previous class references. This is frustrating, because I cannot find the description of what was changed since the previous version. The revision history was a very useful feature of the class references.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit the developer documentation and select a class reference - for example, this one: https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewcontroller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page should include a \"Revision History\" section like the previous class reference: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewController_Class/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006926-CH2-SW1 (accessible under the \"Updated: 2015-10-21\" link at the bottom of the class reference page)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Revision History is inaccessible."
