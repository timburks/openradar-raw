    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, ReplayKit's screen recording functionality can only record the app that uses the ReplayKit framework to initiate the recording. If the user switches apps while ReplayKit is active, the recording stops.\r\n\r\nThis is ostensibly for security reasons, but the app that starts the recording already doesn't have access to the recording that ReplayKit creates - the user ultimately chooses what to do with it.\r\n\r\nIt'd be tremendously useful to be able to create recordings of the whole screen, regardless of app, to allow users to demonstrate things on their device.\r\n\r\nFor example, my app, Workflow, allows people to run \"workflows\" which may involve using multiple apps, and we'd like to allow users to record the workflows they run and share those videos as demonstrations for others. You can also imagine this capability being used for \"screencasting\" or other educational purposes, like to create training materials on how to use particular apps or web sites.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at RPScreenRecorder API\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpecting to see an API to choose whether the screen recorder records only the app that initiates the recording or to record the entire screen regardless of which app is frontmost.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to record the entire screen regardless of app; you can only record the app that starts the recording.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
