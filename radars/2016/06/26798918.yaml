    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen navigating back to a screen that has a table view, if you had selected a row of the table to initially navigate away from it, the deselection behavior of the table view is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample app and run it on an iPhone. It has a table view controller.\r\n2. Tap the first cell, \"Default Deselection\"\r\n3. Observe that the cell highlights as the detail view pushes.\r\n4. Use an interactive dismiss gesture (slide from the leading edge of the screen) to dismiss the detail view.\r\n5. Repeat 1-4 several times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'm not exactly sure what the default deselection behavior should be (going to ask about it at WWDC labs), but the deselection of the row should at least be consistent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLook at the attached video. I'm seeing two behaviors, neither of which looks very good, and one of which could be considered a bug:\r\n1. The cell stays highlighted during the navigation pop interactive transition. Once the navigation is complete, then the cell animates its deselection.\r\n2. The cell does not deselect at all (or maybe partially deselects - it's hard to tell), but then it gets stuck and does not ever completely deselect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wrote a blog post that explores the deselection behavior a little more closely: https://www.raizlabs.com/dev/2016/05/smarter-animated-row-deselection-ios/ (the sample code and videos are also posted there).\r\n\r\nI'll be asking about this in the labs, but the issue I'm addressing here is specifically the inconsistency in deselection animation when doing nothing special in -viewWillAppear:animated:.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, but also reproduced elsewhere"
