    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter testing an Intent with SiriKit, then change the name of the app name, Siri continues to recognise the old app name for that intent. When new Intent are added to the app with the new name, Siri will recognise the old app name for the first intent, and the new app name for the new intent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty project in Xcode, with a sample name 'SG NextBus'\r\n2. Add a Siri Extension for sending messages\r\n3. Test the extension a few times.\r\n4. Rename the app to 'NextBus'.\r\n5. Add a new Siri Extension for booking a ride.\r\n6. Try to invoke both extensions with Siri. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth extensions should be invoked with the new app name, 'NextBus'. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first extension can only be invoked with the old app name 'SG NextBus'. The second extension can only be invoked with the new app name 'NextBus'. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
