    description: "Summary:\r\nI've found bugs in iOS 8 (18054367) and iOS 10 (26864289) that would have been impossible to catch in the iOS simulator, because they are only triggered by 180° device rotation. The simulator should enable 180° rotation, in addition to Rotate Left and Rotate Right, in order to facilitate catching bugs like this in our apps and yours.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Develop an iOS app (or iOS itself).\r\n2. Test your work by using the iOS simulator.\r\n3. Try to test for bugs that might be caused by rotating the device 180° without passing through 90° or -90°.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a mechanism to rotate the simulator 180°.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such mechanism. You must rotate twice left or twice right, which masks the bugs mentioned above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
