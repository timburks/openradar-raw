    description: "Summary:\r\nThe discussion in the documentation states that this delegate method is called for taps *and* long-presses, and \"...you can use this method to trigger an alternative action, such as displaying the web content at the URL in a web view within the current application.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this method does not provide information on what kind of interaction (tap/long-press) is being represented. In the documented example, I would want to present a Safari View Controller on tap, but defer to default behaviour on long-press. Current method signature does not contain enough information to distinguish between these two cases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple UI with a UITextView\r\n2. Configure text view with appropriate data detectors, set it to selectable, and non-editable\r\n3. Fill the UITextView with a string that contains links, phone numbers, etc\r\n4. Create a delegate that implements textView(_:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:) and presents a Safari View Controller if URL's scheme is http / https, returning false, or doing nothing and returning true if the scheme is something else\r\n5. Launch app and long-press on an HTTP link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ntextView(_:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:) is invoked, but should include additional information so that the implementation knows whether this is a tap (continue by presenting opening Safari View Controller) or a long-press (return true to defer to default behaviour)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ntextView(_:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:) is invoked and Safari View Controller is presented\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 and later\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
