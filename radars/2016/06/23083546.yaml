    description: "Summary:\r\nCertain Unicode code points have both an emoji representation and a text representation. Without a variant selector, OS X correctly represents these code points with their text variant; for example, U+2708 'Airplane' and U+24C2 'Circled Latin Capital Letter M' both display monochromatic. On iOS, however, these same code points are represented by color emoji instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhile this is a system-wide issue, this works to demonstrate the problem: \r\n1. Email the attached file from your Mac OS device to your iOS device\r\n2. View the file in TextEdit on the Mac, and in the iOS mail app. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn iOS, the line reading \"Without variant selector\" should display the same glyph as it does on OS X: a black and white airplane in the first case, and a black and white enclosed letter M in the second case. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS renders a color emoji airplane and a blue circled M, in a manner inconsistent with the rendering on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in the last case that shows the enclosed alphanumeric alphabet, you will see that OS X renders all the enclosed letters correctly, but iOS renders the enclosed M with a blue color. Informal testing seems to indicate that the Apple Watch displays the same inconsistency. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0.2 (13A452)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is an issue for many other code points, especially in the Miscellaneous Symbols block and the Arrows block (and the one enclosed alphanumeric mentioned above). The issue with the enclosed capital M is especially difficult to work around, as it requires adding a variation selector after that character just to get a rendering that is consistent with the other characters in the same block. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, AT&T; MacBook Air 11-inch, Mid 2013 running OS X El Capitan\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nUnicodeInconsistencies.txt\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nAirplane glyph example\r\nWithout variant selector : ✈\r\nText variant selector    : ✈︎\r\nEmoji variant selector   : ✈️\r\n\r\nEnclosed alphanumeric example\r\nWithout variant selector : Ⓜ\r\nText variant selector    : Ⓜ︎\r\nEmoji variant selector   : Ⓜ️\r\n\r\nExample of the issue in the enclosed alphanumeric block: \r\nⒶⒷⒸⒹⒺⒻⒼⒽⒾⒿⓀⓁⓂⓃⓄⓅⓆⓇⓈⓉⓊⓋⓌⓍⓎⓏ"
