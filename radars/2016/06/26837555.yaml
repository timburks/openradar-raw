    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the recent addition of Siri to macOS and the enabling of HomeKit.framework on tvOS I think it would be valuable to bring HomeKit.framework to macOS to allow development of home control apps for macOS. This would encourage a whole host of new home related apps for the macOS store."
