    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems, that most crucial system functions like language switch, volume change or sound mute rely too much on general performance of system and don't have any priority. It leads to the situations, when the mentioned change and its visualisation are delayed for a seconds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect immediately applying of changes in spite of execution of ordinary applications and overall performance pressure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)"
