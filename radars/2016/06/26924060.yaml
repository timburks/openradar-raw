    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 10 drops support for 3.5” iPhones, which is wonderful! We no longer have to accommodate for those screen sizes!\r\n\r\nExcept, what if we want our iPhone app to be able to run on iPad, but we don’t have the time to make a full iPad version? Now we have to spend time working on a screen size used by almost no one just so the app will still function on iPad.\r\n\r\nIt would be really really great if iPad Airs and minis just ran the app in a 16:9 window, you know, to match the iPad Pro and also so the 3.5” screen size can finally die.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun an iPhone-only app on an iPad Air or iPad mini (NOT iPad Pro)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRuns in a 16:9 window to match every single other iPhone screen aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStill uses the 3:2 aspect ratio!!!!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease, end this. I will love you forever.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air, iPad mini"
