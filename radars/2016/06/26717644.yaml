    description: "Summary:\n\nNews sites loaded in the News App are not affected by content blockers.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nLoad a new site with trackers (such at NY Times) in the News App. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nContent blockers should apply and trackers should be blocked.\n\nActual Results:\n\nContent blockers do not apply and trackers are not blocked.\n\nNotes:\n\nPrivacy is an absolute competitive advantage for Apple (see https://ar.al/notes/apple-vs-google-on-privacy-a-tale-of-absolute-competitive-advantage/) and it does not make sense to leave people exposed to web tracking within the News App if they have indicated their preference to block it and protect themselves on the web by enabling a content blocker."
