    description: "Summary:\r\nWe had several rejections for failure to comply with IPv6 in our application. It turns out that we had added an AAAA IPv6 record without adding IPv6 support. That part was our bad. \r\n\r\nWhat was absolutely maddening was that we followed all the steps in the IPv6 migration guide (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition/UnderstandingandPreparingfortheIPv6Transition.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010220-CH213-SW16 under “Test for IPv6 DNS64/NAT64 Compatibility Regularly” \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Submit app. \r\n2. Get rejected for lack of IPv6 compatibility.\r\n3. Attempt to reproduce the issue following the IPv6 migration guide. Fail to reproduce issue.\r\n4. Request any clarification in network difference between guide and our setup, receive none.\r\n5. Shrug shoulders and resubmit app.\r\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for about a week, with increasing levels of frustration \r\n7. Send my CTO to the WWDC labs, have him reproduce the issue while connected to their network. \r\n8. Have CTO and head of DevOps find problem and fix it.\r\n9. Resubmit app. \r\n10. Have app approved within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnything which would cause a failure in the App Review setup should cause a failure in the demo network for the IPv6 migration guide, so that we could diagnose and fix the issue on our end without involving your team. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUlcer, questioning my already tenuous grip on reality, delay of release of bugfixes. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease look into where the difference is in the network setup. The problem was on our end, but this whole incident wasted a ton of time for both your team and mine because the documentation does not match the App Review setup. We would have been able diagnose and fix the issue a lot earlier if the documentation matched the setup App Review is using."
