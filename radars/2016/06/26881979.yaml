    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the UK we use celsius when talking about temperature. It's also very common to use a 24 hour clock. Using the weather app with this configuration can be confusing as the high and low temperatures next to the days of the week can often be mistaken for the hour of the day and vice versa. \r\n\r\nPlease consider adding the ยบ symbol next to these numbers as you have next to the hourly temperatures for the current day. Currently the use of the degrees symbol is inconsistent in the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open weather app with region set to UK with 24 hour time enabled.\r\n2. Be confused as to which numbers are degrees and which are the hour\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHigh and Low temperatures foe each day should have the Degrees(ยบ) symbol next to them, as the hourly measurements do.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHigh and Low temperatures do not have the degrees symbol\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_1953.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
