    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to add 3rd party framework files like Parse.framework and SkypeForBusiness.framework in playground. I had to use hacking trick by copying this .framework file to Xcode's System Frameworks folder at \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks\"\r\n\r\nWith this I can import this .framework file in playground just like any other system framework.\r\n\r\nApple Docs has no guidance regarding this matter. The only have guidance about importing Custom framework in playground and that requires framework project. But in my case there was no framework project but only .framework file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Try to import any third party framework  file like SkypeForBusiness.framework in playground. It will say \"no such module SkypeForBusiness\"\r\n\r\n2) Now copy and paste SkypeForBusiness.framework in Xcode's system framework folder at \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks\"\r\n\r\n3) Import now, It will work.(HACK, Please give official guidelines)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nofficial guidelines to import 3rd party .framework file in playground\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nplease see steps to reproduce and attachments"
