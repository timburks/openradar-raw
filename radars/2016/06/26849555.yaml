    description: "As of Xcode 8.0 xcodebuild simply outputs all build & test results to stdout/stderror in an unspecified format. Third party tools such as xcpretty (https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty) need to parse & reverse engineer this output into a structured format.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if xcodebuild could output XML (or any other structured data format) which would allow much better integration with custom CI systems. Ideally this output would be specified and break out build, test and analyzer results separately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build project with `xcodebuild test` with any Xcode project that contains unit test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nxcodebuild outputs build artifacts that describe build & test results in a structured, machine readable format.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxcodebuild outputs all build & test results to stdout/stderror in an unspecified structure."
