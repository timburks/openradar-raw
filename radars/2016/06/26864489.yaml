    description: "Area:\r\nNSURL\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDocumentation states that newly created NSURLSessionTask is paused and has to be explicitly resumed to start download/upload.\r\nActually NSURLSessionUploadTask created from file for NSURLSession configured for background starts upload on its own without explicit resume after app goes into background. Sometimes it happens immediately after app goes into background. Sometimes to trigger upload task resume it’s needed move app into background and bring to foreground several times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. clone repo https://github.com/valeriyvan/NSURLSession-test;\r\n2. build project in Xcode 7 and run it in simulator;\r\n3. press shift-command to send app into background;\r\n4. tap on app icon to bring app to foreground;\r\n5. sometimes it’s needed repeat steps 3 and 4 several times;\r\n6. see by log messages that NSURLSessionUploadTask gets resumed and starts upload.\r\n\r\nIf you would like repeat these steps please remove app from simulator before building and running again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt’s expected that newly created upload task is paused and has to be explicitly resumed to start upload.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActually NSURLSessionUploadTask starts upload on its own without explicit resume after app goes into background. Sometimes it happens immediately after app goes into background. Sometimes to trigger upload task resume it’s needed move app into background and bring to foreground several times.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS simulator in xcode 7, iPhone 6s running iOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
