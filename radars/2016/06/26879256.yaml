    description: "Summary:\r\nUpon launching Xcode, mixed messages are sent by the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Install additional required system components?\"\r\n\r\n\"Xcode requires additional components to support running and debugging. Choose install to add required components.\"\r\n\r\nRequired is defined by Apple's dictionary as \"officially compulsory, or otherwise considered essential; indispensable\". If the components are in fact required for Xcode to be generally useful, then why prompt for the installation of them? The use of the word \"additional\" makes it sound as though they are extra stuff that typical developers might not want.\r\n\r\nIf the components are not in fact required, but only recommended, then they could be described as such.\r\n\r\nIf the components are in fact required, but permission only needs to be obtained from the user to install them, then that request could be described as much.\r\n\r\nIf the components are only required for running and debuggin, and the prompt is there to facilitate \"bare\" installations e.g. for build servers, then the prompt could be inverted and phrased as option to \"Skip components for running and debugging.\" \r\n\r\nCurrently it's not very clear and imposes a mental burden on the vast majority of users who simply want to install Xcode and have it work exactly as it should, for all use cases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
