        Asset catalogs are a great improvement for managing the visual content in an app.

        But when there are problems with those assets, it’s very difficult to debug. The problem could be with Xcode compiling the asset or with the file itself.

        With the addition of automatic color conversion in iOS 10 (by using a universal 16-bit Display P3 file) it’s going to be even harder to figure out why something doesn’t look right or is missing.

        There are tools that do this kind of thing but they rely on undocumented APIs. For example:

        https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/cartool

        This tool hasn’t been updated for the new displayGamut trait because no one has reverse-engineered it yet. It would be much better if Apple provided this tool - we need it.

        For an example of how this could be helpful, please see rdar://27063051.
