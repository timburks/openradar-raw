    description: "Area:\r\nWi-Fi\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Web Sheet process crashes when I'm trying to connect to a wifi with a login portal. The sheet crashes with a privacy violation when trying to enter information because it tries to access contact data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a wifi network that has captive portal functionality (e.g. a hotel wifi)\r\n2. Wait for the Web Sheet to show up and load\r\n3. Ensure the shown captive portal website has a text field with the name “first_name”, “last_name”, “name” or anything else that triggers Safari to try and suggest contacts information \r\n4. Tap the text field in question before doing anything else on the website \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor is placed into the text field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web sheet crashes, according to logs “because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone OS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTested only on iOS 10 beta 1, with iPhone 6s plus. Sometimes, tapping another link in the captive portal website will allow me to subsequently tap into the text field without the sheet crashing, although I didn’t try and find out why. \r\n\r\nThe wifi in question is provided by the Handlery Hotel, Union Sq, SF, if you’re up for some real world testing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone8,2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WebSheet  16-06-16 14-43.crash' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIncident Identifier: F1708954-2F02-4962-8E29-6794250E9612\r\nCrashReporter Key:   1c1932685759c2700e3da002bc4ecbfedb03a268\r\nHardware Model:      iPhone8,2\r\nProcess:             WebSheet [1473]\r\nPath:                /Applications/WebSheet.app/WebSheet\r\nIdentifier:          com.apple.WebSheet\r\nVersion:             1.0 (1.0)\r\nCode Type:           ARM-64 (Native)\r\nRole:                Non UI\r\nParent Process:      launchd [1]\r\n\r\nDate/Time:           2016-06-16 14:43:55.0358 -0700\r\nLaunch Time:         2016-06-16 14:43:50.3495 -0700\r\nOS Version:          iPhone OS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\nReport Version:      104\r\n\r\nException Type:  EXC_CRASH\r\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\r\nException Note:  EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY\r\nTermination Reason: TCC, This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSContactsUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.\r\nTriggered by Thread:  4"
