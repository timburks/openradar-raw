    description: "Update 6/23/16: Duplicate of 26778308\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nApps like Wunderground and Dark Sky have unique approaches to weather reporting. It would be very helpful and convenient to be able to ask Siri “Does Dark Sky say it will rain this hour?”, “When does Dark Sky say the rain will stop” or “Does Wunderground report any weather advisories?”"
