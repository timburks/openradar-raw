    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you would like to know that the system has become \"idle\". You have to do this manually. Current approaches include call `+[NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:handler:]` and start a time each time an event fires or calling `CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType` occasionally. Both of these can be error prone and don't really provide a unified solution for apps to be able to share the concept of \"idle\" time. Looking into the private AppKit headers it looks like _NSIdleTimer exists probably for a similar reason.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to determine when the machine has become idle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a centralized way to do this, possibly with a notification from NSWorkspace's notificationCenter\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to implement a solution similar to the ones mentioned above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
