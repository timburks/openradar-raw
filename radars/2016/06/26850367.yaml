    description: "Summary:\r\nIn adapting a GCD-oriented framework for Swift 3, it becomes possible to extend `DispatchQueue` to conform to a protocol, whereas this was not possible when `dispatch_queue_t` was an opaque class type.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, actually doing the conformance causes a runtime dylib linking failure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a framework using the \"Framework & Library -> Cocoa Touch Framework\" template, with the \"Include Unit Tests\" box checked.\r\n2. Add a protocol with methods to the framework as a public member.\r\n3. Import `Dispatch` and make `DispatchQueue` implement the protocol.\r\n4. Attempt to run the tests.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmpty test bundle having linked the framework runs successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTests fail without any notes in the debug log or Test logs (see attached). The Tests item in the Report navigator reads: \"Test target DeferredTests encountered an error (Early unexpected exit, operation never finished bootstrapping - no restart will be attempted)\".\r\n\r\nIf code coverage is enabled, Xcode presents the rather cryptic dialog \"Code Coverage Data Generation Failed - Unable to retrieve the profile data files from 'My Mac'.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6 Beta (15G12a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the system console log, the following helpful bits are left behind:\r\n6/16/16 4:33:33.744 PM xctest[26546]: The bundle “DeferredTests” couldn’t be loaded. Try reinstalling the bundle.\r\n6/16/16 4:33:33.744 PM xctest[26546]: (dlopen(/.../DerivedData/Deferred/Build/Intermediates/CodeCoverage/Products/Debug/DeferredTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/DeferredTests, 265): Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_OS_dispatch_queue\r\n  Referenced from: /.../DerivedData/Deferred/Build/Intermediates/CodeCoverage/Products/Debug/Deferred.framework/Versions/A/Deferred\r\n  Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\r\n in /.../DerivedData/Deferred/Build/Intermediates/CodeCoverage/Products/Debug/Deferred.framework/Versions/A/Deferred)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MiniDeferred.zip' and 'Session-DeferredTests-2016-06-16_163317-OJyju9.log' were successfully uploaded."
