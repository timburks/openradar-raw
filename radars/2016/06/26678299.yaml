    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a Xcode 7 project where the Global Tint was previously set to a custom value, then adjusted back to the Interface Builder \"Default\" value, any IBOutlet that uses the Default tint still shows and uses the previous custom tint color, regardless.\r\n\r\nWe started this project with Xcode 6 and have gone through a few beta builds of Xcode and now are using Xcode 7.3.1, not sure if something happened over time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In interface builder, set a custom Global Tint other than the default blue.\r\n2. Ensure the IBOutlets are using the new custom Global Tint value.\r\n3. Use the Xcode project for a while. (We started this project with Xcode 6 and now using Xcode 7)\r\n4. In Interface Builder, set the Global Tint to a new custom value or select Default.\r\n5. View the Tint properties of a IBOutlet that uses the Default Global Tint and it should show the previous Global Tint color (not the new one)\r\n6. Clean/Build the project and notice that the IBOutlets that use the global tint do not use the new tint value.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdjusting the Global Tint of the Storyboard in Interface Build should adjust the tint color of all IBOutlet's and views that use the Default Tint property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the Default Tint has been previously adjusted, then adjusted to another value or default value; it appears that the default tint is still the previous tint value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nMac OS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried to replicate this bug in an Xcode project that was created starting with Xcode 7 and this issues does not seem to be applicable. It appears that it may only be related to projects first created in an earlier version of Xcode and now being updated in the latest Xcode release.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15\" (MacBookPro11,3) 16GB RAM, OS X 10.11"
