    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is difficult to maintain colors use both programmatically and in IB.  The new color literals are nice, but don't seem to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pick a standard color for your app that you want to use as a background color.\r\n2. Use this color as a background color in a storyboard for the navigation bar in multiple view controllers\r\n3. Use the same color values in code used to create a view.\r\n4. Have your designer change their mind on what the background color should be.\r\n5. \U0001F62D\r\n6. Manually update all storyboards and code to the new color\r\n7. \U0001F64F that you didn't miss one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to set a variable with a color that could be used both in code and in the interface builder.  Changing the variables color would update that color anywhere the variable is used.  \r\n\r\nCurrently this is easy to do for anywhere you use a color in code, but not for code AND Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\U0001F62D and \U0001F64F\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8"
