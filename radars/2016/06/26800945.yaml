    description: "Summary:\r\nSome properties changed from nullable to nonnull in UIKit from iOS 9 to iOS 10. Because there are no @available guards for optionality changes, how should these be handled? Are they safe to call for apps that target iOS 9, or does that implicitly unwrap an Optional?\r\n\r\nOne such property that changed its nullability attributes is UIViewControllerContextTransitioning, which changed the return value of public func containerView() from UIView? to UIView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite an object in Swift that conforms to UIViewControllerContextTransitioning with the iOS 9 SDK.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProperties of the SDK that were once nullable would not become nonnull.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProperties of the SDK that were once nullable are now nonnull. Iâ€™ve attached a sample project that demonstrates the confusion I have. Check out the classes AnimatedTransitioning.swift and OptionalityChangeWrapper.swift.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS SDK 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'OptionalityChangesTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
