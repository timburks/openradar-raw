        Summary:
        Please bring Night Shift to macOS Sierra. It’s already on iOS and works great.
        On the Mac I currently use f.lux which is fine, but a deep system integration would be even better.

        I was honestly surprised that there’s no Night Shift in the next version of macOS. Such a natural feature.
        Other people were surprised as well: https://twitter.com/mjtsai/status/746326467651338241
