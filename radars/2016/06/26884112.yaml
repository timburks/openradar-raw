    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen holding down on an app icon inside of a folder only apps inside the folder wiggle and display the x button. After leaving the folder by tapping outside of it (not hitting the home button) apps outside of the folder are not in editing mode. Holding down on an app icon will turn on editing for just that app. Going back into the folder where editing first started will show that the apps in the folder are still in editing mode. Hitting the home button at anytime will restore the state of all apps to not editing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to springboard.\r\n2. Tap inside a folder.\r\n3. Hold down on an app icon inside the folder until apps start to wiggle.\r\n4. Tap outside of the folder to go back to the main homscreen area.  (Note: Do not hit the home button to go back)\r\n5. Note that apps are not in editing mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll apps on the home screen should be in editing mode after starting editing no matter where editing started.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps outside of a folder are not in editing mode when starting editing inside said folder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn this instance I am considering an app to be in editing mode when it is wiggling and shows an x button for deletion.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus, iPad Pro\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
