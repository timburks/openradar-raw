    description: "When navigating through Unplayed Episodes tab in Podcasts on iOS, and in episode lists on an individual podcast, VoiceOver reads out HTML tags included in the episode description. E.g., \"p greater than\" is announced whenever the podcast description contains a <p> tag, which is common. Links and tables are also read out loud, making the episode description almost unusable if the creator has included more than minimal formatting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Podcasts app, go to the Search tab.\r\n2. Search for a podcast, one that includes HTML tags is 'Jordan Jesse Go'.\r\n3. Subscribe to the podcast by tapping the subscribe button in the search results.\r\n4. In the Unplayed Episodes list, when an episode of the podcast appears, turn on VoiceOver.\r\n5. Navigate the VoiceOver cursor to the episode, and listen as it reads out the podcast episode description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text of the description, as it appears on screen, is read out without reading HTML markup tags that do not appear on the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen an HTML element is encountered, VoiceOver reads it out, e.g., \"p greater than\" \"slash p greater than\", \"ing src equals\" etc.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\nPodcasts version 2.4 (1125.29)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s with Apple podcasts app installed."
