    description: "Uhhm, guys? I just randomly opened game center. This app needs some love. And by love I mean a total rewrite.\r\n\r\n* Overview shows that I have 25 friends. But when I click on it it toggles between No Friends and “Not Available”. (https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740057497935941632 and https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740057329958301696)\r\n* The Friends page does some funky things while reloading and is stealing focus, had to quit the app because QuickRadar here is losing focus constantly.\r\n* About page lists 2014. https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740058367922704384\r\n* Cannot actually add a friend. Not sure if I got the username wrong or bug - error message doesn’t say. https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740057790887104512\r\n* After ranting on Twitter someone sent a friend request and boom - the friend list was back! Took me a while to figure out how to press accept… but then *sadface* https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740057329958301696\r\n* Uh, Avatar editing seems a bit broken too: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740061185215594497\r\n* Mac apps are listed in the game menu (e.g. Slack)\r\n* Xcode is listed in the game menu as iOS app. WAT https://twitter.com/steipete/status/740062162463412224\r\n* And yes, you can play Xcode. https://twitter.com/b3ll/status/740060990356611072\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the app. Press any buttons.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nidk.. it should work?\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSorry, had a bit too much fun with this radar. However, this app really badly needs some attention - hope some of my findings help to get this to the right people."
