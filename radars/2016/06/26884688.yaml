    description: "Summary:\r\nThe lock behavior during phone calls has changed from iOS 9, making it difficult and incredibly annoying to hang up at the end of a phone call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a phone call\r\n2. Put phone to your ear\r\n3. Wait for screen to lock\r\n4. Attempt to hang up the call\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPutting phone back in front of my face triggers proximity sensor, unlocking the device, allowing me to immediately hit the \"End call\" button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEntire device is lock, forcing me to awkwardly unlock the device and fumble my way back to the phone app so that I can press the \"End call\" button."
