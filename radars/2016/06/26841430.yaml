    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UISearchBar in a Messages extension, tapping it in the compact view does not cause it to become first responder and therefore does not show the keyboard or expand to the full view as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add UISearchBar to MainInterface.storyboard\r\n2. Run the app extension\r\n3. Tap the UISearchBar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLike the image search example included on the simulator it is expected that the UISearchBar would become first responder and expand the extension from the compact view to the full view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe extension remains in the compact view and the UISearchBar does not become the first responder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261u)"
