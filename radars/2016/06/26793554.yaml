    description: "Summary:\r\nOne of the main uses of third party keyboards is for typing in a language which iOS doesn’t support. One of the clearest examples is Persian. Since another version of iOS came out without supporting Persian in any way, people who want to type in Persian are stuck with third party keyboards such as FarsTap.\r\nWith the introduction of iPad Pro, using hardware keyboards has become a lot more common. Unfortunately, despite macOS which has had Persian keyboard for a long time, iOS doesn’t let people type in Persian. The problem is that although people can add typing in Persian functionality via third party solutions, this doesn’t let them type via Smart Keyboard or any other bluetooth hardware keyboards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install FarsTap or Swype on iPad Pro to activate Persian keyboard on iOS.\r\n2. Connect iPad to Smart Keyboard and try to switch keyboards to FarsTap via Globe key.\r\n3. Start typing on Smart Keyboard. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that Persian is typed when FarsTap is selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough FarsTap (a Persian keyboard) is selected, English is typed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhone and iPad running iOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem exists since iOS 8 and the introduction of third party keyboards."
