    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are times when bugreport.apple.com is unbearable in how slow it is.  I've had login take 3 full minutes, switching tabs (Open, Hidden, Closed, Archive, etc) takes 30 seconds to load, selecting different radars takes 30 seconds to load.  Is there a way that this tool can be improved given how important it is?"
