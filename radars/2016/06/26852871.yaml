    description: "Update 6/22/16: Duplicate of 15453121\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs a primary UI color, white is fine at best and eyeball burning at worst (even with Night Shift). A dark theme for iOS would do more than just look awesome, it would make using my iPhone and iPad much more comfortable (I enable dark mode to make the screen easy on my eyes in every app that has it, from iBooks to Instapaper to Tweetbot to Overcast)."
