    description: "Update 6/23/16: Duplicate of 26818037\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nSiri can tweet and post to Facebook because of native integrations, but it would be great to be able to post to other platforms using it. For example, “Post my last photo to Instagram with the caption ‘Visiting Tim at the campus 2 spaceship’”, “Publish ‘I’m so happy with all of Apple’s developers’ work on iOS 10’ with Tweetbot”, “Check-in with Foursquare”, etc."
