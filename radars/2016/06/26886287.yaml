    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you're in the middle of a line in the swift repl and press enter, a newline is entered. Instead of this I believe that the current input should be executed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. type `swift` at the command line to enter the repl\r\n2. Type an instruction such as `let a = 5`\r\n3. Go to the left a character with the left arrow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe instruction is evaluated and `a` is assigned to `5`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA `\\n` is inserted at the insertion point\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe majority of other repls I've tried work the way I'm hoping for. For this I tried python, ruby, haskell, and node.\r\n\r\nRelevant llvm bug: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27365"
