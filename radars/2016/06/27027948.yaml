    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSafari isn’t showing me a saved password for this site (Harrys.com), and viewing all passwords in Settings shows no saved passwords, but when I attempt to log in, it offers to update the existing password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a website for which you think you have a saved password.\r\n2. See that there are no saved passwords, log in to the website by typing your password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari will ask to save the new password, but since it didn’t have a saved password, should not offer to update the password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari asks to update the saved password that it didn’t offer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" (ML0N2LL/A)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have since fixed the issue by creating a new password.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" (ML0N2LL/A)"
