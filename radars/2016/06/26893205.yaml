    description: "Peter Steinberger20-Jun-2016 06:11 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOften it's not feasible to jump to the next SDK version right away - fixing bugs for future iOS versions can be done independently and is often the better way - so apps are ready when iOS 10 ships and also beta users have a great experience.\r\n\r\nFor that it would be really useful if one could deploy apps from the current stable version of Xcode (7.3.1) to future versions of iOS (like iOS 10b1).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpdate device to iOS 10.\r\nSelect in Xcode.\r\nSee \"Could not find Developer Disk Image\" warning: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/744896915934949376\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should be able to find/download/discover this disk image and make it work automatically. \r\n\r\nI found a workaround, but how many people will see that one?\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/steipete/d9b44d8e9f341e81414e86d7ff8fb62d\r\n\r\nRequiring the Xcode-Beta being installed for this to work would be an acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.3.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
