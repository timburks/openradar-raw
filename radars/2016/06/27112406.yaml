    description: "The sample project is pure ObjC. It was auto-updated by Xcode 8's suggestions. In the resulting project the Code Generation of Core Data Model is set to Swift. It causes app launching errors:\r\ndyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib\r\n  Referenced from: /var/containers/Bundle/Application/1C1DEFDB-EC9E-4EE0-A2D9-5AE4D5B58312/FRCMergeFaultBug.app/FRCMergeFaultBug\r\n  Reason: image not found\r\n\r\nManually setting it to Objective-C doesn't help. Actually you'll find it is set back Swift if you relaunch Xcode.\r\n\r\nCode: http://cl.ly/1X3K2u2o1n1j"
