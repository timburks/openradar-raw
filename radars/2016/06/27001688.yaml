    description: "Summary:\r\nAbout 50% of the time when debugging JS in a WKWebView embedded in a native iOS application, the debugging session completely hangs. I am able to close the window and navigate between views (Debugging, Console, Timelines, etc) but I cannot inspect any variables, execute statements in the console, or resume the execution (Play/Pause execution, step into/over). Once this occurs I need to close the Safari window and re-attach. At times I need to completely restart the debugging session be re-launching my iOS app and then re-attaching with Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an iOS app containing a WKWebView \r\n2. Attach Safari to the WKWebView\r\n3. Set a breakpoint on some javascript\r\n4. Exercise javascript to hit the breakpoint\r\n5. Wait a short while (10-20 seconds)\r\n6. Attempt to step over the breakpoint line of code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can step over/into and resume javascript execution as needed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the entire debugging session just becomes unresponsive. I can't step forward or resume javascript execution. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 and 9 (both on device and in the Simulator)\r\nSafari 9.1.1 and Safari Technology Preview 9.1.2\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have not found a configuration where this _does not_ occurred.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
