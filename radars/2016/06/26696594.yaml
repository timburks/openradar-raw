    description: "Summary:\r\nSiri recognizes requests to set alarms by label name, so long as they are identified as \"the <label> alarm\". It should be as amenable to more personalized requests to set \"my <label> alarm\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an alarm in the Clock app and label it something like \"Henry School Day\".\r\n2. Invoke Siri and say \"set my Henry School Day alarm\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarm should be set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri responds with a lack of understanding.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: asking Siri to \"set the Henry School Day alarm\" works.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Failure.jpg' and 'Success.jpg' were successfully uploaded."
