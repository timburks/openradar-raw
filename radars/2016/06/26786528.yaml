    description: "Seems to be resolved in Xcode 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)\r\n------\r\nSummary:\r\nThe automatically generated header \"TargetName-Swift.h\" is broken when using Xcode 8.\r\nThere are errors occurring multiple times in this file:\r\n- Too many arguments provided to function-like macro invocation\r\n- Unknown type name 'SWIFT_CLASS_PROPERTY'\r\n- Expected identifier or '('\r\n\r\nThe Swift code for these lines is correct and does not throw any errors.\r\n\r\nI'll attach the Swift-Header and the Swift-File that are involved in this problem\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(not sure, if this happens in every project)\r\n\r\n1. Convert Swift 2.2 syntax to Swift 3 using the built-in tool in Xcode 8\r\n\r\n2. Fix some errors that could not be resolved by the converter\r\n\r\n3. Build the project for iOS 10\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should be built as expected, because I have no influence on the Swift-Header which causes the errors\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThese 3 error occurred multiple times:\r\n- Too many arguments provided to function-like macro invocation\r\n- Unknown type name 'SWIFT_CLASS_PROPERTY'\r\n- Expected identifier or '('\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nXcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13', Mid 2014); 8GB RAM; 256GB SSD\r\n\r\niOS Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TargetName-Swift.h' and 'MyClass.swift' were successfully uploaded."
