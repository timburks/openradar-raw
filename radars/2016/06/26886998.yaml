    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 3.0 dependencies of our frameworks were not linked correctly, causing them to fail to build, and eventually causing the migrator to crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With a project, create 2 levels of dependencies\r\n2. Migrate the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project builds and migrates correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 2nd level of dependencies are not built to the correct location, resulting in a build failure, and a migrator crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe were able to work around this in the labs by symlinking the normal Intermediates build directory to the SwiftMigration directory."
