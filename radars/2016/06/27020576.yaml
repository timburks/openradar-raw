    description: "On iPad Pro 12.9\" the call to action to \"Start Coding\" is very small and in a non obvious location on screen making it feel like you can't advance. See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Swift Playgrounds on iOS 10 beta 1, on iPad Pro 12.9\"\r\n2. Launch the \"Learn to Code\" playground\r\n3. Swipe through the Introduction screens\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be obvious how to move on to the coding from the Introduction screens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe call to action \"Start Coding\" is tiny, located in the lower corner, and in a color which doesn't stand out properly.\r\n\r\nThis leads to it not being obvious how to move forward in the application.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1 - 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\"\r\niOS 10 beta 1"
