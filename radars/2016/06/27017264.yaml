    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you normally swipe down for notification center you get your widgets when swiping to the right. If you’re on the homescreen however you get your widgets directly when swiping to the right.\r\n\r\nIf you swipe down on the homescreen for the notification center and want to see your widgets then you can not swipe to the right to view them in notification center, this is bad for the user experience as this is the same screen and the user has to remember what was the last screen before he got there. Users might get confused and need to learn the rules for when they can see the widgets (like “If you swipe right, you get the notification, except you have been on the homescreen before.” The same is true for the lockscreen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a random app\r\n2. Open notification center\r\n3. Swipe right to see your widgets\r\n4. Go to homescreen\r\n5. Swipe down for notification center\r\n6. Swipe right\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to see my widgets\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, User is confused."
