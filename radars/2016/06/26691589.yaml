    description: "# Title\r\n\r\nAuto Layout fails when UINavigationController is added as a child ViewController if `scrollViewDidScroll:` calls `topLayoutGuide`\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nWhen a UINavigationController is added as a child ViewController, the view controller in the navigation controller will experience issues with Auto Layout if it has a scroll view whose delegat's `scrollViewDidScroll:` method calls into the UIViewController's `topLayoutGuide` property.\r\n\r\nIn that situation, views with auto layout constraints set up will all have a frame with size (0,0):\r\n\r\n```\r\n(lldb) po [0x7fb8e99b3700 subviews]\r\n<__NSArrayM 0x7fb8e99c1650>(\r\n<UIScrollView: 0x7fb8ea865200; frame = (364 492; 0 0); clipsToBounds = YES; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x7fb8e99bcae0>; layer = <CALayer: 0x7fb8e999fb90>; contentOffset: {0, 0}; contentSize: {0, 0}>,\r\n<UIView: 0x7fb8e9a01fc0; frame = (0 0; 0 0); layer = <CALayer: 0x7fb8e9a01f30>>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a UIViewController containing a scrollView, with its delegate's scrollViewDidScroll method calling `topLayoutGuide` on the UIViewController\r\n2. Create a UINavigationController with the controller created in (1) as its root\r\n3. Add the UINavigationController from (2) as a child view controller to an existing view controller\r\n\r\n# Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe subviews within the view of the UIViewController created in (1) should be laid out as expected, according to the Auto Layout constraints they were created with.\r\n\r\n# Actual Results\r\n\r\nAll the subviews have size (0, 0).\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n\r\niPad Air, iPad Mini, iPhone 6\r\n\r\n# Version & Build\r\n\r\niOS 9 and above\r\n\r\n# Sample Project\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/npjq21zk7nd284h/ViewController.m?dl=0\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mhnjj3zfqird1vj/NavControllerTester.zip?dl=0"
