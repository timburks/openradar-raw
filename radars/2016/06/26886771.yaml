    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 3.0 we noticed that enums inheriting from String were not lowercase *even though* they had defined string values (as opposed to them being implicit).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a string enum in Swift 2.2:\r\n\r\nenum Foo: String {\r\n\tcase Bar = \"something\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. Migrate the code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBar is lowercased to `bar`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBar is left untouched\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBased on the labs at WWDC the assumption was no enums with `: String` are touched because if they do not have values defined then that would affect the runtime values. But in this case were we assign a specific string, this shouldn't be an issue."
