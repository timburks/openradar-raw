    description: "Summary:\r\nI use/depend on a plugin called Polychromatic (https://github.com/kolinkrewinkel/Polychromatic) that gives properties, ivars, and local variables each a unique, dynamic color, stripping away emphasis from types which don't need it. Since Xcode plugins no longer work, there should either be an API that allows a source editor extension to be called whenever the text is changed and allow it to change the color of everything to do custom syntax highlighting, or Xcode team should implement semantic highlighting themselves.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Code has semantic highlighting (useful since the compiler doesnâ€™t know semantics/business rules)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Code has syntactic highlighting (useless since the compiler already checks the syntax)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe lack of this feature could be mitigated on Xcode 7 and earlier using Polychromatic. On Xcode  8 and later it can also be mitigated using MakeXcodeGr8Again (https://github.com/fpg1503/MakeXcodeGr8Again) but that may leave Xcode vulnerable (just like Xcode 7 was).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThousands of developers rely on this feature on a daily basis and may consider removing Xcode signature validation to have it working again."
