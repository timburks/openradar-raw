    description: "Summary:\r\nMessaging apps produce images that are resized to many different sizes. This makes having text or any fine generated lines difficult.\r\n\r\nMany potential messaging apps will be much better with text (even sample apps provided by Apple contain text).\r\n\r\nA potential solution is to allow providing of a nib instead of an image. This nib could then generate images at various sizes using auto layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
