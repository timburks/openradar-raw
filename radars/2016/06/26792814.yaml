    description: "Summary:\r\nThird Party Keyboards are not available in Lock Screen when Touch ID is active. In redesigned lock screen, replying to messages and using keyboards will be much more popular. Unfortunately, if you tap on reply or 3D Touch on a message notification, third party keyboards are not available. This causes huge frustration if your only choice in typing in a specific language is using a third party keyboard as in Persian. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install and activate a third party keyboard such as Swype or FarsTap (for Persian).\r\n2. Lock the device. Make sure you have Touch ID activated.\r\n3. Send an iMessage or SMS or Skype or WhatsApp or … to your device. \r\n4. Try to reply without unlocking the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the third party keyboard to be available when replying to messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThird party keyboards won’t appear in keyboards list and can’t be used.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 10 Beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem exists since iOS 8 but has not been addressed yet. I’ve already filed a radar. I believe far more people will try to reply to messages from the lock screen and I think this has to be fixed. Thanks in advance."
