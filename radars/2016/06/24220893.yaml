    description: "It'd be nice to have possibility to force synchronisation of keychain manually on any kind of device, because quite often it doesn't happen automatically. And it can spent several days for or do nothing at all, I mean it refuses to transfer some items from one device to another and make me disable/enable the feature in settings to get expected results. Damn.\r\nThe same thing had place with credit cards.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2 (13C75)\r\nOS X 10.11.2 (15C50)\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Apr-2016\r\nIt is still annoying a little bit: Safari password isn't synchronised even after 12 hours after creation. Both devices are in the same network and even charging."
