    description: "Summary:\r\nPresently, when playing a WWDC video in the app, the video can only be played back at native speed. Since I have limited time windows for watching videos, I often play back at increased speed. To do this on the iPad though, I need to open the video's page in a browser, then copy the link to the download of the HD video, and open that in VLC, which then downloads the video to play it back. I then have to go back into the WWDC app later and mark that video as watched."
