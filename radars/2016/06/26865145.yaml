    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen filing a bug against the Swift Playgrounds app, RadarWeb has a field that requests the version number of the Swift Playgrounds app. However, the app does not report a version number as far as I could see, either in Settings.app or in the app itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find a bug in Swift Playgrounds.app.\r\n2. Go to RadarWeb to report it.\r\n3. Notice the field for Swift Playgrounds Version & iOS Version.\r\n4. Go looking for Swift Playgrounds version.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe version number is somewhere obvious, like in an info screen in the app, or in Settings.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSadness and despair.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (WWDC seed 1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny device running iOS 10 WWDC seed 1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot of RadarWeb: http://cl.ly/gUPq"
