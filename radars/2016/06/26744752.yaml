        Summary:
        The Alex voice pronounces "destructiveRed" as "destructivurred”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Type “destructiveRed” (it was the name of a constant in an Xcode project, and someone on my team uses VoiceOver to help him read text in Xcode).
        2. Use VoiceOver to read “destructiveRed”

        Expected Results:
        VoiceOver sees the capital R, and takes that into account to split the word, just like OS X spell check does.

        Actual Results:
        VoiceOver reads it the same way as it would read “destructivered” (no uppercase), pronouncing it as “destructivurred”.

        Regression:
        unknown

        Notes:
        none
