    description: "Summary:\n\nWhen working with multiple Xcode versions (for example Xcode 7.3 and Xcode 8), it often occurs that the project update version scripts keep showing up, despite already performing (some - but not necessary all) recommended upgrades. \n\nIf any remaining upgrade suggestions are unchecked and the update checked is dismissed by pressing the done button, the LastUpgradeVersion changes and can even be downgraded to an earlier version. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nOpen an a project with outdated settings in Xcode 8. Uncheck all suggested options in the project updater and select done. \nOpen the same project with Xcode 7.3.1. When (if) the project migrator shows up again, uncheck all suggested options and select done. The LastUpgradeVersion should now be lower than before. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nIf the update was already performed using a newer version of Xcode, then the updater should now show up again when switching to an older Xcode version. \n\nActual Results:\n\nUpdated can show up again and decrease the LastUpgradeVersion in the xcscheme file. \n\nRegression:\n\nWe have seen this happen with multiple Xcode versions so far. Most currently with Xcode 7.3.1 and Xcode 8 (beta1)."
