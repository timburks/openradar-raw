    description: "Summary:\r\nOur application is deployed to iPads at businesses around the country. The application runs almost constantly. Most of our devices are controlled by our MDM program. Our application is signed with an enterprise distribution certificate.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of June 2016 some merchants have reported \"out of space\" errors on our in-store iPads. Storage & iCloud Usage in Settings reports that our application has grown to consume all available local storage space. When we collected the iPad we found that the Preferences folder within our app's sandbox was full of duplicate plist files, like \"com.mycompany.myapp.plist.3gaPYul\". In many cases the preferences had been collecting since the iPad was deployed. The files were created every few hours, with no immediately visible pattern.\r\n\r\nAfter deleting and reinstalling our app the same devices were \"fixed\". They did not make duplicate preferences.\r\n\r\nThis StackOverflow question from 2010 describes the same bug: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4561002/why-is-nsuserdefaults-leaving-temporary-plist-files-in-library-preferences-for-m\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnfortunately we've been unable to reproduce.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPreferences folder should not grow to fill the device's available storage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPreferences folder grows to fill the device's available storage.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany of the iPads have been creating duplicate preferences since they were deployed last year, some as early as August 2015. The iPads were originally running some version of iOS 8. The preferences continued to grow through the updates to iOS 9 and 9.x.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\noriginal iPad Mini, wifi only"
