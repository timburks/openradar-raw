    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 2.3 we noticed that initializers we have in extensions on Foundation/UIKit/CoreLocation types were overwritten at the call site with a stdlib initializer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an extension on CLLocation where you initialize it with a position.\r\n2. Call the initializer from somewhere\r\n3. Migrate to Swift 2.3\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe initializer is untouched\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe initializer is overwritten. In this case ours was overwritten with the initializer accepting an NSCoder.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happened to us with initializers on UIColor, CLLocation, Swift's Dictionary, and others."
