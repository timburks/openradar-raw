    description: "Summary:\r\nThis may or may not be related to rdar://25343654\r\n\r\nFor months now (since before iOS 9.3 - I was hoping that release would fix this) the Health app is nonfunctional on my iPhone. I’ve done a backup and restore, as well as a software restore, and neither made a difference. The Health app shows no data in my dashboard graphs, and won’t allow me to add new data points manually (I try adding them, but then nothing happens). When I go to “Show All Data”, I get a spinner and nothing else. Also, the Activity app doesn’t show any activity at all, and I’ve had my watch for over a year (with streaks going that whole time.\r\n\r\nSince I have an extremely long Move streak going (385+ days) I’m very nervous about any troubleshooting that could lead to data loss.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what else I can send you to help track this very frustrating issue down.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot sure\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHealth app receives and displays data\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHealthKit appears to reject any changes to its database, and doesn’t display any data it already has"
