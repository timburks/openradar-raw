    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8 and 7 I-Beam cursor is hardly visible on dark backgrounds. It is painful to use newly introduced \"Civic\" color theme where many times during programming I can't find my cursor.\r\n3rd-party solution to work around this problem can be found here: https://github.com/egold/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor.  390 stars and 34 forks of this repo convinces me I'm not the only one with this problem.\r\nFurthermore, since Xcode 7.3 it is a lot more complicated to replace cursor file. \r\nXcode 8 is still in beta and I believe it would be awesome for many developers to see a fix for this problem before the final release.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\nVersion 7.3 (7D175)"
