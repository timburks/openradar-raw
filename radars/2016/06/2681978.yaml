    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter modeling some entities, they just disappear from the .xcdatamodeld file. Especially after generating the NSManagedObject Subclass the entities tend to disappear. I have included the .xcdatamodeld file. Further, a third file is sometimes generated, probably a template malfunction. I have included this one as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Xcode\r\n2. New Project\r\n3. iOS Universal Swift Core Data Single View Project\r\n4. Open .xcdatamodeld file\r\n5. Add entity, add attributes\r\n6. Generate NSManagedObject Subclass\r\n7. Navigate to a Swift file\r\n8. Navigate to .xcdatamodeld file\r\n9. Observe the entities are gone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the created entities to be in the .xcdatamodeld file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe .xcdatamodeld file is empty"
