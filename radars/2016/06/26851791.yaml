    description: "Update 6/23/16: Duplicate of 26778058\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently, Siri pulls news headlines from Bing search results. Some users have dedicated apps for keeping up the news. It would be great to be able to ask Siri “What are the latest headlines in Reuters?”, “What’s new in Reeder?”, “What’s the latest in NewsBlur?”, etc."
