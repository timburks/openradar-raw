    description: "Summary:\r\nThe system.login.console section of the Authorization database is reset after an upgrade from 10.11.5, meaning any AuthorizationPlugins that have been configured won't run.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an authorization plugin that also modifies the Authorization Database (for example https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt2) on 10.11.5\r\n2. In Terminal, run security authorizationdb read system.login.console to ensure modifications have been made\r\n3. Upgrade to macOS 10.12\r\n4. Run security authorizationdb read system.login.console again to see modifications are removed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe modifications made to the authorization database should persist after an upgrade.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modifications made to the authorization database are removed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12 DP1 16A201w\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has happened on every upgrade performed so far, on all available test hardware."
