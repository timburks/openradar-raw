    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using URLSession.shared() in the didRecieve(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler:(UNNotificationContent) -> Void) method the completion block is not called which results in serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire being called\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a Notification Service extension to an existing project\r\n2. Set up a URLSession.shared() object in the didRecieve(request:withContentHandler) method\r\n3. Call dataTask(with:completionHandler)\r\n4. Exhibit that the completion handler is never called \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe completion handler should be called every single time a push is received\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe completion handler is called in roughly 1 in 20 push notifications received.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that we use similar methods in a Today extension and the completion block is called without fail in those circumstances, however for the UNNotificationServiceExtension it is almost always never called.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 6th Generation"
