    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iPad or iPhone 6 Plus:\r\n\r\nSetting a wallpaper from the camera roll gets cropped and stretched when the device is rotated. Stretching does not occur when a stock wallpaper is chosen from settings. \r\n\r\nIt appears as though, when choosing a wallpaper from the camera roll, any image (square or rectangle) is cropped vertically before being set, causing the image to zoom in very close on rotation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn iPad or iPhone 6 Plus:\r\n\r\n1. Open Settings\r\n2. Tap \"Wallpaper\"\r\n3. Tap \"Choose New Wallpaper\"\r\n4. Tap \"All Photos\"\r\n5. Choose an image that is square\r\n6. Set image as wallpaper.\r\n7. Press Home Button.\r\n8. Rotate the device into landscape orientation\r\n\r\nNotice that the image was cropped vertically and has stretched to fill the width of the device. (See attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf an image is chosen from the camera roll, on device rotation, the image should maintain the original aspect ratio to prevent the image from being stretched and zoomed in. \r\n\r\nThis works correctly when an image is chosen from the stock still wallpapers. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter setting a wallpaper from the camera roll, the square image is cropped vertically in a 9:16 aspect ratio. When the device is rotated the image becomes stretched and zoomed in. \r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot for example. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 [13F69]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWallpaper chosen from camera roll is being cropped and causing zooming on rotation. See attached screenshot for example. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus and iPad Air 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Example of image stretching.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
