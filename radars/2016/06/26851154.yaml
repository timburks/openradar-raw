    description: "Update 6/23/16: Duplicate of 26910100\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nWorkflow is a powerful utility on iOS—one that enables so much amazing work on iOS (I have personally have 35 workflows as I type this). Apps like Launch Center Pro and IF have similar functions and utility. Imagine the things you could enable on iOS by allowing us to ask Siri, “Launch my ‘Clipboard to PDF’ Workflow”, “Run my ‘Save Parking Location’ workflow”, “Trigger my ‘Log Time’ action in IF”, “Run my ‘Group Text Last Photo’ action in Launch Center Pro” and more."
