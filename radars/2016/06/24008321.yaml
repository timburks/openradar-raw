    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be incredibly advantageous to both developers and users to offer an API to open a particular part of iOS's settings. For example, an app that uses Bluetooth devices could provide a shortcut to the Bluetooth preferences. An app that requires iCloud could provide a shortcut to the iCloud preferences if the user isn't logged in. An app that uses Touch ID could shortcut to the Touch ID settings. The list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nThe Mac has a great API to allow apps to direct System Preferences to a particular preference pane. As of OS X 10.9, this also works for sandboxed/App Store apps - System Preferences supports the \"preferencepane.reveal\" scripting target, so apps can use Apple Events to ask System Preferences to show a preference pane of choice. It would be fantastic to have this on iOS also.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at iOS documentation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn API or URL scheme to open a particular part of the Settings app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API exists.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant called UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString that opens my app's Settings pane, but no API to open other settings panes.\r\n\r\nThere is a URL scheme called \"prefs:\" that can open parts of Settings (for example, \"prefs:root=General\" opens to the General section), but it's undocumented and it is a private URL scheme, so third-party developers can't use it for the most part."
