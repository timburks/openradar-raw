    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the iWork apps on iOS, in the list of documents, you can long press on a document as a shortcut to jump into selection mode and select that document. iBooks should support this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iBooks\r\n2. Make sure you have at least one book or PDF in your library.\r\n3. Press and hold on a book or PDF.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should be the equivalent of tapping the Select button, then tapping on a book or PDF: the app should switch to Edit mode, and the book or PDF should be selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, other than the cell getting a press highlight.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v), iBooks 4.9 (3543.0.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is related to rdar://26867746, which is the same request but for Swift Playgrounds on iOS.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
