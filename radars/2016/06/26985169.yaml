    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMusic matching should take place at album granularity. I suspect this could substantially reduce mismatches for your customers' music libraries.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'd like to suggest a simple heuristic: if *any* track in an album fails to match and must be uploaded, then *all* tracks from that album should be uploaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a well-maintained iTunes music library\r\n2. Enable iCloud Music Library\r\n3. Watch as tracks are mismatched against the Apple Music catalog\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected: iCloud Music matching doesn't mismatch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nActual: sometimes iCloud Music matching mismatches individual tracks in an otherwise uploaded album, which is unfortunate.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm an Apple Music user who recently enabled iCloud Music Library for my primary iTunes library of ~20000 songs. The accuracy of matching is... not ideal. I'd say perhaps as many as 5% of my tracks were mismatched.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the failures in more detail, I can't find a single instance (at least for my library) where an entire album was mismatched; in every case, there were a small number of mismatched tracks from albums that otherwise needed to be uploaded.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X El Capitan (latest)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
