    description: "Summary:\r\nIn FaceTime, when connecting a video call, the user' camera is visible below the connecting screen. For apps that are video only, ideally CallKit should match this experience.\r\n\r\nThis is an important addition as it allows the user to see what will be visible to the recipient of the call when a connection is made.\r\n\r\nThis is also connected to another radar I've filed (26882315) which requests that a connected video call be sent straight to the app when a connection is made.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Make a CallKit call with a video calling app (like our app Zeen)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to see the camera output while connecting\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly contact info of who I'm calling is shown."
