    description: "Summary:\r\nCollection view doesn't query the layout for new attributes after returning invalidation context from `invalidationContextForPreferredLayoutAttributes:`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open SelfSizingLayoutDemo and select iPhone 5s (9.3) from device menu.\r\n2. Build and run.\r\n3. Scroll through the collection view.\r\n4. Stop execution and select iPhone 5s (10.0) from device menu.\r\n5. Build and run.\r\n6. Observe the incorrect cell size right after collection view appears on screen.\r\n7. Flick to scroll through the collection view and observe some cells resizing mid scroll.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe collection view works as expected on iOS 9.3 but not on iOS 10.0. Specifically, the collection view doesn't query the layout for new attributes after returning invalidation context from `invalidationContextForPreferredLayoutAttributes:`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe collection view should behave as it did in iOS 9.3. It should query the layout for new attributes after receiving invalidation context from `invalidationContextForPreferredLayoutAttributes`."
