    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to use playgrounds for ios and CoreImage. I get a \"failure\" both when trying to run the playground and the auto-update when I type.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nopen the attached playground and try to run it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe playground would run and give an error other than failing to find the process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nplayground failed to execute\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis was found on macOS 10.11.5 and Xcode 7.3(7D175). But it should be noted that the Xcode 8 beta(8S128d) has been installed on this computer but was not running when the error occurred.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is a 2011 mac book pro 13in. running 10.11.5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'playgroundFailError.png' and 'playgroundFail.playground.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosed as a duplicate of 26362589"
