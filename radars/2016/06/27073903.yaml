Submit correct answers for the two security questions then click “Continue”\n4. Text of body of modal dialog changes to: “Stronger Password Required”\n5. click Cancel.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe user should be authenticated into Apple ID account but should get warning to update the password.\n\nActual Results:\nThe user is unable to authenticate into account.\n\nRegression:\nThis used to work fine up until April 2016\n\nNotes:\nThis causes severe problems for users of legacy password systems for special needs and accessibility."
