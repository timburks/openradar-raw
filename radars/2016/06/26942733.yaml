    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSlide Over and Split View cannot be invoked by swiping from the middle, right edge of the screen if the last app that was displayed as a secondary app is an expired or unavailable TestFlight beta app. Split View and Slide Over appears broken system-wide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a TestFlight beta app\r\n2. Open an app that supports split view multitasking like Safari\r\n3. Invoke split screen multitasking by swiping from the middle, right edge of the screen\r\n4. Select the TestFlight beta app as the secondary app\r\n5. Wait (possibly many days) until the TestFlight app expires or is unavailable\r\n6. Open an app that supports split screen multitasking like Safari\r\n7. Try to invoke split screen multitasking by swiping from the right side of the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to invoke Slide Over or Split Screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwiping from the middle, ride edge of the screen does not work. If you are swiping from the middle, right edge of the screen, nothing happens. If you are swiping from the top or bottom, right side of the screen, a black arrow on a grey background is briefly animated in. Multitasking appears totally broken. A reboot alone does not help.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the expired TestFlight app and rebooting the iPad, Split Screen and Slide Over works again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v) - I can reproduce the issue on iOS 9.3.2 and iOS 10.0 beta 1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug drove me nuts because I thought my iPad was broken and it took me hours to find out what the problem was.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPad Pro 12.9\" and iPad Air 2"
