    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I present a UIImagePickerController with its modalPresentationStyle set to FullScreen or PageSheet, it seems to use a weird transition for popping view controllers when the device is in landscape mode. \r\n\r\nlet imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()\r\nimagePicker.modalPresentationStyle = .FullScreen // or .PageSheet\r\npresentViewController(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Present a UIImagePickerController using the above code\r\n2. Make sure the iPad is in landscape mode\r\n3. Navigate into any of the options displayed (e.g. Moments)\r\n4. Hit the back button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view controller would transition back using the usual pop animation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view controller flies off the side of the screen (always towards the device's home button, which is extra strange)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.3, iOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air, iPad simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ImagePickerDemo.mov' was successfully uploaded."
