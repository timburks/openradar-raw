    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI received an email about an update to an app I’m testing on TestFlight. I installed. It got stuck at ~75%. I tried deleting it and re-installing (a common suggested fix for such issues) - this did not work. Upon trying to reinstall, the app was stuck in the state you can observe in the attached screenshot - “Installing”.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOne thing I should probably note, it's entirely possible this has nothing to do with TestFlight at all, and rather is a lower level app install thing.\r\n\r\nI’ve tried EVERYTHING to fix it. No, like everything.\r\n\r\nHere’s a list of things that I tried that did not break it out of the “stuck” state:\r\n\r\n- Tapping stop (obviously) - this does nothing, it sometimes “visually disables” but that’s it, no other change.\r\n- Restarting my phone\r\n- Lock Button + Home Button restarting my phone\r\n- Signing out of the App Store/iTunes store on my phone\r\n- Signing out of iCloud on my phone\r\n- Deleting the App\r\n- Banging my head against a wall\r\n\r\nDupes radar://26862276 from Sean Heber of Twitterrific\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs described above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app would install normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app can’t be installed in any way shape or form, not from the App Store, not through TestFlight. (After speaking with another iOS developer who also experienced the issue with an app he is the developer of, even Xcode can’t break it out of this state).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus AT&T 32 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0842.PNG': http://jakemarsh.media/IMG_0842.PNG"
