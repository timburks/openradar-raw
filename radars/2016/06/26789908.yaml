    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen retrieving the iBeacons in range, only the first measurement includes valid data (even though it provides only 1 or 2 beacons in sight), then the measurements are incorrect and after 5-10sec the array is empty and remains always empty.\r\n\r\nAttaching basic sample project to test it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get nearby some iBeacons with the same proximity uuid\r\n2. Start ranging the iBeacons for its proximity uuid\r\n3. See result un beacons NSArray\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA list of all the iBeacons in sight being updated each second\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFirst measurement of the beacons is correct, then few measurement have accuracy == -1 & rssi == 0, and finally the NSArray is always empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 [14A5261v]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S A1688, using Wifi and Bluetooth enabled"
