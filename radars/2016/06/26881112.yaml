    description: "Summary:\r\nAs of iOS 10 the method `textView:shouldInteractWithURL:inCharacterRange:` is deprecated and the header documentation deprecation warning reads \"Use textView:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:forInteractionType: instead\". This method does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate replacement method is `textView:shouldInteractWithURL: inCharacterRange:interaction` although attempting to use this throws the warning \"nearly matches optional requirement\". None of the Xcode automatic fix options satisfy the compiler. \r\n\r\nThe compiler also complains that \"URL\" is not a recognised type which should not be true as the project is Swift 3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift 3 project with the Single View Controller template\r\n2. Add the \"UITextViewDelegate\" protocol to the ViewController class\r\n3. Type \"textviewshouldInteract\" and let Xcode autocomplete to the \"shouldInteractWith URL\" method.\r\n4. Observe warnings\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should autocomplete to a valid method and the delegate should be called when run\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarning that method \"nearly matches optional requirement\" is thrown and is unsatisfiable. My attempts to discover or use the correct method have failed. It seems impossible to satisfy the warning and have the method called.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 SDK. Xcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a sample project that shows the warning\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-06-19 at 12.06.45.png' and 'Test.zip' were successfully uploaded."
