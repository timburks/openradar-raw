    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running xcodebuild -exportLocalizations on the Xcode 7.3 command line (build version 7D175), the command-line never returns, making it impossible to use in a build script. \r\nWhen an event related to a device or simulator arrives,  (connecting / disconnecting) when execution then unhangs and the command returns.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun xcodebuild -project (PROJECT_NAME) -exportLocalizations -localizationPath (OUTPUT_PATH)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe xliff containing all the strings is generated on OUTPUT_PATH and the command returns the execution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe xliff containing all the strings is generated on OUTPUT_PATH but the command never returns the execution until a simulator is opened (or closed if it was open before executing the command). Or a device is plugged (or unplugged if it was plugged before the execution of the command) from the USB. Then the command returns the execution."
