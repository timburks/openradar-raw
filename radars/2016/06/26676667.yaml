    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you raise your Apple Watch and say, “Hey Siri, set a timer for 5 minutes,” it takes around 30 seconds for the timer to start. When it starts, it starts at 5 minutes. I think it should save the timestamp from the user’s speech, and make the timer start from there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Raise your Apple Watch so the screen activates.\r\n2. Say “Hey Siri, set a timer for five minutes.”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA timer starts for five minutes after you said the phrase.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA five-minute timer starts in 30-60 seconds, after Siri opens the timer app on the watch."
