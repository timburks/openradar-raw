        Summary:
        Intents.framework new in iOS 10 doesn't give the context or a way to disable displaying in that context.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1- create an app that make sense in the Siri context but doesn't work in the Maps context. Ex : an app that competes directly with Maps.app
        2- Add a ride sharing intents

        Expected Results:
        Be able to disable Maps.app use of the Intents via Info.plist or other.

        Actual Results:
        The intent can't control or know where it's being used.
