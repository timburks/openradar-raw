    description: "Summary:\r\nBasically it is a re-radar of 15213568 because 15213568 is closed and I cannot see it in the system but the bug is not completely fixed.\r\n\r\nTable view contains a cell which contains a text view. When inputting text, the table view should auto scroll to reveal the insert point of text view, but it doesn't always. If the cursor is visible the scrolling is proper. But very often the cursor is invisible(another bug) and the scrolling is improper.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Tap several characters.\r\n3. Tap return button to enter a new line.\r\n4. Repeat 1~2 until text view fill the height of visible screen and continue.\r\n5. Repeat 1~4 until you see the bug.\r\n\r\nCode: http://cl.ly/33222Q1Q332c"
