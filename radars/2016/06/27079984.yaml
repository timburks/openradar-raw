        Summary:
        I was experimenting with VoiceOver, and went to read some email. I had the screen curtain enabled, and noticed that when viewing one message from a thread, the “up” and “down” buttons at the top right of the screen were reading as “dimmed button” and “button”. But when I connected my phone to my computer and attached QuickTime to do a screen recording, they started reading correctly as “chevron up - dimmed - button” and “chevron down - button”. Just now, I force quit Mail and then relaunched it, and now they’re reading as “previous message - dimmed - button” and “next message - button”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Mail using VoiceOver while the screen curtain is enabled.
        2. Double tap a message to read it.
        3. Swipe around the screen to find the next/previous buttons.

        Expected Results:
        The buttons are pronounced as “previous message (dimmed) - button” and “next message (dimmed) - button”.

        Actual Results:
        The three times I tried, I got three different descriptions of the buttons, from least to most specific.

        Regression:
        unknown

        Notes:
        I tested on an iPad mini 2 running iOS 10 beta 1 and didn’t reproduce the issue, but it was flaky on my iPhone, so I don’t know if it’s actually fixed.
