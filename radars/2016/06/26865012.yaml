    description: "Summary:\r\nIn apps like Workflow and Pythonista it is possible to execute a Python script or a workflow from an action extension. This is helpful to automate computations on your iPad/iPhone.\r\n\r\nUsing these action extensions it is, for example, possible to share an image using the iOS share sheet, alter it using Python code and save the result back to the camera roll.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful for advanced users, as well as beginners to see how great and joyful programming can be and how many useful things you can do with it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Share an image in Photos\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can select a playground to execute, using the image as an input parameter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo option to execute a playground.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1.0"
