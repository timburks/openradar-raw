    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSafari View Controller's Open In Safari button is at the lower right corner on iPhone. It's in the same location as the Tabs button in Safari. This causes confusion when you want to close a thing you've just read, because the action is different depending on how you got there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap a link in an app that shows the results in Safari View Controller\r\n2. Read the page.\r\n3. Desire to close the page and go back to what you were doing.\r\n4. Forget that you're in Safari View Controller, not Safari, because it looks nearly identical to Safari.\r\n5. Bring up the bottom toolbar and tap the far right button, expecting it to show the Safari tabs view so you can close the tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdmittedly, I have just tapped the wrong button, but this is about mitigating the failure case. It should do something relatively non-destructive that doesn't interrupt the flow of \"I want to close the thing I was reading, and go back to what I was doing,\" at which point I would realize my mistake and either swipe to go back, or tap the Done button at the top left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button at the lower right is the Open in Safari button, so instead of giving me a way to close the tab, it instead switches to Safari and opens the page _again_ there, so now I have to tap the Tabs button in Safari, close the tab, switch _back_ to the app I was in, and dismiss the Safari View Controller correctly this time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAnd iPhone running iOS 9\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
