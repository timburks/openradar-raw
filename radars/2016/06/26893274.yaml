    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe barTintColor property on UINavigationBar is not properly animating between transitions when using animateAlongsideTransition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup an app that consists of one navigation controller.\r\n2. In the animation block of `animateAlongsideTransition:completion:`, set the UINavigationBar's barTintColor to a different color. This should animate.\r\n3. Build/run\r\n4. Now push and pop view controllers. Notice the results.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UINavigationBar's barTintColor should animate the same way tintColor does.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen popping and pushing view controllers, the UINavigationBar's barTintColor is not animating (tintColor is, however). It's being set at the very end of the transition.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (iPhone 6S, 6S+)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've only noticed this behavior on an iPhone 6, 6S, and 6S+ (all running iOS 9.3). This problem does not exist in the associated iOS 9.3 simulators. \r\n\r\nAs of 6/20/16, the iOS 10 simulators exhibit the same behavior (not animating the transition in animateAlongsideTransition).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S+\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UINavigationBar tinting test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
