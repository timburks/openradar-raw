        Summary:
        When I make a change, it is *very common* that I forget to “Save” my changes for quite awhile. There is no obvious visual change or indicator that my changes have not been applied, and the [Save] button is in a non-standard location and very easy to miss.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        For example:
        1. go to External Testers and add a new tester
        2. Now they are listed. Great!
        3. An hour later, ask your tester if they have checked their email.
        4. Go to refresh the page to see if they’ve been notified. Get alert that you haven’t saved. Again. #@$!!
        5. *Now* see that stupid Save button in the upper right that you didn’t notice appearing earlier.

        Expected Results:
        There should be auto-saving, or more obvious prompts that your current state is not saved. The whole page should reflect that changes are not yet applied. Perhaps a red bar across the top, or striped background, or something.

        Actual Results:
        There is a tiny faded in Save button that is very easy to miss.

        Regression:
        NA

        Notes:
        I’ve been having this problem for months. If I used iTunes Connect to make changes daily, I’d eventually learn. But I don’t use it often enough, and I’m regularly getting bitten by this. Very frustrating. Just embarrassed me - again - with a client.
