    description: "Designing HTML email messages that work in most clients is still a tall order in 2016, but it would be somewhat less painful if HTML messages could be inspected in the same way as we do on the web. Please add a basic version of the WebKit Web Inspector to Mail to allow for easier debugging.\r\n\r\nThe View -> Message -> Raw Source option is helpful, but significantly less user-friendly than the Inspector, especially when most HTML email messages are a mess of inline styling and nested tables."
