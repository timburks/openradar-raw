    description: "Summary:\r\nI think that a major use case for watchOS 3 will be configuring separate watch faces for different life contexts. To drive this home and aid in reminding users the intention for each face, it would be useful to associate our own names with them:\r\n\r\n\"Exercise\"\r\n\"Work\"\r\n\"Weekend\"\r\n\"School\"\r\n\"Relaxing\"\r\n\"Childcare\"\r\n\r\nBetter yet, giving names to the configured watch faces will faciliate Siri integration such that you could easily switch between the named faces with phrases like:\r\n\r\n\"Hey Siri, put on your Game face.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
