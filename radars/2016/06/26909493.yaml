    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI tagged a picture of my wife and I with my name, when really it should have been hers, and now we are merged in Photos. There does not seem to be a way to audit which pictures are tagged as which people, and now Photos is showing a blank thumbnail for one person and a half-width picture of me for the other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos\r\n2. Open a memory\r\n3. Scroll to \"People\"\r\n4. Tap on a person to find incorrectly-identified people instead.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a way to audit the link between contacts and photos.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such control (though there is an option to confirm new photos)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached video, you can't see where I'm tapping, but I'm selecting the first four thumbnails (including the invisible one) in People, in order.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" (ML0N2LL/A)"
