    description: "The character Byte sometimes (quite often) misses the gems when instructed to collect them.\r\nHe/she jumps and reaches into the air, but the gem doesn't get collected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Swift Playgrounds on iOS 10 beta 1, on iPad Pro 12.9\"\r\n2. Run any playground where the collectGem() command is used.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe gem should *always* be collected if collectGem() is executed on a tile where a gem exists.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQuite often the gem does not get collected when collectGem() is executed. See attached video. This leads to a correct solution not clearing the level, which could confuse young coders.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I've had to re-run the exact same code after this happens to get the level to marked as passed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1 - 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\"\r\niOS 10 beta 1"
