    description: "Summary:\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI'm the author of the Xcode Plugin Luft(https://github.com/k0nserv/luft). I was excited to implement Luft using the new Xcode Source Editor Extensions, but unfortunately I found that the current API is lacking the ability to monitor a source file for changes.\r\n\r\nFor Luft to work it needs to know anytime a line is added or removed in the document as well as being informed when the active file changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode Source Extensions can be invoked when ever a line is added or removed. Additionally extensions can be informed when the contents of the active buffer changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot supported\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8S128d\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8 Beta \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
