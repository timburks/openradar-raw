    description: "Peter Steinberger20-Jun-2016 08:33 PM\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nArea: Foundation. (Why is that not on the list?)\r\n\r\n [[NSBundle bundleForClass:self.class] pathForResource:fileName ofType:@\"txt\" inDirectory:folderName]; clips too much when the directory contains unicode characters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Radar. Observe that there are no lyrics loaded for Call Me Maybe.\r\nReplace textFilePathNotWorkingRadar with textFilePath to get lyrics :)\r\n\r\nRadar sample code is on https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com. I uploaded it here as well, but please use the GitHub one as we often tweak and update sample projects.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnicode should just work. I know, it's not that easy ;)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOne character at the end is removed, breaking the path.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame issue in Xcode 8b1/iOS 10.0b1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.3.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NSBundleFolderLoadingIssue.zip' was successfully uploaded."
