    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up a new Mac, on a static IP network, the Setup Assistant does not accept multiple DNS servers in the field labelled \"DNS Servers\".  \r\n\r\nThe UI looks like it should accommodate them, but it does not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1] Have a network without DHCP service -- static IP addressing.\r\n2] Setup a new Mac on this network.  (e.g. out of the box, OS on a new hard drive, etc.)\r\n3] When in the Setup Assistant, configure for Manual IP addressing.\r\n4] \"DNS Servers\" is labelled as a plural.\r\n5] \"DNS Servers\" is a multiline text field. \r\n\r\nGiven the plural phrasing and UI, surely it accepts multiple values?\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5] Enter multiple DNS servers, attempting several delimiters:\r\nx.x.x.x, y.y.y.y\r\nx.x.x.x,y.y.y.y\r\nx.x.x.x;y.y.y.y\r\nx.x.x.x y.y.y.y\r\n\r\n...and also, attempting to move to the lower line. \r\nx.x.x.x<RETURN>\r\n(The return is not registered; the cursor does not move.)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6] Setup Assistant displays an error, \"Your Mac isn't connected to the Internet. [TRY AGAIN] [CONTINUE]\"\r\n7] After much trial and error, you realize the field in fact accepts only one value. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.5/15F34\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe UX on this functionality is very confusing.  \r\n\r\nThe multiline field looks just like the one in the Network pane on a configured macOS, with the exception of the [+] and [-] buttons for adding multiple records.  The user likely attempts hitting Return to enter a new value, but that too fails.  An experienced user might try a comma, space, or semicolon as delimiter, but they all fail.\r\n\r\nThe field should either accept multiple values, or have changed text/UI to eliminate the perception.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nA network without DHCP service.  Most often witnessed on an Ethernet connection."
