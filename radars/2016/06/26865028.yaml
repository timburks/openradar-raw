    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a long file in Swift Playgrounds for iPad, the top two lines of text are scrolled up under the nav bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Swift Playgrounds.app.\r\n2. Switch to the My Playgrounds tab.\r\n3. Tap the + button.\r\n4. Choose the Shapes template.\r\n5. Tap the Table of Contents button at the upper left.\r\n6. Choose the Create file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first visible line is the one that says \"// 1. Create a circle\", which is line 1 (or line 0, if you're into that sort of thing)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first visible line is the one that says \"circle.center.y += 28\". This is the third line.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe file in question must be longer than will fit on a single screen. I'm using an iPad mini 2 in landscape; your mileage may vary in portrait or on a large iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreen recording: http://cl.ly/gUOi"
