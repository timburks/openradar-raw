    description: "The key combination: Arrow UP + Shift + Delete inserts the 0x08 (backslash) control character (which most of apps doesn't visualize).\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this sistematically in Apple apps (Xcode 7.3, Safari 9.1.1, Calendar) and in some 3rd party (but not all of them, for example it doesn't occurs in Sublime Text).\r\n\r\nThis is very annoying writing code (but is catched by the compiler) and could be very harmful for non-compiled file (es. with localized string this character causes no error but strings defined after it are ignored, thus not found at runtime).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 7.3.1\r\n2. Type some text\r\n3. Quickly press \"up arrow\" + \"shift\" + \"delete\" (in this order)\r\n4. Select Editor > Show Invisibles\r\n5. You'll see that an invisible backslash character is inserted\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis combination of keys should not insert the 0x08 character\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing seems to happen visually (exept if you are writing some code, for example some swift in a project) but if you  enable \"Show invisibles\" or copy/paste code in an editor which visualize invisible characters (I use Sublime Text 2). You see that the backslash character is inserted"
