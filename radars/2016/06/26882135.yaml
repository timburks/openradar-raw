    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be greatly beneficial to developers to have a command line based tool that would allow for setting the iOS simulator's debug location with an arbitrary location coordinate. A tool like this would allow for developers to create better testing tools that would cut down drastically on the time and the hassle involved in creating location-based features for iOS apps.\r\n\r\nCurrently in order to test location-based features in the simulator, a developer has to either add location coordinates to a .gpx file and add that file to the project, or use the iOS simulator's \"Debug > Location > Custom Location...\" tool. The first allows for multiple locations to be available for use for testing, but adding new locations requires recompilation, which can be slow. The second allows for new coordinates to be entered without recompilation, but the process of setting a new coordinate is very slow.\r\n\r\nHaving access to a command line interface to set iOS simulator locations would open up the possibility of creating a tool that can handle changing locations for development and testing purposes that would solve the issues listed above for the current methods of location setting."
