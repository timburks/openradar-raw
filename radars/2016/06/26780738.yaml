    description: "Summary:\r\nSiriKit usage is limited to a small number of types of applications, rather than being available to all applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a parking app you are really excited to add support for Siri for, since many of your users would benefit from the safety benefits of booking parking with voice rather than by touch while driving. \r\n2. Read documentation. \r\n3. Have sad. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComplete steps 1 and 2 as previous.\r\n3. Start building awesomeness with SiriKit\r\n4. Happy users!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is the current text of what’s supported in SiriKit, per https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Intents/Conceptual/SiriIntegrationGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016875-CH11-SW1: \r\n\r\nAdd SiriKit support only if your app implements one of the following types of services:\r\n\r\nAudio or video calling\r\nMessaging\r\nPayments\r\nSearching photos\r\nWorkouts\r\nRide booking\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’m the lead dev for http://spothero.com, which facilitates finding and paying for parking spaces. We (and our competition in the parking business) are a crystal-clear case of a place where Siri support would be beneficial to both the convenience and safety of the users, but with the current guidelines we would need to somehow contort ourselves into the “ride booking” or “payments” category to be able to leverage the API. \r\n\r\nWhile my overall argument is that this restriction should be dropped entirely (My partner and I would really love to be able to add a “Siri, record me a Hum” to my side project, http://justhum.com, for example), parking is a case where usability would be so significantly enhanced, I’m not really sure I understand why it’s not in the list of application types not permitted to use SiriKit."
