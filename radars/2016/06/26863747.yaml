    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nYou should be able to query a UILabel to find out whether its text is truncated, or whether it is showing its full contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a label that shows the description of something in an app.\r\n2. Limit the label to, say, 3 lines.\r\n3. Some items' descriptions will be longer than 3 lines.\r\n4. Make a button with the title \"Read More\", which we want to show only when the label is truncated.\r\n5. Look for a way to determine if the label is truncated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can easily query a label for isTruncated, and that property would be KVO-able so you can respond to changes dynamically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such property. You have to measure the text yourself. This is a shame, because text layout can potentially be expensive, depending on what you're doing, and it can be hard to get right. It would be preferable if UILabel would expose the property, which would presumably take advantage of the measuring work that it has already done.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
