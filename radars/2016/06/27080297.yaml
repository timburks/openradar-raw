    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of Xcode (I believe it was Xcode 5) the list of provisioning profiles were in alphabetical order. Working for a company that has many accounts we have literally hundreds of provisioning profiles and finding them in date creation order is a nightmare.\r\n\r\nPlease revert the list of provisioning profiles to alphabetical.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Xcode Build Settings on an app\r\n2. Select Provisioning profile drop down menu\r\n3. Observe list that is 300 items long and not in alphabetical order\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nList should be alphabetical\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nList is not alphabetical but instead ordered by creation date"
