    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently Swift Playgrounds supports quick actions for things like choosing colours and numbers. It would be be great if this could be extended so that playgrounds could provide custom quick actions\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nIf a custom graph drawing class is included in the playground, it could provide a custom quick action that allows a user to specify what type of graph should be drawn."
