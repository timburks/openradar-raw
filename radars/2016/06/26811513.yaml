    description: "Observed from Xcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) and still persistent on 8.0 beta (8S128d). Mostly happens on Objective-C classes being used in Swift, but also happens on some selected Swift classes. Xcode can't offer class and method suggestions. Greatly reduces productivity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a relatively big project containing both Objective-C and Swift classes.\r\n\r\n2. Try to code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should autocomplete class names and methods for me once I try to type the class names and methods in my code. Screenshot attached shows that when I type a variable name and then dot, it doesn't suggest attributes or methods available to the associated class.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode doesn't offer any suggestion at all\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nXcode 8.0 beta (8S128d)"
