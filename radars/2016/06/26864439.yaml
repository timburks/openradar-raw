    description: "Summary:\r\nThe current version of the Playgrounds app supports document providers and uses `UIDocumentPickerModeImport` to import from other document providers like Dropbox, Git2Go or Transmit.\r\n\r\nIt would be much handier to just open a Swift Playground in-place and have the changes directly in Git2Go, rather than importing/exporting over and over.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the playgrounds app\r\n2. Import from a document provider\r\n3. Make changes to the playground\r\n4. Version in Swift Playgrounds changed but file in document provider is still the old one\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe version contained in the document provider should be changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe version contained in the Swift Playground app changed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMany people would like to store their Swift Playgrounds in a Git app to version control them. The current version does not make it impossible, but not very handy either. It would be nice to support UIDocumentPickerModeOpen to resolve this usability issue"
