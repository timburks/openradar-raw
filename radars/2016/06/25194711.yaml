    description: "Summary:\r\nHave a lot of tabs in Safari. After some time of use it makes system allocate a lot of memory and freeze because of it. It becomes absolutely unusable and even system manager can be hardly opened. And it shows a lot of Safari processes and all of them is \"not answering\".\r\nNo matter what applications you close, the only thing that helps is to close Safari. Then everything gets back and works well. Even after Safari is launched again. Some time after it works ok. Then something happened and it makes system hang again.\r\nEven when other applications \"eat\" a lot of memory system doesn't behaviour like in this case.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\nSafari 9.0.3 (11601.4.4)"
