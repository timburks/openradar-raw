        Here’s a little display nit, demonstrated in the attached screen recording:

        1) Open iOS iBooks on iPad.
        2) Open a PDF book that has some margins on the side.
        3) Double-tap on a text paragraph to zoom in.
        4) Click the iPad’s home button to return to the Springboard.
        5) Tap the iBooks icon to return to iBooks.
        6) The display jumps to display the left edge of the PDF page, although the zoom level does not change.

        Expected behavior: no change in display; view is as you last left it.

        This seem to be a generalized multitasking bug, nothing to do with Springboard per se. You can, e.g., switch to another app with a four-finger swipe and then swipe back to see the same effect.

        For a given document, it’s 100% reproducible. Not all documents display the behavior, but most do.
