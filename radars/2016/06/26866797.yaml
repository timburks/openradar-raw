    description: "Summary:\r\nHello, \r\n\r\nI'm the author of the Xcode Plugin Luft(https://github.com/k0nserv/luft). I was excited to implement Luft using the new Xcode Source Editor Extensions, but unfortunately I found that the current API is a bit lacking. \r\n\r\nLuft currently ships with a preferences window that allows the user to change the settings used by Luft. It would be good if Source Editor Extensions provided a way for Extensions to have a pane/area under Xcode preferences for configuration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode provides a way for Source Editor Extensions to be configured with extension specific settings under the Xcode preferences or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot supported\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n8S128d\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8 Beta\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
