    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLSession provides call backs for body data that contains the uncompressed data size. \r\nI would love it for the new NSURLSessionMetrics to provide the compressed data size along with the uncompressed data size.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful as I'm writing a framework for Twitter to help us understand what our customers are experiencing and how they are being impacted by network performance. The new iOS 10 metrics API is great, but it's lacking this key data insight. We need to know the size of the data that our app receives across the wire before CFNetworking decompresses it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNo report steps, enhancement\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to have access to the size of the body data received, both compressed and uncompressed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't have either, unless I keep an accumulator in a NSURLSessionDelegate instance. This only gets me uncompressed size, which for our purposes, is not very useful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 and UP\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS"
