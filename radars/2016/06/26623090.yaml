    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using self sizing table view cells together with UIKit’s default table view cells, they don’t size correctly. They also change their size while scrolling.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the attached sample project\r\n1. Run on iPad\r\n2. Tap on ‘Open Popover’\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe distance from text to separator line should be the same for all cells, top and bottom.\r\nText should be fully visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText is fully visible.\r\nNotice that some lines of text are very close to the separator lines as their size is too small.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt seems that this happens more often when inside a popover and when having an image set, but can also be seen when having a table view without images and first scroll down and then back up. While scrolling up, the scroll view jumps.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also attached a Screencast where the issue can be seen. Note the wrongly positioned text label and also the jumping while scrolling through the table view.
