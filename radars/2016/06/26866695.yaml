    description: "Summary:\r\nI use the GitDiff plugin (https://github.com/johnno1962/GitDiff) to show the Git status of each line in Xcode's gutter. By default, it shows orange for modified code, green for new code, and a small red line for deleted code. Mousing over an orange block or red line shows the previous state of the line or hung in a popup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Work on a long file in Xcode.\r\n2. Jump to the bottom of the file to change something.\r\n3. Desire to jump back to where you were just working.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can scroll quickly, and look for the little tick marks in the gutter to find the code you were working on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no such marks.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be nice to either have this built in, or have Xcode 8 extension points support modifying the gutter, so that someone else could build this extension. It will be a shame to lose the ability to see Git status in the gutter once I switch over to Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot of GitDiff: http://cl.ly/gTpD"
