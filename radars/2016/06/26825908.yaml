    description: "Summary:\r\nThe com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug argument doesn't seem to work at the moment. Using it with older Xcode/iOS version logs SQL statements as they are executed by CoreData.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new project with CoreData or take an existing one\r\n2. Pass -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1 as argument on launch\r\n3. Observe log\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee SQL queries as they are executed from CoreData\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo logs. Using SQLITE_AUTO_TRACE=stderr I could get some results, but SQLDebug is well documented."
