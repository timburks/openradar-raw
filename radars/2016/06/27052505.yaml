    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://27052269\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn modern setups, one can argue that SSDs shouldn't return false data but a lot of apple users attach USB sticks and external hard disks and I myself was rescued from bad data by using zfs'es checksumming to detect a bad USB cable.\r\n\r\nI think therefore that even if only one hard disk is used, users often have backups either via time machine (most likely), manual copy to external drives (might happen) as well as off-site backup (probably not that often). Getting a notice on: \"Hey user, this file here got eaten by the hard disk, do you want to restore the correct version from time machine\" is a great user experience and helps to avoid data deterioration.\r\n\r\nPlease implement checksumming in APFS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.12 Sierra\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
