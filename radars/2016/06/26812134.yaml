    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using Guided Access mode, any alarms that are set do not alert the user.  You can see the alarm icon in the bar and it will simply vanish at the time the alarm is supposed to go off.  When outside of Guided Access, the alarm functions as expected.  This can be reproduced by creating an alarm 1 minute from now, putting the alarm application into Guided Access, and you can see the switch flip from on to off when the alarm should go off, but there is not notification to the user.  This previously worked as expected in iOS 9.0.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1)  Go to Settings -> General -> Accessiblity -> Guided Access\r\n2)  Turn on Guided Access\r\n3)  Click the \"home\" button on the bottom of the iPad\r\n4)  Open the \"Clock\" application\r\n5)  Tap to go to the \"Alarm\" tab (at the bottom of the screen)\r\n6)  Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now.\r\n7)  Click the \"home\" button three times to turn on Guided Access\r\n8)  If first time running Guided Access, tap hardware options and allow sleep/wake button and volume buttons\r\n9)  Start Guided Access\r\n10)  Watch alarm switch next to the alarm you just set, when the time reaches your alarm the switch simply switches off and there is no alarm or popup notification.\r\n11)  Click the \"home\" button three times to turn off Guided Access (entering passcode if required)\r\n12)  Set alarm for 1 minute from now.\r\n13)  Watch for time to reach the time of the alarm and the sound goes off and the popup is presented.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to hear/see the alarm go off when the time(s) selected are entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarm appears to just turn itself off when it reaches the set time.  There is no sound or popup from the iPad when the screen is off or on.  The alarm icon simply disappears from the top bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe've tried turning the volume up in any location on the iPad that has an audio option, but nothing appears to affect this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini (v1)"
