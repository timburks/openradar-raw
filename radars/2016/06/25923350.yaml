    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an APNs provider connects to an APNs server and presents a certificate for the wrong environment (i.e. presents a production certificate in a development environment), the server will report a `BadCertificateEnvironment` in the payload of an HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frame. This is as expected. However, the server will then immediately send a second `GOAWAY` frame with no payload.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to a production APNs server using a valid development certificate.\r\n2. Monitor HTTP/2 traffic over the established connection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe server sends a single HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frame with the following payload: `{\"reason\":\"BadCertificateEnvironment\"}`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe server sends two HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frames. The first frame has the expected payload, and the second frame has no payload.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
