Open, Print, Share are a few that come to mind immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\"Siri, open the OmniPlan document 'Death Star Construction'.\"\r\n\"Siri, share the OmniGraffle document 'Death Star Blueprints' with R2-D2.\"\r\n\"Siri, print the OmniOutliner document 'Millennium Falcon preflight checklist'.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThese requests would lead to messages to the specified apps to do the intended activities. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis domain does not exist yet. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/behrens/status/743241368999337984\r\nJake Behrens\r\nWant more SiriKit domains in the future?
