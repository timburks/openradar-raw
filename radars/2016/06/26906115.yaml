    description: "Summary:\r\nOS X includes built-in disk-level formatting. This is great! But unfortunately AirPort devices such as AirPort Base Station or AirPort Extreme do not allow sharing encrypted disks, according to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202807.\r\n\r\nThis should be changed for a more cohesive and fluid Apple ecosystem experience.\r\n\r\nNote that the Apple community has been asking for this feature since 2012. See this Community discussion: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3677890?tstart=0\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Format a drive with encryption\r\n2. Connect it to AirPort hardware via USB\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDrive is available to network clients (provided that they can provide a password to decrypt the drive, or alternatively, if such a password is provided via AirPort Utility)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDrive is not available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll current versions, e.g., AirPort Extreme Base Station with Firmware 7.7.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCommunity discussion https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3677890?tstart=0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
