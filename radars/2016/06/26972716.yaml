    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nText field with empty placeholder has corrupted text field during first animation.\r\nThe mandatory condition is to call resignFirstResponder or endEditing: right before animation\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up single-view application\r\n2. Add text field and button \"Submit\" to the view\r\n3. Leave text field's text empty and set some text to placeholder \r\n4. Set up layout constraints for text field (the top constraint is necessary)\r\n5. Add outlet to top constraint in view controller\r\n6. In IBAction on button's touchUpInside implement the code {\r\n    self.view.endEditing(false)\r\n    self.topLayoutConstraint.constant += 10;\r\n    UIView.animateWithDuration(3.0) { \r\n        self.view.layoutIfNeeded()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n7. Run the app\r\n8. Enter some text into text field\r\n9. Press \"Submit\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should stay at the same location\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text is animated incorrectly\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 [13F69]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProbably the real input field of text field hasn't time to update real text label of text field that is being animated after resignFirstResponder called.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ios_rdar_bug.mov' and 'rdar_bug.zip' were successfully uploaded."
