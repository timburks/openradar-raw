Go to configure the transition options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll possible options are there and can be checked\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBackward and forward are missing, but the other options are present.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo see any of this in action you have to set the tab view controller as the tab view's delegate which isn't done by default rdar://19732856"
