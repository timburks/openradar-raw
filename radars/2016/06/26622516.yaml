    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a vertically scrolling webpage, I can't use the up and down arrow keys to scroll up and down the page by little bits. Spacebar still works, but the arrow keys don't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page with a lot of vertical space (ex. a wikipedia page)\r\n2. Hit the down arrow key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPage should scroll down slightly (approximately 20px or so)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPage sticks to the top and does not scroll. If you are scrolled down the page a bit already, hitting the arrow keys often takes you right to the top of the page.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCommand-Down also are a bit weird. Sometimes it goes to the bottom of the page, and sometimes it only goes part way."
