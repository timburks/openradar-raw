    description: "Summary:\r\nI've submitted export compliance documentation and added the appropriate identifier to my app's .plist. According to the FAQ here I don't need to do anything special for the French App Store because the app only uses encryption supplied by the OS: https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/apps/faq/Managing%20Your%20Apps_Trade%20Compliance#50572199 (See \"Scenario 1\" in the \"Sample Scenarios\" section.)\r\n\r\nHowever when I try to submit my app, the \"Export Compliance\" screen asks, \"Your binary is associated with the following documentation: Deliveries.pdf. Is this correct?\" Most of the answers are correct except for this one: \"Is your app going to be available on the French App Store? No\"\r\n\r\nThis is not correct. I do plan to make my app available on the French App Store. If I select \"No\", I get an error message: \"If the encryption associated with your documentation is not up to date, submit new documentation and upload a new binary.\"\r\n\r\nIf I try to submit new documentation I am never asked about the French App Store. That makes sense because, according to the FAQ, it's not relevant given my answers to the other questions. However because I have to agree to the answers displayed on the \"Export Compliance\" screen, it is impossible for me to release my app unless I remove it from the French App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Submit an encryption documentation with the following answers:\r\n\r\n- Is your app designed to use cryptography or does it contain or incorporate cryptography? Yes\r\n- Does your app qualify for any of the exemptions provided in Category 5, Part 2 of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations? No\r\n- Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms that are proprietary or yet to be accepted as standard by international standard bodies? No\r\n- Does your app implement one or more encryption algorithms instead of, or in addition to, accessing or using the encryption in iOS and OS X? No\r\n\r\n2. Wait for approval and look up the \"Key Value\" on the Encryption screen of iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\n3. Add that value to the app's Info.plist for the key ITSEncryptionExportComplianceCode.\r\n\r\n4. Build and submit the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Export Compliance\" screen should not display the question about the French App Store because it isn't relevant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Export Compliance\" screen displays \"Is your app going to be available on the French App Store? No\". The only way to submit the app is by removing it from the French App Store. Ignoring this text, even if I know it's not relevant, would be lying about an important legal question. If I start over I will simply get the same results because the irrelevant question about the French App Store is never asked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n4GHz i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, M295X\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
