    description: NSMutableData(length:) allows you to easily and efficiently initialize a buffer to a given length of all zeros. Data() has no similar initializer, requiring callers to initialize with resetBytes, or copying an Array, or using a temporary UInt8 variable with bytes:count. These are less convenient, and may be less efficient than NSMutableData(length:)
