    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 8 removed the ability to load plugins like Alcatraz and Xvim. While the new extension interface is a good step forward, it doesn't provide enough flexibility to implement the great functionalities that such plugins already provide.\r\n\r\nI understand the reasons why this has been done but since the extensions interface is very restrictive, I'm asking for the old plugin architecture to be left available until the extension mechanism becomes more powerful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add Xvim or other plugin to Xcode plugin's folder\r\n2. Open Xcode 8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe plugin loads into Xcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe plugin doesn't load\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
