    description: "Summary:\r\nFor only one text replacement I have set up, when I enter it as part of the address and then a dash, Mobile Safari crashes. This does not happen with other addresses, nor with other text substitutions, nor on the simulator, so it may be a very hard bug to reproduce. For me on my device it is reliable. It may have something to do with the suggestions list as well, considering I have visited pages on that site before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install a text replacement: KP -> Kernel Panic\r\n2. open mobile Safari.\r\n3. type in the address bar: \"http://slawson.org/kp\"\r\nKP changes to \"Kernel Panic\"\r\n4. type a dash.\r\n5. Safari crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsee in the address bar \"http://slawson.org/kp-\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMobile Safari crashes instantly, black screen for a split second, then back to springboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 9.0 on iOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S, iOS 9.3.2 (13F69)"
