    description: "Peter Steinberger22-Jun-2016 10:47 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOften radars are pushed back to us mere mortals, asking us to be verified on the latest version of iOS/macOS. This either happens because nobody looked at them yet, or because the engineers believe this has been fixed and us checking that this is indeed the case is crucial.\r\n\r\nProblem is: We do not see the difference. There's an internal Verify field in Radar but it is not exposed to our radar interface.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/745454264865198080\r\n\r\nOften after a major event like WWDC we get back a large list of issues and such a field would greatly help to prioritise what we need to look on first... also some developers might be more motivated to give feedback if radar is a bit more open and they have hope that something has indeed been fixed.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger frustrating problem that many comments are not visible and the language we get back to from radar is highly generic - more individual messages, even if they are shorter, would go a long way in making the process feel more human2human and would generate better/faster responses from our side. Resulting in a better product and helping Apple as well.\r\n\r\nFurther good points of the conversation:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/alexisgallagher/status/745479319355416576\r\nhttps://twitter.com/gparker/status/745450500712079360\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite a radar\r\nGet it back for review\r\nObserve that it's simply \"Open\" no matter the internal state\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn additional exposed field that shows if there have been significant changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe need to rely on guesswork or subtle language changes (which are inconsistent though) to try to guess if there has been progress.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
