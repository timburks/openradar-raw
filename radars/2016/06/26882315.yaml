    description: "Our app (Zeen) is designed to be primarily a video only calling experience. CallKit is a huge step forward by providing a native call / connection experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current developer release of the sdk, a call once connected is assumed to be audio only until such time as the user decides to use the \"punch out\" button (I think that's the name for it) to go to the relevant app.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a video calling app, it makes more sense to go directly to the app upon connection, and not require the user to manually switch to the app.\r\n\r\nAfter discussions with several CallKit engineers at WWDC (who were immensely helpful, thank you!) it seems that support for this kind of video call is not currently planned, so I'm filing this radar in the hope that we can get this added functionality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Answer an incoming call from a video only app.\r\n2) Once connected, call is audio only inside the Phone app\r\n3) User has to manually \"punch out\" to go to the app and see the full video call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 2) above, as the app is marked as making specifically video calls (not audio), it should launch the app directly, without the need for the user to take this action.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee above - call connects as audio only.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)"
