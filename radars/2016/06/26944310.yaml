    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have iCloud Photo Library enabled with about 30,400 photos. Optimize iPhone Storage is on.\r\n\r\nWhen restoring iOS onto a phone, which I need to do fairly often as a developer, all thumbnails are missing. Even if I leave this for a few days, they don't come through. See IMG_0004.PNG for a screenshot. \r\n\r\nIn this screenshot, you can see a few of them have loaded. The only way I can get it to do this is to zoom in to the Moments level of photos and then scroll through all 30k+ photos. As I scroll by the empty thumbnails, they all show cloud icons and they load fairly quickly from the cloud. See IMG_0006.PNG. You can see the NetworkActivityIndicator going on the status bar. That said, if I scroll too fast, those thumbnails don't load.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enabled iCloud Photo Library, upload a huge library to the cloud.\r\n2. Turn on Optimize iPhone Storage (not sure if this is related, just what I have on)\r\n3. Restore iPhone from iCloud backup\r\n4. Go into Photos and zoom all the way out to years\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEventually, all thumbnails should load. I expect to be able to preview these at any time, drag my finger over the years to see them load, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust empty years as seen in IMG_0004.PNG\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 [13F69]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might not even be a Restore, I think I may have seen this after enabled iCloud Photo Library on my iPad for the first tie.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, on Wifi, iOS 9.3.2"

    title: Photos doesn't load thumbnails from large iCloud Photo Library after a Restore unless I scroll through all of them at the Moments level.
