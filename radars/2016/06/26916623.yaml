    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAlert Controller with password prompt for iTunes or iCloud should look different to standard UIAlertController. While this password prompts can appear randomly why people use their iPhone / iPad.\r\nWhen it appeared on top of some other app I was afraid this is a fishing attack from third party app to steal my Apple ID password.\r\nIf you would have some custom, for example, black alert.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse your iPhone until you get Apple ID password prompt.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen entering Apple ID password I want to be sure this is Apple who asks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPassword alert can be faked by other apps.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
