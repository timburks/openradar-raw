    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://26900741\r\n\r\nPeter Steinberger20-Jun-2016 11:01 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAt PSPDFKit we build an SDK for other developers, so we run into many edge cases and we are filing many radars.\r\n\r\nOften, these radars are closed as duplicates. In the past, this was the end. Now since at least a year, the status of the original radar is open. Problem is, there is no email notification when this changes - so apart from manually checking my 74 closed radars if the duplicate status changed, there's no way for me to be notified. Often we find this out by accident there were many cases where we shipped hacky code for something thas has since been fixed.\r\n\r\nThis hurts both our product, our developers and Apple as a platform itself. Furthermore, sometimes there are very helpful explanations on the original radar that explain why something is the way it is - and apart from the original author sharing this information, there's no way to get it.\r\n\r\nFor example, I only in the labs found out that the duplicate on https://openradar.appspot.com/21290730 is closed for some time now and they also showed me the explanation on why - this would have effected various design decisions to the better if we only would have gotten this feedback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
