        Summary:
        A user ignored/deleted their original invitation email and would like a new one so they can begin testing on TestFlight

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Go to iTunes Connect > Users > External Testers
        Look for resend invitation email (or copy link, etc.)

        Expected Results:
        See an option to resend invitation email

        Actual Results:
        No option to send an email is found.


        Attempt to force an email to send by deleting the user and adding them back shows a warning about sending an email, but no email is sent/arrives. Checked the spam folder to see if it was caught there and no luck. Will update if the invite comes in.
