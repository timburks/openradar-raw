    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter removing @IBDesignable / IB_DESIGNABLE from a view, Xcode does not change the rendering of the view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS application with the \"Single View\" application\r\n2. Create a UIView subclass with some simple drawing code. Add an instance of it to your storyboard.\r\n3. Add @IBDesignable / IB_DESIGNABLE to the view.\r\n4. Watch it render.\r\n5. Remove @IBDesignable / IB_DESIGNABLE\r\n\r\nA trivial example project is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step 5, if \"Automatically Refresh Views\" is enabled, the view in the storyboard should be reset to default (empty) drawing. In any case, this should happen if \"Refresh All Views\" is pressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view keeps drawing with the version of the code before @IBDesignable / IB_DESIGNABLE was removed. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nClosing and reopening the project solves the problem. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
