    description: "Area:\r\nSpringBoard (Home Screen)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen rotating an iPad running iOS 10 dev seed 1 by 180Â°, sometimes there's a gray backing view that rotates in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any app on an iPad running iOS 10 dev seed 1.\r\n2. Rotate the iPad 180 degrees, making sure to do it quickly enough that it doesn't get a 90 degree rotation event. You can do this by tilting it away from you, instead of rotating it left or right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen rotates normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is sometimes a gray view behind the main app's view/window that rotates in the opposite direction. This happens when rotating from Landscape with home button right to landscape with home button left, and when rotating from portrait upside down to portrait.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is reminiscent of a bug on iOS 8 that wasn't fixed until well after the betas: rdar://18054367\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreen recordings of rotation bug: http://cl.ly/gUGE"
