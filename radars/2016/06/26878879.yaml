    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the past, I have a collection of build-related plugins to Xcode. These vary from the frivolous, to the daily essentials.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to create an extension that could be notified about build completions, and then can either:\r\n\r\n - Report back to the host app.\r\n - Present a view controller.\r\n\r\nI'll take my snapshots plugin as an example, https://github.com/orta/snapshots\r\n\r\nIt listens for build completion notifications, then takes out the log file for the build and parses it to find a specific type of message in a test. If those messages are found, then it presents a UI for showing richer metadata than the plaintext log.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it can be reproduced by kqueue/monitoring the `~/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` folder. Or, by polling the running Xcode app instance using the new AppleScript dictionary ( thanks for that, seems comprehensive. )\r\n\r\nThis would present the UI in a completely separate application, which has a few downsides:\r\n\r\n- You have to remember to open the app\r\n- A developer would need to switch application to interact\r\n- Notifications will go through the OS, and have no way to persist inside Xcode as potential annotations\r\n- It wouldn't work with Xcode in full screen"
