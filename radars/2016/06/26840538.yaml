    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a domain for the type of user activities that Reminders supports. Many people use alternate task management/to do list apps, such as OmniFocus. The biggest benefit could come from simply being able to specify an alternate app for \"Remind me to...\" but it'd also be nice to complete a specific action or view a specific list by name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\"Siri, remind me to file a bug report requesting more domains for SiriKit.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOmniFocus can receive this reminder directly. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri can only store this action in Reminders, and OmniFocus has to do clever things to move the action to the user's primary task manager.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10, WWDC developer preview\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/behrens/status/743241368999337984\r\nJake Behrens\r\nWant more SiriKit domains in the future? Please file a bug report letting us know what you'd like to do with it! http://bugreport.apple.com"
