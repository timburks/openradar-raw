    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are many situations where 'fetchLimit' is of great use while using PHFetchOptions. At the same time, it's needed to skip some results while requesting PHAssets from Photos library.\r\n\r\nExample - An app might need to traverse through the Camera Roll looking into 50 photos at a time. Limiting to 50 PHAssets works well with existing 'fetchLimit' property. A 'fetchOffset' would be a great help for skipping a fixed number of PHAssets while requesting a fetch from library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a look at the PHFetchOptions API.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPHFetchOptions should have 'fetchOffset' property in combination to 'fetchLimit' property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPHFetchOptions doesn't have 'fetchOffset' property in combination to 'fetchLimit' property."
