    description: "I have several very compact png files that OSX renders incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a bug in the NSImage or CGImage code that loads these picture files, as it appears in any application that uses these APIs (Preview, Quicklook and in my own apps).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nView the attached \"Preview Click Mask.png\" on 10.10 or 10.11, e.g. in Preview. Note that it shows what I also show in the file \"appearance on 10.10.5.png\", which is a screenshot from Preview.\r\n\r\nNext, view the same file in 10.12 beta. Note that it shows a different image (as seen in appearance on 10.12.png). This is the bug.\r\n\r\nIf I open the image in Preview on 10.10.5, use Preview's \"Adjust Size...\" command to re-create the image using 100%, so that the content does not really change, and then save the changed image, it will display correctly on 10.12 beta. But it's then also larger.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that these problematic images use a special compression mode that 10.12 has stopped supporting, somehow. Or maybe not. I hope you can figure this out quickly.\r\n\r\nThe picture can be downloaded here: http://files.tempel.org/tmp/26893199.zip"
