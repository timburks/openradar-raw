        Summary:
        When presenting SFSafariViewController in a FormSheet on iPad, the whole App hangs when clicking a <select> dropdown element

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Present SFSafariViewController in a FormSheet on the iPad, and navigate to a page containing a <select> dropdown
        * You can checkout this test project which does exactly that: https://github.com/fabb/SFSafariViewControllerFormSheetBug
        * Click the dropdown
        * Instead of showing a Popover for the dropdown options, like UIWebView does when presented in a FormSheet, the options to select from are displayed in the full view area of the FormSheet, even above the Done button and address bar.
        * When clicking one of the options, the FormSheet contents disappear (apart from some table lines), and one is stuck in the whole app, as the FormSheet cannot be dismissed anymore.

        Expected Results:
        The dropdown options should be presented in a Popover, like in a UIWebView.

        Actual Results:
        User gets stuck and needs to force quit the App.

        Regression:
        Does not happen when showing SFSafariViewController FullScreen instead of FormSheet.
