    description: "Summary:\r\nThe private Preferences framework has been very well documented by the community: http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Category:Preferences. It makes setting/form view controllers significantly easier to make, reducing a great amount of boilerplate code, and it could be argued that without it being part of the official iOS SDK it makes these tasks seem harder than they should.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a settings view controller\r\n2. Implement a table view in Interface Builder, or write a data source\r\n3. Implement method of getting/setting preferences\r\n4. Repeat steps for sub-pages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThese steps are not needed. Table views are constructed from a property list containing all data needed for a working UI. View controllers only need to specify their corresponding property list, and custom getter/setter/action methods. Custom views can be implemented easily using a standard protocol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeveloper is frustrated because they must either consume time constructing a table view UI, possibly even manually managing it with a UITableViewDataSource.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
