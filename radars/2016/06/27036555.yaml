    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI installed a TestFlight beta for a new version of an app. Then, I opened the App Store and navigated to the Updated tab. The TestFlight app, which was previously installed via the App Store, shows the most recent version as an available update, even though the TestFlight version number is greaterâ€”the App Store version is 2.5.5, and the TestFlight version is 2.5.6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app via the App Store.\r\n2. Install a newer version of the same app via TestFlight, overwriting the App Store version.\r\n3. Open the App Store app and navigate to the Updates tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app does not appear as having an available update.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app does appear as having an available update.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" (ML0N2LL/A)"
