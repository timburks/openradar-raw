    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UICollectionReusableView contains a UIViewController’s view as its only child the children of the UICollectionView’s view do not animate their resize while their parent view does. To clarify, I created a demo app to showcase a working and failure case. The demo app can be found at: https://github.com/adamyanalunas/SupplimentaryViewAnimation\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add any type object that is or subclasses a UIView to the stock UIView (that I’ll now call parent view) of a UIViewController\r\n2. Add the parent view to a UICollectionReusableView (that I’ll now call the supplementary view)\r\n3. Resize the supplementary view inside of a performBatchUpdates to inherit the animations\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChildren of the parent view have animation times that match their parent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nParent view bounds animate as expected but its children do not; rather, they immediately jump to their destination size.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown how far back this bug reaches.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDemo app to view the working and broken cases can be found here: https://github.com/adamyanalunas/SupplimentaryViewAnimation"
