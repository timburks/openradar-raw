    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is only one existing domain in SiriKit for transportation, and that is limited to Ride Booking. While that is useful for booking rides, there is a bigger crowd of commuters that uses public transports such as trains and buses. There are many applications in many cities that allow users to get bus/train arrival times. It will be useful to have a domain specifically to query for bus/train arrival time. \r\n\r\nINGetRideStatusIntent is the closes intent that can be used for this, but it is not really created for this use case. Siri always refer to the incoming ride as 'Driver', which in the case of public transport is not suitable. It should be 'train' or 'bus', or a specific bus like 'bus 33'.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus"
