    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 10 Apple has introduced the Swift Playground app, and highlighted the new awesome keyboard optimized for writing code, with easy to access common code glyphs with new swipe gesture on the regular keys.\r\n\r\nSadly though, it appears to be a private implementation that it cannot be used by third party developers that are trying to write awesome apps for coding on the iPad.\r\nI understand that it would be unfeasible on an iPhone (or at least on a compact width trait) so it could be an iPad only keyboard type at least for the first release.\r\n\r\nThe best it would be with some kind of UIView subclass to feed as inputAccessoryView that accept feeds of strings from the developer that will mock the easy variable/constant/function names entry available in the Swift Playground app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install the iOS 10 beta on an iPad\r\n- Open the Swift Playground app\r\n- Download an Apple playground from the Featured tab\r\n- Open it\r\n- Bring up the keyboard during the exercise\r\n- See the new coding keyboard\r\n- Try to bring up the same keyboard in a brand new application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new case in UIKeyboardType enumeration (called coding in Swift or UIKeyboardTypeCoding in Obj-C) is available to use for third parties in iOS 10\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only new type of UIKeyboardType is the asciiCapableNumberPad for inserting non localized number inside the app, and for new apps that will allow people to coding or learn new programming languages the developer must be willing to code an entirely new keyboard or relay on custom inputAccessoryView to surface relevant symbols to the user for avoiding the continuous switch between letters and symbols.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 seed 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 64GB cellular\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
