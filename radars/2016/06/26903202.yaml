    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a collection view animation pushes a UICollectionElementKindSectionHeader off of the screen (thus removing it from the cell pool) its last known origin point is lost. A demo for this bug and my workaround can be found here: https://github.com/adamyanalunas/CollectionViewHeaderPlacement/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a collection view that has properly showing headers, cells, and supplementary views increase the size of a supplementary view—via performBatchUpdates animation—to an extent that a header is pushed off screen\r\n2. Reverse the supplementary view resizing so the header can return to screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHeader animates in from last known origin, giving the user the feeling that the screen space is infinite and they have but a partial view\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the collection view animates again in a manner that would allow the header to return to screen it animates in from {0,0} instead of the last known origin, surprising the user and making for a lame experience.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown how far back this bug reaches.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA demo for this bug and my workaround can be found here: https://github.com/adamyanalunas/CollectionViewHeaderPlacement/"
