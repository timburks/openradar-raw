    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen migrating our codebase from Swift 2.2 -> Swift 3.0 we had a few initializer in structs that called other initializers which were replaced with `self.dynamicType.init(...` where we previously just had `self.init(...`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define a Swift struct with multiple initializers\r\n2. Call one initializer from another\r\n3. Migrate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe initializers are left untouched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `self.init(` call is replaced with `self.dynamicType.init(`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThat this behavior is especially strange since `self.dynamicType` doesn't make sense for Swift structs regardless."
