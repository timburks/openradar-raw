        Summary:

        Getting requests for the Better content blocker (https://better.fyi) from people who want to see statistics on how much requests/data they’ve saved by using our content blocker.

        It would be awesome to have an API where we can query this information for our blocker without knowing anything about the browsing history of the person.
