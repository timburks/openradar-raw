    description: "When using VoiceOver, the alt text of `<img>` elements with an SVG src are not read. This includes `<img>` elements inside `<picture>` elements.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With VoiceOver enabled navigate to https://dorigo.co/svg-test/\r\n2. Place finger on first logo — this is an `<img>` inside a `<picture>`. The source used should be the SVG.\r\n3. Place finger on second logo — this is an `<img>` with an SVG as the source.\r\n4. Place finder on third logo — this is an `<img>` with a PNG as the source.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor all of the images, VoiceOver should read the alt and title text, and that the user is touching an image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver plays a “ding” noise when touching the first two images. For the third image, with a PNG source, the alt and title text are read.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue also affects Safari and Safari Technology Preview on macOS."
