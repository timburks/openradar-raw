    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are using an app group shared container to share documents between our applications on a user's device. Currently, there is no way to determine whether an application that was once installed has been deleted by a user. Without this, it is impossible for applications still installed on the device to garbage collect resources that the deleted app may have created in the shared container. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we could register a URL scheme for each of our applications and whitelist those schemes within each application and then use canOpenURL on UIApplication to test whether an app is installed. However, that requires us to update all of our applications every time that we add a new app that participates in the shared container storage mechanism.\r\n\r\nA better solution would be new API that allows developers to query the system to ask what applications from the same developer team are installed on the system."
