    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new class reference format that arrived alongside iOS 10 doesn't allow you to see which class references were recently updated. This was a very useful feature of the old Developer Library page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. View the new API Reference site (https://developer.apple.com/reference/)\r\n2. Look for a way to see which references have been recently updated\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to sort the API reference by recently added or updated content, as in the old developer reference library (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/). See attached screenshot for an example of how this looked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to see which documentation was recently updated.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a new developer library page for iOS 10 (at https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/navigation/) that no longer includes class references (only guides and sample code), so there is no way to see which API documentation was recently updated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated to rdar://26990587 (though that issue is specific to revision history details not being accessible from API reference pages)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-06-23 at 10.43.18 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
