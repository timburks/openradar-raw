    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation states that the localParticipantIdentifier property on MSConversation is stable, provided the extension isn't uninstalled or disabled. This isn't the case (at least on the simulator). Subsequent calls to willBecomeActive yield different results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new messages app\r\n2. Load the new messages app\r\n3. Break in MSMessagesAppViewController's willBecomeActive(with:) and check the value of conversation.localParticipantIdentifier.\r\n4. Dismiss the messages app.\r\n5. Repeat from step 2.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UUIDs should remain constant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey're different.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached a somewhat trivial demo project, and some images of the log.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulatorApp-678.9 CoreSimulator-260.5 \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-06-18 at 14.40.58.png' and 'LocalIdentifier.zip' were successfully uploaded."
