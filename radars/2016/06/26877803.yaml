    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you use an expanded Messages app, the iMessage bar still appears along the bottom of the window. This should be optional.\r\n\r\nOn a smaller phone, once the keyboard is open, there's hardly any room left to work (see picture 2). Vertical space could be somewhat limited (roughly...):\r\n- Double-height status Bar: 40\r\n- Navigation Bar: 66\r\n- iMessage Bar: 46\r\n- Autocomplete bar: 40\r\n- Keyboard: 216\r\n\r\nleaving a total of ~160 for the messages app on an iPhone SE. That's not a whole lot of space.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that it can be helpful to ensure a consistent experience across apps, but I think that allowing text entry within the app itself will become confusing with two text fields on the screen.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that there is some kind of flag that configures whether the iMessage bar should be shown in .expanded mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a messages app.\r\n2. Request the presentation style to be .expanded\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe messages app receives the entire screen, except the navigation bar at the top.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iMessage bar still appears at the bottom.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n2 pictures attached demonstrating the iMessage bar on a smaller phone.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVersion SimulatorApp-678.9 CoreSimulator-260.5\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'picture1.png' and 'picture2.png' were successfully uploaded."
