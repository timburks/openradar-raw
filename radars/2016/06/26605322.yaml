    description: "Andrew Muray02-Jun-2016 11:39 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the playground code shown below, the “==“ operator returns true.  See cases: \r\n\r\n1)  A tuple defined with single element (line 5,6) is treated as the type of the first element.  OK, but the tuple has more information, namely a label for the first element.  As a  tuple, the label name should be checked for equivalency or generate an error in lines 4 and 5.  Also, one would expect that writing code such as “error1.0” or “error1.name” should work, but it doesn’t.\r\n\r\n2)  Same code is applied to tuples with two elements.  Note that the ‘==‘ operator returns true.  But appending to the array an element (which is equivalent) but with a different label causes an error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse playground in Xcode to run the following code.\r\n\r\n// =start============================================\r\n//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play\r\n\r\nimport Foundation\r\n\r\nlet error1 = (name: \"item not allowed\")\r\nlet error2 = (nameextra: \"item not allowed\")\r\n\r\n/////////\r\nprint(error1 == error2)\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nvar arrayOfErrors1 = [error1]\r\narrayOfErrors1.append(error2)\r\nprint(arrayOfErrors1)\r\n\r\n//====================================================//\r\n\r\nlet error3 = (name: \"item not allowed\", code: 1)\r\nlet error4 = (nameextra: \"item not allowed\", code: 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////\r\nprint(error3 == error4)\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nvar arrayOfErrors2 = [error3]\r\narrayOfErrors2.append(error4)\r\nprint(arrayOfErrors2)\r\n\r\n// ==end============================\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like to see the following:\r\n\r\nThe equivalency operator should check equivalency of labels for tuples, AND issue warning for tuples with only one element.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nErrors as result of not enough information during compiling about tuples\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.5\r\nXcode 7.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nUsing swift playground\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'report1.rtfd.zip' was successfully uploaded."
