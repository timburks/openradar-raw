    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen clicking the \"Desktop & Screen Saver\" pref pane in System Preferences under macOS Sierra (16A201w), the grid of available wallpapers flashes continually and System Preferences hangs. It requires a force quit to quit the app.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to change the wallpaper with this issue -- you just have to keep clicking the area where the wallpaper would normally be, and eventually, it will change.\r\n\r\nThe screen saver tab is unaffected by this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open System Preferences in macOS Sierra developer beta 1\r\n2. Click \"Desktop & Screen Saver\"\r\n3. You will immediately experience this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pref pane shouldn't flash, and you should be able to pick the wallpaper as normal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen clicking the \"Desktop & Screen Saver\" pref pane in System Preferences under macOS Sierra (16A201w), the grid of available wallpapers flashes continually and System Preferences hangs. It requires a force quit to quit the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra version 10.12 beta (16A201w)\r\nRunning on an early 2015 retina MacBook Pro 13\".\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt always occurs, so it's not related to a specific configuration."
