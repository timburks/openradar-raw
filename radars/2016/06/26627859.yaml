    description: "While on an iPhone, following any link that points to an App Store app will open it in the App Store. However, if the app isn't made for an iPhone, App Store will show an error message that cannot be resolved by the user, such as \"<Name of app> is only available on iPad\". While the app would indeed not run anyway, this means it cannot be previewed: it's screenshots, information, reviews, and more won't show at all.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly jarring as a web version of all that information does exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. On an iPhone, go to a link that points to an App Store app, such as https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/piktochart/id924299646?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4G4&ct=tw\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Given that the App Store app cannot display useful info on the link, the page should either be shown in the web browser, or the App Store app should embed it.\r\n\r\nActual Results: An error that the user cannot work around is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion: 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S"
