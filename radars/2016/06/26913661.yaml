    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the announcement that ATS will be required from 1 Jan 2017, I implore you to visit how this will affect local networks. Many UPnP/DLNA devices (Sonos, Phillips Hue, WiFi Hard Drives) make insecure network calls on the local network. It is not possible or necessary to retrofit HTTPS/TLS into these existing products.  Therefore the only option is to set `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = true` to disable ATS.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Introduce a key `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsLocalNetworkOnly`. When this key is set to true, it allows unencrypted http communication between devices on the same local network (IPv4 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 and IPv6 fd00::/8, and 127.0.0.1 for development purposes).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse any UPnP/DLNA application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFunctionality should work as expected, while still allowing ATS to be used for external calls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nATS must be disabled to make the insecure local calls.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.2 (13F69\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device"
