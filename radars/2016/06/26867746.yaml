    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the iWork apps on iOS, in the list of documents, you can long press on a document as a shortcut to jump into selection mode and select that document. Swift Playgrounds should support this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Playgrounds.app.\r\n2. Make at least one Playground, and switch back to the Playgrounds view.\r\n3. Press and hold on a playground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should be the equivalent of tapping the Edit button, then tapping on a playground: the app should switch to Edit mode, and the playground should be selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens, other than the cell getting a press highlight.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n iOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad mini 2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
