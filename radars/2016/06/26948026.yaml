    description: "I have a project that has several build scripts (build phases) that include a emoji unicode char in the name.\r\n\r\nI use a library to programmatically edit the pbxproj file. This library succesfully writes any new contents to the pbxproj in XML format. The emoji are displayed correctly as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, at some point Xcode will read the XML and convert it to another format (looks like JSON). The unicode characters then become corrupted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create Xcode project\r\n2. Add run script phase through 'build phases' tab of a target\r\n3. Give it a title that contains an emoji (e.g. \U0001F4E6 Check Pods Manifest.lock)\r\n4. convert the pbpxproj file to XML (e.g. plutil -convert xml1 -o project.pbxproj project.pbxproj)\r\n5. In the XML confirm that the emoji are still presented correctly.  (refer to the screenshot attached with name '1')\r\n5. If the Xcode project is opened in Xcode then the conversion to the other format happens automatically.\r\nIf the project is not opened in Xcode, first trigger a change to the project (e.g. an extra space in a build script) to let it convert the file back to the other format\r\n6. Inspect the build phases for the project, the run script emoji in the name is now corrupted. (refer to the screenshot attached with name '2')\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode respecting the unicode emoji during conversion\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnicode emoji encoding is corrupted\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X version 10.11.4"
