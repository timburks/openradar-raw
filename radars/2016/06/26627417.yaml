    description: "I apologize for the vagueness of this report; it’s really a request for instructions on how best to document this in an actionable way.\n\nSince installing the most recent OS X beta, I’ve had sporadic problems with the Magic Trackpad. When the problem occurs, pointer motion is both sluggish and jerky, as if there were some kind of interrupt-handling problem at the hardware layer, or the event stream from the trackpad was being buffered somewhere. \n\nThere seems to be a grace period of several hours after booting during which the problem never happens. When it’s not happening, trackpad behavior is completely normal. Once it starts, it can resolve and return to normal behavior on its own, but the duration is indeterminate. It can last from a few minutes to at least half an hour, which is about as long as I’ve been able to stand it without rebooting.\n\nI generally go through this cycle three or four times a day.\n\nThere seems to be no correlation between the trackpad issue and disk or CPU activity. The system can be completely quiescent and still show the problem. Trackpad batteries are fresh.\n\nIs there some additional logging I could do to shed some light on this?"
