    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing the photo for a contact, after confirming the 'Move and Scale' dialouge, using either the \"Use\" or \"Choose\" button, the photo shifts from the position and scale selected. When tapping \"Done\" on the contact editing page, the contact photo shown is significantly scaled out from what the user selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open \"Contacts\".\r\n2. Choose a contact.\r\n3. Tap \"Edit\" in the top right.\r\n4. Tap \"Edit\" under the contacts photo, or if no photo is assigned, tap 'add photo'.\r\n5. Tap \"Choose Photo\" and pick a photo.\r\n6. Scale and position this photo, then tap either \"Use\" or \"Choose\"\r\n7. Notice that immediately the photo's crop has shifted.\r\n8. Tap \"Done\", top right.\r\n9. Notice the image has shifted again, this time with a noticeable scale change.\r\n10. Tap \"Edit\" again, and the photo does not shift.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe photo should be cropped as the user chose.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo changes from what the user chose.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere seems to be a number of UI issues with this process, including the dual \"Use\" and \"Choose\" options when cropping the photo.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 12.9\" 128GB Wifi"
