    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring pairing on iOS 10, a service can be marked as \"Show in Favorites\", showing that accessory in the new Control Center for HomeKit, and also showing it more prominently in the Home app. Allowing third party HomeKit apps to also show these accessories first would improve overall consistency in the HomeKit ecosystem. My proposed name for that property is \"isFavorite\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pair a HomeKit Accessory\r\n2. Check the \"Show in Favorites\" checkbox for at least one service\r\n3. Switch to code\r\n4. Retrieve the HMService instance corresponding to that service\r\n5. Try to access the .isFavorite property\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe property returns either true or false\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe property does not exist\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone OS 10.0 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone8,2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
