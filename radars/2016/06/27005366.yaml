    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have observed that HealthKit will occasionally log an active energy sample with a start and end time covering the timespan of when the watch is off and charging.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I charge the Watch from 9:00 AM to 9:30AM, and re-wear the Watch at 9:32 AM if the Watch doesn't get a chance to write out an Active Energy sample at 9:00 AM, it writes out a sample where the start is 9:00 AM and the end is 9:32 AM.\r\n\r\nThis causes our app to assume the user was wearing the watch for this time."
