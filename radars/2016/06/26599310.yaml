    description: The CFNetworking cache thread sometimes crashes when an item is being added to the cache. It appears that shortly after a SSL handshake or during, there is some sort of memory issue that causes the com.apple.CFNetwork.addPersistCacheToStorageDaemon thread to crash while constructing a NSXPCConnection. This rate of this crash may be increased if a custom NSURLProtocol is being used to handle mutual TLS. I believe that there is a race condition when items are being added to the cache either when the cache is being emptied or when items are moving from memory to disk (or vice versa).
