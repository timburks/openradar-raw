    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be extremely useful, if it was possible to localize Swift Playgrounds without duplicating all the things!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create English Swift Playground .\r\n2. Localize it to German without having duplicate code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to localize the playgrounds either via NSLocalizedString or maybe good old .po file since most text is written in markdown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA lot of duplicate code happens and maintainability plummets."
