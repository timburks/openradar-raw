    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new hard requirement in Xcode 8 presents problems for developers using manual code signing, and to open source teams.\r\n\r\nThis is a nuisance to developers who have fine-tuned their code signing process such that signing is configured to work as expected by way of build settings defined elsewhere: for example, in a centralized Xcode configuration file that imparts the signing information to all projects in an organization.\r\n\r\nThe problem is worse for open source projects, where a project is expected to be checked out and built by a variety of differing organizations. In this case, the organization checking out and building the project will have to somehow automate the insertion of a valid team name in the project after every check out or update.\r\n\r\nThe DevelopmentTeam and DevelopmentTeamName values are stored in the Xcode project file, so they can't be defined in Xcode configuration files the way so many other settings that affect build behaviors can.\r\n\r\nXcode needs some mechanism for providing these values without manually, permanently altering the affected project files. I would welcome either a mechanism for specifying the values in the Xcode configuration file specified for the project, or a wildcard type value that can be selected to indicate the \"default team\" should be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta (8S128d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
