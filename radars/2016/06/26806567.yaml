    description: "Summary:\r\nIf your app includes a third-party framework, iOS 10 requires that it is code signed. But code signing modifies the third-party framework's project file with your signing identity, which is problematic for keeping dependencies up-to-date. Developers can't reasonably push their identities to the source repo, and keeping the change on a downstream branch will lead to merge challenges as the upstream project changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the attached project and open it in Xcode 8\r\n2. Select the \"Framework Dependency Test\" target\r\n3. Select a Team under Signing in the General tab\r\n4. Archive the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe archive should appear in Organizer\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe error \"Signing for MagicalRecord for iOS requires a development team. Select a development team in the Target Editor.\r\nCode signing is required for product type 'Framework' in SDK 'iOS 10.0'\" appears in the Check Dependencies phase.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8, iOS 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt can be fixed by selecting a signing identity on the Magical Record subproject, but that modifies the subproject's project file. It would be much more manageable if the signing identity for the app applied to its dependent frameworks as well. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Framework Dependency Test.zip' was successfully uploaded."
