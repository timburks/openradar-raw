    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 10 brings two new extensions for interacting with push notifications.  The notification service extension is given a limited time to run and transform an incoming notification. If it fails to act within the allotted time no transformation will be completed.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to test these notifications is to fire a local notification from within your app. Testing this way doesnâ€™t provide an accurate method for testing a real experience in the simulator or on device. With a time constraint using a local notification means that the app is already in cache and the extension will load faster than with a cold cache. Without the ability to test a cold cache it could be difficult to optimize the extension to perform its action in the appropriate time.\r\n\r\nThis could be easily alleviated with including a tool in Xcode that would trigger a fake APNS action within an attached device or simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
