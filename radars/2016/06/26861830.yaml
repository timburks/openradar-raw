    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Swift Playgrounds app in iOS 10 uses a special coding keyboard on 9.7“ iPads. I’ve attached a screenshot. Please make this coding keyboard available to third party developers through the iOS SDK.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could add a new UIKeyboardType enum value to return from the keyboardType method of UITextInputTraits. \r\n\r\nThere are many code editor apps like my own app Textastic whose users could benefit from such a keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEdit a text file in a third party code editor app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe users expects to be able to use the same coding keyboard as in the Swift Playgrounds app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the default keyboard is shown."
