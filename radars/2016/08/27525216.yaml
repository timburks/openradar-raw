    description: "Beta 4 was out today, just tested, BLE background advertising still not working, the OS permission dialog would pop up, but after brought the peripheral app to background, the scanner which explicitly scanned for it cannot find it anymore, using LightBlue can see this device, but with \"No services\" label under the \"Unnamed\" device name label.\r\n\r\nUsing BLE tool \"Light Blue\": https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue-explorer-bluetooth/id557428110?mt=8\r\n, I could see the advertising completely shut off after about 3 minutes in black screen mode, if I unlocked the screen, Light Blue can discover the peripheral again, but still with label: \"No Services\"."
