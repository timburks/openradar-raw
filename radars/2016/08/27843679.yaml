    description: "Peter Steinberger15-Aug-2016 10:10 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere are certain essential and useful data structures inside QuartzCore that make it very hard to port things to watchOS, like CATransform3D.\r\n\r\nSince watchOS has SpriteKit and SceneKit, it seems quite logical that it would also include frameworks for lower intrinsics.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
