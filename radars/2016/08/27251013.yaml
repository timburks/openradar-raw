    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsually when driving I like to listen to my recently added music, but there is no easy way to make this part of my up next list. Once an album ends I have to go back and manually go to the next track. I can also use siri for this, but with others in the car this can become a hassle. My proposed solution would add the Play Next button next to the shuffle button in the album view. This tableviewcell does not currently act as the shuffle button, and requires a user to tap on the shuffle button directly to initiate that action. With that in mind, additional buttons should be an easy selection process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Tap on Music > Library\r\n3. Go to Recently Added\r\n4. Tap any album and play a song\r\n5. Tap Back\r\n6. Tap Back again\r\n7. Tap a different recently added album\r\n8. Observe no button to add this to up next\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhile music is playing, tapping another album in Apple Music would show the album list of song with a Play Next button next to the song list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri is the only way to add music to the play next list\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5297c)"
