    description: "Using Xcode8  Beta 4...\r\n\r\nIn Sierra Sticker Pack applications usually get stuck Compiling Asset Catalog. Seems to happen with packs over 10 stickers, though have seen it stall forever with fewer. On occasion, restarting and building will fix the issue but guessing only 5% of the time, and only when there's under 10 or so Stickers. \r\n\r\nOn El Capitan, the Sticker Apps won't build at all and will Exit with Code 255. Red error. \r\n\r\nEverything was working fine in Betas 1, 2, 3."
