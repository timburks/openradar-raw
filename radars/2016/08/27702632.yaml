    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting in 10.12db4 16A270f, the omnibox in Chrome (its URL bar) often flickers when text is entered. I have reproduced this in the Chrome beta 53.0.2785.34 (targeted to be stable when 10.12 is released) and canary (trunk) 54.0.2817.0.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION. This works correctly (no flickering) in 10.11.6 and previous OS releases. It also worked correctly (no flickering) in 10.12db3 16A254g and previous developer and public betas of 10.12.\r\n\r\nThe attached video demonstrates the problem. We have this on file at https://crbug.com/634318.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Chrome. The beta, 53.0.2785.34 or later, should be sufficient. https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/beta.html\r\n\r\n2. Open Chrome.\r\n\r\n3. Stick the insertion point somewhere in the omnibox, in the middle of a URL, and start typing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should be inserted at the insertion point smoothly with no flickering.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOften, all of the text in the omnibox flickers as new characters are entered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12db4 16A270f\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis bug (flickering) occurs in 10.12db4 16A270f. It does not occur in 10.12db3 16A254g or 10.11.6 15G31.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://crbug.com/634318#c1"
