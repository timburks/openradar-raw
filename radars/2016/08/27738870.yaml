    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Photos app keeps nagging a user to enable \"Optimize storage\", probably because it's calculated using a percentage of free space rather than a fixed amount of GBs.\r\nThis results in a dialog each and every time the app is opened on a 128GB device with 11GBs free, even though this is the same amount that's free on a 16GB device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a 128GB device.\r\n2. Fill it up with music/apps/whatever till it reaches 11GBs of free space.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither a way to dismiss the dialog and never have it show again, or no dialog at all since the user has 11GBs free.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA dialog each time the Photos app is launched.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 [14A5322e]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also affects iOS 9, so is not an iOS 10 specific issue, however it's bad UX in my opinion, since pressing optimize storage by mistake could cost the user a lot of data usage if they need to download their photo library again later on.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 128GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
