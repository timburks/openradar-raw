    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently the macOS installer only allows for some command line usage in which one can kickstart an OS upgrade. However there is no method to add additional packages during the OS upgrade method. The ability to add additional packages is valuable in enterprise environments where you would want certain actions to take place for system configuration purposes immediately following an upgrade.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download macOS 10.12 installer.\r\n2. Use command line startosinstall tool to kickstart macOS 10.12 upgrade.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect a method that would allow for additional packages to be added to be installed immediately after OS upgrade environment has finished installing the new OS. This comes in handy for situations where you want certain management tools to run immediately after an upgrade in order collect information on the computer or you want to run other configuration tasks. For example, if your computer is now upgraded, the new OS will have new software available to it or perhaps new settings need to be configured immediately on firstboot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to add packages to the OS upgrade process using the macOS 10.12 installer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12 (all builds)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn this discussion: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/143809 it was suggested to make use of a NetInstall set using System Image Utility. However, this would rely on netbooting which is increasingly more difficult to automate now due to SIP. createOSXinstallPkg used to be able to do this, but unfortunately due to SIP and special entitlements that only Apple has, it is no longer possible to use add additional packages during an OS upgrade. https://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be two improvements implemented with this enhancement request: 1) a method to add additional packages via the startosinstall command line tool and 2) a method to create a OS upgrade package that would contain additional packages for post-upgrade install.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs with all macOS 10.12 installers regardless of hardware.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
