    description: "Currently the only way to retrieve an MSMessage is by having the user select one explicitly. This becomes a program when starting a collaborative process. \r\n\r\nIn this scenario, User B does not have the Message App Extension open:\r\nUser A sends an MSMessage to User B to start a game.\r\nUser B goes into the conversation, but there is no way to retrieve that message programmatically without first tapping the message. At this point, there is no way to tell there is an open game session.\r\n\r\nUser B will be free to send a brand new game session to User A. \r\nAt this point, the most I can do is know User A has an open game session pending and User B has an open game session pending. \r\n\r\nRequiring users to tap on the message (in this case, the message image itself works perfectly fine to display info and doesn't necessarily have to be tapped) shouldn't be required.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend an MSMessage to User B, with a URL, when User B does not have the message app extension open.\r\n\r\nHave User B's message app extension attempt to retrieve the MSMessage from the first user without selecting the MSMessage\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser B opened the app and the message app extension can programmatically retrieve the last sent MSMessage, for example:\r\nactiveConversation.lastMessage\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such lastMessage property exists"
