    description: "Summary:\r\nI am experiencing a bug that causes an endless spinning / spinner hang at restart or shut down if I have EVER connected to another Mac via SMB (cmd+K, smb://foo/bar) during that session\r\n\r\n▪︎ The critical difference seems to be SMB3.0 -- SMB2 or CIFS mounts do not trigger the bug\r\n\r\n▪︎ If you simply CONNECT but do not actually attach to any shares, the bug will not manifest\r\n\r\n▪︎ Disconnecting the share before restarting does NOT fix the problem\r\n\r\n▪︎ Starting up in SAFE MODE (holding shift) does NOT avoid the problem\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect from Mac1 (running ElCap 10.11.x) to Mac2 (also running ElCap 10.11.x) via smb://mac2/share\r\n\r\n2. Authenticate as a user on Mac2 that has permissions to the \"root\" of the hard drive\r\n\r\n3. Mount the root hard drive\r\n\r\n4. Browse to the /Applications folder of Mac2 (from the Mac1 client). The Finder will \"spin\" for a while while all of these files are enumerated. Wait for the list of app icons to appear.\r\n\r\n5. Try to restart Mac1\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac should restart cleanly\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen turns black with a white \"spinner\" in the middle, which will stay there until the end of time. I have left it there for 8+ hours (overnight) and it never stops. The only way out at this point it to hold down the power button until the Mac shuts off.  This can potentially corrupt the filesystem. NEW in 10.12.x: Sometimes the \"spinner\" does not appear and you are simply left on a black screen forever (hang).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested & reproduced with OS X 10.11.1, 10.11.2, 10.11.3, 10.11.4, 10.11.5, 10.11.6, 10.12, and 10.12.1\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached some packet captures that were taken during this hang event as requested by Apple Support on the previous ticket #23684301\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have other SMB3.0 servers (Synology NAS, Windows 2012 server) and connecting to those does NOT cause the bug to trigger. It only seems to happen when connecting to another MAC.  I even reproduced this in a Parallels Virtual Machine -- 100% CLEAN INSTALL of 10.11.6 not a single thing done to it."
