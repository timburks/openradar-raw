    description: We want to disable 3rd party keyboards for specific text fields, even when those are normal textfields. So What we did was returning NO in the - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application shouldAllowExtensionPointIdentifier:(NSString *)extensionPointIdentifier  method of the ApplicationDelegate. I set a breakpoint, the method gets called, NO gets returned but the 3rd party keyboard is available anyway.
