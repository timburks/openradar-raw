    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a UITableView with a colored background, changing the background color of the focused cell results on thin border lines appearing on top and bottom. This effect isn't always visible, since it only happens with some color combination (the attached project has one with default colors that shows this issue).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the sampe app and you'll see this border on the focused cell. If you move the finger over the trackpad it is more visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that this thin border doesn't appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA thin border appears at the top and bottom of the cell.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.2 (13Y227)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 4th gen with tvOS 9.2 and 9.2 simulator."
