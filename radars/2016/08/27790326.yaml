        Summary:
        The iPad allows to run iPhone-only apps, but only in a fullscreen manner. Since iOS 9, the iPad supports SlideOver as well as Split View, but iPhone-only apps are not allowed to run in either of these modes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. open an app that supports Split View, e.g. Safari
        2. slide from the right edge of the screen to open the Slide Over app chooser

        Expected Results:
        iPhone-only apps show up in the list of apps to choose.

        Actual Results:
        It’s not possible to select an iPhone-only app.

        Regression:
        Since iOS 9.0

        Notes:
        Since iPhone-only apps don’t adapt to changing screen sizes, they could be limited to their 320x480 size within the panel
