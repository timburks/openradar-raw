    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a vehicle has an OEM Icon Visible for CarPlay, it appears as an App on the home screen. We are getting requests from people that use Siri to launch applications that they find it frustrating that they cannot return to SYNC (accessory UI) via Siri command. \r\n\r\nTherefore, when making a Siri request to \"Open {oemIconLabel}\", Siri should cause CarPlay to either unborrow/untake the screen of the vehicle, or probably more appropriately launch oem:back url\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch CarPlay with OEMIconVisible set to true and oemIconLabel set to some string (ex. \"SYNC\")\r\n2. Open Siri session and say \"Open SYNC\"\r\n3. Observe\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCarPlay UI unborrows/returns to accessory UI\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri responds \"I don't see any app named {oemIconLabel}\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E5231a)"
