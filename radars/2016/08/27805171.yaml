        Summary:

        Web Inspector doesn’t show the `touch-action` setting properly

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Set a `touch-action: manipulation` rule on an element, and view Styles: Computed tab (Show all: yes)
        Expected: shows “touch-action: manipulation”
        Actual: No `touch-action` rule listed

        2. Set a `touch-action: manipulation` rule on an element’s ancestor of an element. View element’s rules
        Expected: shows “touch-action: manipulation” in the inheritance chain
        Actual: either doesn’t show the `touch-action` parameter, or shows it as overridden

        See attached screenshots.
