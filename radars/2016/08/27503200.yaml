    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSiri makes users respond in full text when sometimes a simple emoji would suffice. What’s worse is if Siri mistakes certain words you will end up taking more effort to fix things (I promise I don't grab the phone to type!). watchOS already has a pretty good system for recognizing responses and prediction is getting even better in iOS 10 and watchOS 3 with things like NSUserActivity. I would suggest having some default emoji responses and then also having some more contextual ones as well. That way you when you’re on your way home and your significant other asks “sushi or tacos for dinner?” you can just tap \U0001F363 or \U0001F32E in a view such as I have attached in the screenshot. This interface design proposal would work across touch interfaces and knob interfaces.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Receive iMessage and Tap to Listen on CarPlay screen\r\n3. Upon message ending Siri asks \"Would you like to reply?\". Say \"yes\"\r\n4. Siri says \"What would you like to say?\"\r\n5. On this view present emoji as potential options.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmoji to be sent or available as responses to messages\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way to describe or send emoji in CarPlay\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 3 (14A5309d)"
