    description: "Other area\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niPhone 6s does not provide haptic feedback when launching Siri\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hold the Home Button to launch Siri\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device should produce two small haptic vibrations in the same way that it does when Siri input stops\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device makes no vibrations when Siri launches / begins listening, but does give feedback when Siri stops listening.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was the behavior in previous versions of iOS and watchOS. Whether it was removed intentionally isn't clear, but I believe it should be restored."
