    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a real 42mm device, WKInterfaceDevice.current().preferredContentSizeCategory is reporting the size category as Small, while on the simulator, it's reporting Large.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample app is attached. Run it in Xcode 8, Beta 6 (8S201h), on a 42 mm Simulator device. You'll see the same screen as Simulator-42mm.png. That indicates the preferredContentSizeCategory is Large, as well as the correct screen size. Run it on a 42 mm physical device, and you'll see the same screen as RealDevice-42mm.jpg. This indicates the preferredContentSizeCategory is incorrectly reported as Small. And that we can see from the screen size that it really is the Large device.\r\n\r\nAttached Simulator-38mm.png for good measure. I don't have a real 38 mm device to test with however, so not sure if that has a similar issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWKInterfaceDevice.current().preferredContentSizeCategory should return \"UICTContentSizeCategoryL\" on a 42 mm physical device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWKInterfaceDevice.current().preferredContentSizeCategory returns \"UICTContentSizeCategoryS\" on a 42 mm physical device.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10030638/Radar-27863302.zip"
