    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode displays a warning when a project file is changed by an outside interaction. However, it uses two different dialog boxes for this warning. The dialog boxes have different copy, and they switch the default action. One box's default action is to revert the file to Xcode's internal state, and the other one reloads the file from disk. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an Xcode project\r\n2. Change the project file â€“ this most often happens when I use version control to switch to a different commit\r\n3. Observe one of the two dialogs. I'm not sure what influences which you see.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be only one dialog warning about external file changes, and it should probably default to \"read from disk.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get one of two dialogs, with the default actions reversed."
