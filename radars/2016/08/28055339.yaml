    description: "Summary:\r\nOn an iOS 10 developer beta device when iMessages is disabled, iMessages still appears in the sharing list. This is contrary on how it behaves in iOS 9, which it doesn't appear in the list at all. Then in iOS 10 if you select multiple videos to share (through photos for example) only 1 video is attached to the message when you share to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have iOS 10 device\r\n2. disable iMessages in Settings\r\n3. Open an app that has photo sharing (example photos)\r\n4. Select multiple videos to share \r\n5. select share\r\n6. Select iMessages\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niMessages would either not show in the iOS 10 share list if it is disabled, or it would correctly attach all videos that were selected. Preferable you'd still be able to share over cellular and iMessages would appear but you'd get the correct number of items selected. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niMessages appeared in the share menu in iOS 10 despite it being disabled. Then, despite selecting 2 videos to share I only got 1 video attached to the message."
