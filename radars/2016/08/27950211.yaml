    description: If the app is running in the foreground and an animations begins while the app is active, and then the user drops their wrist while the animation is still in progress, there’s a very noticeable lag in updating the UI the next time the app becomes active. I’m not sure if there’s a better solution here but I would expect the system to allow the animation to complete in the background and allow the UI to enter the state it will be in when the animation is done before freezing it.
