        Summary:
        When using the new Core Data Code Generation, it is possible to specify a “transformable” attribute with a custom class. However, because it is limited to Objective-C classes, you cannot specify a custom enum type, which is especially annoying when using the generated code from Swift.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Add a transformable attribute to a Core Data entity

        Expected Results:
        There is an option to specify the type of the transformable attribute.

        Actual Results:
        There’s only an option to specify the _class_ of the transformable attribute, not any type.

        Regression:
        n/a

        Notes:
        There is no clean workaround for this issue. You could name the attribute in the model editor something different, and then declare a “public” accessor that is typed as an enum, but then both the public accessor and the generated “private” attribute are accessible. You can technically put any type you want in the “Custom Class” box, but unfortunately due to a previous bug I reported (rdar://27512940), it is always marked as a Swift optional, and Objective-C doesn’t support optional value types so it won’t compile.
