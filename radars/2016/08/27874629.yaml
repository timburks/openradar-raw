    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen modally presenting a UIViewController with the modalPresentationStyle set to UIModalPresentationCustom and the transitioningDelegate returns a custom UIPresentationController subclass. The preferredStatusBarStyle value will not be read from the view controller being presented resulting in no change to the status bar's style.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project where the defect is reproducible.\r\n\r\nI've replicated this issue on both the iOS simulator and physical devices and it also effects binaries compiled against the iOS 9 SDK that are run on an iOS 10 device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached Xcode project.\r\n2. Open the project in Xcode 8.\r\n3. Build and run on an iOS 10 simulator (I used iPhone SE).\r\n4. Tap the \"Present with custom transition\"\r\n5. Observer that the status bar remains dark after presenting the secondary view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSecondViewController will present with a light status bar just like it does when tapping \"Present as regular modal\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSecondViewController will not adjust it's status bar style from it's presenting view controller's style.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that running the same code (compiled against the iOS 10 SDK or earlier) on an iOS 9 device or simulator, this will work as expected. This seems to be a bug within iOS 10 so i'm not sure if i've categorised it correctly or not. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator (iOS 10)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StatusBar.zip' was successfully uploaded."
