        Summary:
        If I import a public key before importing a private key, /usr/bin/security tells me that the private key import succeeds, but when I run `security find-identity`, it doesn't show my private key in the identities list. However, if I import the private key without the public key existing, then everything works normally.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Run the following script:
        ```
        security add-certificate foo.cer
        security import foo.pem -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security
        security find-identity
        ```

        Expected Results:
        The identity from foo.pem should be printed

        Actual Results:
        The identity from foo.pem is not printed.

        Notes:
        Workaround: delete the public key before trying to import a private key
