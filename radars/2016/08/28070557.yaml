    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you present another view controller outside of the initial MessageViewController hierarchy (eg by modal segue), the layout anchors are wrong and it leads to content getting cut off or not scrolling properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new message app\r\n2. Present the standard UIImagePickerController modally in viewDidLoad\r\n3. Expand the message app window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIImagePickerController is correctly displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe top is cut off because it does not have the correct layout anchors\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 6: 14A5339a, iOS 10 Beta 8: 14A5346A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have attached a demo project which always reproduces the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator 14A5339a, iPhone 6S Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MSScrollBug.zip', 'Simulator Screen Shot Aug 29, 2016, 1.39.17 PM.png' and 'Simulator Screen Shot Aug 29, 2016, 1.39.15 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
