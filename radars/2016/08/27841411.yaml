    description: "Summary:\r\nUnfortunately I didn't have SceenFlow running, and while saving a document Xcode crashed and vanished.  I forget exactly what else I was doing.\r\n\r\nAttached are the \"problem details\" from the crash dialog.  I've tagged it with this radar if that's useful.\r\n\r\nAttached is the actual crash log.\r\n\r\nAttached are console log lines (filtered for 'Xcode') around the time it happend.\r\n\r\nAttached is a hardware profiler report of my machine.\r\n\r\nA bit of my workflow, which is out of the ordinary for most sane people:\r\n\r\nThe file in question is redonkously large, close to 10K lines of code, 325K in size.   It's one battle I haven't taken up yet with my partner on this project. [redacted]\r\n\r\nI do most of my Objective-C editing in emacs because it's really fast, and doesn't have Xcode's flakiness (c.f. rdar://27758069 rdar://27776466 rdar://27631844 rdar://27630423 rdar://27479238\r\nrdar://27480844 rdar://27384118 rdar://27268734 rdar://27268928 rdar://27163268 rdar://27141386 rdar://27143385) .  I occasionally edit in Xcode (and reload in emacs) when fixing simple syntax errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nsee attached system profiler log\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Xcode_2016-08-14-195328_pheasantbook.crash', 'problem-details.txt', 'xcode-messages.log' and 'MacBook Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded."
