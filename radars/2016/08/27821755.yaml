        Summary:

        Mac WebViews containing scroll views (i.e. <div>s with a `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` rule) don’t bounce (“overscroll”) after reaching the end of scroll (when swiping on a trackpad/Magic Mouse).

        WKWebViews have this feature, but WKWebView’s limitations make it inappropriate for some uses

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a page with <div>s with a `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` rule
        2. Open in a WebView

        Expected Results:
        1. When scrolling on an Apple trackpad, the scroll view bounces after reaching the end

        Actual Results:
        1. It doesn’t.
