    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dropping an image from Photos into a folder, it writes a re-encoded jpeg. This is unnecessary when the image has not been edited, and causes a severe loss of quality when the original image was a raw.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Import raw images into Photos. Do not edit them.\r\n2. Drag and drop an image into a folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRaw image instantly appears in the folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA temporary file appears, and after a delay it becomes a .jpg image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPartly related to 27815650.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
