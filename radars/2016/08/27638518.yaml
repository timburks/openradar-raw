    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is code provided in doc of SKProduct:\r\n\r\nNSNumberFormatter *numberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];\r\n[numberFormatter setFormatterBehavior:NSNumberFormatterBehavior10_4];\r\n[numberFormatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];\r\n[numberFormatter setLocale:product.priceLocale];\r\nNSString *formattedString = [numberFormatter stringFromNumber:product.price];\r\n\r\nHowever, the output does not match the price in App Store. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the current user’s App Store is China App Store, the prices in his App Store are all in the format of “¥50”, no matter what’s his system language or region is set to. I think it is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the price formatted with SKProduct.priceLocale(as in the code above) is “CN¥50” if the product is from China App Store when the system region is set to US. So it seems the SKProduct.priceLocale is not really locale of the App Store but a mixture of App Store region and system region, which I think is not the correct behavior because it is inconsistent with what users see and pay in the App Store."
