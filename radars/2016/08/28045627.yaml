    description: "Summary:\r\nFor almost any object, the xcode 8 beta 6 console will show objects such as constraints as <private> making it near impossible to know which constraints are breaking. For example \r\n\r\n[Layout] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints : <private>  Will attempt to recover by breaking constraints : <private>\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a bug, or one more hoop we need to jump to get the debugger configured properly. These used to show up in xcode7\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\nmacOS Sierra Version 10.12 Beta (16A304a)"
