    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached screen shot. Project also attached.\r\n\r\nI set a breakpoint as shown. Ran the program.  Did a quicklook at the data to see how the bytes looked for my packed 4-byte structure.\r\n\r\nThe quicklook display defaults to 11 bytes per row.\r\n\r\neleven.  A prime number.  I don't see how that's a useful default.\r\n\r\nA more useful value would be something even, so I could see the repeating patterns in the data.  A power of two would be great.  Most hexdump utilities (c.f. man hexdump -C) use a stride of 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nBut eleven?  I can't.. even... uh...\r\n\r\n(I use all black for my syntax coloring due to my vision correction. SourceKit has not crashed)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just make data in eleven-multiples, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MandelSwift.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2016-08-09 at 8.57.56 PM.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was going to say \"it was ok in prior versions\", but I found a screen shot from some of our training materials that has a _thirteen_ byte stride.  (attached)\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of an even / power of two number is for easier mental calculations between interesting islands of bytes. \"oh, this is four rows different, therefore it's 64 bytes away\" because we marinate in powers of two all the time.  Now we have to count the number of bytes across (say 13), and four rows away is (4 * 3 is two, carry the 1, 2*2 is four, plus the carry) 52 bytes."
