    description: "Summary:\r\nThis happens to me occasionally. This time with a system header, but it's happened to my own files in the past.\r\n\r\nSee attached video.\r\n\r\nI do a quick open for a header file.  The quicklook dialog comes up, uses the prior contents to find stuff (which is awesome behavior), selects the top result, and then immediately _unselects_ it.  I can't open the file with my usual Return key gesture. Instead it beeps.  And I hate beeps.  I want to keep my system sounds on, so I have to put up with Xcode's unwanted noise (rdar://27163286)\r\n\r\nIdeally, the selection shouldn't go away immediately - please let it stick around so I can open the file again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just don't expect things to work predictably, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'bad-quickopen.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
