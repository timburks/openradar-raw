        Summary:
        I just learned this cool feature of Xcode: https://twitter.com/joar_at_work/status/765293744736260096

        However, Copy Qualified Symbol Name does not include `type.` before Swift method name. For example the result of copying `foo.f()` is just `f()` instead of `Foo.f()`. It is not really Qualified. Actually its result is the same as Copy Symbol Name.

        In contrast, the result of copying ObjC code `[foo f]` is `[Foo f]` which is correct.
