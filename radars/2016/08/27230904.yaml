    description: "Summary: A common user interaction in CarPlay is the ability to tap a button and have Siri appear on screen already knowing the context of a request. Examples include: \"Where would you like to go?\" In Maps, \"What should I play?\" In Music, and \"Who shall I text?\" In Messages when pressing the appropriate UIButton in the navigation bar. This would be EXTREMELY valuable for OEMs using SiriKit for car functions. For example, if a user wanted to manually enter a radio station that would be fine if the car is parked, but when moving the keypad button should be replaced with a button that brings up Siri with the prompt \"What station would you like to listen to?\" Or \"What should I tune to?\". The same could be said of climate settings like \"What temperature would you like?\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Start carplay\r\n2. Open OEM app w SiriKit support \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Ability to call function that brings up Siri w given intent request \r\n\r\nActual Results: Undocumented or not currently available \r\n\r\nVersion: 10"
