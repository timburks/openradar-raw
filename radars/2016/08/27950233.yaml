    description: When scrolling through the apps in the dock I sometimes see a blank screen for my app when I assume a snapshot hasn’t been taken yet or perhaps a snapshot is out of date. The UI for the app is never blank so I would never expect to see a blank state while scrolling through the dock for any snapshotted app.
