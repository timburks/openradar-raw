    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Apple School Manager imports records there are often messages that need to be read. The number of unread messages is in a circle in the PEOPLE header, but I can't view them again once I've dismissed them. \r\n\r\nI request the ability to 1) view the logs of all previous imports to see their overall status, and 2) view past messages that have already been read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A"
