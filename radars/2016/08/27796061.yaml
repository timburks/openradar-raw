    description: "Summary:\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nIn Xcode I have my code colorization preferences set so it's all black on white (old-school).  This is because of severe chromatic aberration in my eyeglasses that makes colorized text float around my field of vision in 3-space, each color moving at a different rate compared to the others.  This quickly leads to eyestrain and delightful headaches.\r\n\r\nIt'd be really nice if Instruments could honor Xcode's syntax colorization preferences, or have its own, so I can turn it off and be able to use Instruments for extended periods of time without pain.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noops! Meant to add a screenshot comparing the two.  My vision is also pretty bad, so being able to increase the point size of the text would be most welcome.  Saves zooming in and out with accessibility zooming (and also would be nice for presentations - I demo Instruments during classes I teach with the Big Nerd Ranch, and also for conference presentations, where zooming can be nasuea-inducing for the audience)\r\n\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-08-10 at 7.41.30 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
