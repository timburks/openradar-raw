        Summary:

        The Activity app widget always appears disabled to me, saying “Unlock to view Activity Data”, even when viewed from the widgets page on a completely unlocked iPhone

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add Activity widget to the widgets screen

        Expected Results:
        It shows your activity

        Actual Results:
        It doesn’t

        Regression:
        Worked before, certainly in beta 3, and I think in beta 4 also before some trigger

        Notes:
        Removing and re-adding the widget doesn’t fix the issue
