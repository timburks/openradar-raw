        Summary:
        I sometimes want to move an app in the Dock while it’s still launching, but I have to wait until it’s done bouncing before it will move.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Download the latest Xcode beta.
        2. Launch it for the first time.
        3. It opens and starts doing the Gatekeeper verification dance, which involves the icon bouncing in the Dock for many minutes while Gatekeeper verifies the binary signature.
        4. While it’s bouncing, I want to tidy up my Dock a bit by moving the Xcode beta icon so that it’s next to the non-beta Xcode icon.

        Expected Results:
        Even though the icon is bouncing, I can grab it and move it to another position in the Dock.

        Actual Results:
        You can’t drag icons in the Dock until they have stopped bouncing.

        Regression:
        It’s been like this as long as I can remember, so at least since 10.0 GM, I think?

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
