        Summary:
        Maps Labels Sometimes "Float" Above Non-elevated Maps in Satellite Mode with labels turned on. This occurs in the boundary region between where the satellite map has “depth” and where it does not. The labels behave as though they have depth / elevation, and the imagery does not, which creates an inconsistency / incongruity between the two when the viewport looking at the map is manipulated.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        • Open Maps app, turn on Satellite mode with labels
        • Navigate to a boundary in the satellite imagery between a region that has depth and one that does not (see Regression for definition I am using for this term)
        • Manipulate the map to get a non-perpendicular view of the region (i.e., looking towards the surface of the earth at an angle that is not 90 degrees, i.e., straight down) by using two fingers to pan up or down on the map.
        • Optionally, rotate this view by rotating two fingers on the map

        Expected Results:
        • Labels (traffic, street names, streets, points of interest) appear pinned to the surface of the map as the view of the map changes

        Actual Results:
        • Labels appear to “float” above the surface of the Earth, as if they were painted / displayed on a properly-elevated surface (as they are in the “depth” region), but the region has no depth, and so the satellite imagery is displayed at zero elevation without being elevated above the surface. The labels seem to have elevation, but the imagery does not, which creates an incongruity when manipulating the viewport of the Maps app.

        Regression:
        • Occurs in Satellite mode with labels
        • Occurs at the boundary zone between satellite imagery that has “depth” and regions that do not. Regions that have “depth” are where the vertical height of 3D structures is shown in the satellite map imagery, whereas regions without “depth” do  not show elevation or 3D structures. At the boundary (where satellite data transitions between these two zones) is where this bug occurs.
        • An example of this boundary is at longitude, latitude 39.3678, -76.6561, but I have tried other places where the boundary occurs (e.g. in the Pittsburgh, PA, USA, region) and the bug persists.

        Notes:
        • I have attached movies demonstrating the issue.
