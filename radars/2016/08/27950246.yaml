        I have a WKInterfaceTimer in my UI counting down and when the app enters the dock and is no longer active the timer stops. This occurs both when I trigger a snapshot and when I allow the system to trigger a snapshot by default. That is not what I would expect here. I would expect the system timer to continue running.

        This matches the behavior of the bundled system Stopwatch and Timer apps that continue running while the app is in the dock and actively selected.

        Note that NSTimer’s continue to fire while the app is actively selected in the dock and so the workaround to the above issue is to use a NSTimer triggering a WKInterfaceLabel. But that’s obviously not ideal given the intended purpose of the interface timer class and component.
