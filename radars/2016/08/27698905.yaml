    description: "Summary:\r\nMy workspace has 3 different projects on 3 Git-Repositories. When I load my project, all working copies are recognized, but some of them don't show the current branch. (see Screenshot1) Additionally, I can't switch the branch of these working copies. (see Screenshot2)\r\n\r\nI have a workaround so far, but it's really annoying and doesn't work when I have uncommitted changes. (see additional notes)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode and load the workspace with multiple projects on different Git-Repos\r\n2. Click \"Source Control\"\r\n3. Some branches may not show the current branch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current branch should always be detected and shown in the \"Source Control\" menu for all working copies in the workspace.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome working copies do not show the current branch\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)\r\nXcode 8.0 beta 4 (8S188o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround:\r\n1. Press CMD + ALT + X to pull the repos\r\n2. wait until the dialog to select branches appeared and loaded the available branches (Screenshot3)\r\n3. cancel or push. Doesn't matter\r\n\r\nDoes not work, if a working copy has uncommitted changes\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\r\nXcode workspace with 3 projects. Each project is on an own Git-Repository"
