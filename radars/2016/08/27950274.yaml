        Frequently in watchOS 2.2 (untested in watchOS 3) we see issues where both Pedometer data via CMMotionPedometer and Heart Rate data via HealthKit stop being delivered to the watch app via their respective query methods.

        The only fix we have found is to have the user toggle on and off the Steps and Heart Rate settings in the Apple “Apple Watch” app on the iPhone in the Privacy section. Even when those settings are on, and the appropriate app permissions for Motion and HealthKit are granted, we sometimes stop receiving data. Toggling those settings off and back on restores behavior.

        I’m expecting that if all settings are configured correctly then querying from the motion or health data sources should always work and should not require a user toggle to restore behavior.
