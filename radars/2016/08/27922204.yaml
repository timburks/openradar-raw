    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the latest Xcode8 beta6 SDK when bridging a Swift.Bool to AnyObject or to NSNumber (e.g. to be serialized by JSONSerialization), the Type information is lost and the Bool is serialized as an integer (0 or 1) instead of as a string (\"true\" or \"false\")\r\n\r\nlet bool = true                              // Bool.Type\r\nlet boolAsAnyObject = bool as AnyObject      // is bridged to _SwiftTypePreservingNSNumber.Type\r\nlet boolAsNSNumber = bool as NSNumber        // is bridged to _SwiftTypePreservingNSNumber.Type\r\nlet trueAsAnyObject = true as AnyObject      // is also bridged to _SwiftTypePreservingNSNumber.Type\r\nlet trueAsNSNumber = true as NSNumber        // is bridged to __NSCFBoolean.Type\r\nlet nsNumberFromBool = NSNumber(value: bool) // __NSCFBoolean.Type\r\n\r\nOnly __NSCFBoolean.Type seems to be correctly serialized by JSONSerialization as a string with \"true\" or \"false\"\r\n\r\nSee the attached Playground.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached Playground that shows the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nJSONSerialization serializes Bool as string with \"true\" or \"false\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJSONSerialization serializes Bool as integer with 1 or 0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BoolAsAnyObject.playground.zip' was successfully uploaded."
