    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use DuetDisplay or an external USB screen, Sierra renders a *gigantic* mouse-pointer, and does not generate clicks where expected on-screen, when the mouse is on that external screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attach USB display, or install the ‘DuetDisplay’ app and attach an iPad or similar device\r\n2. Move mouse-pointer over onto the desktop of the second screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe mouse-pointer transfers smoothly to the external display, at a consistent size; and clicks of the mouse apply to UI elements below the tip of that mouse-pointer\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mouse-pointer renders at about half the width of the entire screen(!), and clicks are not remotely accurate to the visible tip of that giant pointer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A201w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nExternal screen attached"
