    description: "When typing on iPad, uesrs can use a two-finger gesture to select text and move the cursor. However, when typing very quickly, the keyboard often confuses consecutive keystrokes with the double-tap gesture. This causes the keyboard to select entire words or sentences and be overwritten as the user types, preventing the iPad's software keyboard from being used efficiently.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. While typing a long sentence, quickly type the letters \"er\" (as if typing the word \"letters\")\r\n2. The keyboard will select the entire word, and as you continue to type, the word will be overwritten."
