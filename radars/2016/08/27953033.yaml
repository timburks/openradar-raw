        Summary:

        On OS X 10.11.x and later, the method of disabling Bonjour advertisement changed due to SIP no longer allowing the following plist to be edited:

        /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist

        After doing some research, it looks like the Bonjour advertisement function can be disabled by running the following command with root privileges:

        defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool YES

        However, it does not appear that I can manage this with a profile.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Install profile
        2. Check NoMulticastAdvertisements value in /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist

        Expected Results:

        /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder NoMulticastAdvertisements is set to True
        Bonjour advertisement function is disabled

        Actual Results:

        /Library/Managed Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder NoMulticastAdvertisements is set to True
        Bonjour advertisement function is not disabled

        Regression:

        Running the defaults command listed above sets the following value:

        /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements is set to True
        Bonjour advertisement function is disabled
