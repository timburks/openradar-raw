    description: "Area:\r\nNSURL\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe current mechanism for App Transport Security requires that either:\r\n1. NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy can be turned OFF on a domain by domain basis, or\r\n2. if we set NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to YES, we can then turn ON NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy on a domain by domain basis.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement request is to allow all ATS features to remain on (i.e. NSAllowsArbitraryLoads set to NO) but allow a global NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy flag to disable PFS (i.e. Perfect Forward Secrecy) for all domains.\r\n\r\nOur app Desk.com (from Salesforce) hosts the support domains for many different clients. Some of our clients use GoDaddy certificates which fail PFS requirement. We cannot statically list all these domains the the plist of our app because the list of domains that require the exception can dynamically change.\r\n\r\nWe need a way to disable PFS for all domains that our accessed through our Desk.com app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy = OFF at the top level NSAppTransportSecurity dictionary. Not under a domain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPerfect Forward Secrecy is disabled for all domains but secure https and minimum TLS 1.2 is still enforced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPerfect Forward Secrecy is not disabled for all domains.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 or later\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll iOS devices running iOS 9.0 or later.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
