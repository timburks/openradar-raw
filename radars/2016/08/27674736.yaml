    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation (Audio / Video)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA lot of times there is no audio when using CallKit because AudioUnitInitialize returns a AVAudioSessionErrorCodeMissingEntitlement error. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Report incoming call through CallKit (outgoing also fails), i.e., call reportNewIncomingCall method on CXProvider.\r\n2. Answer call.\r\n3. Method on provider delegate that notifies of a CXAnswerCallAction gets called.\r\n4. Audio session is configured, but AudioUnitInitialize fails with OSStatus equals to AVAudioSessionErrorCodeMissingEntitlement.\r\n5. Action is fulfilled or not, it doesn't matter.\r\n6. didActivateAudioSession method in the provider delegate is never called.\r\n7. No audio in the call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect AudioUnitInitialize to not fail, and when the action is fulfilled the didActivateAudioSession method gets called and the audio in the call works correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSince AudioUnitInitialize fails, it doesn't matter if the action is fulfilled or not, because the call will have no audio.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 Beta 4 [14A5322e]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis problem is visible in the Speakerbox example code:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/Speakerbox\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 16GB, using Wifi"
