    description: "Summary:\nIn addition to the issue reported in radar 28034006, being able to correlate the last time a FV2 recovery key was used with the timestamp of when it was last generated (as it could be regenerated/rotated after initiating encryption) allows admins to know that an individual recovery key would need to be escrowed. Currently there is no known/documented way to tell the last time a recovery key was generated for a volume, nor does it seem to persist anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Initiate filevault encryption on a computer running 10.12 in system preferences, which generates a personal/individual recovery key. \n2. run sudo log show --debug --info --predicate 'process == \"fdesetup\"'\n\nExpected Results:\nSomewhere in the logs or on the filesystem, a key to the effect of 'personal recovery key last generated date' would be set to a timestamp, or a subcommand of 'fdesetup' would report last time a distinct key became associated with a particular volume.\n\nActual Results:\nThere is no documented place on the filesystem or in the log that reflects the time a key became associated with the boot volume and allows FV2 unlock.\n\nRegression:\nAll OSes that support filevault, including macOS 10.12, Sierra developer preview 7\n\nNotes:\nAffected install count: hundreds at Montefiore Medical Group, thousands at Einstein College of Medicine"
