    description: 'Polish iOS market has grown significantly over the last few years. While it is possible to translate App Store metadata of apps to lots of languages, Polish is not one of them. There’s many languages, such as Finnish, which have significantly smaller reach (Finnish: 5M speakers, Polish: 50M speakers) — so why not add Polish too?'
