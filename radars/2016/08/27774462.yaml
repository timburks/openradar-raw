    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up TFA on OS X you are required to enter a phone number. Living in the Cayman Islands, our country code is +1345 followed by a 7-digit number. However, the phone number validation in the dialog box mistakenly requires a 10-digit number. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFor example, if my phone number was +1 (345) 123-4567. The country code is +1345, so I enter 1234567.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI can continue in the process and receive a text message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe dialog states that my phone number is invalid. If I enter 345 123 4567 then it passes validation, but then the system sends a text message to +1 (345) 345-123-4567 which is not my number so it never arrives.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf I choose +1 (United States) from the dropdown, and enter (345) 123-4567 as my number it works. I receive a text message and can continue, however this is not the most obvious solution."
