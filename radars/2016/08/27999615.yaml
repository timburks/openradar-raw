    description: "When you first launch a Messages Extension the framework displays your iMessage App Icon. But then subsequent loading of the extension seem to show a random screenshot of your extension taken by the framework. Is there a way to customize this for apps? We do a little amount of animation when the extension first loads it likes to take screenshots in the middle of the animation phase.\r\n\r\nFrom https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/60648\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch your extension in Messages, notice the first time after installation your app icon is displayed\r\n2. Navigate to another extension other than the one you installed\r\n3. Navigate back to your extension\r\n4. Notice how it will now load a random screenshot of your extension\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe applications icon is displayed everytime the extension is loaded. Or developers are given the ability to set their own like with launching container apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system takes a seemingly random screenshot of your extension."
