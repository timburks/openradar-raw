    description: "Summary:\r\nsfltool does not have any documentation outside of some options that can be used for it when you type 'sfltool' in the command line.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up Terminal.app in the /Applications/Utilities folder\r\n2. Type 'sfltool' and press Enter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect detailed usage information on what each option does and the syntax usage and any required or optional flags that can be used.\r\nFor example, if I type 'sfltool add-item' I receive no further information on what that option does. I would expect to see something more like this:\r\n\r\nsfltool add-item (-n [Display Name]) LSSharedFileList.domain [path]\r\n\r\nwhere the -n flag is optional and would allow for a Display Name to be used instead of the path specified at the end of the command.\r\n\r\nand path must be written in a file URI format such as file:///Users/admin/Desktop/untitled%20folder/ (where space is encoded as %20)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI receive one line that reads as follows:\r\nsfltool restore|add-item|save-lists|test|archive|enable-modern|dump-server-state|clear|disable-modern|dump-storage|list-info [options]\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12 DP 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a new tool introduced with OS X 10.11 and updated in macOS 10.12 DP 1. There was no documentation in OS X 10.11 either.\r\n\r\nIn order to discover that -n was a flag that some options take, I had to run the strings command on the sfltool binary. There is no man page similar to many other built-in OS command line tools. What does 'restore' do? What does 'save-lists' do? What does 'test' do? What is the difference between a list that is considered modernized list and one that is not? What are all the domains represent and what do they actually effect? These are just some of the questions that a man page and proper usage guide would hopefully answer for any Mac administrator interested in using this new tool.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll hardware supporting macOS 10.12 DP 1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
