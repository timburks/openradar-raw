        Summary:

        In some cases, a SVG <circle> using the `stroke-dasharray` property to achieve a “circle filling” effect does not respect the `transform: rotate()` property properly on iOS

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Open the svg.html test case attached on an iOS 10 device.

        Expected Results:

        The circle should appear as in <ExpectedResult.png>

        Actual Results:

        The circle appears as in <ActualResult.png>, with the circle starting at the 3 o’clock point instead of 12 o’clock.

        Regression:

        This is a regression since iOS 9.3. The bug also, curiously, does not reproduce on Safari Technology Preview (Release 10; running on 10.11.6), and appears to be iOS-specific. (It reproduces both on Safari and UIWebView)

        Notes:

        While this won’t reproduce on the test case (missing some divs around), a transform `rotate(-87deg)` instead of `rotate(-90deg)` would work, forcing the circle to rotate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
