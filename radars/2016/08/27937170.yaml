    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a source editor’s type is set to Objective-C++ Source, as would be the case with a .mm extension, various Objective-C++ and C++ keywords are not recognized as keywords. The source editor doesn’t highlight them as keywords and doesn’t indent or dedent subsequent lines based on the keywords.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached Objective-C++ source file, foo.mm.\r\n2. Select the entire text and go to Editor ‣ Structure ‣ Re-Indent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n• After step 1, keywords like @interface, @implementation, if, public, and switch are highlighted as keywords.\r\n• After step 2, lines 2–3, 6, 12–13, and 16 are unindented, and lines 19 and 22 are indented by two tabs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n• After step 1, keywords like @interface, @implementation, if, public, and switch are not highlighted as keywords.\r\n• After step 2, lines 2–3, 6, 12–13, and 16 are indented by one tab, and lines 19 and 22 are indented by three tabs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\nOS X 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso reproduces in beta 5 but (as far as I can remember) not in beta 4. Does not reproduce in Xcode 7.3.1.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsuccessfully uploaded."
