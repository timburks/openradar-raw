    description: "Summary:\r\nvideo attached.  project attached.\r\n\r\nI tried to use code completion to find out if I can create an NSImage from a CGImage.  Code completion wouldn't show me the NSImage(cgImage:size:) initializer.  I ended up going to the NSImage objc header to see if the call exists, then opened the header in Xcode to see how the Swift version was spelled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MandelSwift.zip' and 'incompletion.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
