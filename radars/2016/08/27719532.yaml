        Summary:
        I’ve been at my iMac more than usual lately and have been trying to make phone calls. It’s supposed to be setup using Wi-Fi calling, but it keeps saying “using iPhone” and no audio comes through.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Not sure

        Expected Results:
        Once I turn on Wi-Fi calling, it stays on

        Actual Results:
        It turns itself off sporadically, reverting to using my iPhone for calls, which then don’t go through

        Regression:


        Notes:
        I’m not sure what’s triggering it, but if I turn off wi-fi calling to my iMac from my iPhone’s settings and then turn it back on from the FaceTime preferences on the iMac, it works again using Wi-Fi calling for a while. I can’t tell what triggers it to stop working.
