        Summary:
        The Pathfinder sample code zip file contains mixed use of "Pathfinder" and "PathFinder", resulting in a project that doesn't compile out of the box when on a case-sensitive filesystem.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a DMG in Disk Utility, formatted as macOS Extended case sensitive.
        2. Copy Pathfinder.zip to the volume and extract it.
        3. Open Pathfinder.xcodeproj.
        4. Build.

        Expected Results:
        Builds successfully.

        Actual Results:
        Build errors due to files that canâ€™t be found.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        The directory tree looks like the following:

        ./PathFinder
        ./PathFinder/Assets.xcassets
        ./PathFinder/MazeBuilder.swift
        ./Pathfinder
        ./Pathfinder/Assets.xcassets
        ./Pathfinder/<all other global files>
        ./Pathfinder (OS X)
        ./Pathfinder (iOS)
        ./Pathfinder (tvOS)
        ./Pathfinder.xcodeproj

        The Pathfinder and Pathfinder (OS X) directories are referenced as PathFinder and PathFinder (OS X) in the Xcode project.
