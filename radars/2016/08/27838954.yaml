    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen instances of both a custom UIGestureRecognizer subclass and one of the built-in gesture recognisers (eg. UIPanGestureRecogizer) are attached to a view using Xcode's Interface Builder, ibtoold crashes while trying to compile the xib or storyboard containing said view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag an \"Object\" from the Object Library on to a view controller.\r\n2. Set the object's class to your custom UIGestureRecognizer's subclass.\r\n3. Drag one of the built-in gesture recognisers (eg. UIPanGestureRecognizer) from the Object Library onto the same view controller.\r\n4. Attach both gesture recognisers to the view controller's view.\r\n5. Try to build the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe storyboard compiles successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nibtoold crashes while compiling the storyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n* Xcode 7.3.1, Xcode 8.0b5\r\n* OS X 10.11.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)"
