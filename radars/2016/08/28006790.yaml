        On WWDC, it was announced that subscription IAPs can be priced depending on the region.

        This should be available to all apps — i.e. to paid-up-front apps as well.

        Here’s my rationale: different markets have different expectations, and software doesn’t have inherent value. For example, I’m in Poland. People are willing to pay much less for apps than in the US. I sell my, quite simple app for $5. This seems to be the optimal price in the US and Western Europe. But in Poland + Eastern Europe + much of less developed countries, I would likely have more success if the app was $2-3.
