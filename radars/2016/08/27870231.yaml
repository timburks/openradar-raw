        Summary:

        When Messages is in landscape orientation, the top bar takes up a lot of vertical screen space due to the need to accommodate the top bar with the chevron button and the other userâ€™s name and avatar. If the avatar was hidden in landscape mode, the top bar could shrink down to a much smaller size and allow more room for App Extensions. Space is especially constrained on smaller devices when using the keyboard, often leaving barely any room at all.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1: Open a Messages App on an iPhone SE (or similar) with a text field in landscape mode and tap the text field to bring up the keyboard.
        2: Note the extremely constrained vertical space

        Expected Results:

        The top bar should shrink down to at least 44 points or less to provide some room for the app extension to offer a more useful interface.

        Another thing that could help is hiding the bottom native Messages input bar while the keyboard is in use.

        Actual Results:

        Space is extremely constrained for iMessage Apps in landscape, leading to a poor experience.

        Regression:

        Appears in all iOS 10 betas

        Notes:

        Providing adequate interface space should be a real concern for Messages App Extensions
