    description: We have AVPlayer in an UITableViewCell. The AVPlayer will start to play once the tabview cell is visible and stop once the table view cell is invisible. We found there are frame loss whenever we init/attach/play/pause/dealloc the player. And reading property like accessLog will stall the main thread too.
