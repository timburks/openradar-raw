    description: "Summary:\r\nI am attempting to set up a CKSubscription for record changes. While the subscription does save, and my app gets a badge/notification in notification center, \r\n\r\n    func application(_ application: NSApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [String : Any])\r\n\r\nis never called.\r\n\r\nSee 23804473\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create CKSubscription and save. Verify CloudKit dashboard.\r\n2. Register your app for remote notifications. Verify using didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken.\r\n3. Receive notifications. Verify by visual inspection of app badge or notification center.\r\n4. Attempt to intercept/receive in program, using didReceiveRemoteNotification. This fails.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect didReceiveRemoteNotification to be called when the badge increases or a notification appears in notification center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ndidReceiveRemoteNotification never calls."
