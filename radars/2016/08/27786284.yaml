    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is the ability in DEP (Device Enrollment Program) to enter a serial number at the top and you can assign the device to one of your MDM servers or unsaying it from them. Now that schools are being converted to ASM (Apple School Manager) that functionality has been lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into ASM\r\n2. Click on Device Assignments\r\n3. Enter one of your device serial numbers at the top in the 'Search Serial Numbers' field\r\n4. Click on the drop down menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. In addition to my MDM servers, there should be an option to Unassign\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Unassign is missing and not an option"
