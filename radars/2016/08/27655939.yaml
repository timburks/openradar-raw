        Summary:
        There is no indication of any sort when you tap the Create (or Rest) buttons in Xcode preferences / Account window, for a specific account. There should be a loading indicator as minimum.
        Also open up a small log window that shows exactly what is happening so in case of any issues, a developer can actually copy that log and post it here as bug report. Log should be as verbose as possible, since this is all sensitive and every step is crucial.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Xcode 8 / Preferences
        Switch to Accounts
        Add fresh new account
        Double click it open Signing Identities / Prov. Profiles screen
        Tap on Create button

        Expected Results:
        A nicer, more friendly UI, described in Summary

        Actual Results:
        Button just disappears.

        Regression:
