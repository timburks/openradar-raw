    description: "Summary:\r\nUser IDs are preferred over user names, at least on Twitter, which allows the user name to be changed. My app performs reverse authentication with Twitter, and must not be used on an account more than once. ACAccount does not expose a public property for the user ID (although it may be accessed via the class' private `properties` dictionary, which is what I currently use, but obviously would rather not in the finished product). Therefore, I am requesting a userID property to be added to ACAccount.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
