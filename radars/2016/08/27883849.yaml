    description: "Summary:\r\nDebugging code that uses message forwarding is very inconvenient - currently it requires either going through lots of assembly code or manually inspecting sender and putting breakpoints into appropriate places.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA.\r\n1. When debugging in the Xcode, get to the line where method implemented through message forwarding is called.\r\n2. Step-in\r\n\r\nB.\r\n1. When debugging in the Xcode, get to the line where -[NSInvocation invoke] is called\r\n2. Step-in\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA.\r\nDebugger should stop in one of the -forwardingTargetForSelector:, -methodSignatureForSelector:, methodSignatureForSelector:\r\n\r\nB. Debugger should stop in the method being called by NSInvocation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDebugger steps over"
