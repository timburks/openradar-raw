        On iOS, thereâ€™s a family of Sec* functions that allow access to the shared iCloud Keychain:

        - SecRequestSharedWebCredential
        - SecAddSharedWebCredential
        - SecCreateSharedWebCredentialPassword

        Those APIs allow apps to take advantage of password saved to the iCloud Keychain by users in Safari.

        The same APIs would be highly useful on macOS.
