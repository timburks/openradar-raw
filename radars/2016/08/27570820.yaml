    description: "Summary:\r\nThe SFContentBlockerManager.reloadContentBlocker function always returns the noExtensionFound error, when called from an extension such as a widget or a Safari Action Extension. This makes it impossible to update a content blocker in a widget, or update a whitelist in a Safari Action Extension (as is common to almost all content blockers in the App Store).\r\n\r\nPrinting the error produces \"Error Domain=SFErrorDomain Code=1 \"(null)\"\", which according to the documentation is the noExtensionFound error. The noExtensionFound can be triggered when the extension is not owned by the caller, which I suspect is the issue â€“ iOS 10 does not recognize extensions as owners of other extensions in the same app."
