    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI am trying to present `CNContactPickerViewController` instances that can only be used for selecting contacts, _not_ properties of contacts. I’ve been able to mostly accomplish this by setting `predicateForSelectionOfContact = NSPredicate(value: true)` on my view controller instances, but this value often does not seem to be respected while searching.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of this write-up, I will refer to a `CNContactPickerViewController` instance whose delegate implements \r\n\r\n* `contactPicker(picker: CNContactPickerViewController, didSelectContact contact: CNContact)` as a “single-selection picker”\r\n* `contactPicker(picker: CNContactPickerViewController, didSelectContacts contacts: [CNContact])` as a “multi-selection picker”\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFor all pickers, set `predicateForSelectionOfContact = NSPredicate(value: true)`\r\n\r\n1) Present a single-selection picker, enter a search query, and select a search result that matches a non-name “contact property” (e.g. email address, phone number, company, etc.)\r\n\r\n2) Present a multi-selection picker, enter a search query, and select a search result that matches by name only\r\n\r\n3) Present a multi-selection picker, enter a search query, and select a search result that matches a non-name “contact property” (e.g. email address, phone number, company, etc.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1) The picker should be dismissed and the `didSelectContact` delegate method should be invoked\r\n\r\n2) The search should be dismissed and the row that corresponds to the selected search result should be selected. Tapping the “Done” right bar button item should subsequently invoke the `didSelectContacts` delegate method.\r\n\r\n3) The search should be dismissed and the row that corresponds to the selected search result should be selected. Tapping the “Done” right bar button item should subsequently invoke the `didSelectContacts` delegate method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1) A contact detail view controller is pushed onto the stack \r\n\r\n2) Nothing happens\r\n\r\n3) A contact detail view controller is pushed onto the stack"
