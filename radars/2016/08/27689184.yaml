    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached video.  Did a Swift 3 migration of a project, got some errors.  That's expected\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't expect is for any assistance to be broken.  I couldn't get to any help to tell me what was going on, what a particular variable is inferring to.  Just \"no help for this item\".\r\n\r\nMakes for an extremely frustrating time until I can get to a successful build and run, not having any information I need to fix the problems that are preventing the build (does this call now take an optional or not?  What is Locale vs NSLocale?).  At this point Xcode is no more help than if I were editing everything in an uncustomized vim.\r\n\r\nEven though everything is black, that's due to all my syntax being explicitly colored as black, due to my vision correction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 4 (8S188o)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just invent new forms of profanity, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
