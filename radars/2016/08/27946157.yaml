    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you programatically set a MPMediaItem's MPMediaItemPropertyRating value, the change persists in the local media library. However it does not sync back to the iCloud Music library.\r\n\r\nBut when the user changes a song rating with the iOS7,8,9 Music App - the change almost instantly is reflected in iTunes on a Mac. \r\n\r\nWhen programmatically changed, the rating change should also be automatically pushed up to iCloud - and then back down to all devices logged into iCloud Music Library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nexample code:\r\n\r\n        let musicController: MPMusicPlayerController = MPMusicPlayerController.systemMusicPlayer()\r\n        if let item: MPMediaItem = musicController.nowPlayingItem {\r\n            item.setValue( NSNumber(value: 5 ), forKey: MPMediaItemPropertyRating)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rating change should be pushed up to iCloud - and then back down to all devices logged into iCloud Music Library. This is what occurs when the user changes a song rating with the iOS7,8,9 Music App - the change almost instantly is reflected in iTunes on a Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe change will persist locally, but not synced back up to iCloud. If the file changes elsewhere, the iCloud Sync when then override the locally changed rating. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7,8,9,10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRatings are gone from the iOS10 music app UI - while still present in data and used by smart playlists. I want to put out a small app to allow setting ratings (even just for myself!) - but it won't work properly if it doesn't sync back to iCloud. :)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S (ios10), 6 (ios9), 4 (ios7)"
