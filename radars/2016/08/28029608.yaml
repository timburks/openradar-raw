        Summary:
        When compiling a project with many Swift files, the HUD that shows all Xcode compilation actions across screens does not accurately indicate that Swift compilation is still taking place.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have an Xcode project with 100s of Swift files.
        2. Click the Play Button

        Expected Results:
        The Xcode HUD view indicates that individual Swift files are being compiled with a label like “Compiling X of Y Swift source files” in a similar fashion in which it indicates Objective-C file compilation.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode just indicated that it is “Compiling Swift source files” with no indeterminate spinner to show that this step has not been hung.

        Regression:
        This happens across all versions of Xcode which are able to compile Swift source files.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
