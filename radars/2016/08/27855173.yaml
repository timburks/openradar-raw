    description: "Summary:\r\nc.f. rdar://27631771 (warning region indicator still visible with live issues but Show All Issues is Off).  I can grant that if live issues are on, then always showing the bright red squiggle under the error regions is working as intended.\r\n\r\nBut now, I'm getting the red squiggles when Show All Issues is off _and_ Live Issues is Off.\r\n\r\nSee attached screen shot.  The project in question is attached.\r\n\r\nSee rdar://27631771 for my reasonings why I don't want such things visible without a way of turning them off.\r\n\r\nP.S. I use all-black for my syntax coloring due to my vision correction.  SourceKit hasn't crashed.  Also, the red squiggles dance around in 3-D space in my field of vision as I move my head around, leading to eye fatigue and headaches.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-08-15 at 6.02.54 PM.png' and 'GrafDemo.zip' were successfully uploaded."
