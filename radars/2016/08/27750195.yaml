    description: "Summary:\n\nOur app uses a separate build configuration with a different bundle identifier for nightly builds (see image #3 and #4). We use the default iCloud container that is tied to the bundle ID (see image #2). We also set up a separate provisioning profile for nightly builds with the different bundle id and (and thus also a different iCloud container ID). \n\nXcode 8 warns that the nightly profile does not have the correct iCloud container for the default bundle ID (see image #1). \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate two build configurations with different bundle IDs. Enabled iCloud with the default container settings. Generate a provisioning profile for each of the two configurations and set them up in Xcode. \n\nExpected Results:\n\nDue to the modified bundle ID, the iCloud container should match the alternative provisioning profile. Xcode should not warn about this configuration. \n\nActual Results:\n\nA warning is displayed because the default iCloud container could not be matched to the alternative provisioning profile. \n\nRegression:\n\nHappens in Xcode 8 (tested with b4)."
