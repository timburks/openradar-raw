    description: "Summary:\r\nHi! \r\n\r\nI have a function with a bunch of arguments (I know CG has renamed these, but I haven't compiled yet, so Xcode shouldn't care. I have other C-based APIs with a zillion arguments I have to deal with).  I want to put some of the arguments on their own lines so that I can comment what they are.\r\n\r\nXcode happily lines up arguments on subsequent lines as I wish, unless a comment is in place. In that case it zings the line over to the left with just a four-space indent, rather than the many-more-than-four-spaces of the immediately preceding lines. \r\n\r\nThis leads to a pretty ugly result (screen shot attached).  It'd be groovy if they all lined up under the opening paren.\r\n\r\n(I use black for my syntax colorization due to my vision correction, so source kit hasn't crashed)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 5 (8S193k)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'weird-indent.mp4' and 'Screen Shot 2016-08-09 at 7.30.46 PM.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappens after converting the old CGFunction call into the proper CGImage(...) call.
