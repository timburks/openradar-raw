    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning the latest Xcode 8 beta and Swift 3, if a label or button is added to a storyboard or nib and has it's font attribute set to System Font Bold in the interface builder, when that application is ran on a none iOS 10 device, the font's are not bold. Running on a iOS 10 device everything looks perfect, so this seems like a regression on previous OS versions.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the font is set programmatically then it bolds correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Install Xcode 8 Beta 4\r\n2) Open the included project \r\n3) Attach a device running any version of iOS 9 (including 9.3.3) and run the application.\r\n4) The label that is setup using Interface Builder is not bold, the one set in code is.\r\n5) Attach a device running any version of iOS 10 and run the application\r\n6) Both labels are bold as expected\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth labels should be bold on iOS 9 devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly labels set programmatically show bold when ran on iOS 9.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8 Beta 4, OS X 11.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested using Xcode 8 Beta 4 and ran on a iPad Pro (12.8 inch one) and iPad Mini 2 both running 9.3.3. Same result"
