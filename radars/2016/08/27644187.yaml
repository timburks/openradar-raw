    description: "Summary:\r\nThe current Mac App Store does not allow people to search what they have already purchased. Even though a search box is already provided in Mac App Store, it couldn't search those products withdrawn from Mac App Store. If a previously-purchased product is withdrawn from Mac App Store, it could only be found MANUALLY through the purchased list, leading to great inconveniences.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou own a product which was previously on sale but currently not-on-sale in Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPeoples are allowed to perform searches among their purchased apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearchbox is only available in Mac App Store, making people unable to search a purchased product which was previously on sale but currently not-on-sale in Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAny macOS build capable with Mac App Store\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
