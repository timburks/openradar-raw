    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nChanges to the isAccessibilityElement attribute of a UI element (in this case, an otherElement, unknown if it's general) correctly propagate out to the accessibility hierarchy (such as may be printed from an XCUITest using, e.g., print(app.otherElements) ) but are not picked up by waitForExpectationsWithTimeout because the Snapshot is never refreshed. Or so it seems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UI element in your code\r\n2. Set up a UI Test with waitForExpectationWithTimeout that waits for the existence of that element\r\n3. In code, set the element to start out as not accessible%2C but then to become accessible after a short span of time\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpectation is fulfilled, because the wait function properly pulls in the new hierarchy once the hierarchy changes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExpectation fails and test fails, because the element is not in whatever cache the expectation is using for its hierarchy snapshot and it doesn't do a new pull.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 7.3.1, iOS 9.2 Simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you set a breakpoint and then immediately “Go” after it%2C everything passes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 Simulator running on Macbook Pro"
