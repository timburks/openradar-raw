    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached video.  Attached project is what's in the video.\r\n\r\nSometimes when clicking on an error, Xcode is replacing the last error with some warnings for an unrelated file, and the replaces them.  As I click around, there's the bottom of the list flapping around spastically.  It's visually distracting as I'm trying to get work done evaluating my errors.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if the list was somewhat visually stable when browsing errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 4 (8S188o)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just don't look at the rapidly blinking light, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'visual-cacophony.mp4' and 'ClassMaker.zip' were successfully uploaded."
