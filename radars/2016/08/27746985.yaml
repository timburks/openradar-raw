        Summary:
        Craigslist uses an email proxy service to prevent abuse. Unfortunately, that means getting email from a number of randomly generated email addresses (e.g. efk6b-5715996242@sale.craigslist.org), which apparently look like junk to the iCloud mail servers and/or Mail.app on El Capitan. It would be nice if there were a way to make a server-side rule to whitelist certain email domains, such as sale.craigslist.org
