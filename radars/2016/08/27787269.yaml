    description: "When using the CMMotionManager method -startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame:toQueue:withHandler: and passing CMAttitudeReferenceFrameXMagneticNorthZVertical as reference frame, the data seems not to be aligned correctly anymore. Using the same method in iOS 9 or older, the motion data was correctly aligned to magnetic north.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall the method -startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrame:toQueue:withHandler: on a iOS device running iOS 10 b2-b5\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe motion data is aligned to magnetic north like in previous versions of iOS\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe motion data is not aligned to magnetic north anymore.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 b2-b5\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nAlso rotating the device seems to mess up CMMotionManager internally. The motion data seems to be lagging several frames behind the rotation."
