        Summary:
        Whenever I install an iOS system update on my iOS 9 iPhone, my iOS 10 iPad shows an iCloud verification code.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have an iPad mini 2 running iOS 10. It’s set to always be on (never sleep), and mounted in a wall dock, because it’s running a status dashboard-type app.
        2. My iPhone 6s (iOS 9.x) and this iPad mini 2 are linked to the same iCloud account, and are both set as devices that can be used to do two-factor auth.
        2. Download and install an iOS point release (9.3.5 in this case) on my iPhone 6s.

        Expected Results:
        Nothing happens on the iPad.

        Actual Results:
        The iPad gets the standard iCloud two-factor auth popup with a four-digit auth code.

        Regression:
        Never saw this on iOS 9.

        Notes:
        none
