    description: "Summary:\r\nThe WWDC session \"Introduction to Notifications\" included the statement that a time interval trigger \"lets you schedule a notification immediately by setting the time interval to zero\". In practice this actually causes an exception.\r\n\r\nI'm able to work around the bug setting the interval to a very small number, but it would be preferable if I could use 0 to have it delivered as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to create a notification trigger with this code:\r\nUNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger *trigger = [UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger triggerWithTimeInterval:0 repeats:NO];\r\n2. Run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification trigger should be created without an exception.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn exception is raised: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'time interval must be greater than 0'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 1 (14A5261v)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
