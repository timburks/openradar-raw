    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a local notification with a custom long alert sound fires outside of the app that schedules it, a banner appears at the top of the screen. Pulling this banner down or 3D Touching the notification banner reveals a list of notification actions. From iOS 7 through 9.3, this action stops the alert sound immediately. In iOS 10 Beta 6/7, this behavior no longer happens. This means that a user is forced to quickly make a choice in order to stop the alert sound.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Schedule a UILocalNotification with a long custom alert sound\r\n2. Return to Home screen and wait for notification to fire\r\n3. Pull down the notification to reveal more options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification sound stops immediately when notification is pulled down to reveal the actions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification sound continues playing non-stop in the background, causing the user undue stress while he's faced with making a decision to tap on one of the actions in the shortest amount of time in order to shut the sound up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5345a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug previously occurred in iOS 8 beta, and was resolved by GM seed. See rdar://17941612\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus (and simulators)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Alert Sound Uncut.mp4' and 'Notification With Wrong Alert Sound.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xvdcdh6c8527d2s/Alert%20Sound%20Uncut.mp4?dl=1\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/q1nf2mbr6sgcdb8/Notification%20With%20Wrong%20Alert%20Sound.zip?dl=1"
