    description: "Summary:\r\nTo use the mount command, the mount point must first exist.\r\nFor a mounted network drive to appear correctly in Finder and on the Desktop, the mount point must be within /Volumes.\r\nHowever with the changes of permissions from 1777 (drwxrwxrwx) to 1755 (drwxr-xr-x), to create a new mount point within /Volumes requires sudo permissions.\r\nThis makes the process impossible (AFAIK) to achieve via automation scripts, or via applications making requests to mount network drives, as the application I develop does.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal\r\n2. Execute `mkdir /Volumes/TestFolder`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder /Volume/TestFolder to be created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPermission Deined error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmac OS 10.12 Developer Beta 1 through 4.\r\nI'd try beta 5, but well, that update process is completed borked right now.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this permissions change is to remain permanent, can you please provide instructions for mounting a network drive via Terminal, without the need of sudo, or modifier sudoers."
