        Summary:
        I was playing an Apple Music playlist (“Paul McCartney for a Lazy Afternoon”) and when one song ended (“The Fool on the Hill”), the next never started. The only thing I can think of that might have triggered it was that I had plugged in my iPhone before starting the playlist and was prompted to download an iOS update. I chose to download but not install it. I’ve attached a sysdiagnose taken while it was hung.
