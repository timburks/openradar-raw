    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new emojis for Information Desk Person are missing an element of sass. Although Information Desk Person is intended to be used to represent a person giving information at a help desk, it is commonly used to represent sassiness or sarcasm. I believe that the new emoji rolled out in this beta have lost that element and risk damaging its reputation and common use case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Use Information Desk Person on iOS 9 and send to friend on iOS 10\r\n- Friend on iOS 10 doesn't understand sarcasm or sassiness due to new emoji.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInformation Desk Person emoji should have more sass\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInformation Desk Person emoji has significantly reduced levels of sass\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nEmojipedia also notes the sassiness of the current emoji\r\nSee: http://emojipedia.org/information-desk-person/"
