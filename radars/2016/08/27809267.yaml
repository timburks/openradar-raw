    description: "Summary:\r\nThis enhancement is for the Setup Assistant of Apple School Manager.\r\n\r\nCurrently we configure Apple ID formats for students and staff with one domain, a student format, and a staff format. We are offered the option to turn off '.appleid' for the domain to accommodate schools that will be utilizing their existing email structure for the Managed Apple ID.\r\n\r\nI ask that we be allowed to customize the domain for students separately from the domain for staff. Some schools have email sub-domains for their students and this would allow the Managed Apple IDs to be created properly. For example:\r\nstudentusername@students.schooldistrict.org\r\nstaffusername@schooldistrict.org"
