    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a CallKit-enabled call fails, the system shows a native UI with two buttons: Cancel and Call Back. However, tapping Call Back has no effect at all. I was expecting that this button will send a new perform:CXStartCallAction to my CXProviderDelegate, but I also tried listening to application:continueUserActivity, whithout any luck. \r\n\r\nThe same behaviour can be observed in the Speakerbox example app: siumulate an incoming call, then in the perform:CXAnswerCallAction I set a timer to force the call to fail after 5 seconds. The 'Call Failed' native UI shows, however Call Back button does nothing.\r\n\r\nWe attach a file with the device logs at the moment of tapping the 'Call Back' button\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a CallKit-enabled call.\r\n2. The call fails for any reason (reported to CallKit via reportCallWithUUID(uuid, endedAtDate:nil, reason: .Failed)).\r\n3. The Call Failed native UI shows (see attachment).\r\n4. Tapping 'Call Back' has no effect at all on the app (no CXProviderDelegate callbacks, or NSUserActivity continuations).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping 'Call Back' button should communicate with the app to start a new call (probably via CXProviderDelegate performStartCallAction).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The screen is not dismissed and the app doesn't receive any CXProviderDelegate or AppDelegate callback.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 Beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S"
