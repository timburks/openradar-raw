    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to provide our users with a finer granularity over the types of notifications they received, we would like to filter push notifications based on device based settings.\r\n\r\nBased on these settings, we would filter the incoming push notifications within the UNNotificationServiceExtension.didReceive(_:withContentHandler:) method.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would be able to invoke the contentHandler with nil, or a specially defined instance signifying no alert should be shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe current UNNotificationServiceExtension method is defined as:\r\n\r\nfunc didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, \r\nwithContentHandler contentHandler: (UNNotificationContent) -> Void)\r\n\r\nthe proposed definition might be:\r\n\r\nfunc didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, \r\nwithContentHandler contentHandler: (UNNotificationContent?) -> Void)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
