    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iOS 10, calling the property scheduledLocalNotifications on UIApplication can block the main thread for up to 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis happens after calling -[UIApplication scheduleLocalNotification:] or -[UIApplication cancelLocalNotification:] with notifications of repeatInterval set to NSCalendarUnitHour multiple times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Schedule 12 UILocalNotification with repeatInterval set to NSCalendarUnitHour using the method -[UIApplication scheduleLocalNotification:] for 6 times consecutively until maximum number of possible notifications have been set (64).\r\n\r\n2. Cancel 12 scheduled UILocalNotification each time with -[UIApplication cancelLocalNotification:] for 6 times consecutively until all notifications have been cleared.\r\n\r\nSee sample code and video attached. Performance may sometimes be extremely sluggish to the point of unusable (up to 10s, as in the video), but other times just plain slow (around 1s).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalling UIApplication.scheduledLocalNotifications should return the results in under a second without blocking the main thread.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalling UIApplication.scheduledLocalNotifications begin to take longer and longer with each loop of scheduling.This can sometimes take up to 10s to access, blocking the main thread.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5345a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1) Although iOS 10 introduce UserNotifications framework, unfortunately because of bug rdar://26855019, apps still need to use UILocalNotification to schedule notifications that repeat every hour.\r\n\r\n2) Scheduling notifications with repeatInterval set to NSCalendarUnitMinute does not seem to suffer the same performance issue as those with repeatInterval set to NSCalendarUnitHour.\r\n\r\n3) While calling setScheduledLocalNotifications: can address the performance issue somewhat, this is not always possible if the app would like to cancel a specific notification (while the app is backgrounded) without also dismissing other notifications that have already been presented.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SlowNotifications.mp4' and 'Slow Notifications.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qolfsgt0jzl8ksn/Slow%20Notifications.zip?dl=1\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zoqmyvat54b5tx8/SlowNotifications.mp4?dl=1"
