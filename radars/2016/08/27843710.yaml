    description: "Peter Steinberger15-Aug-2016 10:13 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAudio is very important on watchOS - it's a much better way to use as input/output instrument. Yet curiously, AudioToolbox.framework is missing from watchOS, which is crucial in converting audio data to a format that can be played. Sure; this can be prepared on iPhone but if watchOS evolves to be a standalone OS, it should have AudioToolbox. Right now we'll just reimplement what we need in C++ but it just results in a larger binary and probably less optimized code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
