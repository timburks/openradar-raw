    description: "Summary:\r\nSee description. If an app is obviously violating App Store rules, there's no way for me to report that to Apple via the App Store UI. App Store violations are becoming increasingly frequent and the ability to surface violations to the review team via crowdsourcing would improve the quality of the App Store as a whole.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to an app on the App Store that is clearly violating copyright, is offensive, or a knock-off of another successful app.\r\n2. Tap the share icon on the top right to open the App Store share sheet.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a action extension that allows users to report the app. Once the extension is selected, I am prompted for my Apple ID password (or Touch ID), and a view appears prompting the user why the app is being reported:\r\n\r\n* Spam\r\n* Nude imagery\r\n* Inciting Violence\r\n* Intellectual Property Violation\r\n* Copy of Another App\r\n* Other\r\n\r\nThe user is then allowed to also write an optional brief message accompanying the report.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo action extension appears in the share sheet."
