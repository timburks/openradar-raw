        Summary:
        I just logged into my iPad and found the issue as you can see in the attached video. The Springboardâ€™s bottom bar is really broken and it stays that way when entering or exiting apps.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - No idea what I did to make that happen.

        Expected Results:
        - It should look like always, with the nice white blur

        Actual Results:
        - See the attached video. Stuff is really funky!

        Regression:
