    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA Swift protocol extension's implementation of a static property that was declared in a public protocol causes the compiler to crash when the protocol extension's implementation is also declared public. A sample playground and crash log are attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a playground or other Swift file, declare a *public* protocol with a static property.\r\n2. Create a protocol extension for it.\r\n3. Implement the static property in the protocol extension by having it get and set some computed value (e.g. setting/getting a property in NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults()). Do NOT declare it public.\r\n4. Create a *public* struct or class that implements the protocol.\r\n5. The compiler will flag the static property in the protocol extension, saying that it needs to be public.\r\n6. Add a public modifier to the property's implementation in the protocol extension, and watch the compiler crash with a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the static property in the protocol extension to compile properly when being declared public.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the static property in the protocol extension is made public, then the Swift compiler crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) with the iPhone 5 simulator running iOS 9.3, all on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB memory\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PublicStaticProtocolExtensions.playground.zip' and 'com.apple.dt.Xcode.Playground_2016-08-25-125719_Developer-Jasons-laptop.crash' were successfully uploaded."
