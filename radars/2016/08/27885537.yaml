    description: "- Area:\r\n    WebKit\r\n\r\n\r\n- Summary:\r\n    When a WKWebview is embedded in a UICollectionViewCell,\r\n    if your WKWebview contains a web gallery or any other view who have to handle some gesture, you'll have some weird behaviour will swiping on the web gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Steps to Reproduce:\r\n    Implement a UICollectionView with a certain number of cells,\r\n    add a WKWebView inside each cell of the UICollectionView,\r\n    load \"http://www.apple.com/\" in those WKWebview.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Expected Results:\r\n    On iOS 9, iOS will consider the gesture of the WKWebview instead of the gesture of the UICollectionView and you will have to swipe outside of the gallery for swiping to the next cell of the UICollectionView.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Actual Results:\r\n    On iOS 10, iOS struggle to choose which gesture prioritize. When you'll swipe inside the web gallery of the WKWebview, the webview and collectionView will began to scroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Configuration:\r\n    iPad Mini Wifi, iPad 4 Wifi\r\n\r\n- Example:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7ivnj0aoq2ztnom/TestSwipeGesture.zip?dl=0"
