    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen reloading a page in Safari, content blocker rules are disregarded. The first time loading a web page, the content blocker rules are in effect. When tapping the reload button, though, they are not. This occurs for all content blockers.\r\n\r\nIn other words, tapping the reload button is now equivalent to long pressing it and then selecting \"Reload Without Content Blockers\" in earlier versions.\r\n\r\nNote that this only happens if you reload pages by tapping the reload button, but not when you \"reload\" them by tapping in the url/search field followed by tapping OK in the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari with a content blocker activated in Settings.\r\n2. Load an arbitrary web page.\r\n3. Notice that the content blocker is blocking whatever it is supposed to block.\r\n4. Tap the Safari reload button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA web page where the content blocker blocked what it was supposed to block.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe full web page, with no blocked assets.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 beta 4 (14A5322e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
