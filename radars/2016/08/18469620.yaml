    description: "Summary:\r\nIf UIScrollView's contentSize.width is slightly larger than its frame.width, UIPageViewController can not page correctly. I guess it is because UIScrollView wants to scroll itself since contentSize.width > frame.width but it can not do the scrolling well for the margin is so small.\r\n\r\nThis issue only occur on iOS 8, not on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nRun the sample app on device or simulator with screen of 320-point width because the special contentSize is hard-coded for this size. But I believe this issue also occurs on devices with other screens, you just need another special contentSize.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is in [DataViewController viewDidLoad].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Page right.\r\n3. Page left.\r\n4. Repeat 2~3 until you see the issue.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/cDGZOyu46oK"
