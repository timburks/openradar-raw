    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached movie.  You can see that I'm looking at some code.  I resize the debug area, say to make more room, and the code editor jumps a dozen or two lines of code.\r\n\r\nI encountered this prior to screen filming, deep in a debug situation, looking at some code, resizing the console a couple of lines to look at some output, and Xcode decided to jump me to a random place in the code; pretty much destroying my mental state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode doesn't scroll the text editor around randomly due to unrelated input.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 4 (8S188o)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just scroll back to where you wanted to be, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'jump-jump-jump.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
