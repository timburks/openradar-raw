    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a new build of an app is installed either via Xcode, TestFlight and App Store on iOS 10, all existing scheduled local notifications begin to ignore the custom alert sound and play the default alert sound instead. Even newly scheduled notifications after the update will not play the custom alert sound. The only way to resolve the problem is to restart the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Schedule a UILocalNotification with a custom soundName\r\n2. Run the app\r\n3. Return to Home screen\r\n4. Wait for notification to fire\r\n5. Verify that custom alert sound is played\r\n6. Return to Xcode and increase build number. Run app.\r\n7. Return to Home screen\r\n8. Wait for notification to fire\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification plays the custom alert sound as assigned\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification plays the default alert sound\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5345a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWatch video reproducing the bug, or check out sample project.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus (and all iOS 10 simulators)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Wrong Notification Sound.mp4' and 'Notification With Wrong Alert Sound.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vjd4tiict7uo4ll/Wrong%20Notification%20Sound.mp4?dl=1\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1nxo8xr5antpt22/Notification%20With%20Wrong%20Alert%20Sound.zip?dl=1"
