    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a collection view where I both add and move content in a batch update:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nAB\r\nCD\r\nEF\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nA\r\nGBC\r\nHDEF\r\n\r\nI was incorrectly moving B to (1, 0) and adding at G (1, 0), which should fail.  Instead I get one of three random behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. The step succeeds and produces an invalid animation which may not be seen offscreen.\r\n2. The app crashes in [UICollectionView _endItemAnimations] with SIGABRT incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.\r\n3. The app crashes in [UICollectionView _computeItemUpdates] with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nIf I turn on Guard Malloc, it will always crash on case 3.  Given the unpredictable behavior of the app on this error, and the fact the SDK appears to be writing to freed memory, the SDK should throw an NSInternalInconsistencyException here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSInternalInconsistencyException, similar to other invalid batch updates\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInvalid animation (cells don't match final data) or memory related crash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.1.2, 8 beta 5, simulator and device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS simulator, iPad Air"
