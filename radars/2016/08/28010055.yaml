    description: "Area:\r\nReminders\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nForce-touching on a reminder on my lock screen and selecting any of the actions does nothing. The “X” button to close the notification also does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Force-touch a reminder on your lock screen.\r\n2. Tap “Mark as Completed”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe reminder disappears and is marked as completed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0 (14A5345a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI had already marked this reminder as complete on my Mac, so it might be related to reminders that have already been completed. See the attached video.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus 64GB AT&T (MKTQ2LL/A)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Reminders Notification Issue.mov' was successfully uploaded."
