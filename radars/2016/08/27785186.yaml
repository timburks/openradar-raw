    description: "Never mind, closing myself do to user error. 'Working as Designed' :)\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205918\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iCloud Settings for a Managed Apple ID, there is no option for turning Mail on and off. Also, when launching Mail.app it appears nothing is configured, but when you try to create an iCloud connection it says it has already been added.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign into iPad (NOT a Shared iPad) with a Managed Apple ID.\r\n2. Note your options for turning things on and off.\r\n3. Launch Mail.app. You are prompted to create various mail connections.\r\n4. Select iCloud and sign in with the same Managed Apple ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. I would expect to see Mail as an option to turn on and off.\r\n3. I would expect to see my iCloud mail.\r\n4. I would expect it to sign me into my iCloud Mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2. Mail is missing\r\n3. I am prompted to configure a connection\r\n4. An error pops up 'This iCloud account has already been added to your iPad'"
