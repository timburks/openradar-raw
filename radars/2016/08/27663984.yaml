        Summary:
        An image set that uses lossy compression renders incorrectly on a device if it uses lossy compression.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Build and run the attached project on an iPad Pro (9.7 inch) device
        2) Tap “Asset Tests” then “Adaptive”

        Expected Results:
        The image should render correctly

        Actual Results:
        The image is flipped

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:

        • The image is Harbor_Universal in the Images.xcassets file.

        • The rendering problem changes depending on the type of compression used (GPU vs. Basic.) See the attached screenshots.

        • There is no problem on an 8-bit sRGB device.

        • The iOS Simulator renders the image correctly: this problem only occurs on the device hardware.

        • Turning off lossy compression causes the image to render correctly.
