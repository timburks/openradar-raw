        Summary:

        UIWebView doesn’t respect the `touch-action: manipulation` CSS rule to disable the double-tap gesture and remove the 350ms delay

        Steps to Reproduce:

        (See the Xcode project attached)
        1. Open a page in a UIWebView that contains an element styled as `touch-action: manipulation`
        2. Tap on the element

        Expected Results:

        The click event gets dispatched immediately

        Actual Results:

        Click event gets delivered after a 350ms delay

        Regression:

        Doesn’t occur on WebKit2 clients (WKWebView & Safari)
