    description: "When supplying information with any of the the background transfer methods, the watch app seems to be woken, but never forwarded a WKWatchConnectivityRefreshBackgroundTask in Handle. Background transferred data is then lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Following the path defined by the WatchConnectvity sample code\r\n2. Compile, run, and dismiss the Watch app\r\n3. Forward a background message to Watch App\r\n4. See Watch App awoken in background, handle(_:) called, but no WKWatchConnectivityRefreshBackgroundTask is delivered. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected handle to be passed WKWatchConnectivityRefreshBackgroundTask so we can defer completing the task until after all background information has been processed. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp is woken and handle(_:) is invoked, but not passed a WKWatchConnectivityRefreshBackgroundTask, causing the background session to expire immediately, and suspending the app. Background transferred information is then lost. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatch OS 3 beta 6, iOS Beta 6"
