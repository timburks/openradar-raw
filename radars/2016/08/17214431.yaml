    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen displaying the contents of an NSAttributedString which was initialised from an RTFD document, it seems to be impossible for assets suffixed with the @2x qualifier to be used if the device has a Retina display.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open TextEdit and drag and drop an image. Save as RTFD.\r\n2. Open the package contents in Finder and drag and drop the Retina asset.\r\n3. In an app, initialise an NSAttributedString from the RTFD, and assign it to a UITextView.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the device has a Retina display, image@2x.png is used.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nimage.png is used.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8.0 (12A4265u), iOS 7.1 (11D167)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlthough TextEdit adds \\width and \\height to the RTF, these seem to be ignored by both iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iOS Simulator Screen Shot 7 Jun 2014 9.26.22 pm.png' and 'NSAttributedString RTFD Retina bug.zip' were successfully uploaded."
