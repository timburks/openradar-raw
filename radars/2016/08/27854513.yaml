    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://19565319\n\nSummary:\r\nAs of iOS 10/Xcode 8, an app to which I've heretofore linked the ExternalAccessory framework now triggers errors in the General>Signing tab.\r\n\r\nI'm not using the ExternalAccessory.framework for wireless accessory configuration; it supports bluetooth and directly-connected devices. I don't think it should fail to build or automatically switch on this capability.\r\n\r\nIf I attempt remove this capability, it re-toggles the capability back on. If i remove ExternalAccessory.framework then the signing error is cleared; but the project will now fail to link (of course). Once the ExternalAccessory.framework is added back into the link section, the WAC capability is automatically toggled on and the signing error returns.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new project\r\n* Add the ExternalAccessory.framework to the list of Linked Frameworks and Libraries.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Wireless Accessory Configuration capability should not be turned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Wireless Accessory Configuration capability is turned on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nObserved in Xcode 8 (all betas up to 8S201h)."
