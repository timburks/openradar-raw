    description: I am using the new UserNotifications framework to trigger local notifications on Apple Watch. When I issue a request with the same unique identifier as the one that is currently presented, nothing happens. At a minimum I am expecting to see the notification interface controller’s didReceive method called again to update the notification content. That seems to be the intended way to update the notification content, but the custom presentation is never called again to update its contents.
