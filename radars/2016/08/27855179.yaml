    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 8 beta-6 (also the case in betas 4 & 5), the menu item to toggle comment/uncomment (Editor > Structure > Comment) of code lines is broken and will never be available. The corresponding keyboard shortcut (Cmd-/) does not work either.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place cursor in any line of code.\r\n2. Try to use the menu item to comment or uncomment the line of code.\r\n3. Nothing happens\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line of code should be commented-out (if currently not commented), of uncommented (if currently commented).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\nOS X 10.11.6 \"El Capitan\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a function I literally use hundreds of times each day, so while it seems minor, this is actually a major problem and a productivity-killer, making it very difficult to use Xcode 8.\r\n\r\nHave tested using Swift 2.3 code, and Objective-C code. Have also tested on 3 different computers, all running OS X 10.11.6: 2013 Mac Pro, 2012 MacBook Pro, 2011 MacBook Air. The Xcode comment/uncomment menu is disabled on all of them.\r\n\r\nThe Xcode beta-5 release notes state \"The Editorâ€™s Comment/Uncomment Selection command is functional when enabled. (27524523)\". However, the issue was not fixed for me, and apparently for other people as well. See this discussion thread:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/53339?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2013 Mac Pro\r\n3 GHz, 8 core Intel Xeon E5\r\n64 GB RAM\r\nAMD FirePro D500 3GB\r\nOS X 10.11.6 \"El Capitan\""
