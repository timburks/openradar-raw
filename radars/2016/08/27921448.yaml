        Summary:
        Updating from beta 5 to 6 removed all previously scanned/tagged faces.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Let the iPhone analyze your photos
        Help it with identifying people and confirming additional photos
        Update to latest beta

        Expected Results:
        Still be able to see the previously identified faces

        Actual Results:
        All faces gone

        Notes:
        It's a beta, but still kind of annoying.
