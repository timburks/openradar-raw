    description: |-
        I’ve noticed that occasionally when I press to attempt to activate Force Touch from one of the interface controllers that the animation that occurs while force touch is being activated will freeze, and the app will become unresponsive. While in this state you cannot re-activate force touch and you can’t do anything else in the app.

        From this state you can exit to the watch face or honeycomb by pressing the digital crown. When you return to the app via whatever means the interface controller will be back in its normal state, but now force touch is totally unresponsive. You can’t activate any of the force touch menus at all.
        The only way to regain force touch from this state is to force quit the app and re-launch it, or restart the device.

        This happens on multiple projects I am working on, and happens both when the force touch menu is hard coded in the storyboard and when the menu options are set manually in code. Anecdotally it seems to occur less often when the menu options are defined in the storyboard.
