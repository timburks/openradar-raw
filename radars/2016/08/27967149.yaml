    description: "Summary:\r\nlibxml2's schema validation broke in iOS 10. It did work in any previous iOS version since a couple of years, at least.\r\n\r\nAn example is: It reports \"false\" as not conforming to `xs:boolean`, even though this is clearly wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project's unit tests in Xcode 8, in the simulator: A failure will be reported.\r\n\r\nWhen run in Xcode 7 all works as expected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA unit test failure.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo unit test failure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 6, iOS 10"
