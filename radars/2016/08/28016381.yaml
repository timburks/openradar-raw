        (Disclaimer: I'll call it iCal because I still think that's a better name than Calendar.app)

        Summary:
        iCal on OSX can't set travel time properly, you can only select the default location.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add an event in iCal
        Select "Travel time"

        Expected Results:
        Choose my starting location (either Home or Work or some place else)

        Actual Results:
        Can only select one location

        Regression:
        On iOS this does work.
