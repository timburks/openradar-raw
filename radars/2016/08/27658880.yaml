        Summary:
        In Xcode 8 beta 4 the cmd+/ or comment selection function does not work anymore.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Select some code in the code editor
        - Press cmd+/

        Expected Results:
        The selected code is commented in or out depending on its current state.

        Actual Results:
        The selected text length is decremented by 1. So if before e.g. you had selected ‘[self doSome’ now only ‘[self doSom’ is selected.

        Regression:
