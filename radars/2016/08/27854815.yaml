    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running an underdamped spring animation for UIView.backgroundColor from UIColor.clear color to UIColor.black, there is a short period near the end — overshooting period I guess — during which the background color jumps back from black to clear.\r\n\r\nI guess it has something to do with the new extended color spaces in iOS 10.\r\n\r\nYou can change the animation to normal animation or increment the damping to over 0.9 to see the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample playground.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly on iOS 10.\r\n\r\nCode: https://cloudup.com/ihWiqlVxt1A"
