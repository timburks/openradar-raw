    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit (Maps)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a user is currently navigating somewhere in Apple Maps and then opens a url to navigate somewhere with a different destination location, Apple Maps should ask to add that route to the current navigation session. Use cases include using Gas Buddy, Parking apps, and many more.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this prompt should also appear in CarPlay\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a route in Apple Maps\r\n2. Tap home button and open a third party mapping app (ex. Gas Buddy)\r\n3. In third party app tap a button that will open an Apple Maps url with a destination address (daddr field)\r\n4. Observe the prompt shown on Apple Maps (Screenshot attached)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn addition to Cancel and End Navigation, a button asking to add the destination to the current route in progress such as \"Add Destination\" would be very useful\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPrompt only asks to end navigation or cancel url request\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 3 (14A5309d)"
