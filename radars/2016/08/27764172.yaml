        Summary:

        When a web page opened in UIWebView has configured keyboard events (many websites such as GitHub or Facebook have one-letter keyboard shortcuts for navigation; or basic keys like arrows, escape, ⌘Enter for navigating on lists, accepting selection, closing views), they don’t respond at all to keypresses on a connected keyboard.

        Keyboard events work only in the context of a focused input (with an open keyboard). No keyboard = events don’t get delivered.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open a website with a keyboard shortcut set up and press it
         - for example, go to github.com and press `?`

        Expected Results:

        A keyboard shortcut is triggered (for github, a help view is displayed)

        Actual Results:

        Nothing happens

        Regression:

        This is only true for UIWebView (and possibly WKWebView, unsure), but not for Safari. If you go through those same steps in MobileSafari, the keyboard shortcuts *will* be triggered

        Notes:

        With iPad Smart Keyboard, and all around iOS getting more serious about productivity, keyboard shortcuts are becoming more and more important, so now’s a great time to patch this bug! :)
