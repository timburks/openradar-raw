    description: "Summary:\r\nBeen experiencing this issue since Swift was incorporated into the developer documentation on Firefox. When expanding symbols, Firefox will jump to the wrong place on the page. This bug makes using the Apple developer documentation very annoying to use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open latest version of Firefox\r\n2. Navigate to any ADC library like https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Accounts/Reference/ACAccountClassRef/index.html\r\n3. Expand several symbols from different sections.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEvery time I expand a symbol, I expect the browser's scroll frame to focus to the top of the expanded symbol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen I expand a symbol, it often jumps far above the symbol hundreds of pixels or to near the top of the page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVerified in Firefox 31.6.0 on OS X 10.10.3, but have been experiencing since introduction of Swift documentation. Also verified since then on Firefox on Ubuntu 12.04.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
