    description: "Summary:\r\nI started annotating PSPDFKit to match batter with the Swift 3 style guidelines. However as soon as I added `NS_SWIFT_NAME` to one of the methods, the generated interface refreshed and only shows an empty file since then. However, the code that uses this newly annotated API compiles just fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open an ObjC header file and the assistant editor\r\n- Make the assistant editor show the generated Swift header\r\n- Add NS_SWIFT_NAME(â€¦) to a method, with some swift name in the braces\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Generated interface view refreshes and shows the new Swift method name\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Generated interface view refreshes and shows an empty file\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI tried restarting Xcode, cleaning, deleting derived data, nothing helped.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI attached a video to show how this looks like after restarting Xcode."
