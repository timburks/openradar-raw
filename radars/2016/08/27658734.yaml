        Summary:
        After searching for a place (e.g. Seattle, or Pennsylvania) the label that appears does not scale down when the user zooms out (to expose more of the map). Therefore, the label appears strangely large. I believe this happens with US states as well but isn’t as pronounced as with cities, since the initial zoom scale is more zoomed in (and thus the unadjusted zoomed-out scale is more ridiculous).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        • Search for a place (e.g. Pittsburgh)
        • Zoom out to the minimum zoom scale

        Expected Results:
        • Place name appears reasonably sized, but maybe even disappears at very very small zoom scales

        Actual Results:
        • Place name stays the same size no matter the zoom scale, appearing comically large at smallest zoom scales

        Regression:
        • May not be relevant, but I am observing this on a 3x device e.g. iPhone 6s Plus
