        Summary:
        A custom class of mine, named “Box” was referred to in Swift by just that name. The Swift 3 migrator changed all references to “__ObjC.Box”, which then didn’t compile with the message “Use of undeclared type ‘__ObjC.Box’”

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In Xcode 7 create a project with a Core Data class named “Box” defined in Objective-C
        2. Add a Swift file that uses that class, adding it to the bridging header
        3. In Xcode 8, migrate the project to Swift 3

        Expected Results:
        Either (a) the references Swift become “__ObjC.Box” and the code compiles, or (b) the references stay “Box”

        Actual Results:
        The Swift references to “Box” become “__ObjC.Box” and The compiler returns an error: “Use of undeclared type ‘__ObjC.Box’”
