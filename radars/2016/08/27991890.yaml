    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen displaying a UIActivityViewController on iOS 9, the popoverPresentationController property is nil. However, on iOS 10, this property is not nil. Not sure if there was a change in how this works internally but even so, I've noticed that when trying to attach a UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate, none of the delegate methods get fired. This makes me think that either this shouldn't be presenting using a UIPopoverPresentationController or there is a bug with firing the delegate methods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(From attached POC)\r\n\r\n1. Present a UIActivityViewController\r\n2. Dismiss the UIActivityViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n1. UIActivityViewController instance's popoverPresentationController property is nil\r\n2. UIActivityViewController instance's popoverPresentationController property is not nil but the attached delegate receives messages such as didDismiss\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIActivityViewController.popoverPresentationController is nil on iOS 9 but not nil on iOS 10. On iOS 10, UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate's method for didDismiss is not fired when attached and dismissing the popover.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 7, iOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod Touch 5th gen iOS 10 beta 7, iPhone 6 Simulator iOS 9.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIActivityViewControllerPOC.zip' was successfully uploaded."
