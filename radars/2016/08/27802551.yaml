    description: "Summary:\r\nWe're trying to write a UI Test that verifies that an external link is properly opened outside our app in Safari.app.\r\n\r\nWe successfully recorded a test that taps on a link and then gathers the URL from Safari's.app address bar. Unfortunately the test fails to run and dies with the following assertion:\r\n\r\nAssertion Failure: <unknown>:0: UI Testing Failure - Failure getting snapshot Error Domain=XCTestManagerErrorDomain Code=12 \"Failed to get main window after 30 retries: kAXErrorServerNotFound (see <rdar://problem/15530121>)\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Failed to get main window after 30 retries: kAXErrorServerNotFound (see <rdar://problem/15530121>)}\r\n\r\nWe're unsure whether one can test the device environment outside of the app under test. The Xcode's recorder feature suggests so but tests always fail when trying to run them and the documentation isn't clear about it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Create an empty project with UI Test support.\r\n2.Add a UITextView with http://www.example.com as text\r\n3.Disable 'editable' flag and enable 'link detection' on the UITextView\r\n4.Record a test that taps on the UITextView and taps on the status bar \"back to app\" button.\r\n5.Run the test, the aforementioned assertion will occur\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUI Test be able to run outside app under test\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAssertion occurs\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 and Xcode 8 beta 5"
