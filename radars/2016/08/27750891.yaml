    description: "In Instruments there is an option to filter details window based on textual query. For example in Allocations tool you can filter collected information based on the filter. Once you run the same profiling tool again (with filter query unchanged) you can see that filter is not being applied to the new session\n\nThe problem goes away as soon as you trigger filter refresh (by toggling filtering options or by typing and removing a single character.\n\nPlease see attached video for further details \nIt shows how on the 4th run of the same profiling tool filters that were applied in the previous run are not applied until toggled"
