        Summary:
        It took some time but it happened. Stumbled upon some photos that the iPhone can't download from the iCloud Photo Library, from here on I will call it THE CLOUD.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Enable iCloud Photo Library

        Expected Results:
        THE CLOUD stores all my originals. I can delete all my originals and live a free life knowing that all my photos are backed up and easily accessible.

        Actual Results:
        THE CLOUD stores all my originals. I can't delete all my originals because THE CLOUD is having a bad day and I can't access my originals anymore.

        Regression:
        Dear THE CLOUD, it's me not you.

        Notes:
        Luckily for me I didn't trust the iCloud Photo Library so I kept all my originals. Even when my Mac kept asking me to Optimize Storage I told him to go take a long walk because he would have to pry my precious photos from my cold dead fingers.

        I realise this is not a sustainable strategy: my photo collection keeps growing while my HD doesn't grow at the same speed. So sometime into the future I will have to ditch keeping all my originals on my laptop. Since iCloud Photo Library doesn't expect a library to be "sharded" over multiple HD's, at that point I will have to admit defeat and stop using the iCloud Photo Library.

        But hey, it was fun while it (kind of) lasted.

        For what it's worth, one of the missing photos is called "IMG_4237.JPG" it was take 18 Aug 2013 at 12:46. If it helps, I can list some more, but I'm not really sure how I could give you an iCloud ID.
