    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen searching for Parking in Apple Maps in CarPlay it would be very useful to have some of the Parkopedia information. Right now listings can typically have all the same title such as \"Parking\" and include less than relevant information such as the Yelp rating. This makes the listings not glance able and harder to surface relevant information.\r\n\r\nI would propose in the subhead that instead things such as current price or hours of operation would be far more useful. The location and ETA values are fine as well. The header could be \"Parking near...\" and then some landmark as well\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Open Maps in CarPlay\r\n3. Tap Destinations\r\n4. Tap Parking\r\n5. Observe results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTableview Cell for parking result would include:\r\n\r\nMore contextual title label such as \"Parking near Bank of America\" and more relevant information including hours or price at the current time of day\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGeneric title label that says \"Parking\" with a yelp rating, location, and ETA."
