        Summary:
        When “Keyboard Clicks” is disabled in Settings > Sounds, most keyboard presses are muted except for Space, Delete, and Return.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. In iOS beta 4, open Settings > Sounds and make sure “Keyboard Clicks” is disabled. Ensure that the mute hardware switch is not enabled on your iPhone.
        2. Open any app that allows you to type.
        3. Start typing and note the sounds played when the Space, Delete, or Return key is pressed.


        Expected Results:
        All keyboard presses should be muted.

        Actual Results:
        Distinct keypress audio events are played when the Space, Delete, and Return keys are pressed.

        Regression:
        All prior versions of iOS muted all keypresses when “Keyboard Clicks” is disabled in Settings > Sounds.
