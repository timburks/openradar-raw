    description: "Summary:\r\nIt should be difficult to Erase All Content and Settings if you have pending iCloud photos that have not uploaded yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. My aunt went to her son’s tap dance camp recital and filmed the final performance on her iPhone 6.\r\n2. Afterwards, she started backing up her phone, because a replacement from AppleCare had arrived (defective GPS antenna), and she was going to restore the new phone from the iCloud backup of the old one.\r\n3. The old phone was not on Wi-Fi because she was not at home. She was backing up to iCloud over cellular, because she’s locked in to an AT&T unlimited data plan, so she doesn’t really worry about Wi-Fi. (Jealous.)\r\n4. Once the iCloud backup had completed, she began restoring the new phone from the backup.\r\n5. While everything was still restoring, she erased the old phone and mailed it back to Apple. Perhaps inadvisable, but, I suspect, not uncommon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause she had never gotten the old iPhone on Wi-Fi and power simultaneously before wiping it, the videos from her son’s tap dance performance were never uploaded to iCloud. However, when she looked in iCloud settings at the backup process, she saw that the backup had been completed. Either iCloud photo status should be reflected in the iCloud Backup Settings screen (because, to most users, they are conceptually indistinguishable), or attempting to wipe the phone should alert the user that there are photos that have not finished uploading to iCloud. For bonus points, the alert should show _which_ photos have not been uploaded, because that makes it much harder to ignore, and give steps to upload them (power + Wi-Fi).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere was no indication in iCloud Backup settings that the photos had not uploaded, and no warning, other than the standard generic one, when wiping the phone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem when photos were included in the normal backup, which I believe was the case before iCloud Photo Library.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
