    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I use Base Internationalization of an XIB or Storyboard, I don't have enough control over the resulting XLIFF file.  I would like:\r\n\r\n1. To be able to set the id used for the string\r\n2. To provide an comment to aid translation\r\n3. To indicate that a string is not supposed to be translated -- for example, I have a label that will show the user's name -- I put in a name so I can see the layout in IB, but that name will always be replaced at run-time.  I don't want that name in the XLIFF\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Base Internationalization on an XIB or Storyboard\r\n2. Export for Localization\r\n3. Note that the XLIFF has random ids, no comments, and some strings that I don't want translated\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome way to control the XLIFF better\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn XLIFF that isn't as useful as it could be"
