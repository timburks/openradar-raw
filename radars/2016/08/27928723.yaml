        Summary:
        I put all my money-related apps in a home screen folder. I wanted to name the folder with a finance-related word that can be spelled with currency symbols, and the best I could come up with was $€££ (“SELL”). Not very good, but it’s my dumb little thing and I like it. The point is that VoiceOver reads it as “Dollar Sign U-ur Folder”.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Name a folder $€££, or just open Notes and add that text to a new note.
        2. Get VoiceOver to read the note.

        Expected Results:
        VoiceOver says “Dollar Sign Euro Sign Pound Sign Pound Sign”.

        Actual Results:
        VoiceOver says “Dollar Sign U-ur”

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        In the attached screen recording, you can see that it pronounces the characters correctly when read individually. It only messes up when they’re strung together.
