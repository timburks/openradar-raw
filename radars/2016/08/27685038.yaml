    description: "Summary:\nDuring and after enabling accessibility screen zoom, single finger swiping in scroll areas is broken. Sometimes it takes three or four swipes to actually have the gesture recognized (see attached video). This only seems to happen during and after zoom has been enabled via three-finger double-tap, on a device that has been freshly hard restarted, problem is not present. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Turn on Zoom (Settings>General>Accessibility>Zoom)\n2. Double tap with three fingers to active zoom.\n- Observe the performing a single finger swipe in a scroll view such as a table view does not register touches on many occasions. \n3. Deactivate zoom by double tapping with three fingers again.\n- Observe that the intermittent touch handling issue is now still present. \n\nExpected Results:\nTouches should always be handled. \n\nActual Results:\nSee observations and video. \n\nRegression:\nHas been present on all iOS 10 beta releases thus far (1, 2, 3, 4)"
