        JavaScript `console.log`s, exceptions, and errors are not logged to the app (system) log.

        They only exist in their own web console log. This makes it cumbersome to view them in apps that use web views, because we have to *first* connect to the web view using Web Inspector, and only then we can reproduce an issue, or observe an important diagnostic log or other web view error.

        It should be possible to enable, perhaps as a development/diagnostic switch, redirecting of all web view logs and errors to the system log, so one can see them in Xcode pane or on devices through the system log.

        There already exists a private API: _logsPageMessagesToSystemConsoleEnabled on WKPreferences to allow this. I suggest this API be made public.
