        I’m seeing the notification delegate method for willPresent notification get called on my notification center delegate, but when I return .alert or .sound nothing actually happens on either the simulator or the device. When this happens and I return the .alert setting I’m expecting for the default system alert to be presented for my notification, but that doesn’t happen.

        The notification does display properly while I’m on the watch face, just not while the app is running in the foreground.
