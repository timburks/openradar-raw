    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApp icons are supposed to exude the personality of their content. Currently, the CarPlay Now Playing icon looks like a relic of the old Music app. It exists to get the drivers immediately to the basic controls of their media. This icon's color scheme doesnâ€™t reflect the content at all and so my proposal would be to have it show a blurred album art background with the play icon glyph accented by some minor effects (in my example a light shadow around the glyph and small white glow around the edges for legibility). The transition to this single view thus becomes far more harmonious to the overall presentation of the view and the song's content. In cases where no music is playing then perhaps the current icon suffices, but it just seems extremely out of place in modern iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start CarPlay\r\n2. Play some music from any source.\r\n3. Observe CarPlay home screen\r\nBonus:\r\n4. Tap now playing icon and see transition from orange and pink to album art.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNow Playing icon to have elements of the album art of the content\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIcon has orange and pink gradient representing old iOS 8 music app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10 beta 3 (14A5309d)"
