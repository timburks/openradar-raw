        Summary:
        I scheduled an automatic nightly update with my iPhone from iOS 10 beta 6 to iOS 10 beta 7. In the morning I was greeted with an error on my lock screen that says ‘[Internal Only] Software Update failed to install with error 3 Error Domain=com.apple.softwareupdateservices.error Code=3 “(null)”’

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Wait for iOS to announce that a software update is available
        - Choose ‘later’
        - Enter your passcode
        - Wait for the next day

        Expected Results:
        - The update was installed
        - Maybe a message is shown, telling you that the update was successful

        Actual Results:
        - On the lock screen I see the message: [Internal Only] Software Update failed to install with error 3 Error Domain=com.apple.softwareupdateservices.error Code=3 “(null)”

        Regression:
