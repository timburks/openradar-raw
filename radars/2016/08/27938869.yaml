    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you save a build log through the report navigator in Xcode, it is saved as a lightly stylized rtf file. This makes it difficult to edit with a plain text editor that doesn't explicitly handle rtf files (such as vim). Instead these files should be saved with no stylization in a plain txt or log file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to Xcode's report navigator\r\n2. Click \"Save...\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe saved log is a plain text file of some sort\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe log is saved as an rtf file and a few lines are bolded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 8 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
