    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a project that does not use Storyboards, if the window property on the application's AppDelegate is instantiated directly on the property declaration, the focus events are not forwarded to the applications responders.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached Xcode project and open AppDelegate.swift\r\n2. Run the tvos_bug target on the Apple TV Simulator for iOS 10\r\n3. Try to interact with the table view, and you can't.\r\n4. On AppDelegate.swift, go to line 116 and uncomment it. Now, go to line 112 and leave the property declaration as follows:\r\n\r\nvar window: UIWindow?\r\n\r\nLeave everything else as-is.\r\n\r\n5. Run the project again. Now you can move the focus around.\r\n\r\nYou can check that this is not only happening with UITableView by changing the rootViewController for the window to be an instance of ViewController and trying to move focus between the two UIButtons on screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAs long as the window is instantiated correctly and made key and visible, all focus events should be able to go through the responder chain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the window property is instantiated from the property declaration itself, focus events are not being forwarded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThis is reproducible on Xcode 8 b4 and b5 as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nDownload example project: http://oscarswanros-personalcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/tvos_bug.zip"
