    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn our app we show web content in a UIWebView. Part of our app allows the user to tap on an email address that's shown inside the UIWebView and have that create a new message with that email address as the recipient.\r\n\r\nTo implement this we make use of the UIDataDetectorTypeLink data detector in the UIWebView. Unfortunately if we have an email address that looks like this:\r\n\r\n#distribution-list@company.com\r\n\r\nThe leading \"#\" is dropped from the email address that is resolved by the data detector. As a result, tapping on the email address creates a message to the wrong address. The email has distribution-list@company.com as the address instead of #distribution-list@company.com\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot showing the DOM as shown in safari web debugger. Note that the leading \"#\" is ignored and dropped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a UIWebView that shows a HTML document that contains the following user facing text\r\n\r\n#distribution-list@company.com\r\n\r\nEnable UIDataDetectorTypeLink data detection on the UIWebView \r\n\r\nNote that the email address is linkified but the leading \"#\" is not.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe entire email address including the \"#\" should be linkified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"#\" is not linkified, and tapping on the link results in an email address that does not include the leading \"#\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS9+\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone / iPad - any\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'DOM inspector of sample email.png' was successfully uploaded."
