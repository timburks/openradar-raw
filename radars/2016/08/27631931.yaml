    description: "Summary:\r\nSee attached video.\r\n\r\nWas editing a xib file, and thanks to several bugs I've already reported (rdar://27630700,rdar://27149543,rdar://27268385), the xib file icon stays dirty.  \r\n\r\nI don't have OCD, but I like a tidy environment, so out of frustration I did cmd-S a couple of times in rapid succession.  Xcode then turned toes-up in SPOD-ville.\r\n\r\nattached is the project (the one I've been _slowly_ working on today. This is my 12th xcode radar filing since this morning.  #ilyxc)\r\n\r\nattached is a sample from Activity Monitor\r\n\r\nattached is a sysdiagnose run performed via `sudo sysdiagnose -f ~/Desktop/`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)\r\n10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's really not that big a deal - just don't do anything with any kind of speed, but\r\nwhen these kinds of things happen day-in, day-out, it's just another heavy-sigh\r\ndeath-of-a-thousand-cuts that makes using Xcode unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nattached is all sorts of stuff.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'sysdiagnose_2016.07.31_19-50-04-0400.tar.gz', 'xcode-sample.txt', 'MyFatnessPal.zip' and 'fans-gone-wild.mp4' were successfully uploaded."
