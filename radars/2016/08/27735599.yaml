    description: "Summary:\r\nFilms are deleted once they have been watched. This is a serious usability problem when you have kids -- who often like to watch the same movie over and over and over and over and over again.\r\n\r\nAnd this is especially a problem when you're on a slow and sometimes troublesome network. I went for the 64 GB model of the box because that would be enough to hold the films my son watches frequently, but it seems they don't stick around after they're watched anyway.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Wait 4 hours to download a film on my slow network\r\n2. Watch the new film\r\n3. Son really enjoyed it and want to watch the film again immediately\r\n4. Disappoint son by telling him he has to wait another 4 hours for film to download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect films to not be deleted as soon as they're watched, but to stick around until the space is needed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFilms that you finish watching are deleted more or less immediately so you cannot watch it again if you don't have a (fast) network.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2.2 (12Y825)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe designers clearly don't have kids and poor network!"
