        Summary:

        If another view controller is presented from the MSMessagesAppViewController, the top and bottom are overlaid by the top and bottom Messages bars. The top and bottom layout guides should reflect that they are within the Messages App interface.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1: Create a Messages App Extension
        2: Create UIViewController subclass with views on top and bottom constrained to topLayoutGuide and bottomLayoutGuide
        3: Present the new UIViewController with either storyboard segue or presentViewController: method
        4: Observer that the top and bottom of the view are obscured by the Messages bottom and top bars
        5: Observe that the topLayoutGuide length is 20 and the bottomLayoutGuide length is 0

        Expected Results:

        The top layout guide should match the height of the top Messages bar interface (name + chevron)
        The bottom layout guide should match the height of the bottom Messages bar interface (input)

        Actual Results:

        The layout guides seem to behave as if the view controller is full screen

        Regression:

        I have observed the issue in Xcode 8 beta 5+6

        Notes:

        I have not seen any mention of presenting view controllers within the Message App Extension, but it should definitely be an option for an extension of even moderate complexity. Presenting separate view controllers for different areas of functionality is a bedrock feature of iOS. When presenting a new view controller however, the potentially obscuring interface elements of the container should update the layout guides.
