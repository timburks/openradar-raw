    description: "Suppose there are two measurements for temperature. One in fahrenheit, other in celcius, when adding them together using + operator, result is mathematically wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip the MeasurementsAndUnits.playground from attached zip file.\r\n2. Open in Xcode\r\n3. Look at the results where totalTemperature is calculated. Line 12 - Line 18\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo measurements of same type with different units should add up correctly mathematically when added using + operator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo measurements of same type with different units don't add up correctly mathematically when added using + operator."
