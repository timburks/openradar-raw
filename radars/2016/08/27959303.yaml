    description: I've given it an honest try, but I'm still really flustered when macOS capitalizes the first letter of the first word of a sentence. Would you consider moving this to another option in keyboard preferences? I still like proper nouns getting capitalized, and it feels like correcting the two is separate enough of a concern to warrant it.
