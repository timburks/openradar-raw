    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` command hangs indefinitely for projects with Core Data. On a new project it hangs 100% of the time for me. On an existing project it hangs approximately 20% of the time locally and approximately 60% of the time on my CI server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new single view iOS app via the template in Xcode\r\n2. Choose to use Core Data\r\n3. Run `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -project <path-to-project>\r\n4. Repeat the command several times if necessary \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the command to return.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe command never returns.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 6 (8S201h)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.6 (15G31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/50372 helped me diagnose the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on both my local machine (OS version below) as well as my CI server, which is running the latest Sierra beta."
