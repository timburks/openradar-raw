    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently CarPlay's \"smarts\" are limited to jumping into a specific app and then having the relevant content presented in that grouping. For example, suggested addresses and information are presented only if I open the Maps app. Taking advantage of the behavioral patterns Siri learns in iOS 9 around context and time of day, it would be exciting to incorporate a more visual version of these proactive features in a page that appears to the left of the CarPlay home screen (similar to the phone's Springboard interface). These could include places of interest that might be suggested, home kit actions that apply when leaving the house, seeing when the next event may be, or other car-appropriate Siri actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser currently has to press and hold home button/steering wheel control and remember particular actions Siri can perform.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 8 beta 5 (12A4345d), CarPlay R11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached screenshot the weather icon in the upper left corner has another radar associated with it:\r\n18207766\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus, Verizon, 16 GB, CarPlay R11"
