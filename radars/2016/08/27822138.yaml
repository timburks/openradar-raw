        Summary:

        When the currently-focused <textarea> (presumably any input) gets removed from DOM, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t get hidden. This is a regression since iOS 9.3.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open and run the attached test case project in Xcode. Or:
        1. Make a page that contains a <textarea>, and something that causes it to get quickly removed from DOM
        2. Open in UIWebView
        3. Tap on the textarea (keyboard gets opened)
        4. Do the action that causes it to be removed

        Expected Results:
        Keyboard automatically hides

        Actual Results:
        Keyboard stays on screen, and keeps dispatching keypress events to `document`.

        Regression:
        This doesn’t reproduce on iOS 9.3 and earlier (also try running test case project in Xcode 7)
