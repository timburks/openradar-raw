    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 10 beta 7, when the user taps on a received remote notification while the app was in background, the ApplicationDelegate method \r\n\r\n\r\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))handler\r\n\r\nis NOT called.\r\n\r\nWe realised that if implemented, the legacy method \r\n\r\n-(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo\r\n\r\nis called in this case.\r\n\r\nThis breaks backward compatibility and would force us to update\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Implement the method -[AppDelegate application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:]\r\n- Send app to background using the home button\r\n- Send a remote user  notification to that app\r\n- Tap on the received notification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe delegate method -[AppDelegate application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:] is called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification delegate method is called."
