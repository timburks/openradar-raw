    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving the ability to define, for a Today Widget Extension, which iOS versions the widget is adapted to, would be good. Thus, you would be able to have one widget extension tailored to iOS 8 and 9, and one completely different widget extension tailored to iOS 10.\r\n\r\nThe reason: iOS 10's widgets are massively redesigned, and any widget that would fit in iOS 10 would seem widely out of place in iOS 9. The light (almost white) background color, the new compact (fixed) size, and the removal of the left margin inset provides totally new conditions. Simple adaptations are not possible."
