    description: "Summary:\r\nIf ones starts playing non-downloaded podcast and in parallel also start downloading, then when it gets downloaded playing will be stopped and reminded to the start position or to the one before downloading.\r\nIt's a little bit frustrating.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start playing of non-downloaded podcast.\r\n2. Start downloading of podcast.\r\n3. Wait till downloading finishes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt'd be nice to get podcast continue playing but bow from locally downloaded file. If it's not possible and int's necessary to stop playing then at least it should store current position.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPodcast is stopped and current playing position is lost, i.e. it's rewinded to beginning if we start playing from beginning. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\niTunes 12.3.2.35\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt's actual for all the last versions as I can remember."
