    description: "Summary:\r\nMPRemoteCommandCenter commands (e.g. playCommand, pauseCommand, etc) aren’t triggered when playing music with MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer.\r\n\r\nSample project available here: https://github.com/robmaceachern/MPRemoteCommandCenter-Bug\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample project and run on an iOS 10 beta 6 device that has songs in the media library.\r\n2. Allow media library access when prompted.\r\n3. Select “Open Player” on the device\r\n4. Select “Play” on the device. You should hear audio playing.\r\n5. Open the iOS Control Center by swiping from bottom of screen.\r\n6. Attempt to pause the playing song by selecting the Control Center pause button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe playing song should pause.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe song audio continues to play and the Control Center now playing info changes to an unrelated song.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem also seems to exist in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNone of the MPRemoteCommandCenter commands I’ve tested are triggered when using MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer. The sample project registers handlers for nextTrackCommand, previousTrackCommand, playCommand, and pauseCommand.\r\n\r\nThis also impacts other remote control methods beyond Control Center (e.g. headphone controls and presumably car controls, etc)."
