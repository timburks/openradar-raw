    description: "ummary:\r\nWhen writting a file with the transparent zlib compression enabled to the HFS+ filesystem (e.g. ditto --hfsCompression /etc/passwd /tmp/), a KAuth callback registered in the KAUTH_SCOPE_FILEOP does not get the flag KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE_MODIFIED when the target file of the ditto is being closed.\r\n\r\nThis happens even when the file is copied from different filesystem (e.g. a network share or removable device).\r\n\r\nTherefore the target file simply likely bypasses any indexing, backuping or antivirus tools which may rely on the KAuth mechanism.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCompare KAuth callbacks within the KAUTH_SCOPE_FILEOP when using ditto with and without the --hfsCompression command line option.\r\n\r\n(If you find it useful, I can provide a Kext logging all such callbacks into system.log.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing the HFS compression should not have any impact on the data passed into the KAuth callbacks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee description.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nProbably any OS X version. Tested on 10.8.5 build 12F45, 10.10.5 build 14F27, 10.11 build 15A284\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll configurations.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
