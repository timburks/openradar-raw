Create a new iOS application on iTunes Connect, or navigate to an existing one that has not yet been submitted to the App Store.\r\n2. Navigate to the \"App Information\" tab.\r\n3. Under \"General Information\", find \"License Agreement\", and click \"Edit\".\r\n4. Select \"Apply a custom EULA to all chosen territories. If you don't choose all territories, Apple's standard EULA will apply to all remaining ones. Custom EULAs must meet Apple's minimum terms.\"\r\n5. Under \"Custom License Agreement\", paste the text in the attached document (\"EULA.txt\")\r\n6. Under \"Territories\", check \"All\", then check \"Done\".\r\n7.
