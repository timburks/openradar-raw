        I have an extensive library of ePub titles that are shared through iCloud. I notice that in recent iOS 10 betas, covers are often not displaying correctly. Instead, I see generic covers based on the metadata, as shown in the attached screenshot.

        I have the impression that iBooks generally tries to load covers interactively and then cache the results. So when entering, e.g., a collection of books that hasn’t been viewed before, you’ll normally see generic covers for a short while, but the real covers will quickly pop in. From then on, you’ll always see the actual covers.

        In the current beta, I have the impression that the cache is being updated, but that there’s something wrong with the connection to the logic that displays the books. In particular:

        1) If you navigate to a set of “coverless” books and leave it displayed for a while, the covers will not update. But if you then quit and restart iBooks, the covers will now display.

        2) However, if you simply navigate to a different collection, then back to the one with missing covers, the covers will still be drawn as their generic versions.
