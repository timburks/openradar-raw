    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAdded custom font \"riffic.ttf\" to app. Created two Labels using the custom font. The first label field does not use size class customization. The second label uses size class customization. Xcode renders the custom font both in the storyboard and in the preview. When built and run on the simulator the first Label renders the custom font successfully while the second Label (i.e., with size class customization) does not render the custom font. This incorrect behavior continues when running the build on a device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a custom font to the project. This includes adding the \"Font provided by application\" entry to Info.plist\r\n2. Add a label to the storyboard.\r\n3. Create a size class for the label and select the custom font.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLabel text would be rendered with custom font selected for size class.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLabel rendered with font size selected in size class, but typeface was the system default.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E230)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApparently reported in 2015. See https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/13682\r\n\r\nThe Xcode project above can be found at GitHub: https://github.com/jsjacob/CustomFontAndSizeClass\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode simulator: iPad Air, iPhone 6s\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Simulator.png', 'CustomFontAndSizeClass-master.zip' and 'Xcode.png' were successfully uploaded."
