        Summary:
        iOS 8 introduced the distinction between "Always" and "While Using" as permissions for an app to use location services. Developers can opt not to offer the "While Using" option, giving users only the choice between "Never" and "Always". While some apps arguably wouldn't function without "Always" location access, I believe the user should always have this choice.

        I am very selective of what apps I trust with the "Always" setting and therefore can't some features in some apps because the developers (and iOS) only give me the choice between "Always" and "Never", thus forcing me to deny the app all access to location services. One example of such an app that I personally use is Fantastical. The newest version of the Uber app is another (though I don't use this).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        n/a

        Expected Results:
        Even when an app only requests "Always" location access, the user should have the option to downgrade the permission level to "When In Use" in Settings > Privacy > Location Services.

        Actual Results:
        The only available settings for such an app in Settings > Privacy > Location Services are "Never" and "Always"

        Regression:
        n/a
