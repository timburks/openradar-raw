    description: "Summary:\r\nI wrote a sample Xcode Extension using the new XcodeKit API, and was able to successfully run it once. On subsequent runs the menu item was grayed out for no discernible reason, preventing me from performing its action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new macOS Cocoa Application\r\n2. Create an Xcode Extension target\r\n3. Run a couple of times\r\n4. Eventually the menu item will be grayed out\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu item is always available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe item is grayed out and unusable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 2 (8S162m)/macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A239j)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A239j)"
