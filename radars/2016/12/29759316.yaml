    description: "Area:\r\nLocation Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUber just upgraded their requested permissions to \"Location Always\" from \"Location While Using\".\r\n\r\nThis company in particular, but as a matter of general principle for all companies, has little reason to be trusted by all users with this data. For instance, a US Senator wrote them about their particular past abuses: https://www.scribd.com/doc/250487488/God-View-Concerns-Sen-Franken-Letter-to-Uber\r\n\r\nParticular company aside, the app *can* function just fine without this data from when users are not using the app. Perhaps not all goals of the company publishing the app can be achieved, but the user's desired function, as well as partial or full functionality of the service can be achieved still with \"Location While Using\" instead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, constantly using location data uses battery life we, as users, can otherwise use in a manner of our choosing.\r\n\r\nThis is a request to change the AppStore rules to require apps to mostly if not entirely function when the \"Location While Using\" permission is selected instead of \"Location Always\", and to require apps to offer \"Location While Using\" before \"Location Always\" or on the same dialog if the general function of the app is not one clearly requiring \"Location Data Always\". \r\n\r\nThe rules should allow no overstatement of the loss of service from denying the more expansive permission, nor allow companies to greatly reduce services they should be able to deliver without ambient location data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall Uber. Start using app. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDialog requesting \"Location While Using\" or \"Location Always\". App should be able to see which permission they have.\r\n\r\nIf you go to location services in settings app, you can choose between Never, While Using, or Always\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDialog requesting \"Location Data Always\" and the app requiring manual entry of addresses thereafter (which users may not know even how to enter, especially in different countries). If you try to schedule a ride, it tells you to turn on location services.\r\n\r\nIf you go to location services in settings app, you can only choose between always and never allowing access to location."
