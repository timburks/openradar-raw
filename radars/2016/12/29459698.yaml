    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThen back button becomes truncated when changing the title from a medium length title (long enough to make it say \"Back\" but not long enough to remove it altogether) to a long title (one that would normally remove the title leaving only the chevron).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a navigation controller\r\n2. Push a second view controller onto it so that the back button shows \"Back\"\r\n3. While still on the same view controller, change the title to something long\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Back\" should disappear completely\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Back\" becomes truncated (i.e. \"Ba…\")\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUse the provided sample project on a 4.7\" screen (i.e. iPhone 6, 6s or 7).\r\n\r\nChanging between short, medium and long titles have the following results:\r\n\r\nS -> M = Switches from the title to “Back”. Good.\r\nS -> L = Switches from the title to no title at all. Good.\r\nM -> S = Stays as “Back”. Acceptable, maybe not ideal.\r\nM -> L = “Back” becomes truncated. Bad.\r\nL -> S = Stays as no title at all. Acceptable, maybe not ideal.\r\nL -> M = Stays as no title at all. Acceptable, maybe not ideal.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ifdqzkbefdy0yv3/SampleBackButton.zip?dl=1"
