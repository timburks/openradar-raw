    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m trying to play a song on an Apple Music playlist on repeat, but setting it to Repeat One has no effect. Up Next still shows all the songs after it, and when it finishes the next song starts. Repeat One seems to work fine for songs in my library\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iTunes, go to For You\r\n2. Open My Favorites Mix (or any other Apple Music playlist)\r\n3. Play a song\r\n4. Click the repeat button in the Now Playing area until it’s set to Repeat One (or use the Controls->Repeat->One menu item)\r\n5. Click the Up Next button\r\n6. Seek to the end of the song\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step 5, Up Next shows the same song repeated over and over. After step 6, the song that was playing starts over\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 5, Up Next shows the remaining songs in the playlist. After step 6, the next song in the playlist starts\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don’t remember trying this in the past\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I tried repeating a song (the same song, actually) in my library, it repeats without issue"
