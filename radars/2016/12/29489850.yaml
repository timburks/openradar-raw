    description: The HealthKit documentation states that HealthKit is designed to manage data from a wide range of sources, automatically merging the data from different sources based on userâ€™s preferences. Apps can also access the raw data for each source, merging the data themselves. However, when users track their workout route using GPS, there is no way for another app to access and visualize this location data. If you track a workout using the Apple Workout app on the Watch, the route is visible in the Apple Activity app on the iPhone but not in the Nike+ app on the iPhone. If you track a workout using the Nike+ app on the Watch, the route is visible in the Nike+ app on the iPhone but not in the Apple Activity app on the iPhone. To improve this situation, the recorded location data associated with a workout should be exposed through the HealthKit API itself and a dedicated permission should be added for this. This would enable dedicated visualization apps to ask a user for permission to access workout location data and show the route.
