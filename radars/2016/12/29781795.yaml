    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen controlling a Mac running macOS 10.12.2 via Screen Sharing, if a keyboard command is used (e.g. Cmd-Shift-C in the Finder to go to \"Computer\") the modifier keys sometimes are not released.  This is visible through:\r\n\r\n- Double-clicking a folder in the Finder, it opens in a new Tab rather than the same window\r\n- Dragging a file into Terminal, it causes Terminal to \"cd\" to the parent directory of the file rather than entering the path into Terminal\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Update a Mac to macOS 10.12.2\r\n2. Control that Mac from another Mac\r\n3. Use keyboard commands\r\n4. Do other things, such as double-clicking a folder in the Finder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOther activities (such as double-clicking a folder in the Finder) execute normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOther activities (such as double-clicking a folder in the Finder) open new Tabs rather than continuing to open folders in the same window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHost:\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 16C67, MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)\r\n\r\nTargets/Slaves:\r\nMacPro5,1 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\nFusion 8.5 Pro 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\nMBP (15-inch, Mid 2012) 10.2.1 (16B2657)\r\nFusion 8.5 Pro 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to be a regression when the target/slave Mac upgrades from macOS 10.12.1 to 10.12.2.  A physical Mac and a VM both running macOS 10.12.1 do not exhibit this issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVMware Fusion with macOS 10.12.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
