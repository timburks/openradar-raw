    description: "Apple ID of the App: 1158733998\r\n\r\n\r\nApple ID of the User: dan@lionheartsw.com\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nApp developers are unable to respond to ratings or reviews provided by customers on the App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into iTunes Connect.\r\n2. Select an app.\r\n3. Go to \"Activity\".\r\n4. Click \"Ratings and Reviews\"\r\n5. Select a country with reviews in the dropdown.\r\n6. Find a review from a user who misunderstands a key component of the app or a user who complained about a feature that's missing that has recently been added.\r\n7. Find a contact button to reach out to this user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe contact button generates a temporary email address that I can use to email this customer. See Craigslist for a similar implementation.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the reply field stays within iTunes Connect and the reply is publicly visible to other users on the App Store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no contact button or reply button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 10.0.1 (12602.2.14.0.7)\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)\r\n4 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nAMD Radeon R9 M295X 4096 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
