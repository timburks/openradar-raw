    description: "Please add arrow keys to the specialized iPad keyboard top bar, alongside the typing suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn the attached screenshot, it would be much easier to hit the arrow key a couple times to get to the space in between the parentheses in the line with the insertion caret than to try to select and drag the caret over to the right spot."
