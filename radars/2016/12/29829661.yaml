    description: "Summary:\r\nSending of this (https://www.vincedes3.com/vincedes3.vcf) VCF file to another individual via iMessage in Messages.app causes the recipient's device to freeze and quit Messages.app as soon as the file is opened. The file appears to be an RTF file contained within VCF format and contains an amount of garbage data, presumably for overflow. examination of logs shows that string overflow occurs in the process of this bug. The ultimate result of this bug is the inability to use Messages.app until the device is restored within iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send above VCF file to target device\r\n2. On target device, open Messages.app\r\n3. Open selected VCF file, and Messages.app will proceed to crash\r\n4. Messages.app will not load\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe opening of the VCF card should entail the device to verify contents and proceed to show that the VCF card is damaged (as it is not a valid VCF card). \r\n\r\nIt should not crash Messages.app and prevent load.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe opening of the VCF card causes Messages.app to crash and remain unusable until the device is restored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis issue does not occur on macOS or watchOS."
