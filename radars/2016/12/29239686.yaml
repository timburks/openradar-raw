    description: "Summary:\r\nNormally, drawing a color with alpha less than 1 to a view with NSCompositingOperationCopy allows content beneath the window to show through. If the view has a layer, though, content beneath the window never sho\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached project\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth windows' green circles should be translucent, blending the color beneath the window with green.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the window on the right, which does not have a layer on its WTFCircleView, composites background content. The window on the left has an opaque green circle. See the screenshot, which demonstrates some of Photoshop's UI visible through my app's window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried -isOpaque on all the views and layers but that had no effect.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WTFLayers.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2016-11-13 at 4.22.45 PM.png' were successfully uploaded."
