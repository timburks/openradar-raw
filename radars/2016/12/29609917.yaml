    description: "Summary:\r\nThe stock Apple Watch Workout app saves \"route\" information for outdoor workouts such as \"Outdoor Cycling\" and \"Outdoor Running.\" This route is visible in the iOS activity app when looking at the workout details\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no public API to save this route information with the workout. 3rd party apps should be able to save this information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start an outdoor run workout using the stock Apple Watch Workout app\r\n2. Run 1/4 mile\r\n3. Complete the workout\r\n4. View workout in Activity app\r\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 with a 3rd party fitness app, such as https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sweaty-bird/id1160940396?mt=8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRoute information should be visible for both the stock Workout app and the 3rd party app should\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRoute information is only visible for the stock Workout app\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBeing able to view his/her workout route on a map is one of the most important metrics for fitness enthusiasts. Since one of the main selling points of the Apple Watch is its functionality as a Health and Fitness device, a public API to save route information is essential for 3rd party fitness app developers.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 2, WatchOS 3.1\r\niPhone 6s+, iOS 10.1.1"
