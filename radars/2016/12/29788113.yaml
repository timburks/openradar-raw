    description: "Summary:\nPlaceholder ( little blue pill) in code editors is too low contrast\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nBe a student or someone relatively new to Cocoa development\nType some code that autocompletes from Xcode’s built in code snippets (like NSString.init).\nSelect the autocomplete option and hit enter. \nObserve there is now a placeholder in the new code that has been auto-filled.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe placeholder should stand out and be very easy to identify, particularly in the default themes\n\nActual Results:\nThe placeholder is hard to see and identify\n\nRegression:\nNA, been a problem since at least Xcode 4 or 5.\n\nNotes:\nI teach classes all over the world and have for several years. \nStudents are regularly confused by the placeholder. They easily miss it. \nIt’s important to teach, but it would be a better if it were higher contrast,\nso it would be easily visible both on student screens and via projector."
