    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrent Xcode 8 release on 10.11 only includes a 10.12 SDK. With that SDK, some weak linking for libc symbols was added. One example: mkostemp was added in 10.12, and it will be linked against in 10.12, but if you compile on 10.11 with 10.11 as minimum target, it weak links that symbol.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/3727, \"-no_weak_imports\" shall be passed to the compiler, to specifically avoid that behaviour and allow existing autotools based projects to continue to work on the same platform.\r\n\r\nIssue is, that this compiler flag has no effects for any autotools based project with uses AC_CHECK_FUNCS to check for a function.\r\n\r\nPlease find the test program attached which autotools produce for the check. Please find the compiler line at the top. This program should fail to compile if the flag would work correctly. But it just compiles fine and only fails at runtime.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup 10.11 machine with Xcode 8 and 10.12 SDK only.\r\n2. Create autotool based project, use AC_CHECK_FUNCS to check for mkostemp (which was only added in 10.12)\r\n3. Do configure with \"-no_weak_imports\" flag set.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nconfigure should not detect mkostemp as available\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nconfigure still thinks mkostemp is available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS 10.11.6, Xcode 8.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nsuccessfully uploaded."
