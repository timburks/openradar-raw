    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the process of setting a firmware password from within the recovery OS, no warning is shown that the US keyboard layout will be used when being prompted for it.\r\n\r\nThis is serious as there are characters that cannot easily (or if at all) entered on an english keyboard. It also shocks the user until they figure out what they're doing wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nset a firmware password for a mac via recovery OS\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA warning/confirmation dialog could be an option. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be to notify the user that the keyboard layout will get switched to US when entering the password. As long as the password prompt will always be US, the user can just use it and *never bother*. This would also guarantee that the password the user entered would be recognized the same way at the boot prompt.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nno warnings or anything alike whatsoever\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nalmost every Mac\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nalmost every Mac\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
