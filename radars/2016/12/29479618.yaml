    description: Currently the XLIFF localization export from Xcode contains all UI items. That’s not always ideal, since some of the UI items could be just placeholders that are not meant to be localized. The translators then have to sift through the strings to filter out the placeholders. It would be great to have a checkbox in the Interface Builder that says something like “Non-localizable” and would exclude checked items from localization export.
