    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a SplitVC is presented in an iPad, if it is initially being shown in the UISplitViewControllerDisplayModePrimaryHidden and then the user decides to switch to UISplitViewControllerDisplayModeAllVisible, UIKit doesn't send the viewWillAppear message to the newly appeared VC\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.- Create two UIViewControllers\r\n2.- Set them as the viewControllers of the SplitViewController\r\n3.- Set the displayMode to .primaryHidden\r\n4.- After some time, or to response to user action, change it to .allVisible\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nviewDidAppear is sent to the newly appeared view controller\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nviewDidAppear is not sent to the newly appeared viewController\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see this problem in the attached xcodeproject\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf you instead are always presenting the splitVC in the .allVisible mode, this problem is not present."
