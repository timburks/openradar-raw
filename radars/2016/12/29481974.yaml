    description: "In the \"Manage your keywords\" page of https://app.searchads.apple.com when changing the sort criterion by tapping on a column title such as \"Impression\", \"Taps\" etc., it sorts in ascending order by default. This is almost always not what I want. In a typical use case there are many keywords that have 0 impressions. The user is usually not interested in these but in the keywords that do produce impressions, taps, conversions etc. \r\n\r\nI always have to click twice in order to get meaningful results.\r\n\r\nSo when changing the sort column, please sort in *descending* order by default."
