    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery time I add a test target (UI test or unit test) to my iOS app and press the Test button (or the shortcut cmd+u), Xcode freezes (the spinning rainbow appears).\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs if I run the tests using xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nI've tried waiting but then noticed that the memory usage grows very quickly. In about 20 minutes I had Xcode using more than 60 GB of memory, as seen on the screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone my iOS app project\r\n2. Add a test target (UI test or Unit test) using the File > New > Target menu\r\n3. Run tests (either by pressing the button, cmd+u or `xcodebuild test`)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild app, open the simulator and run the tests.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode freezes and leaks memory infinitely until I force quit it. It does not even start building, neither does it open the Simulator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.1 (8B62)\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached the report that shows up after force-quitting Xcode.\r\nThe project consists of an iOS app, a Today Widget and a Watch App/Extension.\r\nThe project uses mixed Objective-C/Swift 3.0.1 code.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt happens specifically with my iOS project, which compiles and runs normally and is a big app already on the App Store.\r\n\r\nThe steps are reproducible on other machines with the same configuration as well."
