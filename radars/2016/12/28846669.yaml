    description: "I am using a UIDocumentInteractionController to preview small PDF files (approx 83K) using presentPreviewAnimated:.  My delegate implements documentInteractionControllerViewControllerForPreview: and returns the view controller currently at the top of the nav stack, so that the interactionController is displayed modally.\r\n\r\nI noticed on iOS 10 when calling presentPreviewAnimated that the preview takes a very long time to load the document (5+ seconds).  While loading, a blank white screen is displayed.  Then, when clicking \"Done\", there is another pause of ~5s where the app becomes completely unresponsive (can't scroll or tap done again), followed by the dismissal of the preview and return to normal operation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Use the UIDocumentInteractionController to preview a PDF file.\r\n2.  Once the preview view appears, click \"Done\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PDF preview renders and dismisses in a timely fashion.  Interaction is smooth and never results in a period of unresponsiveness.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the preview view appears, the preview pane is blank (white) for 5+seconds before the PDF is rendered in the view.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking done, the UI freezes for another 5-10 seconds before the preview is dismissed and the app returns to normal operation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.0.2"
