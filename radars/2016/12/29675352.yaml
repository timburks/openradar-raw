    description: "Please add PGP support to Apple Mail. Specifically, please add the ability to PGP-encrypt messages to recipients for whom the user has a private key and please add PGP signing.\r\n\r\nI know that Apple Mail has support for S/MIME. This is undoubtedly good for customers who have corporate certificate authorities. But I couldn't even find an S/MIME certificate authority that would give me a certificate based only on a CSR and not an authority-generated key.\r\n\r\nEmail encryption is particularly important for customers who are living under oppressive government regimes. Or customers who anticipate living under an oppressive government after January 20."
