    description: "Summary:\r\nOften, I'd like to close a window I've minimized, but I don't really want it to expand over what I'm working on and then be closed (and switch the application in the process). I'd  like it if there could be a right click option on minimized windows in the Dock that was something like \"Close this window\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Minimize a window\r\n2. Right click on it in the Dock\r\n3. Click \"Close\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe minimized window has this option\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only option is to open it\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A304a) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A304a)"
