    description: "Summary:\r\nUpon export to either WAV or MP3 (the only two options I use), 2 out of 3 times, Logic will start the file with my track data, but then it will give way to noise, hums and clicks. Restarting my machine will usually fix it for a a few hours. This problem happens across Logic files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Export audio from Logic.\r\n2. Skim entire exported audio file. At some point, it may turn from your content into noise and static.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLogic Pro X 10.2.4\r\nmacOS Seirra 10.12.1"
