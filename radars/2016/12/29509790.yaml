    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iTunes 12 and iOS 10 were launched, iTunes on macOS and the Music app on iOS displayed both \"My Favorites Mix\" and \"My New Music Mix\" in the For You section of the apps.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few weeks later, the \"My New Music Mix\" disappeared from the top of the For You sections in both locations (macOS and iOS). \"My Favorites Mix\" is still there, and \"My New Music Mix\" is available in the Recently Played section, but it is not being updated every week like it was when it appeared in the main section of For You.\r\n\r\nI am seeing this on two MacBook Pro devices, on my iPhone, and on my iPad.\r\n\r\nI have found other people complaining of similar issues online, with no known fix. For example, see <https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7665294?start=0&tstart=0>\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown how to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"My Favorites Mix\" and \"My New Music Mix\" should appear at the top of the For You section of iTunes (macOS) and the Music app (iOS).\r\n\r\n\"My New Music Mix\" should be automatically updated with new songs once per week.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"My Favorites Mix\" appears, but not \"My New Music Mix\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 12.5.3.17 on macOS Sierra 10.12.1\r\n\r\nMusic app on iOS 10.1.1"
