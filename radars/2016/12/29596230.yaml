    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an app is playing audio and notifies Media Player of it, such as iTunes or Safari, a pop-up button is added to the Control Strip.\r\n\r\nThe icon literally makes no sense. I'm sorry, I love its functionality, but it doesn't. I understand using the typical 8th-note glyph might confuse it with iTunes itself, but it's still so much more clear. What is on the Touch Bar today is a spreadsheets glyph, not an oscilloscope glyph. If it were animated, that would be a different story. But it's not, and it's ridiculously confusing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Play a song\r\n3. Look at the Touch Bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Oh, look, my music!\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Oh, look, my spreadsheets!\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2659)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThread: https://twitter.com/zwaldowski/status/805819945833508864\r\n\r\nI'm sorry. I love the functionality, I really do. The icon is insanity.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Late 2016 with Touch Bar (MacBookPro13,3)\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
