    description: "Have a setting to allow the digital crown of Apple Watch to control the volume of AirPods when listening to audio.\r\n\r\nChanging the volume should automatically work when the watch is showing its face (i.e., not in an app) -- essentially the same conditions as when Time Travel can be invoked. It may also be desirable to work when the watch screen is off."
