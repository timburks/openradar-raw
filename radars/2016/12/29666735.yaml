    description: "Summary:\r\nFor the past month or so, the fans on my MBP are constantly spinning. When I check Activity Monitor, cfprefsd is almost always at the top of CPU utilization. I'd say the average value I see is 40%. I've tried killing cfprefsd and rebooting, to no avail. Based on this radar: http://www.openradar.me/23666465 and the referenced tweet by David Smith, I've generated a bluetooth diagnostic report, sampled blued and cfprefsd, and spindumped cfprefsd. All of those reports are attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the computer for any purpose\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem processes should not be constantly running at high CPU utilization\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncfprefsd is frequently hogging the CPU\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\r\n2.3 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nmacOS 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSeems to always occur"
