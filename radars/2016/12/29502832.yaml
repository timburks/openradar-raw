    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the many years since Apple acquired Siri, I have reported bugs from time to time. At times they have seemed to land in the \"black hole\" of bug reports, while at other times (at least once) I was asked to engage in a time-consuming process including the installation of a custom configuration profile, and the subsequent gathering of a system diagnostics dump.\r\n\r\nThis is simply too much work bug reporters. A system like Siri that will prevail only by addressing the thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of minor defects that turn customers away, needs a streamlined bug-reporting process akin to the one implemented by Apple Maps.\r\n\r\nEvery Siri user who encounters a \"d'oh, can't believe Siri got that wrong\" type of bug should be empowered to say something in response like \"I'd like to file a bug about your behavior,\" which would kick off a process in whch the pertinent audio files, contextual information, etc., are all bundled up and, after gaining the user's permission to do so, sent off to Apple for evaluation.\r\n\r\nEven better would be if the Apple Maps behavior of offering to follow up bugs reported this way were instituted.\r\n\r\nAs it stands I am unlikely to file bugs against Siri because the amount of work seems disproportionate to the frequency with which I encounter bugs. Here's one I ran into today in NYC: \r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/805448945333862400\r\n\r\nMake of it what you will ;)\r\n\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 (14B150)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
