    description: "Summary:\r\nI was having an issue with two Quicklook plugins overriding each other for a certain file type, so I removed one of them and ran qlmanage -r and qlmanage -r cache. However, Quicklook refuses to use the remaining plugin (which I can confirm works on other filetypes), instead, it searches for the old plugin and then complains that it cannot find it. I cannot find any way to completely reset Quicklook so it can recognize the new plugin. A reboot fails to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a Quicklook plugin\r\n2. Install another Quicklook plugin with the same filetype\r\n3. Remove first plugin\r\n4. Run qlmanage -r and qlmanage -r cache\r\n4. Try to Quicklook a file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuicklook will switch to the new plugin\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nQuicklook is stuck trying to find and use the old, deleted plugin\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A239j)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A239j)"
