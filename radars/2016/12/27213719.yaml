    description: "Summary:\r\nIn XIB files it is possible to add an External Object when loading a NIB using instantiateWithOwner:topLevelObjects: \r\n\r\nThis is not possible in an NSStoryboard (or a UIStoryboard for that matter).\r\n\r\nThis would be useful, for example, to enable a developer to supply singleton style objects to storyboard view controllers.  One example of this might be a NSDocumentController.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately\" in the case of NSDocumentController the 2nd invocation of init returns a shared instance so you can fake this in a storyboard by putting an NSObject (of type NSDocumentController) in a storyboard \"scene\".  However this behaviour, although documented, is quite weird and a better architecture would be to allow storyboards to supply external objects to scenes via some form of dependency injection that could be referenced in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat Storyboards should support external top level objects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can not supply external top level objects to a storyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014), macOS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
