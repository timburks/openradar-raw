        Summary:
        Sometimes in iOS 10, my iPad Air 2 will get stuck in the orientation is was in when I unlocked it. Once itâ€™s stuck, I have found no way to get it unstuck, other than restarting the device. I tried locking and unlocking, rotating in a variety of orientations, and turning the rotation lock on and then back off.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        (sometimes):
        1. Unlock iPad in portrait orientation
        2. Rotate iPad into landscape orientation

        Expected Results:
        iPad orientation rotates

        Actual Results:
        No change in orientation results

        Regression:
        This never happened before iOS 10
