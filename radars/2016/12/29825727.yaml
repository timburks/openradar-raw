    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis is an \"us, too\" report for rdar://29182929 where the keystroke function is incorrectly casing of output to uppercase based on uppercase and other sentinel characters. We've also identified a work-around that we haven't seen reported, described in Additional Notes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Script Editor\r\n2. Either open the attached sample script or paste this:\r\ntell application \"Terminal\"\r\n\tactivate\r\n\ttell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"This is a test\"\r\nend tell\r\n3. Watch the output in Terminal.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe script should properly print each entered character in the correct casing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe casing is different from what was entered and differs with almost every run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is our work-around, forcing an adjustment to shift after using keystroke to emit each character individually:\r\n\r\ntell application \"Terminal\"\r\n\tactivate\r\n\ttell application \"System Events\"\r\n\t\tset outputString to \"mmalibu@zetetic.net\"\r\n\t\tset len to length of outputString\r\n\t\trepeat with i from 1 to len\r\n\t\t\tset x to character i of outputString\r\n\t\t\tkeystroke x\r\n\t\t\tkey up {shift}\r\n\t\tend repeat\r\n\tend tell\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nI should note that the problem appears to remain in 10.12.3 Beta 2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe output is occasionally correct, but the frequency varies quite a bit.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AdjustKeystroke.scpt' was successfully uploaded."
