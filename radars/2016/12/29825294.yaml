    description: "Area:\r\nNetworking\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAn IKEv2 VPN that is delivered through a mobileconfig profile does not appear in \"Set Service Order\" in the Network System Preferences pane. Therefore it is not possible to prioritise the network connection above or below other network adapters.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Deliver an IKEv2 VPN through a mobileconfig.\r\n2. Open System Preferences and then Network.\r\n3. Click the cog icon and then select Set Service Order.\r\n4. The mobileconfig-delivered IKEv2 VPN profile is not present in the list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe IKEv2 VPN profile should be present in the list, like with VPN connections that have been added through the GUI by hand. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVPN profiles added by hand appear in the list.\r\nVPN profiles added by mobileconfig files do NOT appear in the list. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-12-29 at 13.25.56.png' was successfully uploaded."
