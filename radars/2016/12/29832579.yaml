        Summary:

        I have a JavaScript based Safari Extension which parses URLs on contextual menu events and if they in a recognized format adds contextual menu items. If the user selects one of those contextual menu items the JavaScript changes the scheme from http to a scheme registered by my native OS X application.

        Expected Results:

        The native application is invoked and the URL is processed.

        Actual Results:

        The user is prompted with a JavaScript alert asking: Do you want to allow this page to open “Xinet Support”?
        This happens every time, there is no way to avoid the question.

        Regression:

        Previous versions of Safari and OS X allowed this. It is possible to reimplement the Safari (JavaScript) Extension as a Safari App Extension to provide this functionality. However, Safari App Extensions are only available on OS X 10.11 El Capitan and above.

        Notes:

        I have no issue with changing the way our Extension works but this does not solve the problem for our OS X 10.10 Yosemite customers.
