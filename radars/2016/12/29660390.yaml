    description: "Summary:\r\nSupport addition/modification of buttons in the Toolbar and Touch Bar in Xcode for supporting Xcode Source Editor Extensions.\r\n\r\nSuch behavior could be implemented in Xcode in a similar vein to Safari Extensions (with SFSafariExtensionViewController)\r\n\r\nRationale / possible use-cases:\r\n\r\n- Localization: in some countries (such as Italy), common characters used in programming (such as a curly-brace) require complex 3-key chords, causing a headache and repeated hand stress for the programmer. The ability to add a curly-brace button to the touch bar for such users would be invaluable. Alternatively, add those braces to Xcode yourself. Seriously, curly braces are hard on an Italian keyboard.\r\n\r\n- Invocation: some users include one extension or another in their common/daily workflow, and an ability to add a Toolbar or Touch Bar button for one-touch invocation of their favorite editor extensions, perhaps with custom icon, would be convenient and useful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(not a bug)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n(not a bug)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(not a bug)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016)\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (public)\r\nXcode 8.2 (public/MAS)"
