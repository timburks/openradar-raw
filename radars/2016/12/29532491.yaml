        Summary:
        When calling performBatchUpdates:completion: on UICollectionView, the completionBlock is not called unless it forcibly retained

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Use performBatchUpdates:completion: with a trivial completion block with no retain cycles. Let’s use a log statement that prints @“hi”


        Expected Results:
        Log statement executes and “hi” appears in the logs

        Actual Results:
        Log statement doesn’t execute (confirmed by debugger), and “hi” doesn’t appear.

        Notes:
        If you add a retain cycle, such as  including self in the the block, the block will execute.
