    description: "Summary:\nEmojis are used all over the internet. While Messages.app now shows single emojis bigger the other emojis are still as tiny as the surrounding text.\nWith the introduction of force-touch in OS X in order to browse the selected word in a dictionary it would be useful to have a dictionary for emojis. This dictionary would display the emoji in bigger shape and would also provide an explanation of the emoji.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nThis example text contains a \U0001F35D emoji. It’s almost impossible to see that it’s a pasta emoji. Force-click the emoji to see the dictionary entry for the emoji. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe dictionary should show the pasta-emoji at least at 128pt. It should also give an explanation of the emoji like „Pasta“ or „Spaghetti“. Bonus points for a more detailed explanation.\n\nActual Results:\nThe dictionary shows „no results“ in Safari and Messages. In some applications it seems to be able to show the Wikipedia entry for „Spaghetti“.\n\nRegression:\nnone\n\nNotes:\nnone"
