    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen configured using the GUI (as opposed to mobileconfig), the IKEv2 rekey timeout is set to approximately 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nAt this 8 minute interval, the VPN attempts to rekey the CHILD SA. Unless the DH group of the VPN is set to 14, this rekey fails every single time and the CHILD SA is deleted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create IKEv2 VPN responder using Strongswan or other software such as Racoon, configure using certificate authentication (but not XAuth) using aes256-aes256-modp4096.\r\n2. Connect the VPN.\r\n3. After 8 minutes, iOS/macOS attempts to rekey the CHILD SA. The proposal sent for the rekey does not match the initial SA proposal.\r\n4. The VPN disconnects.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rekey proposal should match the initial proposal (i.e. DH group 2 or 14).\r\n\r\nThe CHILD SA should not be deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe rekey proposal is not the same as the initial SA proposal, therefore the rekey fails and the CHILD SA is deleted. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAlways occurs. When using mobileconfig the rekey interval can be increased but then this problem still happens eventually."
