    description: "Summary: It should be mandatory to app which use location services to work with  \"When in use\" (authorizedWhenInUse) permissions.\r\nExample, Waze only permit Never or Always permissions levels.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Install Waze from the AppStore \r\n2. Go to Settings.app > Waze > Location\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I should have the choice to only allow Waze to use my location \"When in Use\"\r\n\r\nActual Results: \"When in Use\" is not proposed\r\n\r\nI think it's a critical privacy issue, many apps are abusing this permission. \r\nIt should be checked at the app submission, like NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription and others."
