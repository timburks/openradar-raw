    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Stopwatch app in graph mode will show 0.100s instead of 1.00s when the average is around 1s. See the attached screenshot. This seems to only occur when approaching the average from \"below\", and the real average is probably being rounded to 1.00 but in reality is actually less, causing an error with the format string.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Stopwatch.\r\n2. Switch to Graph mode.\r\n3. Start the stopwatch (please read the rest before actually doing this)\r\n4. Come towards a 1s average from below, see instructions below\r\n5. Press \"Lap\" just shy of 1s (0.9 s is fine)\r\n6. Repeatedly press \"Lap\"  at a time just over 1s, the average should increase towards 1 from below.\r\n7. Eventually, the average will go from 0.99s to 0.100s.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe time is shown as 1.00s (or 0.99s)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time is shown as 0.100s (as shown in the screenshot)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 3.0 (14S5247t)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n38 mm Apple Watch Sport running watchOS 3.0 (14S5247t)"
