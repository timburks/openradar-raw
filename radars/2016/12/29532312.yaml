        Summary:
        The fact that you have to go through the "New File" wizard each time you want to create a new .swift file causes you to dread doing that and put more code than needed into one file. I think there's still a space in UI (and keyboard shortcuts) to allow creation of new files in a quicker fashion, e.g. something like:

        1.  Type a keyboard shortcut or choose "File" -> "New .swift file".
        2. A new Untitled.swift entry appears in the Project Navigator in the currently selected group.
        3. That file name's is focused in the Project Navigator, so you can rename it quickly.
        4. Once you're done renaming, a file gets actually created on disk, the name you provided is filled in in the file template and the editor text view gets the keyboard focus.

        This won't cover other cases, such as binary formats, Objective-C classes requiring two files, etc. However, it will probably cover 80% use case of many developers, which is creation of empty Swift files.
