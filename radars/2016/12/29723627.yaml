    description: "Summary:\r\nCorrect availability descriptions are important to writing correct and effective Apple software. Many developers use the documentation to find new methods and now if the system provides a given algorithm before writing one themselves. As an iOS instructor, I teach my students to do this as well.\r\n\r\nAs of the 10.12.2/10.2 releases this week, SDK availability has become much more inaccurate in the unified API Reference.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an empty Swift playground\r\n2. Type \"let f: CharacterSet\"\r\n3. Cmd-click on \"CharacterSet.\"\r\n4. Locate the type property \"CharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed\".\r\n5. Open Quicklyâ€¦ > \"NSCharacterSet\".\r\n6. Likewise, locate the type property \"NSCharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed\".\r\n7. Find the counterparts in the documentation for 3, 4, 5, and 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the generated \"header\", all the above symbols have no availability markers, thus indicating (and is true) that the APIs are available targeting the lowest possible deployment target of Swift. All the above referenced methods should be documented as such.\r\n\r\n- CharacterSet should be documented as 8.0/10.10/9.0/2.0.\r\n- CharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed should be documented as 8.0/10.10/9.0/2.0.\r\n- NSCharacterSet should be documented as 2.0/10.0/9.0/2.0.\r\n- NSCharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed should be documented as 7.0/10.9/9.0/2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe APIs have a mix of incorrectness.\r\n\r\nThe lowest deployment target for Swift as of Xcode 8/Swift 3 is iOS 8, macOS 10.10, tvOS 9.0 (first public release), and watchOS 2.0 (first public release).\r\n\r\n- CharacterSet is documented as 10.0/10.12/10.0/3.0\r\n- CharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed is documented is 10.0/10.12/10.0/3.0.\r\n- NSCharacterSet is documented as 8.0/10.10/9.0/2.0.\r\n- NSCharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed is documented as 7.0/10.9/7.0/2.0.\r\n\r\nThe above is especially confusing: due to Swift bridging, NSCharacterSet.urlQueryAllowed returns a type that the documentation explicitly says is not available.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCharacterSet - Foundation\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/characterset\r\n\r\nNSCharacterSet - Foundation\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nscharacterset\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problems are not limited to just these locations.\r\n\r\nHaving historically accurate documentation for APIs is extremely important.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
