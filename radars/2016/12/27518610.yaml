    description: "Summary:\r\nSourceKitService regularly hogs all the memory on my machine, slowing it to a crawl. See the attached screenshot; SourceKitService is using about 3.6 GB of real memory (and 11.62 GB virtual), which is quite impressive given my computer only has 4 GB total.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Open a Swift project\r\n3. Do some work\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSourceKitService doesn't hog the RAM\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSourceKitServices uses all the RAM if not periodically killed, often causing my machine to become unresponsive and requiring a force restart.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.0 beta 3 (8S174q)/macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Force quit SourceKitService every once in a while\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)"
