    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I restart my computer, any Automator Calendar alerts that happened earlier in the day trigger again.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. In Automator, create a new Calendar Alarm\r\n2. Configure it to do something obvious and visible, like creating a Notification Center notification\r\n3. Save it for 1:00 am on the current day (any time before the present)\r\n4. Restart the Mac\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe notification doesn't show\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe notification does show (as does the spinning gear Menu Bar icon)\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\nThis has happened at least since El Capitan, and possibly earlier. All of my calendar events were created in the first version of OS X that required you to use Automator instead of setting the alerts to execute AppleScripts directly."
