    description: "Area:\r\nSoftware Update\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSoftware Update insists on quitting an app about to be updated at the point *before* the update is even downloaded. For large updates, on slower connections (like those in most of the rest of the world, you lucky Silicon Valley types ;-)), such as Xcode, this can mean hours of lost time for no reason whatsoever: Xcode does not need to be closed while the update is running.\r\n\r\nSuggest revising this so that the updated app is quit only when the update is actually *being applied*. This is infuriating otherwise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-12-16 at 08.22.28.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
