    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBecause of custom focus ring issues (rdar://problem/29465363) I started converting one of our main NSButton subclasses to use layers instead of having the cell or image do any drawing in -drawRect: or drawTitle:WithFrame:inView. (Overriding either of these causes the focus ring to look like crap - see radar listed above). \r\n\r\nThe one issue I ran into is that I could no longer specify a custom color for disabled text. In my old code I used -drawTitle:withFrame:inView: and used my own attributed string with the customized disabled color if the button was disabled. Since I can't use that method in a modern layer backed button subclass (when I implement it the button goes back to using legacy crappy focus rings) I needed to find some other way.\r\n\r\nCurrently as far as I can tell the only way to change the disabled text color is to override _textDimColor in an NSButtonCell subclass. Since our apps are generally sold in the App Store using private api is kind of frowned upon.\r\n\r\nSo if possible could you give us a non-private api that would allow some of our custom buttons to have a different disabled text color? Our designer here is really really picky with his colors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\nIf you'd like I could submit a test app with my custom NSButton class and show you the issues when NSButtonCell -drawTitle:withFrame:inView: is implemented.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1/Xcode 8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
