    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"TV\" app, introduced in iOS 10.2, replaces the \"Videos\" app in being the system app for playing movies and TV shows synced from iTunes. However, it is often unable to either show the downloaded videos or play them when in Airplane Mode.\r\n\r\nI've seen the following behaviors in airplane mode:\r\n\r\n* A spinner that never goes away as the only content of the app at launch (see screenshot \"ipad-airplane-spinner-at-launch.PNG\")\r\n\r\n* If the app is backgrounded, the downloads may (or may not) appear (see \"ipad-airplane-downloads-after-backgrounding.PNG\"), but tapping into a show produces a screen that is just a spinner with a back button to \"downloads\" (see screenshot \"ipad-airplane-episode-list-spinner.PNG\", \"iphone-airplane-episode-list-spinner.PNG\")\r\n\r\n* If the app is then brought online, it is more likely to be able to show the downloads, but if I then go back to Airplane Mode, the play button in an individual episode may not do anything (see \"iphone-airplane-episode-play-button-does-nothing.PNG\")\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sync several TV episodes to an iOS device running iOS 10.1 or earlier. These can be DVD rips or downloaded iTunes episodes\r\n2. Watch them on the Videos app\r\n3. Upgrade to iOS 10.2. This replaces the Videos app with the TV app\r\n4. Put the device into airplane mode\r\n5. Launch the TV app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe TV app should have equivalent functionality for playing local files that the Videos app did\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. On both devices I've tried, if the TV app's first launch is in Airplane Mode, you will only see a spinner that never dismisses. Restarting the device and re-launching TV does not help.\r\n2. If the TV app is then launched while able to connect to the internet, the downloads can then be displayed.\r\n3. However, if you then go back to Airplane Mode, browsing to individual TV episodes sometimes gets you a play button that does nothing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the Downloads scene can be reached, synced/downloaded movies can be played consistently. This problem seems to mostly be with TV episodes.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 9.7\", 128 GB \r\niPhone 5s, 64 GB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ipad-airplane-downloads-after-backgrounding.PNG', 'iphone-airplane-episode-list-spinner.PNG', 'iphone-airplane-episode-play-button-does-nothing.PNG', 'ipad-airplane-spinner-at-launch.PNG' and 'ipad-airplane-episode-list-spinner.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
