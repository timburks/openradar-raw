        Summary:
        When having a UIResponder that handles keyboard input (UITextField, UITextView and friends), sometimes the keyboard can stay on screen without the responder being on the screen/window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UITextView and add it to a view hierarchy inside a window thats key
        2. call [textView becomeFirstResponder]
        3. A `UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification` is posted, because the keyboard will appear
        4. inside a handler for that `UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification` notification, remove the UITextView from the key window (e.g. removeFromSuperview on one of its superviews)

        Expected Results:
        1. Keyboard disappears again
        2. There is no firstResponder anymore

        Actual Results:
        1. Keyboard stays on screen and sends key input to the UITextView that's no longer in the key window
        2. There is no firstResponder at all, yet there is a keyboard

        Regression:
