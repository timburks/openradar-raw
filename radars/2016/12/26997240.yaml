    description: "Summary:\r\nI've tried adding faces as well as deleting photos, but the changes do not appear unless a tab change (for example, from People to All Photos, then back to People) takes place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Import photos\r\n2. Delete some of them\r\n3. After confirming (\"Do you want to move it to the Trash?, etc\"), no change occurs\r\n4. Switch to another tab (for example, \"All Photos\")\r\n5. Switch back to \"Last Import\"\r\n6. Changes show up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI updates immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI does not change until the tab is switched\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPhotos Version 2.0 (402.10.11)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A201w)"
