    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing `transferFile:metadata:` on `WCSession` doesn’t provide the `session:didFinishFileTransfer:error:` callback and doesn’t update `outstandingFileTransfers` property even though the file is transferred to the counterpart iOS app when a breakpoint is applied in during the operation of sending the file.\r\n\r\nAttached screenshots show the out of sync data because there was no success/failure callback on the watchOS device.\r\n\r\nThis causes extreme difficulty in debugging logic around WatchConnectivity transfers on watchOS.\r\n\r\nSample project available [here](https://github.com/mattrobmattrob/WatchConnectivityTransferFileTest).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open sample project and build `WatchConnectivity WatchApp` for simulator or device.\r\n2. Open the Apple Watch app and the iOS app at the same time.\r\n3. Tap the 1, 2, 3, and “All Files” buttons in any order or frequency.\r\n4. See the watchOS and iOS labels updated as expected as files are sent between the devices based on the button presses.\r\n5. Add a breakpoint at `InterfaceController.m::95` with `po self.session.outstandingFileTransfers.count` or something with a  more complicated print out.\r\n6. Tap the 1, 2, 3, and “All Files” buttons in any order or frequency.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the watchOS and iOS labels updated as expected as files are sent between the devices based on the button presses and confirmation is received from `WCSession`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS labels and watchOS’s attempted labels update as expected. The `session:didFinishFileTransfer:error:` is never received for some or all files.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 8.2 (8C38)\r\n\r\nDevices:\r\niPhone 7, iOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\nApple Watch Series 2, 38 mm, watchOS 3.1 (14S471)\r\n\r\nSimulators:\r\niPhone 7 Plus Simulator, iOS 10.2 (14C89)\r\nApple Watch Series 2 Simulator, 48 mm, watchOS 3.1 (14S471a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoesn't occur without a breakpoint set. Begins dropping delegate callbacks when breakpoint is set.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Simulator Screen Shot Dec 21, 2016, 4.13.06 PM.png', 'Simulator Screen Shot Dec 21, 2016, 4.13.05 PM.png' and 'WatchConnectivityBug.zip' were successfully uploaded."
