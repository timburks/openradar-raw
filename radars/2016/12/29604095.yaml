    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring a wi-fi call of sufficient length (at least 30 minutes or so), all of a sudden the waveform would freeze and both parties could no longer hear each other, although the call duration timer kept incrementing. The call wouldn’t actually drop until I hung up, and then the second call would be fine, though it didn’t last as long as the first one had."
