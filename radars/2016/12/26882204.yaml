    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to merge contacts using Card->Look For Duplicates… presents a modal that has some text cut off. After starting a merge, Contacts becomes unresponsive (not as in \"Not Responding\" freeze/hang, but as in there's nothing you can do); even the cancel button doesn't work. As the merge never finishes the only way to exit is to force quit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts\r\n2. Go to Card->Look For Duplicates…\r\n3. Start the merge.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContacts merges the cards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContacts merges correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A201w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A201w)"
