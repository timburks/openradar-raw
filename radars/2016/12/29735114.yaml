    description: "Jeff Vautin.  25-Jan-2017 09:07 PM:\r\n\r\nThen why is it prompting me for this after I changed my local Mac password? I changed it, and then these prompts started appearing, and clicking them takes me to the iCloud Preference Pane.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, the purpose of these notifications is entirely opaque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations  18-Jan-2017 07:52 PM:\r\n\r\nIt is not asking for iCloud password but for your local Mac password.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Report:\r\n\r\nhttps://jeffvautin.com/wp-content/uploads/openradar/radarIcloudPassword.png\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUnder 10.12.2, I changed my user password. I intentionally maintain a separate password for my iCloud account. Now, every time I log in, I'm prompted to 'Finish Changing my iCloud Password'. I don't intend to change it at this time, and I can't find a way to prevent this from popping up (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, clicking 'Details' just opens the iCloud Preference Pane. It would be unclear to most users what the intent of that notification is (especially since the notification text is clipped).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a user account.\r\n2. Link to an iCloud account with a separate password.\r\n3. Change the password on the user account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPassword will successfully be changed, and that's it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPassword is changed, but every time you log in you will be prompted to finish changing your iCloud password.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-12-16 at 3.37.23 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
