    description: "Area:\r\nAPNS (Notifications)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe `thread-id` APNs payload field was recently introduced. As described in the APNs docs (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/PayloadKeyReference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH17-SW1), users should:\r\n\r\n> Provide this key with a string value that represents the app-specific identifier for grouping notifications. The system groups notifications with the same thread identifier together in Notification Center and other system interfaces.\r\n\r\nIn practice, though, I can't find any noticeable behavior change with or without a thread ID included in notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend a notifications to the APNs server with a variety of thread IDs (some with the same ID, some with different IDs, and some without thread IDs at all). Notifications with an ID will include the `thread-id` field as a property of the `aps` object, as shown in this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"aps\":{\"alert\":\"Thread ID example\",\"thread-id\":\"example-thread-id\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotifications with the same thread ID will appear in proximity to each other either on the receiving device's home screen or in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotifications appear in the order in which they were received, regardless of their thread ID.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 (14B150)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has come up a couple of times on the APNs forums:\r\n\r\n- https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/188955\r\n- https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/69520\r\n\r\nAdditional discussion is also available at https://github.com/relayrides/pushy/issues/382.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHTTP/2-based APNs API with token authentication"
