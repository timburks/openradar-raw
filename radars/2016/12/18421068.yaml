    description: "We believe this issue has been addressed in the latest OS X v10.11 Developer beta.  This is a pre-release OS X v10.11 update.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the release notes for complete installation instructions.\r\n\r\nPlease test with this release.  If you still have issues, please include any relevant logs or information that could help us investigate.\r\n\r\nOS X El Capitan\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/osx/download/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe NSURLComponents header states:\r\n\r\n\"Although ';' is a legal path character, it is recommended that it be percent-encoded for best compatibility with NSURL (-stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters: will percent-encode any ';' characters if you pass the URLPathAllowedCharacterSet).\"\r\n\r\nHowever, NSURLComponents's own translation to NSURL does not behave correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry the following code:\r\n\r\nNSURLComponents *components = [NSURLComponents componentsWithString:@\"http://one/two;three/four\"];\r\nNSLog(@\"Path: %@\", [components path]);\r\nNSLog(@\"Percent-encoded path: %@\", [components path]);\r\nNSLog(@\"URL path: %@\", [[components URL] path]);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPath: /two;three/four\r\nPercent-encoded path: /two;three/four â€”(or /two%3Bthree/four)\r\nURL path: /two;three/four\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPath: /two;three/four\r\nPercent-encoded path: /two;three/four\r\nURL path: /two\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 6 Beta 2\r\nOS X 10.10 (14A361c)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to re-encode the percentEncodedPath."
