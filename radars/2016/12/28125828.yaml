    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, when I'm opening a Mail thread in Mail.app, the \"first\" message (i.e. the message that is the first unread one) is missing the \"Details\" button in its header, but every other message in the thread has it. Please see the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a mail thread to open it\r\n2. The message that opens doesn't have a \"Details\" button, but the rest do\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Details button would appear\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo button\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A313a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis appears to be a regression from an earlier beta, but I'm not sure which one. Maybe beta 6?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A313a)"
