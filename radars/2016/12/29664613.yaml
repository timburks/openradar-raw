    description: I want to develop a monitoring app for iOS that reports system health information of iPhone or iPad to my server. So stuff to monitor is battery status, battery health, backup status, backup via iCloud/iTunes status, backup encryption status, current password strength status, boot volume capacity status, untrusted apps installed status, untrusted profiles installed status and more.
