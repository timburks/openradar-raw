    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an HTML element that was previously of type `position: sticky;` is changed to type `position: fixed;` it is rendered incorrectly by Webkit browsers on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the 'closed' example (closed.html) in an iOS browser.\r\n2. Click the 'Show / Hide Table of Contents' toggle link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav element 'expands' to fill the entire viewport.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page is rendered incorrectly - the navigation element occupies approximately the lower third of the screen. Despite this, when interacting with the screen, the browser reacts as if the elements are in their correct positions.\r\n\r\nInspecting the page using Safari's remote debugging also highlights the elements as if they are where they 'should be'.\r\n\r\nIf the same CSS is applied when the page is loaded, the example appears correctly (as in open.html).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 (14B72), Safari or Chrome 54.0.2840.91\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHosted version of example available at https://36degrees.github.io/webkit-ios-fixed-sticky/\r\n\r\nNot able to reproduce on my mac (Safari Version 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10), Mac OS 10.12 (16A323))\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
