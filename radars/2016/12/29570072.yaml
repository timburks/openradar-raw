    description: "Summary:\r\nSince 10.2.1, a new behaviour for proxy authentication has been implemented.\r\nNow, a dialog box appears, attached as dialog1.png\r\nThis dialog box has two buttons, not now and System Preferences (Default button)\r\nWhen the user clicks system preferences the system preferences application launches.\r\nAnother dialog box appears and requests the users credentials, attached as dialog2.png\r\nWhen the user enters their credentials into this new dialog box it goes away leaving the Network System preferences pane open.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be absolutely no need to open the system preferences pane at all on macOS. \r\n\r\nIf the user is a standard user account, they do not have access to modify the network system preference anyway, so why open it for them?\r\n\r\nThis seems to be simply a change of behaviour for no benefit to the end user and simply means more clicks, more windows/dialog boxes and more confusion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install macOS 10.12.1 or higher\r\n2. Configure network settings (Network Proxy via PAC Automatic Proxy Configuration)\r\n3. Create new local standard user account\r\n4. Log in to macOS with new local standard user account\r\n5. macOS attempts to contact iCloud configuration on login.\r\n6. Prompt for proxy authentication is presented\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe request for proxy authentication should not attempt to open system preferences or the network pref pane\r\nThe request for proxy authentication should only request the users credentials and allow the requesting application to use these new credentials and continue on in the background as per the 10.2.0 and previous behaviour\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe prompt for proxy authentication opens the network system preference pane\r\nAfter the user provides the user credentials, the system preferences application is not automatically closed and requires the user to close it.\r\nA standard user account is unable to make any changes to the network system preference pane without admin rights anyway so this irrelevant to them\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.2.2 16C60b\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not occur in 10.12.0\r\nFirst noticed in 10.12.1.\r\nStill exists in current 10.12.2 beta 16C60b\r\n\r\nScreen shots of dialog boxes attached"
