    description: "Summary:\nA CharacterSet initialised with only a emoji is  empty (reported as being a subset of the alphanumerics CharacterSet).\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nExecute the following code:\n\nlet empty = CharacterSet(charactersIn: \"\")\nlet onlyEmoji = CharacterSet(charactersIn: \"\U0001F437\")\nlet emojiAndCharacter = CharacterSet(charactersIn: \"\U0001F437a\")\n\nempty.isSubset(of: .alphanumerics) // true\nonlyEmoji.isSubset(of: .alphanumerics) // true\nemojiAndCharacter.isSubset(of: .alphanumerics) // false\n\n\nExpected Results:\nAs the Emoji is not contained in the alphanumerics (irregardless of the underlying unicode representation) it should not report to be a subset of the alphanumeric set or be empty. If it does then it should be consistent when initialised with a string containing a character and an Emoji.\n\nActual Results:\nIt reports to be a subset of the alphanumerics, but does not when initialised with an additional character.\n\nNotes:\nProvide a failable or throwing initializer that prevents this usage or change the implementation to work with Emoji."
