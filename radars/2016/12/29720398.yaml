    description: "Summary:\nThe settings for junk mail in Mail.app contain a switch „Trust mail-headers for junk mail in emails“. Yet common anti-spam headers are ignored, for example DSPAM. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nIn Mail.app, activate the aforementioned setting. Setup mail server with dspam or SpamAssassin. Receive emails which contain spam-headers that clearly mark the mails as spam or as whitelisted, and still apply the wrong filter. \n\nAs an example, here are some of the DSPAM headers for a newsletter I received, which Mail.app mistakenly marked as junk: \n\nX-Dspam-Probability: 0.0000\nX-Binding: 1786589854\nX-Elqsiteid: 1786589854\nX-Dspam-Confidence: 0.9949\nX-Dspam-Result: Whitelisted\n\nIn other words, the spam filter is 99,49% confident, that his opinion that it has a 0% chance of being spam is correct. Still, this email was in my junk mailbox when Mail.app received it via IMAP. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe mail should be put into my inbox with confidence, instead of being filtered. When the setting is activated, the headers should override mail’s built-in filtering. \n\nActual Results:\nThe setting seems to have no effect. Mail applies the wrong filtering.\n\nRegression:\nThis problem has been there as long as I remember using Mail.app. It’s high time the setting does what it promises.\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
