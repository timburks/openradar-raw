    description: "When I swipe down or to the left on my iPad to search for an app or content on my device, I regularly get the keyboard in the wrong orientation. This happens about 90% of the times I try it. Keyboard still works normally.\r\n\r\nDevice: iPad Air 2\r\niOS: 10.2\r\n\r\nThis has happened for the last couple of versions."
