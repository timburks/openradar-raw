    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSee attached screen shot. Quote Tweets should render in preview not just display t.co link. This doesn't conform w Twitter standard experience representation of Tweets at this point.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a tweet with a tweet quoted within it as a message to someone\r\nExample tweet:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/conorsen/status/808779313902456832\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expected the quoted tweet to be rendered in the messages preview.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead the quoted tweet is only rendered as a t.co link. This completely changes the value of the original tweet which relies heavily on the content of the quoted tweet. Also I am reasonably sure at this point it might even violate Twitter's policy on how tweets are rendered in syndication not sure.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest macOS latest iOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee this info on quote tweets from Twitter\r\nhttps://support.twitter.com/articles/20169873\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-12-13 at 1.31.48 PM.png' was successfully uploaded."
