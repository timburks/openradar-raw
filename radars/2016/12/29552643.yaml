        Summary:
        Xcode8 often triggers a full rebuild of our large project, even when we only changed one single character in a string. Since the project is large, this takes a couple of minutes to see the effects of a minor change.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a large project with 1500+ source files (Objective-C) and an embedded framework
        2. change one letter in a hardcoded string (e.g. "bla" to "blh")
        3. run the project

        Expected Results:
        1. Only the relevant source file is recompiled

        Actual Results:
        1. All 1500+ are recompiled

        Regression:
        This did not happen in Xcode 7
