    description: "Organizing folders is hard in iOS. It's even harder to remember where I've put a particular app. So I mostly use Spotlight to launch apps.\r\n\r\nHowever, to delete an app or to actually file it into another folder one needs to look at the actual home screen location.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a \"Reveal App\" 3D Touch action in Spotlight results that opens the page or folder of the app and potentially highlights the selected app."
