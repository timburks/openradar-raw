    description: "Area:\r\nScreen Saver & desktop\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn macOS 10.12.1, I've noticed that if I use the \"keychain status\" menu item to lock my Mac, that erroneous keyboard or mouse activity can sometimes unlock my Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Keychain Access, go to Preferences, and select \"Show keychain status in menu bar\".\r\n2. In System Preferences, go to \"Security & Privacy\", and select \"Require password _immediately_ after sleep or screen saver begins\"\r\n3. Go to the lock icon in the menu bar, and select \"Lock Screen\". The screen will begin fading to black.\r\n4. Immediately generate some keyboard input (I find repeatedly striking \"Enter\" to be effective).\r\n5. Over 50% of the time, my Mac will be unlocked.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChoosing \"Lock Screen\" should result in my Mac being locked at the password prompt, 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChoosing \"Lock Screen\" only results in a locked mac if I quiesce all input. I now need to verify that my Mac is really locked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't have an Apple Watch, so I don't think my Mac is accidentally getting unlocked that way. I also haven't customized login with any U2F or other devices.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWe have been able to reproduce this on a variety of MacBook Pros around the office. In my configuration, my early 2015 13\" MacBook Pro is connected to an Apple Thunderbolt display and operating in lid-open mode (both displays active). In this configuration, the Thunderbolt display immediately goes black when clicking \"Lock Screen\", while the MBP display fades to black. Initiating keyboard input while fading to black is happening is the most likely way to trigger this bug, but I have successfully triggered it when both displays are dark (which normally indicates that the Mac is locked)."
