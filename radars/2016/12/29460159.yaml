    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an HTML element that was previously of type `position: fixed;` is changed to type `position: sticky;` it crashes the Webkit process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the 'open' example (open.html) in an iOS browser.\r\n2. Click the 'Show / Hide Table of Contents' toggle link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav reverts to stick at the top of the screen, as in the initial state of the 'closed' example.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web content process crashes and the page is reloaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari Version 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10)\r\nmacOS 10.12 (16A323)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis also happens on iOS (#29459895) although less consistently â€“ sometimes it doesn't crash on iOS but still renders strangely.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee dump file"
