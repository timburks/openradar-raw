    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMy app Deliveries makes use of local notifications. The app reuses the same identifier for each delivery, so old information is replaced with the most recent information.\r\n\r\nI've recently noticed some inconsistencies in whether these notifications are displayed. In the past, each call to deliverNotification: would present the notification in the top-right corner of the screen. Now that doesn't seem to be the case. If a notification with the same identifier is already in Notification Center, the new notification is not presentedâ€”it just quietly replaces the information in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is an intentional change in behavior, and I'm not sure when it happened. I only noticed it recently, after months of testing a new version of my app, so I assume something changed in 10.12.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached sample app.\r\n2. Run the app.\r\n3. Quickly switch to another app, and wait a second or two for the notification to display.\r\n4. Quit the app.\r\n5. Run the app again.\r\n6. Quickly switch to another app, and wait a second or two.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA second notification should display, with the text \"Message 2\" (or some other higher number).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second notification is not displayed. If you open Notification Center, you'll see the new notification there.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n3.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Intel Iris Graphics 550 1536 MB\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded."
