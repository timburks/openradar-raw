        Summary:
        Third party authorization plugins that are inserted to fire in addition to regular password auth when unlocking the screen have no visible UI

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add plugin to the appropriate authorization database
        2. Lock screen via screen saver or directly by using a screen lock command
        3. Attempt to unlock screen
        4. Enter regular password
        5. Wait for authorization plugin to show UI

        Expected Results:
        Authorization plugin shows UI and user can perform the required operations to be authorized

        Actual Results:
        No UI is shown, but the plugin is still running and any default keystrokes are handled, any other UI operations are impossible however

        Regression:
