    description: "Area:\r\niTunes Store / App Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt's important for developers to get ratings and reviews on our products in the App Store, so we want it to be as easy as possible for users to do so. \r\n\r\nCurrently, users are prompted to type in their iTunes store password when they choose to review an app. Allowing them to use Touch ID to authenticate would make the process much easier, and more users would be inclined to review products.\r\n\r\nThis may also reduce the number of developers who use illegitimate methods of obtaining product ratings on the App Store; the easier it is for actual users to rate apps, the more they'll actually do it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the App Store and navigate to the details page of any app that is installed on the device\r\n2. Tap the Reviews section\r\n3. An alert will prompt you to authenticate using your password\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe authentication prompt should use Touch ID rather than the account password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe authentication prompt asks for the store password, which can be long and cumbersome to type, and may lead the user to cancel their review entirely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1 [14B100]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis applies to all iOS devices with Touch ID, as well as the Mac App Store on models that have Touch ID as well."
