        Summary:
        Duplicating a target in Xcode creates an target-copy-Info.plist, but doesn't create a target-copy.entitlements. This leads to unexpected outcomes when editing the Capabilities of the target-copy.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In Xcode, select a project, then select a target within that project. Right-click on the target and select "Duplicate"

        Expected Results:
        The duplicate target (target-copy) should contain a separate entitlements file.

        Actual Results:
        The duplicate target uses the same entitlements file as the original target.
