        Summary:
        Swift non-escaping closure used escapingly in ObjC should trigger compilation error, just like called in Swift.

        In a mixed project, after migrating from Swift 2 to Swift 3, one closure is not correctly migrated to escaping, maybe because it is only called in ObjC code. However, it compiles successfully and caused runtime error which is very hard to figure out.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open sample project.
        2. See the correct compilation error for Swift code.
        3. Fix it.
        4. See no compilation error.
        5. Read code in ObjCClass.m which has the same code that triggers error in ViewController.swift.
