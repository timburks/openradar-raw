    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building and running tests on a slower machine, the test bundle fails to execute. Retrying can fix the issue. But this is particularly problematic when relying on a Continuous Integration service. Flaky test running defeats the purpose of having tests in the first place. Even if you run them on a slow machine, they should still work but just take longer to execute.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPreconditions:\r\nXcode 8.1+\r\nLow resource machine (4GB, single core)\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached workspace\r\n2. Run tests\r\n3. If they succeed, clean and run them again until the test bundle fails to execute.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test bundle should run every time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test bundle fails to execute. Inside the logs we see:\r\n\r\n2016-12-21 06:13:08.865 xcodebuild[4070:11608] Connection peer refused channel request for \"dtxproxy:XCTestManager_IDEInterface:XCTestManager_DaemonConnectionInterface\"; channel canceled <DTXChannel: 0x7fa41e2a2780>\r\n[06:13:08]: ▸ 2016-12-21 06:13:08.868 xcodebuild[4070:11461] Error Domain=IDETestOperationsObserverErrorDomain Code=3 \"The operation couldn’t be completed.
