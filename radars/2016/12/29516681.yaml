    description: "Area:\r\nVPN\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen connecting an iPad to a USB adapter and then a USB Ethernet adapter, the wi-fi icon disappears from the status bar to indicate that you’re on the wired connection. However, if you connect to a VPN while on Ethernet, the VPN icon does not appear on the status bar. If you disconnect from Ethernet, the VPN icon appears next to the wi-fi icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect your iPad to Ethernet.\r\n2. Connect to a VPN.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe VPN icon is displayed in the status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe VPN icon is not displayed in the status bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C90)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried to do this the opposite way—connect to the VPN and then connect to Ethernet—but this appears to continue using the wi-fi network until you disconnect from the VPN.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro (12.9\"), 128GB, Wi-Fi"
