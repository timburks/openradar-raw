    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen in a standard Save dialog that's displaying in icon mode, clicking the name of a file to rename the new file you're saving (the \"Save As\" field) doesn't work. This works fine in List or Grid view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create or open a file in any application that uses a standard OS save dialog.\r\n2. If needed, switch the view to Icon view.\r\n3. Click a file displayed in the dialog\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Save As\" field would change the name of the file to be saved to the name of the file clicked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Save As\" field does not change to the name of the file clicked.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.12.1 (16B2555)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to switch to list or column view, where this works. But this worked in previous versions of Mac OS X and I'm pretty sure in macOS 10.12\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), Intel Iris 1536MB graphics\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
