    description: "Summary:\nWhen running a project built through Xcode 8.2 build 8C30a, there are numerous log statements describing networking information, and many other things dumped into the console even though the project has not been opted into such logging.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Build any iOS project \n2. Select any iOS 10.0-based simulator (this does not reproduce on iOS 10.1 or 10.2-based simulators) and run the built project \n\nExpected Results:\nOnly log statements created within the built project, or itâ€™s related libraries are emitted to the console\n\nActual Results:\nSystem level log statements such as those listed below are emitted to the console in addition to log statements created within the project. Examples of errantly emitted log statements as follows:\n\n[] nw_connection_endpoint_report [16.1 54.71.130.170:443 ready socket-flow (satisfied)] reported event flow:finish_connect\n[] nw_connection_endpoint_report [16 api.segment.io:443 ready resolver (satisfied)] reported event flow:finish_connect\n[] __tcp_connection_start_block_invoke 16 sending event TCP_CONNECTION_EVENT_TLS_HANDSHAKE_COMPLETE in response to state ready and error (null)\n[] tcp_connection_event_notify 16 event: TCP_CONNECTION_EVENT_TLS_HANDSHAKE_COMPLETE, reason: nw_connection event, should deliver: true\n[] tcp_connection_get_statistics DNS: 194ms/196ms since start, TCP: 282ms/483ms since start, TLS: 473ms/954ms since start\n[] tcp_connection_cancel 12\n[] nw_socket_handle_socket_event Event mask: 0x4\n[] tcp_connection_cancel 13\n[] nw_socket_handle_socket_event Socket received WRITE_CLOSE event\n[] tcp_connection_cancel 11\n\nRegression:\nThis logging does not occur when using the iOS 10.1 or 10.2 simulators. Additionally, the networking logging does not happen when using an iOS 10.0 simulator on the production version of Xcode 8.1 8T61a, but UIKit logging does.\n\nNotes:"
