    description: "I'm trying to send an HTTP GET with some data in the body. The HTTP Request says the Content-Length is greater than 0, but no body is sent. A minute later, the response comes back saying \"The request timed out.\" I'm expecting the request to succeed by sending the body to the server.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed a bit in https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/67143\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun this code in the simulator:\r\n\r\nlet session = URLSession(configuration: URLSessionConfiguration.default, delegate: nil, delegateQueue: nil)  \r\nvar request = URLRequest(url: URL(string:\"https://www.example.com\")!)  \r\nrequest.httpMethod = \"GET\"  \r\nrequest.httpBody = try! JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: [], options: .prettyPrinted)  \r\nlet task = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in  \r\n    print(\"Got response\")  \r\n    print(data)  \r\n    print(response)  \r\n    print(error)  \r\n}  \r\ntask.resume()  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe response should come back successfully in under three seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe response takes over 30 seconds and times out."
