    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBecause NSStatusItems are implemented as NSWindow, and appear in the window list of the host app, selecting Minimize All in an app that has status items installed will cause those status items to minimize to the Dock.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the status item windows shouldn't minimize in any case, because they are not conceptually \"windows\" to a user. But the fact they do minimize is probably owing to another bug, rdar://problem/29482397, which causes an app's windows to be minimized even if the \"miniaturizable\" bit is not set on their styleMask.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached project.\r\n2. Build and run.\r\n3. Hold the option key while either clicking the minimize button of the app's main window, or selecting Window -> Minimize All.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the app's single window should minimize.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window, and status item \"Hi\" are minimized to the Dock.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C48b) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'StatusItemWindowTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
