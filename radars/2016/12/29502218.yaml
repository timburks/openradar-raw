    description: "Area:\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt is impossible to add Songs from the \"My New Music Mix\" playlist to my own Apple Music library if I have downloaded the whole playlist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the \"My New Music Mix\" playlist in the \"For You\" tab in the Music app.\r\n2. Tap the download button for the whole playlist.\r\n3. Wait for songs to download\r\n4. Try to add a song to you library with one of these methods:\r\n4.1. Play it and search for the \"+\" button that should be in the lower left corner.\r\n4.2. Touch and hold the song entry in the list and search for the non existent \"Add to my library\" button (which is replaced by the \"remove download\" button).\r\n4.3. Touch the ellipsis button on the bottom right of the now playing screen (same menu as 4.2.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is an option to add the selected song to my library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to add the selected song to my library, except for deleting the download first, then adding the song to my library and redownloading.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C82)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's even impossible to add the song using the search. It has to be removed from the device first.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE, iPad Air"
