    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIt seems that using an AVSpeechSynthesizer in any way (I tried several) in iOS 10.2 results in a lot of garbage being spewed to the system or debug console.  It happens (1) when initialized and (2) during and immedidately after the first utterance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Connect an iPad Retina, or probably any iOS device, to your Mac.\r\n2.  Build and run the attached project, SpeechBug1226.zip, also available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jerrykrinock/SpeechBug1226\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn Debug Console, only entries from my NSLog() statements.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen running this project on my actual iPad Retina Mini, I get\r\n\r\n- 9 lines of garbage upon running the initializer `AVSpeechSynthesizer()`\r\n- 18 lines of garbage upon calling `speak(_ utterance: AVSpeechUtterance)` for the first time\r\n- 149 lines of garbage after all is said and done\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.2 (14C92)\r\nXcode 8.2 (8C38)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs you can see from this Stack Overflow article, some developers are reporting that, in addition to the garbage, no sound is produced.  I have seen that problem in my actual app, with the first utterance after the speech synthesizer was initialized.  I was able to work around that by rearranging the code.  I don't know exactly what I did, but it will probably be back to bite me if this bug is not fixed first :(\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39879275/avspeechsynthesizer-doesnt-work-on-ios10\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWhen running in the iOS Simulator's iPad Retina I get a little less garbage, 145 lines total."
