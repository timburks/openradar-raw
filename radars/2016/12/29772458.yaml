    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have encountered this issue multiple times. Now we having this issue with latest upgrade of Xcode to 8.2 and we are having this issue on Travis.\r\n\r\n1) I can only attach our latest build log on Travis where we tripple-checked the correctness of our certificates and profiles.\r\n\r\n2) https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6675 issue is another manifestation of similar behaviour when codesign just hangs.\r\n\r\n3) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40994404/xcodebuild-stuck-at-codesign-step-when-being-run-in-travis-ci\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnfortunately the issue is hard to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect codesign to either succeed or fail in a reasonable time with a human-readable explanation of a failure reason. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncodesign hangs without printing anything to a console.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.2 (8C38)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue is hard to reproduce however for us it is quite obvious that codesign should be smarter about error reporting and failing with errors after a certain timeout (could be a configurable option).\r\n\r\nA lot of people suffer from just this single codesign problem.\r\n\r\nI am willing to provide any additional information by request.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'2016.12.21.Travis.CodeSign.txt' was successfully uploaded."
