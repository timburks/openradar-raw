        Summary:
        Generation of .icns files (which are still required for things like custom document types) is no longer possible with any Apple provided GUI application. As mentioned by this note https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Optimizing/Optimizing.html people should *not* use Icon Composer (and in fact, cannot as of Sierra). Instead the documentation recommends using set of icons to convert using the iconutil command.

        The ability to have an icon set be generated into an .icns file should be built into Xcode’s asset catalog management UI as a configuration option.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        0. Download sample project from http://drop.mchl.io/072O2R410F2g
        1. Open the sample application
        2. Click on the “TestMacApp” target
        3. Click on the “Info” tab
        4. Expand the document types
        5. Attempt to set the named image set “Icon” as the value for the Icon field of the Document Type with the identifier “com.testapp.file”

        Expected Results:
        Since we are advised to export an icon set as the way to create an .icns file I expect to be able to set an icon set as the value of my document icon.

        Actual Results:
        Setting a value that is not an .icns file will set the image well to a large question mark, and not set any proper image value. Additionally, .icns files cannot be referenced if they are located inside of an asset catalog.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
