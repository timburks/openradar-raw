    description: "Summary:\r\nStarting in macOS 10.12.2, Safari is more active about preventing custom schemes from launching pertinent applications. This applies not only to custom schemes invoked from web content, but also from user-installed Bookmark Bar links.\r\n\r\nBookmarklets are sometimes used to facilitate an ease of workflow between the web and native apps. My app, MarsEdit, offers such a bookmarklet to users, so that they can easily open a new blog post draft based on the current page and selected content in Safari.\r\n\r\nThe particular workflow accommodated by this is stymied by having to repeatedly confront a permissions panel in Safari, every time the bookmarklet is used.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if there were some way of whitelisting schemes or, better yet, providing an option to users to \"Always Allow\" opening a particular application.\r\n\r\nThe argument for allowing users to open specific applications is greater for bookmarklets, because the user is likely to have manually installed the bookmarklet in order to accommodate a certain workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download MarsEdit: \r\n\r\nhttps://red-sweater.com/\r\n\r\n2. Launch the app (you can skip configuring a blog).\r\n3. Select MarsEdit -> Install Browser Bookmarklet from the menu bar at the top of the screen.\r\n4. Drag the \"Send to MarsEdit\" link from the page in Safari, to the Bookmark Bar.\r\n5. Navigate to any page on the web.\r\n6. Click the \"Send to MarsEdit\" bookmarklet.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to download the app, just put this bookmarklet code in a bookmarklet:\r\n\r\njavascript:var%20baseUrl%20=%20'marsedit:';%20var%20url%20=%20baseUrl;var%20title%20=%20document.title;%20url%20=%20url%20+%20'title='%20+%20encodeURIComponent%20(title);%20var%20currentUrl%20=%20document.location.href;%20url%20=%20url%20+%20'&url='%20+%20encodeURIComponent%20(currentUrl);%20var%20selectedText;%20selectedText%20=%20getSelection%20();%20if%20(selectedText%20!=%20'')%20url%20=%20url%20+%20'&text='%20+%20encodeURIComponent%20(selectedText);document.location.href=url;\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome means of suppressing the warning panel being displayed every single time.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user must click through the tedious panel in order to complete the action.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2 (16C67)\r\nVersion 10.0.2 (12602.3.12.0.1) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
