    description: "The authorisation database is a bit of an anachronism. It’s poorly documented and functions are uncertain, however there are useful things in it such as swapping the screensaver to use the security agent instead of the loginwindow for authentication. It’s only manageable via the security command at present. However with the rumoured removal of system level access, as well as going MDM only in two years time … maybe some/most/ALL of this handy functionality could be moved into configuration profiles?\r\n\r\nIt would certainly make the macOS admin’s job a lot easier too from a usability point of view. We would know for sure what we’re actually setting!"
