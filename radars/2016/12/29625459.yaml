    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm creating an AVAssetDownloadURLSession through documented means. I'm assigning it to a property in another class, but that property is \"NSURLSession\". Since AVAssetDownloadURLSession is a subclass of NSURLSession, this is fine, and the compiler doesn't complain.\r\n\r\nLater on, I want to see if the session is an AVAssetDownloadURLSession by downcasting it. The downcast fails, even though I'm checking the memory address in the debugger, and it says it's the same as when it was created. The debugger does report it as an \"__NSURLBackgroundSession\", btw. But now I can't be certain if my session is an AVAssetDownloadURLSession, and this is a real problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVAssetDownloadURLSession.\r\n2. define a varaiable like this: var someVar: URLSession = avURLSession\r\n3. try to downcast: let downcastAVSession = someVar as? AVAssetDownloadURLSession\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect my downcast to work, and the value \"downcastAVSession\" be valid.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe downcast fails, giving a nil result.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHere's my original post in the forums about this:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/69209"
