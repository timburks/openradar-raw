    description: "Summary: Interface Builder is a great tool for setting the graphical values of your views without needing to write any code, but for iOS applications this does not extend to a UIView's layer.\r\n\r\nBecause the layer object is not exposed, any layer setup details must be performed in code.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request that the layer object be exposed in nib and xib files, and that you be allowed to set things like cornerRadius and borderColor on it in IB."
