    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit (Health / Activity)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSee title. This is a duplicate of rdar://29144669, but with a correct sample project attached. The sample types in the issue title cannot be written and therefore third party apps cannot help generate activity summaries, as filed in rdar://29144768.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (\"Radar1Dec2016.zip\").\r\n2. Build and run in the simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA HealthKit popup appears prompting the user to give permission to import Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel points.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes and the attached file appears in the console (\"Radar7Nov2016.crash\").\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone SE 64GB T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Radar1Dec2016.zip' was successfully uploaded."
