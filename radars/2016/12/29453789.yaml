    description: "When using Keychain Access to reset the default keychain, the entries located for TouchID are lost. This causes fingerprints to still show that they are valid, but you cannot use Touch ID to unlock the machine or use it for any other administrative tasks.\r\n\r\nReproduce steps\r\n1. Configure Touch ID either through SetupAssistant or System Preferences -> Touch ID\r\n2. Lock screen and authenticate to ensure Touch ID is functioning.\r\n3. Open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app and go to Preferences -> Reset My Default Keychain\r\n4. Create a new login.keychain\r\n5. Reboot\r\n6. Login and attempt to use Touch ID for administrative tasks or subsequent unlocks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\n1. Keychain Access should inform the user that they will need to re-configure any previously configured fingerprints.\r\n2. A sub process should remove any fingerprints configured for that particular user.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nKeychain is reset and System Preferences -> Touch ID shows valid fingerprints. The user can no longer use Touch ID."
