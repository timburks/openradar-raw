    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen an HTML element that was previously of type `position: fixed;` is changed to type `position: sticky;` it either crashes the Webkit process or is rendered incorrectly by Webkit browsers on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load the 'open' example (open.html) in an iOS browser.\r\n2. Click the 'Show / Hide Table of Contents' toggle link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav reverts to stick at the top of the screen, as in the initial state of the 'closed' example.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe web content process will usually (but not always) crash. If it does not crash, the element reverts to its sticky state, but is not stuck at the right place, and occasionally seems to disappear entirely.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 10.1 (14B72), Safari or Chrome 54.0.2840.91\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHosted version of example available at https://36degrees.github.io/webkit-ios-fixed-sticky/\r\n\r\nThis also happens in Safari 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10) on macOS 10.12 (16A323), submitted as a separate bug report (with Web Content Crash Dump)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s"
