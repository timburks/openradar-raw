    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a mailing list frequently, and unfortunately relevant information (i.e. who sent a message) is often hidden in the \"Details\" area of the message (specifically, the \"Reply-To\" field). I'd like an option to have this expanded by default so that I don't have to open it for every message (see screenshot for what I'm talking about).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive an email from a mailing list\r\n2. Click \"Details\" for every message in the thread\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option to have it expanded by default\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's always \"folded\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRegression from the previous beta, which had it \"opened\" by default\r\nSomewhat relevant: could you add these \"Details\" to Mail messages in iOS as well?\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12 Beta (16A254g)"
