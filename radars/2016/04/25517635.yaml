    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I misplace the Siri remote, it would be significantly easier to find if I could make it beep at me via either the software interface of the Apple TV, a hardware button on the Apple TV, Remote.app on my iPhone or a button on my apple watch (preferably some combination of all of the above). \r\n\r\nIt’s a great remote, but it’s really difficult to find because of its size, and using the Remote.app iPhone app is a significantly degraded user experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lose Siri remote. \r\n2. Turn apartment upside down looking for Siri remote. Fail to find it, because it is tiny and you have dark furniture. \r\n3. Question your sanity, because it was RIGHT THERE, and you had to start watching things on your Apple TV somehow.\r\n4. Resign yourself to using Remote.app and potentially buying a new Siri remote. \r\n5. Find remote a week later, wish you could have made it beep at you so you could have found it a week ago. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOperation similar to the “where the hell is my phone?” button on the Apple Watch - press a button, and the object beeps at you/ allowing you to echolocate the object and have it not be lost anymore\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(See “steps to reproduce”)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot really a regression - the previous remote was also easy to lose, although since it was silver it was a lot easier to find against dark furniture. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA good example of how to handle this can be found on the TiVo Roamio, which allows you to press a TiVo logo-shaped button on the front of the device, causing the remote to play a noise until you can find it. \r\n\r\nApple TV remote los seems to be a fairly common problem. Running a search for “Lost Apple TV Remote” on Twitter while filing this radar brought up such gems as: \r\n\r\n“If I had a chicken nugget for every time I lost the apple tv remote id never be hungry again” - https://twitter.com/ryanbak_/status/716443611773214720\r\n“If I had a dollar for every time I lost my Apple TV remote id be able to buy Kanye west \U0001F644” - https://twitter.com/KinseyInc/status/716114803786260480\r\n“I HAVE BEEN CLEANING UP THIS APARTMENT FOR LIKE THREE HOURS BC I LOST THE APPLE TV REMOTE CONTROL AND STILL HAVE NOT FOUND IT FFS” - https://twitter.com/oliveginja/status/715238665589559297\r\n\r\nHelp your customers avoid caps lock rage, friends. Please make it easier to find the remote."
