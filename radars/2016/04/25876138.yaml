    description: "See this discussion I started: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=185680\r\n\r\nIt's about the fact that, despite the AppleScript documentation for files (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH218-SW28), specifying a file by HFS path does not work any more in 10.10 (and 10.11 probably as well).\r\n\r\nE.g, this leads to an error:\r\n\r\nfile \"Macintosh HD:Library\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, it should work, however.\r\n\r\nThe work-around is to use \"as «class furl»\", it appears.\r\n\r\nThat's a very obscure and therefore bad solution.\r\n\r\n1. Please fix the \"file\" specifier to make it work again,\r\n2. Update the docs,\r\n3. Add a proper name for the \"furl\" class type so that it's not showing as «class furl» but rather as something like \"file URL\", and hopefully also can be used with that name.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on 10.10.5 and 10.11.4"
