        Summary:
        The preview assistant view in Xcode is really great. It’s nice to quickly see layouts in the known screen sizes. However, for sometimes tricky Auto Layouts (like with lots of flowing text), where you might have varying lengths of text, it can be really useful to see how Auto Layout performs in a more interactive way. It think it would go a long way in helping people understand Auto Layout better as well.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build a UI with Auto Layout in storyboard or XIB
        2. Open the preview assistant to preview the UI
        3. Click the “+” icon on the lower left to add a new screen type

        Expected Results:
        There’s a new “Resizable” screen type. Selecting that shows a new screen size, with has resizer handles when you mouse over the edges. You can drag with your mouse to increase or decrease the size of the UI, to watch your Auto Layout constraints in action.

        Actual Results:
        Only fixed screen sizes are available, based on Apple’s overall device lineup
