        Summary:
        When switching through tightly-packed tabs, the tab text shifts slightly left and right.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open enough tabs in a Safari window that they stop getting smaller with each new tab.
        2. Switch through tabs.

        Expected Results:
        The text in the tabs doesn’t move while switching tabs.

        Actual Results:
        The text shifts a few pixels left and right. See attached screen recording, also posted at http://cl.ly/faGN

        Regression:
        I feel like I would have noticed this on pre-9.1 Safari, but I don’t have it installed anywhere to confirm.

        Notes:
        Running OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)
