    description: "Summary:\r\nThe bar button items used from an UITextInputAssistantItem's bar button item groups, do not allow long-press repeat events. Especially for text modification buttons this would be extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- Buttons to move the insertion point\r\n- Buttons to change font size (any numeric metric)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a – this is about missing API\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ability to set a bar button item's action into \"repeat\" mode. This would allow tap & repeat actions like the keyboard delete button exposes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API. Sad developer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached a screenshot from one of our apps, where – if enough space is available (ie. predictive turned off) – buttons to move the insertion point are made available to the user. Those not offering a long-press repeated action is a point of frustration for may of our users.\r\n\r\nThis sort-of relates to rdar://25824951\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Napkin 20.04.16, 11.55.45 AM.png' was successfully uploaded. http://cl.ly/fkOQ"
