    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen invoking a timer either using the Clock app or especially when using Siri, the \"When timer ends option\": \"Stop playing\" should never be used if there is currently no music or other audio playing. With no music playing this always ends up with missed timers. Using Siri, this gets even worse as you cant get a glimpse of the setting like you can in Clock app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boil Water\r\n2. Brew some black tea\r\n3. set the timer to 3 minutes using Siri\r\n4. do something else\r\n5. forget the timer\r\n6. after ~12 Minutes, realize you were brewing tea\r\n7. find out the signal was set to \"Stop Playing\" even though no music was playing that could be stopped\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither notify me when creating the timer that the signal is set to \"stop playing\" and offering me the option to change the setting.\r\nMy Tea being delicious.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe timer didn't ring.\r\nMy Tea tastes \"interesting\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
