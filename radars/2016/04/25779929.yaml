Currently, you have to manually divide them up into multiple targets, but ideally, you could just specify a list of tests to test with the xcodebuild command it run just those tests, similar to how you would within Xcode. Steps to Reproduce: xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -scheme \"MyProject\" test -only MyProjectUnitTests:TestClass1/test1,TestClass1/test2,TestClass2/test3 Expected Results: Test just the classes or individual test specified Actual Results: Run all all tests within a target.

We are using UIWebView to render content that the user will annotate. Without the ability to create a selection that triggers the selection UI we are blocked from allowing the user update and adjust their highlights. Steps to Reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/c6jsa/ Create a javascript Range object, add it to a Selection. Expected Results: The blue selection UI with grabbers appears. (UIWebView enters selection mode) The pre-defined selection Range defines the start/end of the grabbers. Actual Results: Nothing. The only way to enter selection mode is to long press on text. The blue selection UI never shows. Version: All versions of iOS Notes: The desired behavior is to programmatically enter selection mode in UIWebView. Right now, the ONLY way to do that is through a long press gesture on text. Here's a stackoverflow post where others are desiring the same behavior: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16972655/how-to-programmatically-enter-selection-mode-in-a-uiwebview Configuration: All iOS devices, including simulators Attachments:\r\n25779929 \r\n`xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` hangs when running multiple instances in parallel\r\n2\r\nState:OpenProduct:iOS\r\nRank:No Value\r\nAdd new information...\r\nChoose FileAttach a fileHide |  Resolved Revert Save\r\nStephan Heilner19-Apr-2016 01:15 PM\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -showBuildSettings often hangs as well when not run in parallel, just when run independently\r\nStephan Heilner18-Apr-2016 10:53 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen running multiple xcodebuild -showBuildSettings at the same time, I get a NSRecursiveLock, which causes them to deadlock and hang. I use a tool called xctool that allows me to divide up and run my tests suite in parallel. Its worked really great up until the Xcode 7.3 release. When I run a `ps aux | grep xcodebuild`, I see this process is stuck:\r\n\r\n`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator9.3 -destination id=17C92A97-0AB2-4F49-ABAB-5D4E0D03CA1B -destination-timeout 10 CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR=/Users/iosbuild/Jenkins/workspace/GospelLibrary-PullRequest-IntegrationTests/build/derivedData PLATFORM_NAME=iphonesimulator -project GospelLibrary.xcodeproj -target GospelLibraryIntegrationTests OBJROOT=/Users/iosbuild/Jenkins/workspace/GospelLibrary-PullRequest-IntegrationTests/build/derivedData/Build/Intermediates SYMROOT=/Users/iosbuild/Jenkins/workspace/GospelLibrary-PullRequest-IntegrationTests/build/derivedData/Build/Products SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR=/Users/iosbuild/Jenkins/workspace/GospelLibrary-PullRequest-IntegrationTests/build/derivedData/Build/Intermediates/PrecompiledHeaders TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1,2 build -showBuildSettings`\r\n\r\nxctool, runs this command and then spawns a simulator and lets you get a list of all your tests within a target. I take that list, partition it out and run the tests on 6 different machines so that I can slim down 2 hours worth of tests to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload sample project (MyTestProject.zip), extract, run the 'makeHang.sh' script, which just runs 10 xcodebuild -showBuildSettings simultaneously. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRun multiple xcodebuild -showBuildSettings simultaneously without hanging\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRun multiple xcodebuild -showBuildSettings simultaneously causes it to hang\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOSX - MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and Mac Pro\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'spindump.txt' and 'MyTestProject.zip' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -showBuildSettings often hangs as well when not run in parallel, just when run independently"
