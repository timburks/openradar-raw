    description: "Summary:\nCurrently, we have an application that implements MKMapView, and we place several annotations on top of the map. We offer an option in app, similar to Maps.app, using the showsTraffic property. Occasionally, when viewing the map with the MKMapTypeStandard mapType, traffic will not display on the map, even though the boolean is set to true.\n\nIn looking through the logs on a device where we were seeing this occur (iPhone 5S, 9.2.1 13D15), found some various errors with VectorKit failing to load traffic, along with an error when querying http://gspe12.ls.apple.com/, with a request that presumably is for traffic. I've attached a text file with the applicable logs to this radar.\n\nHave been able to recreate this occasionally on an iPhone 5, 5S, and 6S. Twice, on an iPhone 5 and 6S, the issue resolved itself after simply opening Maps.app. On the 5S, opening Maps has not improved this issue at all. Really not sure what is going on, and can not find any documentation or guidance on issues in the app or with the device that could be causing the failure to load traffic.\n\nNote, this has happened occasionally across many hours of testing, but can not reproduce reliably and consistently. Happy to offer source code for the project we are working with, if it would be useful. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Implement an application with MKMapView\n2) Try to display traffic with the showsTraffic property\n3) Sometimes, traffic will not display on a device. Xcode gives no error output on this, but was able to find some logs and have attached.\n\nExpected Results:\nTraffic data should be shown on the map.  \n\nActual Results:\nWe've had instances with same zoom level, on devices both connected to same WiFi network, sitting next to each other, where one will show traffic and the other will not.\n\nRegression:\nIt seems to be more common on iPhone 5/5S hardware, but this does not seem to be a definite. Have seen issue occur on a 6S as well, and in various simulators."
