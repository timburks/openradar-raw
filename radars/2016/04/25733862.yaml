        I understand that Safari now uses custom Javascript alerts to fight malware. And I appreciate that the new alerts are tab-modal and don't affect other tabs or Safari as a whole.

        However the fact that keyboard navigation was completely taken away is a major usability issue. JS alerts are used in many Intranet / Admin UI frameworks, e.g. as delete confirmations. Taking away the ability to confirm alerts by simply typing Return or ESC is a serious usability regression. Not even speaking of the accessibility problem for the visually impaired.
