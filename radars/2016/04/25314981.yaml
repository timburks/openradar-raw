    description: "Summary:\r\nI am using Wi-Fi connection at school. At the end of a lesson I just close the MacBook and I go home. At home I open MacBook, log in and OS X does not connect me to my home Wi-Fi althought it is saved in known AP. OS X cannot connect me because it cannot see this Wi-Fi on channels 12 and 13. My Wi-Fi is at channel 12, so OS X cannot se it.\r\nBut WHY? System report shows Country code: US. But WHY?\r\nAt \"Language&Region\" is preferred language just and only \"Čeština\" and Region is set to the \"Czech republic\". List sort order is set to \"Czech\". Data&Time -> Time Zone has got disabled automatically using current location and is set to the city \"Brno - Česká republika.\" (my school is at the same city)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. close MacBookAir6,2\r\n2. move it to another location\r\n3. open MacBook and login\r\n4.
