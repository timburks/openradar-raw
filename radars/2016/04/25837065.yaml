    description: |-
        iOS 9.3 added two new color space names: kCGColorSpaceDCIP3 and kCGColorSpaceDisplayP3

        The documentation needs to be more explicit about which color space is being used by the display (and can be used by developers to get the right gamut.)

        Additionally, some background about why the white point and gamma curves are different than the SMPTE specification would be helpful.
