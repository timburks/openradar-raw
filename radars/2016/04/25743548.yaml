    description: "Summary:\r\nSeriously - AppleScript control already allows you to do enormous damage (delete all your files for example).  Why on earth would this triviality be disabled by default?\r\n\r\nDisabling this, and worse only allowing it enabled from within the \"Develop\" menu which in turn is not shown by default is very problematic for users (for instance, it disables all Safari actions in Keyboard Maestro).\r\n\r\nI'm all for security, but this is just pointlessly annoying given the breadth of power an executing AppleScript already has."
