        Summary:
        We have Smart App Banner meta tags on our web page. The app-argument url (url A) differs from the url the Smart App Banner meta tag is on (url B) though. In our apple-app-site-association file, we only have url A, not url B. The Smart App Banner does not appear in that case. Only when we add url B to the apple-app-site-association file, which we want to avoid.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Have a website https://www.mywebsite.com
        * Add an apple-app-site-association file:
        {
            applinks: {
                apps: [],
                details: [
                    {
                        appID: "my.app.id",
                        paths: [
                            "/supported/url/path"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
        * On the web page https://www.mywebsite.com/web/only/url/path add the following meta tag:
        <meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=123456789, app-argument=https://www.mywebsite.com/supported/url/path">

        Expected Results:
        When in Mobile Safari navigating to the website https://www.mywebsite.com/web/only/url/path, and the app is installed, the Smart App Banner should show up, and show the "Open" Button.

        Actual Results:
        No Smart App Banner shows up.

        Interestingly, when adding "/web/only/url/path" to the apple-app-site-association file, the Smart App Banner DOES show up. But our app does not support this url as an app argument, so we cannot add this to our apple-app-site-association file. This behavior does not make any sense, we think there is a bug in Safari when it decides if the Smart App Banner should be shown.

        Regression:
        Tried on different iPads and iPhones with several iOS 9 versions, especially 9.3.1.
