    description: "Summary:\r\nAudio received from the system input (by calling AudioUnitRender on a Remote IO unit's bus 1) from within an IAA node app is corrupted when the client-facing scopes of the RIO node are operating at a different sample rate than the session.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the first few frames of each buffer appear to contain audio samples from the past (see attached image).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Remote IO audio unit, with input enabled and client formats on bus 0 input scope, and bus 1 output scope at 44.1kHz.\r\n2. Publish the RIO unit, and host from an IAA host app with session sample rate at a different sample rate (e.g. 48kHz)\r\n3. When rendering, draw input from the RIO unit using AudioUnitRender\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem audio received as normal\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFirst part of every buffer contains old junk data\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iOS 9.2 and 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached sample apps: one generator, one host. After starting host, switch to generator and move switch to oscillator mode to verify that audio reaches host app without issue: problem lies on the RIO input side.\r\n\r\nIf the IAA node's client-facing scopes are running at the session sample rate, or the node uses a separate Remote IO unit for input, the problem goes away.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on an iPhone 6S Plus without headphones plugged in, causing read-only 48kHz samplerate for session\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IAA Test.zip' and 'analysis.jpg' were successfully uploaded."
