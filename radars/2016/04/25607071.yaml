    description: "Summary:\r\nKeys such as Shift and Backspace disappear when a textField has its keyboard appearance set to .Dark. This seems to happen in particular when automatically re-displaying the keyboard after dismissing a modal view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload, unzip, and run the attached project, which reproduces the problem in just a few lines.\r\n\r\n(Project publicly available on BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/clozach/darkkeyboardbugdemo)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeys _don't_ disappear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeys _do_ disappear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E230)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSimulator. iPhone 6+.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'keyboard.png' and 'DarkKeyboardBugDemo.zip' were successfully uploaded."
