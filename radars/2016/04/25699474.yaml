    description: "Description:\r\nWhen a photo has proportions close to device's screen proportions, Photos app automatically zooms the photo to occupy whole screen. Zooming out in such case is impossible – the photo just closes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Save a photo with proportions close to device's screen proportions to Photos.\r\n2. Open Photos, then tap on the saved photo.\r\n3. The photo goes fullscreen, but zoomed in to occupy whole screen.\r\n4. Try to zoom out the photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe photo zooms out\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo closes\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\nThere are 3 possible solutions in my opinion:\r\n1. Prevent Photos app from zooming photos automatically.\r\n2. Make zoom out gesture close only photos that are not zoomed in.\r\n3. Don't use zoom out gesture for closing photos, close only by swipe down."
