    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing an external keyboard, the key command ↑ (up arrow) does not work in certain situations, when used a second time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the attached sample project on an iPad Simulator\r\n- Tap into the UITextView on screen\r\n- Place insertion point after \"ullamco\" (this is important)\r\n- Ensure the External keyboard is connected\r\n- Press ↑ (up arrow)\r\n- Press ↑ (up arrow)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn the first use of ↑ (up arrow), the cursor jumps to the end of the previous line. On the second invocation, the cursor should jump to the line above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the first use of ↑ (up arrow), the cursor jumps to the end of the previous line. On the second invocation, however, the cursor does not move!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is always triggered when:\r\n\r\n- In a paragraph that is being wrapped to multiple lines\r\n- Placing the cursor in a line that's longer than the line above\r\n- Moving the cursor using the up arrow to the end of the line\r\n\r\nThe counterpart command ↓ (down arrow) works correctly. There seems to be an issue in UITextInputTokenizer not returning correct positions.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'textedit v2.zip' was successfully uploaded. http://cl.ly/fk4d"
