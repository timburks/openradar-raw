    description: Currently, anything of type UIApplicationShortcutIcon shows as just that, and has no properties to check what type of icon it is. The reason this would be useful is because some icons are only available on older iOS versions. If I am running tests against my app, I have no way of verifying the icon type without going through the hassle of mocking the object
