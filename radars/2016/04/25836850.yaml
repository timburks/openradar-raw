    description: "Summary:\r\nDynamic type is not working with the iOS Simulator running iOS 9.3 using Xcode 7.3. For example a UILabel set to a headline style does not respect the preferred font size set in the accessibility settings.\r\n\r\nIt works as expected on a physical device and on the iOS 8.4 Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a single view iOS project and add a UILabel to the view.\r\n2) Set the font of the label to the headline style.\r\n3) Have the view controller observe the UIContentSizeCategoryDidChangeNotification and set the font of the text label using the preferred font for the headline text style\r\n4) Run on the iOS 9.3 simulator and change the text size in the accessibility settings\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text size of the label reflects the settings of the device when first run and changes when the text size is changed in the accessibility settings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe size of the text label never changes when running on the iOS 9.3 Simulator. It works when running on a device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 running on OS X 10.11.4. Built for iOS 9.3 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis works as expected on the iOS 8.4 Simulator."
