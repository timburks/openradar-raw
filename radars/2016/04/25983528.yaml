        Summary:
        When using Application loader 3.0 OR 3.1 it does not allow you to login with an apple ID that is associated with multiple accounts.  This is painful because sometimes when Xcode will not submit an app without error application loader works.  So when Xcode has an error and your apple ID has multiple iTunes accounts the only workaround is to create a brand new apple ID that is only associated to that one account.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Using application loader 3.0 or 3.1 try logging into an Apple ID with more than one account associated

        Expected Results:
        It allows you to login and pick which account.

        Actual Results:
        In 3.0 I believe it gives you a message about the multiple accounts and in 3.1 it just fails to login.

        Notes:
        Using Xcode 7.3 on El Capitan
