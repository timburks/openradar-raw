    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, OS X selects the default font for applications based on the system language. This is not ideal in some cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sample application has Chinese (Simplified) and English localizations. If a user had system preferred languages set as “Japanese > Chinese (Simplified) > English”, the application would fallback to Chinese (Simplified). However, OS X would use the default Japanese font for it. This causes Chinese content being displayed using Japanese font.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/xhacker/radar and open the Xcode project in SystemFontInLanguage directory.\r\n2. Set system preferred languages to “Japanese > Chinese (Simplified) > English”.\r\n3. Build and run the sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text in the application should use the default system font for Chinese (Simplified) .\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt used the default Japanese font instead. (Notice the third character 系, it’s in Japanese shape.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be better to have different fallbacks for different content. In this case, although the application should use Chinese font for its UI, it should still use Japanese font for other content."
