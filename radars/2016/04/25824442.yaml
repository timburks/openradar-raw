        When clicking the ‘build and run’ button on Xcode while holding down the control key, Xcode launches the target without recompiling. This is an awesome feature. Sadly, this feature is not available when executing tests by clicking the play icon next to a test in the test navigator pane nor as an option when right / control clicking the play icon next to a test method in the source code editor.

        It would be very useful to have this option available as it happens quite often that, when improving / refactoring a certain part of the app you want to run only a hand full of unit tests to check if you broke something. These set of tests does not always match with all tests in a certain file, so that it may not always be a good fit to run the tests for a complete file. Being able to run a number of tests like this one after another would be a great feature.

        Even better: Xcode could, when running tests while control-clicking on a play icon of another test queue up this test until after the current test is done, instead of asking if the user wants to stop the current test run. Then you could quickly select a couple of tests that you want to check and Xcode will execute them one after another.
