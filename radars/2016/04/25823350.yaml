    description: "Summary:\r\nNSURLCache seems like it could be called on multiple threads by the system/applications, but the documentastion for NSURLCache doesn't state if this is even allowed. It would be great if this could be documented and/or what the expected usage on multiple threads is. Are apps allowed to call methods on the sharedURLCache\r\n\r\nURL: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLCache_Class/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Use NSURLCache on the main thread or on a background thread\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Confidence that using the sharedURLCache from the main thread or a background thread will not crash or that it's forbidden to do so.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Cluelessness what will happen. Living in constant fear that a crash might happen\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
