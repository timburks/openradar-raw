    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to create a stack view with the stack button with sibling items already in a stack view crashes Xcode\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a fresh Mac app with the standard template. \r\n2. In the story board, in the view controller, add a stack view\r\n3. Add a Label to the stack view, and add a text field to the stack view.\r\n4. Select the label and the text field\r\n5. Press the stack button \r\n\r\nXcode crashes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe intent is to create a horizontal stack (a stack in the other orientation to the first containing stack) of the two views within the vertical stack of the containing stack view. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes. Also, if Xcode didn’t crash, I figure IB would make a vertical stack view for consistency. But I really think that nested stack views should alternate orientation by default — this would fit with my use of stack views."
