        Summary:
        The share sheet on the system Photos app as an action on the share sheet of an image that allows the user to set up the selected image as a wallpaper for iOS. Is a really useful Action as it allows for a change on the background in a contextual manner (while viewing your photos) and not forcing the user to go to the settings app losing the context of the photo and being force to find it again.
        This Action should be exposed in the system frameworks to be included in the share sheet of third party apps allowing the apps to have this feature. Right now the apps have to relay on the user saving the picture on the photos app and then going there or the settings app to change the wallpaper.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        There is no way right now for a developer to include the “Use as Wallpaper” action on a share sheet.

        Expected Results:
        Adding system actions to share sheets of images or allowing the developer to include the option when creating the share sheet.
