    description: "Summary:\r\nLaunching an app while Split View is enabled on an iPad Air 2 prints layout errors. That's very annoying.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app on iPad Air 2 Simulator\r\n2. Enable Split View by swiping in another app from the right\r\n3. Stop running from Xcode\r\n4. Run again from Xcode\r\n5. Observe errors being printed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nno output at all.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n2015-11-25 14:07:23.308 test[40797:10955504] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.\r\n\tProbably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. \r\n\tTry this: \r\n\t\t(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; \r\n\t\t(2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. \r\n(\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fc7b963e890 V:|-(20)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x7fc7b9637ca0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x7fc7b940f450 )>\",\r\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fc7b95264f0 'UIInputWindowController-top' V:|-(0)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x7fc7b9637ca0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x7fc7b940f450 )>\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nWill attempt to recover by breaking constraint \r\n<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fc7b963e890 V:|-(20)-[UIInputSetContainerView:0x7fc7b9637ca0]   (Names: '|':UITextEffectsWindow:0x7fc7b940f450 )>\r\n\r\nMake a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.\r\nThe methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air 2 Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'test.zip' was successfully uploaded. http://cl.ly/fkRC"
