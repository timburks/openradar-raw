    description: "When an update to OS X is available and the user has chosen to Install OS X Updates Automatically in System Preferences, the system often attempts to install the update prior to providing warning, particularly if a prior warning has been provided and the user has asked for the update to be installed in an hour. Apps will be quit and the system will begin to shut down.\r\n\r\nThis is inherently intrusive and interruptive. It is user unfriendly and makes it less likely for me to install updates, not more likely. In-progress downloads in browsers may be cancelled without warning, for example, which makes this action potentially destructive.\r\n\r\nIf an update is attempting to install, the system should monitor for trackpad, keyboard, and network activity to ascertain whether the system is currently in use. If it is, the system should automatically prevent the update from installing and attempt again when there is no system activity. On machines with Power Nap, like my MacBook Air, system updates should be saved for installing overnight."
