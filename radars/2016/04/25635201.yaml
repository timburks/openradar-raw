        Summary:
        If I'm watching a movie/show on Netflix* and pause the playback and wait for the screensaver to turn on, unpausing will lead to a crash 90% of the time.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Netflix app
        2. Start movie
        3. Pause movie
        4. Wait for screensaver
        5. Unpause movie


        Expected Results:
        1. Open Netflix app
        2. start moview
        3. Pause movie
        4. Wait for screensaver
        5. Unpause movie
        *movie resumes, crowd goes wild*

        Actual Results:
        1. Open Netflix app
        2. Start movie
        3. Pause movie
        4. Wait for screensaver
        5. Unpause movie
        * crash, go to 1*

        Regression:
        This used to not happen, but I'm afraid I can't pinpoint it to an exact version that caused it.

        Notes:
        Things that help:
        - restarting the AppleTV
        - Using the default screensaver (I'm using the photos slideshow)
        - Restarting the AppleTV after it sleeps

        * Currently Ant-Man but if I had to pick one suggestion to test this out, I'd suggest HEAT. Micheal Mann's epic crime sage with De Niro and Pacino at their peak. A good plot coupled with top performances and Mann's amazing ability to make a character out of LA topped off with some amazing action scenes is not the worst way to debug this issue.
