    description: "Summary:\r\nAt least 90% of the phone calls I get these days are marketing robots, borderline scams, or just people doing regular unwanted marketing. I'm on the do not call list, it doesn't help. As much as I'd like to see the actual problem fixed, I just don't see it happening. Whenever I get one of these unwanted calls, my phone ring and vibrates, my Watch starts tapping me, alerts pop up on my iMac and iPad. It's frustrating.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd really like an option for iPhone to ignore calls that aren't in Contacts. It'd work pretty similar to how Do Not Disturb works, but just for the phone and always enabled. Or you could look at it like Mail's VIP system.\r\n\r\n- Calls from numbers in my Contacts ring normally\r\n- Repeated calls from numbers not in my Contacts would ring on the second call\r\n- A single call from a number not in my Contacts would either do nothing at all, or perhaps just display a quiet, far less disruptive notification\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a call from some telemarketer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy devices should not all pester me loudly as though it's something urgent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy devices all pester me loudly as though this phone call from someone I don't know must be something incredibly important.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s, 128GB, AT&T\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
