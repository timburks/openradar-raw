        Summary:
        UIAlertController doesn't lay itself out correctly if no title is set.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open sample, press black button. Run with iPad Air 2. Notice that the borders are incorrect. Screenshot: http://cl.ly/2t2R1Z3O2K44

        Expected Results: Discussable.

        1) UIActionSheet actually presented itself IN the popover. I would prefer this style, it’s also more in line with Apple’s HIG of only showing one popover at all times.

        2) If this isn’t possible (and it certainly would be a larger change) let’s at least make the layout correct. We got support requests at PSPDFKit where our customers complained for this bug, and it sucks that I have to tell them that it’s actually a UIKit problem and we’ll have to find some kind of terrible workaround that probably involves doing unspeakable things that might cause forward compatibility issues.

        Actual Results:
        Borders should not be cut off.

        Regression:
        This didn’t happen with UIActionSheet, however that one also presents differently.

        Notes:
        Doesn’t happen for all sides, definitely happens when the button is on the right side.
