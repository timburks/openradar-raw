    description: "When deleting an artist from an iTunes Library with the sidebar in the \"My Music\" view, the interface jumps back to the top of the list each time. This makes it very tedious to go down the list of artists and delete several at a time.\r\n\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Navigate to the \"My Music\" tab\r\n3. Switch to the \"Artists\" view\r\n4. Add enough different artists to an iTunes library so that the list has to scroll.\r\n5. Scroll down so that there are several items at the top of the list that aren't visible.\r\n6. Select an artist lower on the list\r\n7. Control-click the artist name and delete\r\n\r\nExpected: The artist's music is removed from the library, and either the artist before or after the deleted artist in the list is selected.\r\n\r\nActual: The artist's music is deleted, but the sidebar scrolls all the way back to the top."
