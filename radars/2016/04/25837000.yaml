        TN2313 - Best Practices for Color Management in OS X and iOS states:

        "iOS application development uses the targeted color management model. Your content is matched to the sRGB color space on the authoring platform. This matching is not performed dynamically on the iOS device. Instead, it happens during authoring on your Mac OS X desktop."

        iOS now uses active color management.
