    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, when creating a to-many relationship in Core Data, when the NSManagedObject CoreDataProperties.swift file is generated, these relationships are described as @NSManaged var relationship: NSSet. This is very unhelpful, and the generated Objective C code even is declared as NSSet<MyClass *> *relationship.\r\n\r\nChanging the CoreDataProperties.swift declaration to @NSManaged var relationship: Set<MyClass> works just fine, as NSSet and <Set> are bridged. Having a native Set declaration significantly simplifies Swift code that accesses it.\r\n\r\n Please change how the CoreDataProperties file is generated. Thank you.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create two classes in Core Data\r\n2. Create a to-many relationship\r\n3. Editor -> Create NSManagedObject Subclass...\r\n4. Create files in Swift"
