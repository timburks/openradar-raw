        Summary:
        For some days in the Activity app on my iPhone, days are missing Move, Exercise, and Stand totals even though they have data.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Wear your Apple Watch during the day.
        2. Move a little, exercise, and stand up periodically.

        Expected Results:
        The Activity App has summaries for each day youâ€™ve done this.

        Actual Results:
        Some days show a 0 for the totals alongside non-zero data.

        Regression:
        Unknown

        Notes:
        I noticed this thanks to the Activity++ app, which (I presume) uses HealthKit to look up the data, so the summary in HealthKit is wrong.
