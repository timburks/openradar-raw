    description: "Summary:\r\nSmart Banners on iOS 8 or 9 devices don't detect Xcode-deployed builds as \"installed\" and always redirect to the app's App Store page instead of calling application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: method in the app delegate.  This means that any parsing of navigation context sent as the \"app-argument\" can't be directly tested before shipping to the App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a debug build of your app from Xcode\r\n1. Deploy a <meta name=\"apple-tunes-app\"> tag using your app's app-id to a webpage.\r\n2. On an iOS 8 or 9 device, browse to the page\r\n3. Observe the Smart Banner displays with a \"View\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Smart Banner should have an \"Open\" button indicating that it found the app installed, and tapping that button should call the app delegate's application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Smart Banner always displays the \"View\" button that takes the user to the App Store page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.1 (13B143)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis previously worked in iOS 7 by installing the App Store build first, then running a debug build on top of it.  As of iOS 8, this is no longer a valid workaround."
