    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UINavigationController is the seventh item in a UITabBarController with 9 or more tabs, then the app window is resized to smaller size with Split View, then returned to the original size, the UINavigationController shows a black rectangle instead of showing its Root View Controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Open Xcode and create a new iOS \"Tabbed Application\"\r\n2- Open Main.storyboard\r\n3- Add a UINavigationController to the storyboard\r\n4- ctrl-drag from the UITabBarController to the new UINavigationController and select Relationship Segue -> view controllers\r\n5- Do steps 3 and 4 for seven times until you have a total of 9 items in the UITabBarController tab bar (2 views added automatically, and 7 added manually)\r\n6- Name the items First, Second, Third, ..., Ninth (for easier demonstration of the bug)\r\n7- Run the app on an iPad that supports Split View multitasking such as iPad Mini 4\r\n8- Tap \"Seventh\" item on the tab bar to select it\r\n9- Run another app in Split View mode (not Slide Over mode)\r\n10- If the iPad is in landscape, drag the Split View vertical divider to the middle of the screen to make the demo app smaller\r\n11- Drag the Split View vertical divider back to the right side of the screen to close Split View mode\r\n12- You'll notice the screen shows a black rectangle instead of the \"Seventh\" Root View Controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UINavigationController should show the same contents as it was before the app was resized\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UINavigationController shows a black rectangle instead\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 (13E238), Xcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy analysis of the bug:\r\n\r\n1- When the app window becomes smaller, the Seventh UINavigationController gets removed from the UITabBarController  and gets attached to the \"More\" ViewController\r\n2- When the app window becomes big again, the Seventh UINavigationController gets removed from the \"More\" ViewController and is returned to be a direct child of UITabBarController\r\n3- However, the Root View Controller of the Seventh UINavigationController remains attached to the \"More\" ViewController and doesn't return to the UITabBarController along with its parent UINavigationController \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini 4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'demo.zip' and 'IMG_0006.jpg' were successfully uploaded."
