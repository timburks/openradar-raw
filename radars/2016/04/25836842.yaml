    description: |-
        When Xcode creates the Assets.car file for CoreUI, a color profile in a PNG file is used to convert pixels to the sRGB color space. Additionally, color profiles in JPEG files are maintained and used by ColorSync at display time.

        None of this is documented and the resulting behavior is extremely difficult for a developer to understand at runtime.
