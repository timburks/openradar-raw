    description: "Summary:\nXCUIElementType triggers partial availability warning inside XCTest. \n\nWe use -Wpartial-availability to catch calls that are iOS 9 specific since we still have to support iOS 8. This works well but we needed to update our xcconfig rules for the tests, since Clang flags XCTest itself.\n\nThis was a bit annoying. I guess there are already a lot of radars for it and it’s probably to trivial to even need a sample, but just wanted to give you my +1 to please look into that. Thanks :)\n\nBut hey, new warnings are always great, so thanks for that! Don’t always just want to complain here. Love the progress.\n\nScreenshot if attachments don’t work: http://cl.ly/0s0R3G3k3y40"
