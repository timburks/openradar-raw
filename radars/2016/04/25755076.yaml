    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm working on a complication that counts down to a specific date. \"3 DAYS\" is an example of something that would typically display. I'd like to support all the complication types, but I'm finding this more difficult than it should be in the \"Circular\" and \"Modular Small\" complications. If I use a \"Simple Text\" template, along with CLKRelativeDateTextProvider, then the display ends up saying \"3D\". If you know the context it's understandable, but it's far from great. I'd prefer to use a \"Stack Text\" format, with the number (\"3\") on the first line, and the unit (\"DAYS\") on the second line. But the only way to do this is by generating the text myself, without using CLKRelativeDateTextProvider. It's not ideal, and in fact the HIG warns to \"Never generate relative date or time strings yourself.\"\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd love to see this formatted in a more optimal way, with the number a bit larger than the text. Kind of like the Calendar complication, just with the text on the bottom. Currently this seems to be impossible for a third-party app (unless I created images for every possible display).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a complication template using CLKComplicationTemplateModularSmallStackText or CLKComplicationTemplateCircularSmallStackText.\r\n2. Set line1TextProvider to something like [CLKRelativeDateTextProvider textProviderWithDate:date style:CLKRelativeDateStyleNatural units:NSCalendarUnitDay];\r\n3. Do not set line2TextProvider\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should wrap to display it in an ideal way, with the number on one line, and the text on another.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text all displays on one line. (Well, technically if line2TextProvider is nil I think it crashes.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nwatchOS 2.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch 42mm\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
