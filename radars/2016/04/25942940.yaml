    description: "Summary:\r\nThis page: https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/ should have a \"Regenerate All Profiles\" button, or something of the sort. I spend a huge amount of time just clicking through screens on this site. Every time I change an entitlement or add/remove a device, I have like 8 to 16 different profiles that have to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/ and add or remove a device, or go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle and change an entitlement.\r\n2. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/\r\n3. Click on a provisioning profile\r\n4. Click Edit\r\n5. For an Ad Hoc profile, change the selected devices if necessary. For an App Store profile do absolutely nothing.\r\n6. Click Generate\r\n7. Click Done\r\n8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 several more times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 8 should not be necessary. I'm doing the exact same thing for several different profiles. I should be able to click the Edit button at the top, select the profiles I want to change, click a Generate button, and pretty much be done. Either it could select all devices or allow me to choose which devices are applied to all of them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt takes about 72 clicks to update everything. Oh and that's assuming you don't lose track. The design of this page means things are always jumping around and you can't just open each thing you want to edit in a new tab, so usually I have to double/triple check that I didn't miss anything. (It helps when the old profiles are invalid, but if I'm just adding a device that's not the case.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
