    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building project with custom Build Configuration other than the default Debug or Release, the embedded frameworks cannot be found if they don't have the same Build Configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever, Xcode knows to default to Release when building these frameworks' projects as dependencies. It just cannot link in the results when building the product project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild sample App project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should link in Release version of frameworks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode cannot find frameworks.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3\r\n\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/1E411U3w3w2b"
