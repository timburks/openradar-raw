    description: "The DCI-P3 displays on the iPad Pro 9.7” provide a wider gamut and very different visual appearance than sRGB (which traditionally has been the display profile on iOS.)\r\n\r\nWhen you take a screenshot on the iPad Pro 9.7”, the display’s color profile is not embedded in the resulting PNG file. See the attached file.\r\n\r\nThis feature should work as it does on OS X, where a color profile is embedded in the screenshot image. This provides better fidelity and allows any post-processing of the screenshot images to be done in a color managed workflow.\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nPlease close this bug report. The problem was with Dropbox dropping the embedded color profile while uploading. If Photos is used to get the screenshot off the device, the \"Display P3\" profile remains embedded in the image."
