Currently, you have to manually divide them up into multiple targets, but ideally, you could just specify a list of tests to test with the xcodebuild command it run just those tests, similar to how you would within Xcode. Steps to Reproduce: xcodebuild -project MyProject.xcodeproj -scheme \"MyProject\" test -only MyProjectUnitTests:TestClass1/test1,TestClass1/test2,TestClass2/test3 Expected Results: Test just the classes or individual test specified Actual Results: Run all all tests within a target.

We are using UIWebView to render content that the user will annotate. Without the ability to create a selection that triggers the selection UI we are blocked from allowing the user update and adjust their highlights. Steps to Reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/c6jsa/ Create a javascript Range object, add it to a Selection. Expected Results: The blue selection UI with grabbers appears. (UIWebView enters selection mode) The pre-defined selection Range defines the start/end of the grabbers. Actual Results: Nothing. The only way to enter selection mode is to long press on text. The blue selection UI never shows. Version: All versions of iOS Notes: The desired behavior is to programmatically enter selection mode in UIWebView. Right now, the ONLY way to do that is through a long press gesture on text. Here's a stackoverflow post where others are desiring the same behavior: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16972655/how-to-programmatically-enter-selection-mode-in-a-uiwebview Configuration: All iOS devices, including simulators Attachments:\r\n25809715 \r\nAdd ability to run individual tests or specified list of tests with `xcodebuild test`\r\nState:OpenProduct:iOS\r\nRank:No Value\r\nAdd new information...\r\nChoose FileAttach a fileHide |  Resolved Revert Save\r\nStephan Heilner19-Apr-2016 01:06 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI need the ability (outside of a 3rd party tool like xctool) to run a subset of my test within a target across several machines.
