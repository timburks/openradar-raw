    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a git-version-controlled environment, when you move folders via \"git mv\", the Xcode comparison view stops working: Although you still see the previous commits, when selecting it you get the error \"The source control operation failed because no repository could be found. Make sure a valid repository exists at the specified location and try again.\"\r\n\r\nIn the console, you can see the following error:\r\n\r\n\"11.04.16 10:17:33,859 Xcode[41176]: #DVTSourceControl Error: -200 The source control operation failed because no repository could be found.\r\nUnderlying Error: the path 'source' does not exist in the given tree (-3)\r\nMethod: __101-[DVTSourceControlManager exportFile:inWorkingCopy:fromRevisionLocation:toDirectory:completionBlock:]_block_invoke_2\"\r\n\r\nOther SCM software like \"Tower\" can handle that change.\r\n\r\nTested with installed git 2.8.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project and enable git version control\r\n2. Commit the initial state\r\n3. Move the folder with your source-files to a different location via \"git mv\"\r\n4. Commit that state\r\n5. Reopen the project, and relocate the sources-folder\r\n6. Open the comparison editor for a source code file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can see the version of the file before I renamed the sources-folder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get the error message \"The source control operation failed because no repository could be found. Make sure a valid repository exists at the specified location and try again.\"\r\n\r\nIn the console I see \r\n\"11.04.16 10:17:33,859 Xcode[41176]: #DVTSourceControl Error: -200 The source control operation failed because no repository could be found.\r\nUnderlying Error: the path '<new sources folder name>' does not exist in the given tree (-3)\r\nMethod: __101-[DVTSourceControlManager exportFile:inWorkingCopy:fromRevisionLocation:toDirectory:completionBlock:]_block_invoke_2\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.3 (7D175)"
