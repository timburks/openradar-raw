        Summary:
        When configuring a Twitter account in the Settings app, it should be possible to use the password extension mechanism to retrieve your Twitter password from an app such as 1Password.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Settings app, go to the Twitter section, and tap "Add Account"

        Expected Results:
        There should be an option presented somewhere (e.g. on the rightmost side of the password field) to bring up a share/action sheet that lets you retrieve the username and/or password from your password manager app.

        Actual Results:
        Instead, you must quit the Settings app, open 1Password manually, search for the account, copy the password, switch back to Settings, then paste the password into the password field. Like an animal.

        Notes:
        The same improvement could be made to the configuration for other built-in app settings, such as Facebook and Flickr.
