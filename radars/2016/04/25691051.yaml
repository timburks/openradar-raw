    description: "Summary:\r\n[I submitted this to DTS (Follow-up: 639288258) and got the reply: \"Our engineers have reviewed your request and have determined that you are experiencing an issue for which there is no known workaround at this time.\"  So here's a bug report to upvote.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an app, Time Out, that users typically leave running, either as a normal or background (status item) app.  It provides breaks on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSome users have reported that after some time their pasteboards stop working: copy/paste and dragging.  The only solution is to restart the Mac.\r\n\r\nI haven't experienced this myself, but I have had a few reports, and at least one of the users has offered to help test any fixes.\r\n\r\nWhen the issue occurs, the following line appears in the Console (for pretty much every running app):\r\n\r\n    CFPasteboardCreate(CFAllocatorRef, CFStringRef) : Lock timeout\r\n\r\nI can't think of anything I do in the app that could cause a pasteboard issue; it doesn't do much in related areas.  \r\n\r\nThis issue isn't unique to my apps; a Google search reveals other examples, e.g.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7493153?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/234419/malware-paste-stops-working-cfpasteboardref-lock-timeout\r\n\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/HCPUB-137\r\n\r\nhttp://veertu.com/forums/topic/veertu-knocks-out-systemwide-clipboard-functionality/\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is an obscure OS bug, but it's hard to know what the cause might be.  Do you have any information about this issue?  Can you help?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can't reproduce, but have a customer who can help.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPasteboard keeps working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPasteboard stops working, with the above-mentioned error."
