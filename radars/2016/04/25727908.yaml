    description: "Summary:\r\nNote: I quipped about this on Twitter and Patrick Burleson reported a bug about it: rdar://problem/25727634. He suggested it would still be valuable for me to file it from the outside.\r\n\r\nSummary: while engaged in 3D touch with the iOS standard keyboard, pressing other keys on the keyboard lead to the disapearance of all keys even after 3D touch is dismissed. Subsequently typing can continue but with no visual feedback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached image for a visual example.\r\n\r\n1. Open a text input application such as Notes.app\r\n2. Tap into an editable text area to active the iOS on-screen keyboard.\r\n3. Press firmly on the keyboard in the letters area to active 3D touch.\r\n4. While holding firmly to keep 3D touch engaged, tap the blank tile where the Emoji button would be.\r\n5. While continuing to hold firmly, tap the blank area where the Number Shift key would be.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExtraneous taps while engaged in 3D touch should probably have no effect, or at most should have a meaningful effect on the edited text being navigated with the cursor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe taps on these keys lead the iOS Keyboard into a state where it will not redraw any of its view graphics even during use. The normal functionality of the keyboard can be restored by dismissing and reactivating it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_5563.PNG' was successfully uploaded."
