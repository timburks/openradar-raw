        Summary:
        When pasting an array of enums contained in another enums definition, the indentation of closing brackets / parentheses is removed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open attached sample project, “Radar Example 03-31-2016.xcworkspace”.
        2. Build project. Note that there are no build errors and the indentation of the ExampleContainer struct.
        3. Cut lines 14-29, and then paste back in the same location. View attached screenshots for visual example.

        Expected Results:
        Lines 21 and 28 are indented 4 spaces further than they should be.

        Actual Results:
        Closing brackets and parenthesis should lie on the same level as the opening definition.
