    description: "Summary:\r\nPreference Pane -> Date  & Time -> Time Zone Tab:\r\nTurn off auto location setting. If the City you are typing has a non alpha character in it, the popup can not locate the city in question. I think the alphabetization algorithm has changed or the order in the list needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPreference Pane -> Date  & Time -> Time Zone Tab:\r\nTurn off auto location setting.\r\nType \"St. L\" (as in st. louis)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPop up will eventually get to St. Louis (Which is in the list)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPop up pushes \"Stockholm\" which makes no sense as it doesn't match alphabetically, it's not the first st* nor the last. (Later added, now St. Petersburg... So... Progress?)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked under 10.5\r\nProblem exists under every machine I've tested under 10.6\r\nI'm not able to come up with anything but \"St.\" that causes this issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is of course convenient that I'm in the St. Louis region to discover this."
