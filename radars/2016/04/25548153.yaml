    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently mobile data statistics can be reset manually(Settings > Mobile Data > Reset Statistics). Monitoring mobile data usage can be more useful when the statistics are only recorded for a specific interval, such as the billing cycle.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose to extend the mobile data settings so that an interval can be selected after which the statistics are reset - similar to how repeating reminders can be created.\r\n\r\nIf searching for \"iphone reset statistics automatically\" the first result leads to ReStats (http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974271), that offers this feature - unfortunately for jailbroken iPhones only. It would be really nice if iOS would have this built-in.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings > Mobile Data > Reset Statistics: there is no option to specify an interval in which mobile data statistics should be reset\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAllow to specify a recurring date under Settings > Mobile Data > Reset Statistics on which statistics are set.\r\n\r\nFor example: reset statisticcs on the 3rd or each month\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
