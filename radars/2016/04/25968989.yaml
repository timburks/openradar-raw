    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you attempt to call `[UIApplication canOpenURL:]` with a URL that is a universal deep link, it will return true if the app that handles the link is not installed, but will return false if the app is installed. This defeats the purpose of the restrictions that were placed on canOpenURL in iOS 9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Uninstall YouTube if it's installed\r\n2. Call canOpenURL with \"https://youtu.be/tk_gx9LNLlw\", it will return true\r\n3. Install YouTube\r\n4. Call canOpenURL with \"https://youtu.be/tk_gx9LNLlw\", it will return false\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncanOpenURL should return true for http/https links regardless of whether there is an app registered to handle them that is installed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncanOpenURL reveals that a user has installed the app that handles the universal link\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone"
