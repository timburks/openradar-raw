    description: "Summary:\r\nAs a commuter I use tethering in public places and wish to keep my tethering password private. \r\n\r\nIf I need to turn it on or off I am on a screen clearly showing my password in plain text to anyone who is sat next to me or behind me on the train.\r\n\r\nI would like the password to be hidden with a button \"tap to reveal tethering password\" for those times when I actually need to see it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to settings > Personal hotspot \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPassword should be hidden until requested\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen shows wi-fi password in plain, easily legible text.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
