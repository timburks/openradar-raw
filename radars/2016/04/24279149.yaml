    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen performing animations inside coordinator.addCoordinatedAnimations in didUpdateFocusInContext:withAnimationCoordinator:  and scrolling fast through the cells in a collection view, the animations occurs in (what seems to be a) random order.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass of UICollectionViewCell and override didUpdateFocusInContext:withAnimationCoordinator: to perform some animation.\r\n2. Create a collection view and populate it with a significant amount of cells. Make sure the collection view is scrollable, e.g. horizontally.\r\n3. Run the app on the Apple TV and scroll fast through the cells.\r\n4. Notice that the animations happens in an incorrect order.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animations should happen in the same order as the cells are scrolled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animations happens in the incorrect order.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 9.2 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 4th generation\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
