    description: "With Opportunistic deliveryMode requestImageForAsset reports degraded image before full image whether the full image is in cloud or not.\r\n\r\nBut ideally the user experiences should be very different depending on whether the full image is in cloud:\r\n1. If the full image is in cloud it usually takes a significant period of time to download the full image so apps should present the degraded image as a placeholder for that period.\r\n2. If the full image is not in cloud it is immediately available just after the degraded image is reported so apps should NOT present the degraded image and immediately switch to the full image because it flashes the screen which is a bad user experience.\r\n\r\nHowever currently there is no way to know whether the full image is in cloud or not before the full image is downloaded because there is no PHImageResultIsInCloudKey in the degraded image's info dict. So I suggest degraded image's info dict carry a PHImageResultIsInCloudKey to indicate whether the full image is in cloud."
