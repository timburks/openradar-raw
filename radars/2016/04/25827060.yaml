        Summary:
        When using Xcode to handle project group manipulation, I frequently will accidentally create a group from a selection rather than a new group in the same root, or accidentally move files between groups. When this happens, I expect it to be possible to undo this using CMD+Z.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Open a project in Xcode
        2) Perform file/group manipulation
        3) Try to undo

        Expected Results:
        1) The action should be reversed

        Actual Results:
        1) Nothing happens and I need to find the files I just moved.
