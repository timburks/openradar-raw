    description: "Diffing plists is hard, mainly because the sort order in NSDictionaries is not stable. Thus, a simple one-key insertion can be lost in the noise of dozens of rearranged keys. \n\nplutil, being the main tool people would use to manipulate this file type, should get an argument switch that makes it output dictionary elements in a stably sorted order. This would make it suitable for making it a default filter preset in FileMerge for plist files, for instance, making it a lot easier to diff two plist files."
