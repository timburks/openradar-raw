        Summary:

              I used to be able to open Notification Center by pulling down from the top
              It died, it died.
              Apple told me it woud work,
              they lied, they lied.
              Why oh why is my Notification Center dead?
              Couldn't that bug happen to someone else instead?

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Try to pull down from top top open Notification Center

        Expected Results:
        Notification Center shows itself.

        Actual Results:
        Notification Center remains absent.

        Regression:
        /

        Notes:
        This will probably be fixed by a restart of my iPhone,  but for now it's gone. Pulling down from top does nothing, it doesn't have any effect. Spotlight is working as is the Control Center, it's only Notification Center that seems to be completely gone.

        I'm sorry, but I don't have any way of generating any useful log from this, so I'm just filing this radar in the hope it will help you, dear engineer, to connect some dots and have an aha-erliebnis, do some coding and fix this for someone else.

        As for me, I'm going to restart my iPhone now, turns out not having Notification Center is really annoying.
