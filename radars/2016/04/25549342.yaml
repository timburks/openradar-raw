    description: "While there are a number of studies on the light background vs. dark background subject, that push to the dark text on a white background, and are align with the discussion on the opening and closing of the eye's iris and the perceived fuzziness of such change, these considerations change when the environment's light also change.\r\n\r\nI believe that a dark IDE will ease the effort on the eyes, when the environment's light is also low. But for this to be possible, it would have to be a more homogeneous environment overall and not just the code editor, as is today. For the change in contrast from the window to a dark code editor is too high to be smooth on the eyes."
