Click on Shared computer in Finder -> Sidebar -> Shared\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder attempts to connect to shared device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder presents user with alert: '\"<Computer Name>\" can't be opened because the original item can't be found.'. (See attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nI have to relaunch Finder to get it working again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.0\r\n...\r\n10.11.4\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air 2012\r\niMac 27 2011"
