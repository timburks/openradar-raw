    description: "26-Apr-2016 04:19 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen playing a video through AVPlayer, if you go offline and then background the app, when resuming the player continues to play the buffered content but does not set playbackLikelyToKeepUp or playbackBufferEmpty correctly. This is reproducible across a number of apps that use AVPlayer\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a piece of content with AVPlayer\r\n2. Go offline (airplane mode)\r\n3. Background the app\r\n4. Bring app back into foreground\r\n5. Continue playing content\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAVPlayer will continue to play content from its buffer and playbackBufferEmpty is still NO until the buffer has been empty, when it will be set to YES. playbackLikelyToKeepUp is set to NO when the buffer runs out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback continues but playbackBufferEmpty is set to YES immediately and playbackLikelyToKeepUp never set to NO.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 and iOS 9.2.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis can be demonstrated in a number of apps such as BBC iPlayer and Youtube - load a video and enable subtitles, go offline, background, and then foreground the app, play and once the buffer has run out, the video stops playing but the time continues to tick along and subtitles are still displayed. This also occurs when playing videos in Safari - if you follow the steps above the time continues to tick along and the scrubber continues to move along even though the video has stopped. It seems that you have to background the app to be able to reproduce the problem - if you just go offline and wait playbackLikelyToKeepUp is set correctly.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Mini A1489 and iPhone 6 Plus A1524 over Wifi\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
