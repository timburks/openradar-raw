        Summary:
        See issue title and attached example project. When the argument of the closure is referenced in Xcode, it resolves as <<error type>>, even though there is no error.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open attached sample project, “Radar Example 03-31-2016.xcworkspace”.
        2. Build project. Note that there are no build errors.
        3. Navigate to “ViewController.swift”, line 24.

        Expected Results:
        Adding a period after “cell” should provide autocompletion choices.

        Actual Results:
        No autocompletion occurs.
