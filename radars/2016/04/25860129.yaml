        Summary:
        If I build an app in the iOS simulator, and then switch simulators, the slow simulator boot process happens after the build is complete. They should happen concurrently.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Build and run an app in the iPhone 4s Simulator.
        2. In Xcode, switch the destination to the iPad Pro.
        3. Run the app again.

        Expected Results:
        By the time the app is re-built in Xcode, the iPad Pro simulator is open and waiting, so the app launches immediately after building. Unless the simulator launch process and the Xcode build process are vying for the same resources, I think they should happen concurrently.

        Actual Results:
        The iPhone 4s simulator quits the running app, but then just sits there during the build. The simulator doesn’t “reboot” into the iPad Pro simulator until after the build has completed, meaning that Xcode is just sitting there waiting for the simulator to boot.

        Regression:
        The simulator didn’t used to have a boot process with a progress bar, so this wasn’t (as much of) an issue.

        Notes:
        If I switch the simulator’s device right after I hit build, it boots up during the build, and everything seems to work, so I believe this is possible.
