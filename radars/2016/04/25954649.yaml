    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 9, when an app requests authorisation to access photo library, the system presents an alert. When the user rotates the screen by 180Â°, this alert does not rotate at the same speed as the screen. This looks weird. \r\n\r\nThis issue did not happen on iOS 8.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlert should rotate at the same speed as the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert and screen rotations are not in sync\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5c\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Rotation issue.mov' and 'AuthorizationPOC.zip' were successfully uploaded."
