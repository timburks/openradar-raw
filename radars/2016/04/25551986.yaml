    description: "Currently only UIButton and UIBarButtonItem provide some standard icons. They are very limited and cannot be used elsewhere like UIImageView.\r\n\r\nFor both better HIG compliance and design convenience, iOS should provide a rich set of standard icons. Android is already ahead of iOS: https://design.google.com/icons/."
