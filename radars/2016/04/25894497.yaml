        Summary:
        On OSX the Messages app allows you to enter a message like "/me thinks this is fine", this will display:

              "Piet Jaspers thinks this is fine"

        To both me and the other party involved.

        On iOS it will just be a message "/me thinks this is fine".

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Messages
        Enter message "/me thinks this is fine"

        Expected Results:
        "Piet Jaspers thinks this is fine"

        Actual Results:
        "/me thinks is fine"

        Regression:
        /

        Notes:
        The /me idiom is a relic from IRC (I guess), it's a fun way of expressing a thought in a conversation. It would be nice to have around on iOS as well.
