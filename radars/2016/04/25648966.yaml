    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's an example project attached that will reproduce the issue on the iPhone 5 (but also on any other device, depending on the amount of text you enter). You just need to enter some text (multiple lines, but not using the return key!). Once the entered text hits the end of the line, a new line is inserted. UITextView will automatically scroll to that position. Unfortunately it does not scroll to the correct position, so you cannot see anymore what text you're actually typing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached example project on an iPhone 5 device or Simulator\r\n2. Enter some text (multiple lines, but not using the return key!)\r\n3. OK: It adds a new line if necessary\r\n4. OK: It tries to scroll so you can see what you're typing\r\n5. NOK: It does not scroll to the correct position, you cannot see the text anymore you're typing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should scroll to the correct position so you can see what you're typing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not scroll to the correct position so you cannot see what you're typing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 Simulator\r\n\r\nSample project:\r\nhttps://github.com/plu/radar-25648966"
