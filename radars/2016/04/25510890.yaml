    description: "Bryan Campbell02-Apr-2016 07:33 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you insert a sensitive password for example into a note, and nothing else. If we choose to lock this note we can still view it in the in the middle panel of the three. I am astonished this has not been identified as a security risk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the notes app\r\nAdd a super secret password\r\nLock the app\r\nLook in the middle 'panel' of the three - read the 'super secret' content\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis should not be visible in any capacity. it should be hidden from view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent is clearly visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
