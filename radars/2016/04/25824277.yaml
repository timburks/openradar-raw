    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing an external keyboard, the key command ⌥↑ (option-up) does not work, when used a second time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the attached sample project on an iPad Simulator\r\n- Tap into the UITextView on screen\r\n- Place insertion point in the last Paragaph (e.g. after \"cursus\")\r\n- Ensure the External keyboard is connected\r\n- Press ⌥↑ (option-up)\r\n- Press ⌥↑ (option-up)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn the first use of ⌥↑ (option-up), the cursor jumps to the beginning of the paragraph. On the second invocation, the cursor jumps to the paragraph above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn the first use of ⌥↑ (option-up), the cursor jumps to the beginning of the paragraph. (correct) On the second invocation, however, the cursor does not move.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe counterpart command ⌥↓ (option-down) works correctly. There seems to be an issue in UITextInputTokenizer not returning correct positions.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from (at least) iOS 8.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'textedit.zip' was successfully uploaded. http://cl.ly/fkFE"
