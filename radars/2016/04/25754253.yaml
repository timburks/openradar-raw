    description: "School systems with 1:1 iPad programs usually engage in high stakes testing. Many times the test vendor (such as American Institutes for Research) has certified their test to work with specific versions of iOS. If an iOS update comes out in the middle of a multi-month test cycle, the vendor will not have certified it and test results may be questionable.\r\n\r\nPlease create an MDM command for supervised devices that will allow us to block iOS updates, or set a max version, or something similar."
