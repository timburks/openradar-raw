    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently the `simctl` CLI can output the path of an app's sandbox (`xcrun simctl get_app_container <device> <bundle identifier>`) but lacks the ability to print the app's App Group container(s). \r\nPlease add a subcommand like `xcrun simctl list_app_group_containers <device> <bundle identifier>` printing out all App Group containers of the given app. These App Groups are configured on the Capabilities tab in the app's Project Settings in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Terminal\r\n2. run `xcrun simctl`\r\n3. There is no subcommand like `list_app_group_containers`\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA subcommand like `list_app_group_containers` exists.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no subcommand like `list_app_group_containers`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn SimPholders (https://simpholders.com) the App Group containers are shown when using ⌘ + ⌥ + Click. Until Xcode 7.2 the App Groups were read from the app's `.com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist` file which contained a MCMMetadataInfo tag containing the app groups. This behavior has changed with Xcode 7.3. The file does not have this information anymore. Therefore this SimPholder's feature is broken since Xcode 7.3!"
