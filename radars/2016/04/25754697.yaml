    description: "We are a 1:1 school district that leverages DEP. When students permanently disable their iPads by entering the passcode incorrectly too many times (or have it done to them by a bully), we have no way to enable them.\r\n\r\nIn the past I could plug the iPad into a Configurator station that I had initially configured it with, and which I had an existing Trust Relationship with. I would launch iTunes and initiate a sync, and iTunes sent a command to enable the iPad.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the iPad is temporarily disabled with a countdown timer, an MDM Clear Passcode command works. However if the iPad is permanently disabled, the command doesn't work and we have to wipe the iPad, potentially losing student work.\r\n\r\nPlease add functionality to the Clear Passcode command, or create a new MDM command, that can enable a permanently disabled iPad.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nchris"
