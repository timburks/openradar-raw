        Summary:
        See: https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/86#discussion_r58315662

        XCTest defines {{XCTestCase.testRunClass}} as an {{AnyClass?}}, and checks at runtime that this is a subclass of {{XCTestRun}}. It would be nicer if this was exported as {{XCTestRun.Type}} or {{XCTestRun.Type?}}.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        {{import XCTest}} from within a Swift file, check the type of {{XCTestCase.testRunClass}}.

        Expected Results:
        Has a type that conveys the expectations of the value: that it is an {{XCTestRun.Type}} or {{XCTestRun.Type?}}.

        Actual Results:
        It has a type of {{AnyClass?}}, meaning the type system would not prevent me from returning an {{NSCalendar}} from this method.

        Regression:
        All versions of XCTest.
