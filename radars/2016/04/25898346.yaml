        Summary:
        I can see cumulative network sent/received in Activity Monitor, and I can see total system data sent and received per second, but Iâ€™d like to be able to see sent/received per second _per process_.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use flaky bus Wi-Fi to try to get work done.
        2. Notice that a thing is slow, and wonder whether the network flaked out, or whether some process on your machine started saturating the network.
        3. Open Activity Monitor and switch to the Network tab.

        Expected Results:
        There are columns available, either by default or by right-clicking the column headers, that show data sent and received per second per process.

        Actual Results:
        There is no such column.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        none
