    description: "Summary:\r\nScenario: You're driving down the highway, across the desert, on a long road trip, and you see a sign: \r\n\r\nGas 16 Miles\r\nNext Gas 203 Miles\r\n\r\nYou glance at the fuel gauge and observe that your tank is running low. Your first thought is \"dang, I better not miss that exit, or I'm hosed. So you activate your nearest Siri device and speak:\r\n\r\n\"Hey Siri, remind me in 15 miles to get gas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I'll remind you.\"\r\n\r\nAhh, you relax back into your chair, crank up the Apple Music, rest assured that all will be taken care of. Man, isn't the future great?\r\n\r\n45 miles later you're stuck in the middle of the desert with no gas, no cell coverage, and limited battery life on your stockpile of iOS devices. You look at your Reminders list to figure out what went wrong:\r\n\r\n\"In 15 miles to get gas.\"\r\n\r\nThere it is, on the list. Uncompleted, unhelpful, uncool.\r\n\r\nHow would this be solved? By introducing a notion of distance-relative reminders in iOS and by extension in Siri. In the same way that Siri allows you set a reminder for a *specific time* or for a *relative time from now*, it should ideally offer the same functionality for distance.\r\n\r\nThere are other scenarios where this kind of position-relative reminder would be helpful, and it sort of plays into the same kinds of reminders currently offered by e.g. \"Arriving Home\", etc. Imagine running for example, and saying \"Remind me in 3 miles to turn around and head home.\"\r\n\r\nIn any event please consider amending Siri so that it recognizes phrases of relative distance, and cops to not being able to help:\r\n\r\n\"Remind me in 3 miles to turn around\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you with distance based reminders... (YET!)\"\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee prose-form example above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee prose-form example above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee prose-form example above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 US Verizon 64GB.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
