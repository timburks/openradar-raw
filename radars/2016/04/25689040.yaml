    description: "Summary:\r\nDynamic Type is a iOS feature that lets users control the size of copy when a developer has programmed against the static list of text styles. As of Xcode 7.3 this feature no longer works in the iOS Simulator and required on device testing. I'm pretty sure this used to work on earlier versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an iOS project that uses an UILabel  and set it to the Headline or Body style. Adjust Settings app Text Size in Accessibility.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect my label with a Headline style to change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMy label with a Headline style is not changing in the Simulator. It does work on device.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work in past versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/g62yla4p1jladi2/comp.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nSample project:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/dl7jtnmoh2ta2bm/AAAYWPMu5eTph5YZhBYLQ5Eja?dl=0"
