    description: "Summary:\nSince Xcode 7.3, autocomplete is essentially useless: \n - it often won’t find enum values, constants, methods or classes\n - it has trouble keeping up with my typing, it often lags behind several characters\n - it gives nonsensical suggestions such as \"NSHTTPCookieStorageInternal\" when typing \"NSI\" or \"bool\" instead of \"BOOL\" when typing BO.\n - #import autocomplete doesn’t work at all anymore\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install Xcode 7.3\n2. Open a somewhat large Objective-C project (200kloc)\n3. Type the first characters of a class\n\nExpected Results:\n- AutoComplete gives the class name as suggestion quickly\n\nActual Results:\n- gives weird results after about a second, such as \"NSHTTPCookieStorageInternal\"\n\nRegression:\nAutoComplete worked ok in Xcode 7.2.\n\nNotes:\nPlease fix, this is horrible."
