        Summary:
        Sometimes I can’t get the hidden menu bar to show after it has been hidden.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Make Safari max screen, not full screen. Try to get the menu to show by sliding mouse up.

        Expected Results:
        Menu bar shows.

        Actual Results:
        Menu bar doesn’t show

        Regression:
        Seems to be related to Safari.

        Notes:
        Command Tabbing to another app allows me to get it to show.
