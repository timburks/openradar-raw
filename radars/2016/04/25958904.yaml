        In some apps, e.g. those that play music, it would make sense to be able to mute UIPickerView's click sounds even if the system preference for keyboard sounds is enabled. Right now, there is no public API to do so, though there is a private method, -setSoundsEnabled: that can be used to disable UIPickerView sounds.

        This method could be made public, allowing developers to turn UIPickerView's click sounds off, for example while music is being played by the app.

        Alternatively, UIPickerView sounds could automatically be muted when the AVAudioSession category is AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, etc.
