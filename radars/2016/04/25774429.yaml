    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 9.2, a WKWebView rendering HTML with fixed-width tables bigger than the device width could be told to shrink the content to fit by adding a viewport tag like this:\r\n\r\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=YES\">\r\n\r\nThis line caused the WKWebView to effectively zoom out the viewport so that the entire rendered page fit in the view frame without the need for scrollbars. However, this behavior has changed in 9.3. The identical code running in 9.3 renders differently.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following code, when run in viewDidLoad in a vanilla single view app: \r\n\r\nWKWebViewConfiguration *wkWebConfig = [[WKWebViewConfiguration alloc] init];\r\nWKWebView *newWebView = [[WKWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,40,self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height - 40) configuration:wkWebConfig];\r\nNSString *toRender = @\"<head><meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=YES\\\"></head><body><table width=700 style='background-color: blue; color:white; font-size=20px'><tr><td>this is some text that is long enough to exceed the width of the iphone 6 unless shrink-to-fit is applied</td></tr></table></body>\";\r\n[newWebView loadHTMLString:toRender baseURL:nil];\r\n[self.view addSubview:newWebView];\r\n\r\nThis renders on ios 9.2 and ios 9.3 as shown in the \"ios92.png\" and \"ios93.png\" screenshots respectively.\r\n\r\nWas this change intentional? If so, is there a workaround to obtain the 9.2 behavior on 9.3?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRender HTML with a fixed-width table bigger than the viewport in a WKWebView, with a meta viewport tag specifying width=device-width. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nsolter/NSWebViewShrinkTest demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWebView should zoom out to fit entire width of html page in device width (pre ios 9.3 behavior).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe viewport tag seems to be ignored - the view does not shrink the content to fit in the device width. This behavior is new with ios 9.3.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this is an intentional and permanent change in behavior, please let me know if there is any workaround.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny hardware/simulator with ios 9.3."
