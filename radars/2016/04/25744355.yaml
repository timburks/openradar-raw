        Summary:
        When my MacBookPro goes to sleep (closed the lid), after reactivate it does not always restart the launchctl task with StartCalendarInterval set.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Load the attached file: launchctl load com.iotcl.mbsync.plist
        2. The task runs periodically (see /tmp/mbsync.log & /tmp/mbsync-err.log)
        3. Close the lid of the computer (go to sleep)
        4. After reopen the task should start again

        Expected Results:
        The task should run when the computer awakes again.

        Actual Results:
        Sometime after sleep, the task is not restarted and is never run again. A manual `launchctl unload && launchctl load` is needed to re-enable it.

        Regression
        I think it depends on how long the computer sleeps. I think at least 30min sleep will make the problem occur.

        Notes:
        I also tried `StarInterval` but according some of the documentation I found, it does not restart after sleep (which I think would be weird).
