        Summary:
        OS X’s built-in autocorrect changes “Atlassian” (2x “s”) to “Atlasssian” (3x “s”)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a new Mail Message, TextEdit document, QuickRadar, or other app where OS X’s autocorrect is active.
        2. Type some text including the word “Atlassian” (2x “s”), the name of an Australian software company. You can confirm the spelling of their company here: https://www.atlassian.com
        3. Press the spacebar after typing Atlassian.

        Expected Results:
        The text stays as you typed it, with 2x “s” in “Atlassian”.

        Actual Results:
        The text changes to “Atlasssian” (3x “s”), even though this isn’t a word as far as I know.

        Regression:
        unknown

        Notes:
        Reproduced on two different machines running 10.11.4 with the system language set to American English. and most of the same apps and services running.
        If you type “Atlassian” (2x “s”) and then wait, the OS X autocorrect bubble appears with “Atlasssian” (3x “s”).
        The 3-s version is also suggested on iOS 9.3.1,, suggesting that the bug is present in some autocorrect code or logic that is shared between both platforms.
