        Summary:
        https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1165 - The Apple XCTest team will need to specify a swift_name for the -[XCTest runTest] or -[XCTest run] method. Alternatively, the deprecated -[XCTest run] method should not be imported into Swift.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Use apple/swift {{swift-api-dump.py}} to generate XCTest.framework headers using Xcode 7.3:

        $ export SWIFT_BIN_DIR="/path/to/build/Ninja-ReleaseAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/bin"
        $ $SWIFT_BIN_DIR/swift-api-dump.py -s macosx -m XCTest \
            --framework-dir /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/Library/Frameworks/

        Expected Results:
        The methods are imported into Swift as XCTest.run() and XCTest.runTest(). They do not conflict. Or XCTest.run() is not imported at all.

        Actual Results:
        The two methods are imported with the same name. Which is used is based on return value type inference:

        class XCTest : NSObject {
          // ...
          @available(*, deprecated)
          func run() -> XCTestRun
          func run()
        }

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
