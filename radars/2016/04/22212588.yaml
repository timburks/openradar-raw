    description: "Summary:\r\nThe app which had previously been in focus before iTunes will display its name (e.g., Chrome) in the menu bar with menus that do not drop down. iTunes will not display its menu bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes.\r\n2. Use the app.\r\n3. Make another application have focus, such as Safari or Chrome.\r\n4. Go back to iTunes.\r\n5. Usually the iTunes app menu bar will show the app name (e.g., Chrome) of the previously used app. If I try to click a menu item nothing drops down.\r\n6. Quit iTunes and re-open it to get its app menu bar back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeginning at step 4 I expect to be able to see the iTunes app menu bar at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app which had previously been in focus before iTunes will display its name (e.g., Chrome) in the menu bar with menus that do not drop down.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has been happening to me going back to previous OS X versions (Mavericks, Mountain Lion) across multiple versions of iTunes. It's not always reproducible, but it finally got on my nerves enough to submit a bug report.\r\n\r\nI've attached a video showing it in action. If it doesn't come through, you can view it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1156878/itunes_loses_menu.mov\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRunning a standard OS X 10.10.4 (14E46) build on a MacBookPro9,1. Current iTunes version I experience this on is 12.2.1.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'itunes_loses_menu.mov' was successfully uploaded."
