    description: "Summary:\n\nThe Description field when creating a new extension does not state the character limit (which, by trial and error, I’ve found to be 100 characters). \n\nIf you’re unable to intuit the character limit by resonating at the same frequency as the app, you’re presented with an error message.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate a new extension in Extension Builder.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nDescription field should state the character limit.\n\nActual Results:\n\nDescription field does not state the character limit."
