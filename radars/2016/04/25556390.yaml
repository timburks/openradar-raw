    description: "DUPLICATE OF 22126998 (Closed)\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I create a new file (Cmd-N) and choose iOS => Source => Swift File, it creates a new Swift file as expected. However the next time I create a new file (Cmd-N), it defaults to an **OS X** Swift File.\r\n\r\nThis has resulted in my accidentally choosing a \"Cocoa Class\" instead of a \"Cocoa Touch Class\", for example, and many other confusing issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode (new project or existing project)\r\n2. File menu > New > File...   (or Cmd-N)\r\n3. Choose iOS > Source > Swift File\r\n4. Click Next, accept default file location and name, click Create\r\n5. Create a second new file (Cmd-N)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS > Source > Swift File should be selected by default (remembers last selection)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOS X > Source > Swift File is selected by default\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\nOS X 10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'New File - first time.png' and 'New File - second time.png' were successfully uploaded."
