    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen tests are run from the command line, there's no information about which tests are being run and which failed. This is also true when running from Xcode and looking at the console. In Xcode 7.2 the console would also output the list of tests as they ran.\r\n\r\nThis seems project-specific, as running xcodebuild on other projects works fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI haven't been able to create a minimal project to reproduce but you can reproduce with this:\r\n\r\nsudo gem install cocoapods # If necessary\r\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch issue/5004 https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS.git wpios-xctest-output\r\ncd wpios-xctest-output\r\npod install\r\nxcodebuild -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6' -workspace WordPress.xcworkspace -scheme WordPress -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Debug clean build test\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nxcodebuild should show which tests are being run, and which test has failed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxcodebuild shows the console output from the app and a '** TEST FAILED **' at the end\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
