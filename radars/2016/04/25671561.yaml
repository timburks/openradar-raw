    description: "Summary:\r\nSee UI tests in attached project. Basically I'm trying to set launchArguments and launchEnvironment in a UI test. \r\n\r\nDocumentation for this seems to be very light, but searching the inter webs has surfaced two techniques.\r\n\r\nBoth of which fail.\r\n\r\nApple's documentation says that these can be set in code, but after setting the values are still empty.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nValues should be assigned and be able to be read by the app as it starts up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAPI appears to ignore any values that are set and when queried, returns an empty array or dictionary.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 7.3\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'LaunchDebug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust confirmed that arguments and environmental values set on the scheme are NOT passed through to the app when UI testing. \r\n\r\nThis is probably part of the same bug.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nProblem was my misunderstanding of how to use XCUIApplication(). it should only be used once."
