    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a user taps on a photo inside of a message and then quickly taps the back button the navigation stack will pop to root but then the image gets loaded anyway. Once that happens the user can dismiss the image but the messages navigation controller doesn't have any any children and thus no messages are there. You must then force quit the messages app for it to work again. (Video shows this)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a message that contains an image\r\n2. Tap on the image\r\n3. Quickly tap on the back button\r\n4. Observe\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCould be either\r\n\r\n1. The image is loaded but when dismissed the user sees a list of all messages\r\n2. The image loading is cancelled once the back button is pressed and the user goes back normally\r\n3. Back button is disabled after the image is tapped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation stack pops the individual message view controller, and then the image loads on top of the \"root\", but once it is dismissed you're left in a weird state that requires you to force quit Messages for it to work again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\nModel # MKTV2LL/A\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_0170.mov' was successfully uploaded."
