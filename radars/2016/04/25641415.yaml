    description: "Summary:\nWhen increasing the “Cursor size” to Large (4x default resolution) in the Vision > Display section of the Accessibility system preferences, custom cursors are limited to the 2x resolution representation scaled up, while system-provided cursors are displayed at full resolution.\n\nThe custom cursor is created in the way described here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/19245387/nscursor-using-high-resolution-cursors-with-cursor-zoom-or-retina\nThis method provides custom cursors for scale factors, 1 thru 4. This can easily be increased to 8 for Large cursors for retina 2x resolution.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Build and run an OS X app that displays custom cursors and\n2. Set the  “Cursor size” to Large in the Vision > Display section of the Accessibility system preferences\n3. Switch to custom cursors app & view and observe the scaled-up/pixelated cursor\n4. Move the cursor outside of the custom cursor view or window and observe that the system-provided cursor is perfectly resolved \n\nExpected Results:\nThe appropriate cursor image representation should be used instead of a lower resolution one used scaled up.\n\nActual Results:\nThe 2x resolution representation is scaled up to fill the cursor frame.\n\nRegression:\nnone\n\nNotes:\nIt would be even better, if a resolution independent cursor image could be provided to NSCursor’s -initWithImage:hotSpot: so that it can do “the right thing” to get smooth, sharp cursors under all possible circumstances."
