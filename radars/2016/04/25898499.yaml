    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a screen sharing client disconnects (Mac screen sharing or VNC), screen saver turns on (regardless of whether it's enabled or disabled).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. The mac mini is plugged into a TV via minidisplayport -> hdmi. No keyboard or mouse is plugged in. (others report that this fixes it, however, I have no need for kb or mouse on this machine)\r\n2. Connect to the mac mini via screen sharing or VNC.\r\n3. Disconnect screen sharing session. Screen saver activates.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo screen saver. Display stays the same as when client is connected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen saver activates.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther people are experiencing this:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/29344387\r\nhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105244/start-screensaver-lock-screen-on-screen-sharing-disconnect\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAffected machine is a 2009 Mac Mini running El Capitan (OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)). The main display (an attached TV via mini displayport) reliably shows the screen saver whenever any screen sharing client disconnects (Apple Screen Sharing.app or VNC-based). Enabling/disabling screen saver or changing time has no effect."
