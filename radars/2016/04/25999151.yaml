    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are located in Czech Republic (central Europe).\r\nThere are two AirPort Extreme AC basestations in our company.\r\nWe are trying to set 5 GHz channels for AC Wi-Fi on both of them so they do not overlap.\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple SP680 document AirPort Exterme AC should support  following channels in Europe https://support.apple.com/kb/SP680\r\n\"Channels 1-13, 36-64, and 100-140 approved for use in Europe and Japan\".\r\n\r\nHowever there are only 4 settings for 5 GHz channel in AirPort Utility: 36, 40, 44, 48.\r\n\r\nOur current setting is 36 on first and 48 on second AirPort. However you can't fit two 80 MHz wide channels so they do not overlap. See attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nI believe there shoud be settings for channels in 50-64 range.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Airport Utility\r\n2. Connect to desired AirPort Extreme AC Basestation\r\n3. Go to Wireless -> Wireless Options...\r\n4. Counry is set to Czech Republic\r\n5. Configure 5 GHz Channel:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to configure channels in range 36-64.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am only able to configure channels 36, 38, 44 and 48. That is fine for US but according to Apple specificication SP680 I should be able to set channels all in range 50-64 in Europe.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAirPort Extreme 802.11 ac A1521"
