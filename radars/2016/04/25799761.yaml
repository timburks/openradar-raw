    description: "Summary:\r\nI have few machines with OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion. They were configured to connect to Wi-Fi via configuration profile installed by Munki (Munki uses profiles command line tool to install profiles).\r\n\r\nWhen I upgrade machine to 10.11.4 El Capitan it does not connect to Wi-Fi. Configuration profile is listed as installed.\r\n\r\nI've seen similiar behavior with various few other profiles such as Gatekeeper settings.\r\n\r\nSample Wi-Fi configuration profile is provided in attachment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. There is a machine with OS X 10.8.5 and all available updates installed\r\n2. Install Wi-Fi configuration profile. Profile is installed by profiles command line tool from root shell.\r\n3. Client connects to Wi-Fi.\r\n4. Upgrade OS X to 10.11.4 via installer downloaded from MAS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMachine connects to Wi-Fi after upgrade\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMachine does NOT connect to Wi-Fi after upgrade. \r\n\r\nWi-Fi configuration profile is listed as installed. If I turn Wi-Fi off and on again it has no effect. If I try to connect to affected Wi-Fi manually I am prompted for password as if there was no configuration profile in place.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.8.5\r\n10.11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy current workaround is to manually remove all installed configuration profiles after upgrade and reinstall them.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'WiFi_X.mobileconfig' was successfully uploaded."
