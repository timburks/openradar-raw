        Summary:
        Attached is an image detailing the steps to do this and what I'm seeing. But essentially, the device's Restrictions setting in Setting.app, where the user can block specific content that may be deemed objectionable, etc, is being bypassed with respect to the Apple Music Connect restriction, when the user searches for an artist that has a Connect page.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) In Settings.app, General > Restrictions, turn off Apple Music Connect.
        2) Go into Music.app (Apple Music may be required for this to occur, have not tested without it.)
        3) Search for an artist that has an Apple Music Connect page, I saw this occur using Zebrahead, Drake, and Elton John.

        Expected Results:
        Search results should not include Connect pages, and user should not be able to see this content.

        Actual Results:
        User sees results for Apple Music Connect, and can tap the table view cell, go forward, and view the restricted content.
