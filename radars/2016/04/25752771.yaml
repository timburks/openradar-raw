    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a \"space gray\" iPhone or iPad boots up, it shows a white Apple logo on a solid black background. Since it's just booting up it doesn't know your brightness setting or how bright the room is, which is fine. The logo can be a little bright at times, but no big deal.\r\n\r\nBut at some point (iOS 7 maybe?) white/silver devices got a white boot screen with a black Apple logo. When I first noticed the change, I thought it a fun idea. It stopped being cute a long time ago. When iOS is misbehaving and I need to reboot my device at night, or it just starts up again after running out of battery, it's insulting. (It also doesn't even work that wellâ€”on a black device the black background blends with the device itself, sure, but that's not true on a white iOS device. There's always a black border around the screen, and the whites don't match either.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Reboot a white/silver iPad in a dark room (or a white iPhone)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot get blinded and light up the room for a cutesy boot screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPad makes a serviceable lamp for a short time while it is booting.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro, 256GB, T-Mobile\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
