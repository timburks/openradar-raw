        Summary:
        When setting secureTextEntry to YES (from NO) on a UITextField with text in it, the textfield will clear all text on the next insertion. This is probably some sort of intended behavior, but it makes having a "show / hide password" button hard to create.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a UITextField
        2. type some text in it
        3. set secureTextEntry = YES
        4. type another character

        Expected Results:
        - The character is appended to the text already being there

        Actual Results:
        - The textfield is cleared and only the typed character in step 4 is visible.

        Regression:

        Notes:
        It seems that secureTextEntry always clears text on first insertion, which seems intended: the user probably cannot know what is in there, so it makes sense to clear. However, this also happens when dynamically setting secureTextEntry to YES on a textfield which already is first responder: that does not seem intended.
