    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS, NSValue can be initialized using CGAffineTransform.\r\nThe Mac counterpart does not exists, despite the fact that most of the initializers are equal on both platforms.\r\nNSGeometry simply misses methods in its NSValue extension that UIGeometry has.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\niOS: let value = NSValue(CGAffineTransform: transform)\r\nMac: let value = NSValue(CGAffineTransform: transform) does not work. Therefore it is difficult to use a CGAffineTransform in, let's say, a CIFilter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth platforms should be able to initialize a NSValue from a given CGAffineTransform.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCGAffineTransform can not be wrapped in an NSValue using Swift (or at least I haven't found a way yet).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest release build.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI added sample code in playgrounds that demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), OS X 10.11.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'NSValue Sample Code.zip' was successfully uploaded."
