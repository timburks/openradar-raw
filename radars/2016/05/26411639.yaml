        Summary:
        Creating a second Cocoa Application target (and probably others) overwrites existing files with same names without warning.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new "Cocoa Application" project (ObjC in this case).
        2. Name it "MenubarlessClock" and make it an NSUIElement
        3. Write the code (i.e. modify the XIB and source file)
        4. Realize that you want a settings app to wrap around this app
        5. Rename the target to "MenubarlessClock Helper" (this will also rename the build product)
        6. Note how all files are still in a "MenubarlessClock" folder next to the project, the folder wasn't renamed.
        7. Choose File > New > Target… and create a new Cocoa Application target named "MenubarlessClock"

        Expected Results:
        8. A warning: "Some files with the same names already exist, do you really want to replace them?" Ideally with an option to rename the files from the template or at least put everything in a subfolder of a different name.

        Actual Results:
        8. main.m, AppDelegate.h, AppDelegate.m, Assets.xcassets, MainMenu.xib and Info.plist are now shared between both targets. I'm not sure about the assets and main.m (because I hadn't modified them), but the xib, .m and .h were overwritten.

        Notes:
        I don't think it makes a difference, but I originally renamed the blue project icon at the top of the projects files list. That offered to rename all the other parts to "MenubarlessClock Helper". Then I renamed the top back to MenubarlessClock again but this time didn't let it rename the rest. If this should have had an effect, it should have renamed more things to …Helper, not fewer, but for completeness' sake I mention it.
