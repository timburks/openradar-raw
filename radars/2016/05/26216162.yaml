        Summary:
        If the user is in a call, it doesn’t provide any valuable information if his phone keeps vibrating and on top of that playing notification sounds when he holds it up to his ears.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Make a call. Then receive messages or even worse, when people from my generation (`93) are texting you, they send you like 5 messages to get to the point. This then is 5 times a sound AND a virbtational alert directly at your ear during which you can’t look at it because you’re in a call. Also, if switched to silent mode with the switch, it still vibrates even in call. I don’t see any use of notifications whatsoever during a call where the iPhone is directly at my ear. It might be a different story for handsfree, bluetooth or alike, but not for „hold iPhone to my ear“ calls.

        Expected Results:
        Essentially, do not disturb should automatically be enabled once on an active call.

        Actual Results:
        Notification sounds and vibrational alerts during the call

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
