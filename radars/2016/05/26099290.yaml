    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari, visit a web form where the submit action posts to a path that would trigger a universal link into some app. Tapping the submit button on the form will deep link the user into the app, but tapping the keyboard 'Go' button instead opens the destination in Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSuppose you have a form like:\r\n<form action=\"https://twitter.com/twitter\">\r\n<input type=\"text\">\r\n<button type=\"submit\">\r\n</form>\r\nand that you also have the Twitter app installed\r\n\r\n1. Visit the page with this form in mobile Safari\r\n2. Tap the submit button\r\n-> The Twitter app opens\r\n3. Go back to the web page and bring up the software keyboard\r\n4. Tap the Go button\r\n-> Twitter opens in mobile Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe 'Go' button submission of a form should also handle the universal link if tapping the submit button does so. Both should bring up the Twitter app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 'Go' button bypasses universal link handling. The destination is opened in mobile Safari instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s+"
