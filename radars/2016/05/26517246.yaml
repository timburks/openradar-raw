    description: "I have Dvorak enabled as the only keyboard on my laptop. When I run the Simulator and type in content from my hardware keyboard on my laptop, the Simulator displays the Qwerty equivalents.\r\n\r\n1) Enable Dvorak as your laptop's keyboard preference.\r\n2) Delete the US keyboard preference.\r\nRun an app in the simulator that has a text input field.\r\n4) Verify that the simulator has Keyboard > Use the Same Layout as OS X selected.\r\n5) Use your laptop's keyboard to input text.\r\n\r\nExpected: Dvorak keystrokes to appear in the simulator.\r\n\r\nActual: Qwerty keystrokes appear in the simulator"
