    description: It’s pretty common for people to completely ignore invites to TestFlight. Maybe this because they need to open the email on their phone (which may not have their work email connected) or they just aren’t interested at the time. Then, a few months later when they need access, they can’t find the original email. At this point I, as the developer, have no way of resending the invite. The only solution in iTunes Connect is to remove them and add them again, which isn’t very obvious, and feels like it could be dangerous.
