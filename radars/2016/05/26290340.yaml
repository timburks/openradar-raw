    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Reload Without Content Blockers\" option, accessed by holding the \"Refresh\" button in the address bar, does not seem to actually deactivate Content Blockers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a Safari content blocking plugin (I tried both Adguard AdBlocker and Wipr)\r\n2. Navigate to a page that changes if it detects content blockers are on (for example an adblock test page, or an article that ask for the user to turn of adblockers)\r\n3. Try to turn of content blocking for the page with \"Reload Without Content Blockers\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page is reloaded with content blockers disabled (as if I had gone to preferences and disabled the plugin).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing appears to happen, the page continues to complain that adblock is turned on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1.1 (11601.6.17, 11602.1.31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLate 2011 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.5 Beta (15F31a)"
