    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen deleting unread Mails on iOS while not having internet connectivity it is marked read but is not deleted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn order to reproduce this issue you need a mail account with unread emails. I use an IMAP Mail account.\r\n\r\n1. Open Mail\r\n2. Open the Inbox of your Email account\r\n3. Remove Internet connectivity on the iPhone (e.g. turn on flight mode)\r\n4. Press Edit\r\n5. Mark at least one unread mail\r\n6. Press delete\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are two valid results:\r\nEither:\r\nThe email is still unread and not deleted.\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\nThe email is marked as deleted and will be deleted as soon as there is network connectivity\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe email is not deleted but is marked as read. As soon as there is network connectivity, the email is marked read on the server.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 13E238\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI rely on the correct status on my mails. If I press delete I expect the Email to be deleted and not marked as read. An Email should only be marked as read If I open it.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus"
