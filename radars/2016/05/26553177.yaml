        Summary:
        Finder doesn't display new files in folder for a very long time.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a folder on your Desktop, or on any Fileserver.
        Open said folder in the Finder.
        Have another Process create a new file in there, or let another process move a file into that folder.
        Alternatively have another user move or create a new file into that folder.

        Expected Results:
        The Finder should pick up the change and display the new or changed files within a few seconds.

        Actual Results:
        It takes the Finder several minutes to show the change, if it ever displays the change AT ALL in the case of an SMB mount.
        It is sometimes necessary to unmount and remount an SMB Share to make the Finder show new files in a directory.

        Regression:
        This has worked since System 6 up until about 10.9. Since 10.10 and 10.11 this delay causes severe problems with the workflow when several people work on a project via a fileserver. Yes, this problem is most noticable on Apple's own OS X Server product.

        Notes:
        Apple would do good in recognizing and admitting that they have a severe software quality problem with OS X instead of giving absolutely delusional interview answers where Hairforce One claims that their quality has improved when anyone actually USING OS X has seen a steady decline in usability and stability since 10.6.8.
