        Summary:
        The WWDC app should make it easier to log in.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open WWDC app to check a session schedule or watch a video.
        2. The app has signed me out for various reasons (token expiration, changed Apple ID or password).

        Expected Results:
        It’s easy to sign back in using iCloud keychain or the 1Password extension.j

        Actual Results:
        I have to go look up my Apple ID password (it was randomly generated, so I don’t know it) and paste it in.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        none
