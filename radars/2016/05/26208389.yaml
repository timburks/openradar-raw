        Summary:
        Sometimes, the AutoCorrection bubbles appear below the keyboard, making them impossible to tap. It would be a good idea to move the bubbles above the word instead.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add a UITextView just above the keyboard and make it a first responder
        2. Type a word that can be auto corrected
        3. Wait until the AutoCorrection bubbles appear

        Expected Results:
        1. The AutoCorrection bubbles appear not obscured by the keyboard, e.g. above the word.

        Actual Results:
        1. The AutoCorrection bubbles appear below the word, obscured by the keyboard.

        Regression:
        This happens on some devices more often than others. An iPad Mini running an iPhone app in compatibility mode seems to make this happen quite a lot.
