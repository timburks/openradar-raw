    description: "A lot of custom frameworks for maps like MapBox' or Google Maps SDK offer the ability of setting a custom limit for a map's zoom level which the user can't zoom past. \r\nImplementing the same functionality with MapKit currently requires listening for updates in the regionDidChangeAnimated delegate method and manually setting the region or camera.altitude at that point. Unfortunately this results in changing the zoom level only after the user has zoomed past it, resulting in weird jumping behavior.\r\n\r\nThere are valid use cases for having a custom hard zoom limit. It would be fantastic if MapKit could support this."
