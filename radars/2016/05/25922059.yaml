    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Safari View Controller user interface already makes it clear when a user is in private mode or normal viewing mode.\r\n\r\nThe Safari View Controller API should provide a way for developers to ignore privacy settings of the normal Safari application.\r\n\r\nThere are many use cases for this level of control, including 3-legged O-Auth, for using Safari View Controller in an application's authentication flow as well as being able to provide app-specific browsing privacy control to the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an app that uses Safari View Controller\r\n2. Open a URL in Safari View Controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Safari View Controller should launch in a privacy mode that is app specific or specified by the developer through the API.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Safari View Controller launches in private browsing mode if the user's Safari application is in this state. It launches in normal viewing mode if the user's Safari application is in normal viewing mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F61)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64 GB T-Mobile, using Wi-Fi"
