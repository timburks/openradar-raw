        Summary:
        libxpc is an incredibly useful inter-process communication library for OS X. Like libdispatch (https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch), it would be great if open-source work could be done to port it to Linux. It would also help with Swift 3 goals such as porting SourceKit (heavily dependent on libxpc) to Linux.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Visit https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libxpc in your favorite browser.

        Expected Results:
        A web page hosting the source code to libxpc is displayed.

        Actual Results:
        A 404 is returned.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
