    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen having a UITextView inside a modally presented view controller, tap & hold does not work on a link in a UITextView. The problem is caused by UITextView always wanting to present the AlertController it wants to show on the root view controller, which is already presenting a view controller, so it fails. It would be appropriate for the UITextView to present the alert controller on the containing view controller instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. modally present a view controller with a textview with an embedded link\r\n2. tap & hold on the link\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. a popup menu for the link shows up\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. A log warning: Warning: Attempt to present <_UIRotatingAlertController: 0x7fa34a55c800> on <UIViewController: 0x7fa34975ff60> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!\r\n2. no action sheet\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas been there since at least iOS 8.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
