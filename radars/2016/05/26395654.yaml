    description: "Summary:\r\nInterface Builder does not handle fraction/decimal constants for layout constraints, margins, stack view spacings, etc. It is very common to use \"0.5\" to recreate the very thin lines commonly used as the UITableView spacer. IB rounds 0.5 to 0 or 1 (usually 0).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can manually edit the storyboard XML file and set the value to 0.5. In IB it will still display as 0 or 1 but saving the storyboard/nib does not reset the raw value in the XML file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create storyboard, add UIViewController\r\n2. Add UIStackView with a few views\r\n3. Set UIStackView's spacing to '0.5'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSpacing is set to 0.5\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSpacing is rounded to 0\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X Version 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPerhaps it's more acceptable to add this thin line w/ drawRect, but it is IMO easier and more convenient to do this in IB.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
