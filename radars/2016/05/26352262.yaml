    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an app is woken up via PushKit push, the app stays awake for 27 seconds before being suspended. The PushKit API does not currently provide a way to say, \"I'm done, suspend me now.\" APNS wakeups have this in the form of a completion handler that we can call when we are done with processing.  Having an equivalent mechanism with the PushKit API will help minimize battery usage and background running time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a PushKit push to device\r\n2. Observe background running time of app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should only stay awake for as long as it needs to complete its processing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp stays awake for 27 seconds before being suspended."
