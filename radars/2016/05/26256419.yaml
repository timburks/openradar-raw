    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you dictate to a search field on Apple TV using Siri there is a spinner shown. A circular line that is not completely connected. This line spins. It is not symmetrical. This causes the appearance of the circle oscillating and appearing wobbly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Perform a Siri search\r\n2. Observe the loading indicator very carefully.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA super smooth and beautiful circle rotating evenly within itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSomething that will drive OCD people nuts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest Apple TV software as of 2016-05-12."
