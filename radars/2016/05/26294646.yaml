    description: "When performing intense computation using the GPU on the Mac (OpenGL, Metal, OpenCL), UI typically becomes unresponsive to the point the computer becomes barely usable. This happens because 1. GPU is a shared resource, 2. such computation are performed at maximum speed without priorities. It doesn't seem possible to configure priorities the way GCD does it for the CPU (QoS). \n\nTherefore, I would like to suggest a new API [ideally GPU-SDK agnostic] that would enable priorities, or Quality of Service, for the GPU resource so that a better experience can be implemented in apps."
