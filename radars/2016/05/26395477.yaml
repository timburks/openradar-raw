    description: "Summary:\nI should be able to paste an image into fields in the brower. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. take a screenshot by holding down ctrl on the keyboard (which copies to your pasteboard without saving as a file)\n2. hit cmd - v in a comment box on github.com\n3. nothing happens\n\nExpected Results:\nWhen images are sent properly, github comment boxes display “[uploading image]” etc.  This issue happens with various other sites that can process an image pasting.  Safari doesn’t seem to be sending the image data properly.\n\nActual Results:\nNothing happens.\n\nNotes:\nThere are no known workarounds beside using inferior browsers like Chrome… help!"
