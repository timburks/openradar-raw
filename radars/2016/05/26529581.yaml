    description: "Summary:\r\nSome apps are, by design, running all the time. When using the App Store to update such apps, they are relaunched prematurely while the App Store is trying to update them, which causes the App Store to have to ask them to quit again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app from the Mac App Store such as Fantastical 2: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-calendar-reminders/id975937182?mt=12 or CloudApp: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloudapp/id417602904?mt=12, both of which I’ve used to reproduce this issue.\r\n2. Run the app, and use its preferences to set it up to run at login (i.e. “always running”).\r\n3. Wait for an update to be available for the app in the Mac App Store.\r\n4. Click Update.\r\n5. The Mac App Store will ask to close the app, promising to reopen it when the update is done.\r\n6. Click Continue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app quits, and it stays quit until the update is done, at which point it reopens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs soon as the update starts downloading, the app reopens all on its own. The App Store will then prompt to quit it again, and after quitting it a second time, the update succeeds.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI’m pretty sure this was working at some point between 10.11.0, although I can’t test that, and it’s definitely broken in 10.11.4 and 10.11.5. I would have logged this sooner, but I had to wait for an update to Fantastical or CloudApp, and then remember to actually capture a screen recording.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached a screen recording, also uploaded to http://cl.ly/gIz7"
