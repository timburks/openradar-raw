    description: "Summary:\r\nReceiving text messages where the sender sets a name (icing / nagios notifications) does not sort sender correctly.\r\nI think because you don't implement an actually lookup, but only check if there is a name attached to the sender, or just a number.\r\nIn this special case your lazy detection does not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReceive text with sender name set by sending gateway/service, but senders is not in contact list.\r\n-> doesn't get sorted into \"Unkown Senders\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGets sorted correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGets sorted as \"Known Sender\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 [13E238]\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI only want to see server notification when I look for them, but if I use \"Mute\", the messages still get sorted by arriving message.\r\nI hoped using \"Unkown Senders\" could fix that problem for me.\r\nWether you stop sorting messages from muted senders on the top or fix the bug with \"Unkown Senders\" I don't care I just wish to be able to work with messages again.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 64GB, Provider Salt, both over Mobile net or WiFi"
