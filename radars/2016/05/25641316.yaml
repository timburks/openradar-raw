    description: "John Brayton09-Apr-2016 08:20 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nScrolling doesn't appear to work on the iTunes Connect page for an iOS app that lets you upload screenshots and set the app description for an iOS app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Log in to iTunes Connect with an account that has at least one iOS app with one version whose status is \"Prepare for Submission\".\r\nhttps://itunesconnect.apple.com/\r\n\r\n2.  On the \"My Apps\" page, click on the app.\r\n\r\n3.  Click on the version label from the left navigation pane. You will end up on a page with screenshots. (I attached a screenshot of the page I am referring to.)\r\n\r\n4.  Attempt to scroll the right navigation pane.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to scroll the right pane down to where I can enter the app description and keywords. This works in Safari 9.1 (11601.5.17.1), but not in Safari Technology Preview 9.1.1 (11601.6.10, 11602.1.25).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot scroll beyond the bottom of the screenshots.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.1.1 (11601.6.10, 11602.1.25)"
