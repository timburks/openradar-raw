        Summary:
        I sync my music collection (usually over wi-fi) to my iPhone. Since at least iOS 7, I’ve noticed that many tracks with album art in iTunes don’t show their album art in the iOS Music app. This has persisted across multiple restore from backup operations, though I’ve never done a full reset of my iOS data (i.e. I’ve restored from backup with each iPhone I’ve had since iPhone OS 1.0)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Not sure.

        Expected Results:
        Every track in iTunes that has album art should show its art in the Music app

        Actual Results:
        Many (seemingly random) tracks don’t show their artwork

        Regression:
        It’s tough to remember at which point this started, but it’s at least a couple major revisions ago

        Notes:
        I can provide any additional info you need to help diagnose what’s happening
