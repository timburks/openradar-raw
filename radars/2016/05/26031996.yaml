Launch Photos.app\r\n2. Go to Photos\r\n3. Select some photos || videos\r\n4. Click Share -> iCloud Photo Sharing -> Family\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser can see some feedback. Progress of upload. Grayed out preview of uploaded items in Shared iCloud Family album. Something. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser does NOT have any feedback after sharing items (this is problem on xDSL line with slow upload). This creates confusion. Is Photos.app doing anything or not?\r\n\r\nClassic reaction: user tries to share photos again. Result -> Photos are shared twice in Family album. \r\n\r\nBad UI.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4"
