        Summary:
        When marking some views and using "Embed in View" in Interface Builder, all subviews lose their AutoLayout constraints against their superview and eachother.
        There's actually no reason for that and it creates a huge pain when doing this in a complex storyboard with lots of constraints. E.g. One would expect for instance that views that are centered against their superview will remain centered against the new parent, etc.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Mark a few views that have constraints, go to Editor -> Embed In -> View

        Expected Results:
        Views will keep their constraints against siblings and ancestor

        Actual Results:
        They lose these constraints
