    description: "Summary:\r\nIf AVPlayer is paused for about 2 minutes on a livestream it does not continue playing on play().\r\n\r\nThe problem is AVPlayer does not communicate that it can not continue playing. It does not change rate back to 0. It does not change to failed state on the AVPlayerItem. It does not change to buffering AVPlayerItem.\r\n\r\nTherefore I can not recreate the AVPlayerItem in my code to recover the stream myself. I need to know if AVPlayer fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI attached a Playground which demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\n1. create AVPlayer and AVPlayerItem with an internet livestream url\r\n2. play()\r\n3. pause() after 2 seconds\r\n4. play() after 120 seconds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAVPlayer should actually recover and play\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nreport any error that something went wrong, so I can recover in my code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAVPlayer.rate = 1\r\nAVPlayerItem.status = ready\r\nAVPlayerItem.caching = false\r\n\r\nSo it looks like its playing, but there is no sound to hear\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nworks on all ios devices. even in a playground as attached\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/funkenstrahlen/ba0f97c1fb9f88ee63a44470a8ed7b5f"

    title: AVPlayer play() does not work if it was paused for 2 minutes. Does not report any error indication too!
