    description: "Disabling \"Clear on Appearance\" for a Table View Controller in a storyboard doesn't make any difference. `self.clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear` is still YES in viewDidLoad.\r\n\r\nHowever, disabling it in code does work:\r\n\r\n- (void)viewDidLoad {\r\n    [super viewDidLoad];\r\n     self.clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear = NO;\r\n}"
