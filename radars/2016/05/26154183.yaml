    description: "Summary:\r\nI've a got storyboard, this storyboard has a view controller which has a title view inside its navigation item. While showing such view controller on screen, Xcode becomes terribly slow if used in an external monitor. If you move to the Mac's main screen, it performs well again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add view controller to a storyboard\r\n2. Drag a Navigation Item to this storyboard\r\n3. Drag a UIView to this Navigation Item\r\n4. Drag anything else to this view, like a UIButton\r\n4. Move Xcode to an external monitor\r\n5. While the view controller previously created is on the screen, try navigation through the storyboard\r\nXcode now should be really slow and sluggish.\r\n6. Move Xcode back to the Mac's main screen. Xcode should not be back at its old snappy self.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode's performance should not be affected by this specific scenario.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode's performance is seriously affected in this specific scenario.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3 (7D175)\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm not using any 3rd party plugins\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI'm using a MacBook Pro with Retina Display, Late 2013, 2.3GHz i7, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M.\r\nTested in 3 different external monitors: a Thunderbolt Display and 2 generic LG monitors.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
