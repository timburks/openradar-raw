    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen changing settings while editing SMTP server settings, and then deciding to discard the edits, Cancelling does not actually revert changes that were already made, but instead save them regardless.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Mail, open its Prefs window.\r\nSwitch to the Accounts tab.\r\nOpen the popup menu below for \"Outgoing mail server (SMTP)\", choosing \"Edit SMTP Server List...\"\r\nIn the SMTP sheet dialog,\r\nChoose any existing account from the list.\r\nMake any changes, e.g. change the Description.\r\nNow click the Cancel button.\r\n\r\nAdditional test: If you edit (in the Advanced tab) the authorization to something that requires a login, and leave the user name empty, you cannot even Cancel because it'll keeps telling you that the user name can't be empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe changes should not be saved. However, when checking the SMTP settings again, you'll find all the changes are saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe changes are saved, which is plain wrong.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4, Mail 9.3 (3124)"
