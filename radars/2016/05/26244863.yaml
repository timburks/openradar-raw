    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running an automated UI Test, if the test steps involve presenting a modal view controller, the presentation does not occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn the attached project:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure an iPad simulator is selected\r\n2. Run the automated test named `testExample()`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe automated test should press the button titled \"Show Modal\", which should present a modal view controller. The test should then tap the button titled \"Dismiss\" and the test should complete as succeeded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test does not indicate that it failed to find the button \"Show Modal\" nor does it indicate that it failed to tap the button. Despite there being no indication of these failures the modal view controller is not presented.\r\n\r\nThe next step of the test fails, because the view controller was never presented, the \"Dismiss\" button cannot be found.\r\n\r\nThe test fails with an error stating it was unable to find any buttons titled \"Dismiss\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad Simulator or Device.\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iPadTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
