    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the cullMode of an SCNMaterial to front, the overlay SKScene is also culled (as set by SCNView overlaySKScene). The overlay scene should not be impacted by changing the cullmode of an unrelated object in the 3D scene.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload test project demonstratting bug from\r\nhttps://github.com/lachlanhurst/SceneKitFrontFaceCullingBug\r\n\r\nCompile and run. Tapping the screen toggles between front face and back face culling. Note how the red square disappears when front face culling (it should remain visible)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe overlay scene (SKScene) should remain visible no matter what cull mode is set on the objects in the 3D scene.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe overlay scene disappears when setting cullMode to front.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F69)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s Plus\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'FFculling.gif' was successfully uploaded."
