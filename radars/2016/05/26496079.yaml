    description: "The CMSensorRecorder returns a CMSensorDataList of CMRecordedAccelerometerData objects.\r\n\r\nCMRecordedAccelerometerData is a subclass of CMLogItem which has a timestamp property.  The timestamp should be \"the amount of time in seconds since the device booted\".\r\n\r\nThe time stamp is incorrect and is always offset by a constant amount from the expected time stamp."
