        Summary:
        When I switch from My Music to New, and then back, all of my playlist folders get collapsed

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Expand a bunch of playlist folders in My Music
        2. Switch to the New section
        3. Switch back to My Music

        Expected Results:
        Playlist folders expanded in step 1 stay expanded (which is how iTunes has always worked)

        Actual Results:
        All playlist folders are collapsed

        Regression:
        This started with 12.4

        Notes:
        When I dragged a song over the list of playlists, it seemed like they sprang back the first time, but when I repeated and tried to expand a folder without dragging, they stayed collapsed.
