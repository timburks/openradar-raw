    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UITextView is edited and the first line is left blank (either by pressing return on the keyboard or setting the text programtically starting with \\n) when that line is selected the cursor is aligned to the left and any text entered is left aligned. The rest of the text is left unchanged, centered correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a view containing a center aligned UITextView.\r\nStart editing the textview and tap return before entering any text.\r\nTap on the first line in the text view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor should still be centered and any text entered should be centered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cursor is aligned to the left of the text view and any text entered is left aligned, pressing return will mean the new line is left aligned."
