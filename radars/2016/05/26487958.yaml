    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 7, developers can add an Objective-C category to extend existing classes. When adding such a category, developers are prompted for both the name of the category and the class to be extended. The resulting file is named Class+CategoryName.[hm].\r\n\r\nHowever, if a folder already exists with the given category name, the file add fails, claiming something named \"CategoryName\" already exists. This should be irrelevant, since the add dialog won't attempt to create anything named CategoryName.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project from sample\r\n2. In the project's source directory, create a folder named Extensions\r\n3. In Xcode, add a new Objective-C category on any class named Extensions; save it in the source directory\r\n4. Click Next\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe addition should succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe addition fails with error: '\"Extensions\" already exists. Do you want to replace it?'\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3.1 (7D1014) / OS X 10.11.5 (15F34)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDownload the attached sample project to cover steps 1 and 2 from above; open the project and continue from step 3.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny Mac\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SomeArbitraryProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
