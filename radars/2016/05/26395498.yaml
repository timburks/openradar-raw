        Summary:
        Any call to presentationLayer() on an AVPlayerLayer object will crash.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create an AVPlayerLayer and make a call to the presentationLayer() method inherited from CALayer(). (Run the attached sample project)

        Expected Results:
        I would expect it to not crash, and to return a layer in the presentationLayer hierarchy for the AVPlayerLayer.

        Actual Results:
        The app crashes with an EXC_BAD_ACCESS.
