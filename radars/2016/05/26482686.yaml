        Summary:

        So Playgrounds allow us to import frameworks from the same workspace they are located in, which is great for trying out third party frameworks or providing Playgrounds to users of third party frameworks.

        Unfortunately, importing frameworks does not appear to be working for additional source files in the Playground. This feels like a bug, but might be intended functionality.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Download the example project
        2. Build the “ContentfulPlayground” for simulator, so that it is available for import
        3. Look at Contentful.playground/Sources/file.swift

        Expected Results:

        File should compile, no errors should be displayed

        Actual Results:

        “No such module” for third party framework

        Regression: -

        Notes:

        If you delete or uncomment the offending code in “file.swift”, you can see that the same code works fine in the main Playground file.
