    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting a viewController with the .FormSheet style, the frame is not properly updated until viewDidAppear in the view lifecycle.  This is problematic because if operations that depend on the view size happen before the view's frame is updated, they may render incorrectly, or fail altogether (ie. scrollToItem:atScrollPosition:animated: fails when called in viewWillAppear:, but is visible to the user in the viewDidAppear:)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- on iPad, present a view controller modally with the presentation style set to .FormSheet\r\n2- print the frame after calling super.viewWillAppear() in viewWillAppear and likewise in viewDidAppear.  \r\n3- observe that the frame is the full size of the screen in viewWillAppear, and the correct modal size in viewDidAppear. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrame should be the correct smaller size in viewWillAppear:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFrame is the incorrect full size in viewWillAppear:\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany device that can present with a .FormSheet modalPresentationStyle \r\n\r\nAttachments:"
