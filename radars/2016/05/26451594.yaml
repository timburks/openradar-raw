    description: Imagine something horrible happens with OS and you need to reinstall it from (internet) recovery. Currently you can only install OS X version which shipped with computer. Wouldn't it be nice to have ability to install latest (purchased?) version of OS X available for particular Mac. Original OS X could still be available for install but user would have choice between original and most recent version of OS X. This ability would reduce time to reinstall older computer by one half.
