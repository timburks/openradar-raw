    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://26009995\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe are using a relatively big bridging header (~ 150 lines) and every time we try to use the “Open Quickly” feature of Xcode, it opens an empty file the first time and we need to re-open it to see the actual content of the Bridging header file.\r\n  \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start the Open Quickly thingy (CMD + Shift + O)\r\n2. Look for your Bridging header file\r\n3. Press enter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should show the content of the bridging header file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe opened file appears to be the Bridging header, but is empty"
