    description: "Summary:\nCreating a SceneKit scene, exporting it via Model I/O to an .OBJ file and reimporting it causes the materials associated with the model to be lost. The export does write a material file (.MTL) but it does not contain correct information and the exporter does not write image file.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Run the attached playground. \n2) Notice on the timeline that the lower view contains a plane of the default material. The texture from the original model were not exported and the export/import cycle caused that information to be lost.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe exporter should write out a correct material file and any needed image files.\n\nActual Results:\nWhile the mesh is correctly written to the .OBJ file, the .MTL file that is written does not reflect the materials used in the model.\n\nRegression:\nOccurs on Mac OS X 10.11.4 and iOS 9.3."
