    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the screensaver or screen sleeps, the com.apple.screenIsLocked NSDistributedNotificationCenter notification fires regardless of what is set for \"require password after sleep or screensaver begins\" in System Preferences > Security & Privacy, so long as the checkbox next to that setting is checked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a simple Xcode project, register for the notification with the NSDistributedNotificationCenter as so: \r\n\r\n[NSDistributedNotificationCenter.defaultCenter addObserver:self\r\n                                                    selector:@selector(screenDidLock)\r\n                                                        name:@\"com.apple.screenIsLocked\"\r\n                                                      object:nil];\r\n\r\n2. In System Preferences, check the box next to \"require password after sleep or screensaver begins\" and set it to require a password for anything other than \"immediately\"\r\n\r\n3. Run the Xcode project and allow the screen to sleep before what was set in the previous step\r\n\r\n4. Note that the notification fires even though the screen is not locked and does not ask the user for a password\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification should not fire as the screen is not locked and the user is not required to enter a password\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification fires even though the user is not required to enter a password and the screen is not locked\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65), all Mac models\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
