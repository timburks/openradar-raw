    description: "Summary:\r\nQuicklook (through both iCloud Drive and Dropbox) both will render particular Keynote documents as zoomed-in, with no way for the user to zoom out to fit the whole presentation on the screen at once. You can see it here in this screenshot:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7u8suq309ecfn8m/Screenshot%202016-05-16%2012.52.57.png?dl=0\r\n\r\nI've attached the document that causes this behavior to happen, along with a sample app that shows this behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use any application that uses the QuickLook framework to open the attached keynote file, including the Example project included.\r\n2. Observe that the slide is not fit to width in either portrait or landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe document should be sized to fit, and zoom behavior should allow the user to see the entire slide at once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt shows only around 2/3 of the slide and zooming out doesn't allow you to see the whole slide.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3 (13E230)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
