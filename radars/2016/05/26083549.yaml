    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 7.3.1 / Swift 2.2 the fix-it is broken when it comes to the old style for loops.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open the sample playground.\r\n1. Click the yellow advise on how to update the for loop\r\n2. Click the now appearing red compiler error\r\n3. Repeat step 2 a couple of times\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step 1 there is no other warning / error in that line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhile repeating step 3, sometimes Xcode tries to add another comma do fix the issue and sometimes it tries to remove one. This looks like as if the Swift syntax parser is non deterministic in its behavior.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOpen Source Sample: https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com/tree/master/26083549%20-%20SwiftForLoop"
