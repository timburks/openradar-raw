    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone5 on iOS 9.2.1 was able to work until battery level 1%.\r\niPhone5 on iOS 9.3/9.3.1/9.3.2 not able to reach battery level 5...10% because it it randomly shut down itself.\r\n\r\nErasing iPhone and performing clean install does not solve issue.\r\nUsing \"Low Power Mode\" does not solve issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fully Charge iPhone (100% battery)\r\n2. Start using energy consuming app (Google Maps, Facebook, ...) on 3G connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhone should shutdown itself at battery level less than 1%.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Approximately at 20...30% of battery level (sometimes at 60%) iPhone will shutdown itself.\r\n2. Upon pressing \"Lock\" button \"large battery icon with cable\" will be shown, hinting user to plug-in iPhone to the charger.\r\n3. Wait 5-10 minutes\r\n4. Long press \"Lock\" button and start iPhone.\r\n5. iPhone will launch and will show approximately the same battery level as it was before shutdown.\r\n6. It is possible to use iPhone 5-15 minutes until it shut down itself again.\r\n\r\n----\r\nI just got additional information with the help of BatteryLife.app (https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1080930585).\r\nThere are two screenshots in attachment.\r\n- BatteryLife-701mAh.PNG: Shows that battery has capacity 701mAh (http://i.imgur.com/bdXXzEC.png)\r\n- BatteryLife-1171mAh.PNG: Shows that battery has capacity 1171mAh (http://i.imgur.com/WepZSig.png)\r\nSecond screenshot taken only 2 minutes after first one.\r\n\r\n----\r\nHere is a list of time events (Timezone: Central Europe - Berlin)\r\n\r\nTime and event:\r\n4:39 - shutdown at 11%\r\n4:42 - boot up - battery level 22%\r\n4:45 - shutdown at 20%\r\n4:51 - boot up at battery level 17%\r\n4:54 - shutdown at 16 %\r\n\r\nCapacity change: (mAh)\r\n4:01 - 952\r\n4:20 - 768\r\n4:24 - 704\r\n4:28 - 820\r\n4:32 - 684\r\n4:33 - 647\r\n4:44 - 764\r\n4:53 - 747"
