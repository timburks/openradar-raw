    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is not possible to programmatically select a tab in NSTabView when it is attached to a NSTabViewController. NSTabViews selectTabViewItemAtIndex: method has no effect at all. To select a tab by index programmatically, it has to be done via NSTabViewController. The property to modify is selectedTabViewItemIndex.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a NSTabViewController and try to select a tab by its index.\r\n2. See that it only works when using NSTabViewControllers selectedTabViewItemIndex.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tab should be selectable by NSTabViews own methods, not just the one provided by NSTabViewController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelecting the tab using NSTabView has no effect.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI found this bug by answering the following StackOverflow question:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/37005622/control-a-nstabviewcontroller-from-parent-view/37012322#37012322"
