    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen editing a SceneKit particle system, the warmup duration can be set to a negative number, when Xcode tries to apply this setting it hangs, requiring a force quit.\r\nI have attached a sample project with a particle system for ease of testing, although this bug will occur with any project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new SceneKit Particle System File. (Or select the particle system from the project navigator in the attached example project.)\r\nIn the right sidebar set the warmup duration to a negative number.\r\nRefresh the particle system by either pressing the refresh icon, or clicking another file, then back to the particle system.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should not hang. The warmup duration setting should be applied, or if negative numbers are not supported it should either default to 0  or not allow negative numbers to be selected through the interface.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs when trying to display a particle system with negative warmup duration, requiring a force quit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI assume negative numbers are not supported, so can ensure not to set them."
