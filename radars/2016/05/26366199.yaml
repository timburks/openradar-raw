    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing interpolated strings in Swift can cause memory leaks to be reported in Instruments. Changing the code from interpolating to concatenating the strings fixes the leak.\r\n\r\nI’ve attempted to shrink the repro case down as much as I can, from what I can gather, the problem only occurs when a largish value type is assigned within the same scope. There are other factors involved that I couldn’t discern - making minor changes to the size/structure of the value types can result in the leak disappearing, but the structure I’ve supplied in the sample code will reproduce the issue every time. \r\n\r\nNote the types need to be declared in a separate file, and the code compiled -O (fast) with whole module optimisations off.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is also available at https://gist.github.com/samritchie/81172456003141415f2fddcd4d3e50e9 if there’s an issue with the zip.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached project zip and unzip\r\n2. Open in Xcode and select a simulator or device\r\n3. Profile the app in Instruments, selecting the 'Leaks' instrument if prompted (Simulator or Device is okay)\r\n4. Comment out the string interpolation at AppDelegate.swift#20 and uncomment the concatenation at #23\r\n5. Profile the app again\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere shouldn’t be any memory leaks, regardless of whether interpolation or concatenation is used\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstruments detects a memory leak in the interpolation case\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\nApple Swift version 2.2 (swiftlang-703.0.18.8 clang-703.0.31)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Swift v 2.2 (Xcode 7.3.1). I’ve only tested iOS/iOS Simulator and this specific version of Swift."
