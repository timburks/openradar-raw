        Summary:
        When an Swift extension on UIButton exists in the project or linked frameworks, you canâ€™t connection a method marked with @IBAction to an UIButton.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Add an extension to UIButton
        Add an UIButton to a view in a XIB or storyboard file
        Try to connect the sent action to the file owner.

        Expected Results:
        Interface Builder shows all methods marked @IBAction from the file owner

        Actual Results:
        Interface Builder only shows Action and Non-Adaptive Seques

        Regression:
        As soon as you remove the UIButton extension, everything works as expected.
