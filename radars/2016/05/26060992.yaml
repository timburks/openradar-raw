        Summary:
        When using a dark background in Xcode, the beam cursor is very hard to spot because it's almost completely dark as well. A simple solution would be to add a white outline to the beam cursor, as was previous possible to do manually: https://github.com/egold/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use an Xcode theme with a dark (black) background
        2. Try to locate the beam cursor in the editor

        Expected Results:
        - Easy to do

        Actual Results:
        - Is incredibly hard, because the beam cursor only has a faint white border. Over time, this leads to build up frustration and lots of sadness :(

        Regression:
        Since Xcode 7.3, the following hack is no longer possible https://github.com/egold/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor

        Notes:
        Adding a white outline to the beam cursor will improve the life of countless Xcode users who like to use a dark background.
