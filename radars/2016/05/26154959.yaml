    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Interface Builder (IB), when we set a UILabel to use a custom font, and then define a *different* font for a separate size class (by using Interface Builder's Size Class Customization), the label is stripped of both Font name & size at runtime.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using Xcode 7.3, start a new project with a storyboard.\r\n2. Add a custom font to the project. See fonts added in attached project. Ensure font is added correctly (ie. added to build phases & *.plist)\r\n3. In the Main storyboard, add a new UILabel. Set the font of the label to the custom font. This should be in the Any/Any size class.\r\n4. Next to the 'font' field in the inspector, click on the '+' button to add a new size class-based font to the UILabel. Pick Regular/Regular to get an iPad-specific size class.\r\n5. Set a different font size for the Regular/Regular size class, but ensure that you are still choosing a font that was added to the project directly.\r\n7. Run the project on both iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the fonts defined in the Label Inspector to be displayed in the UILabel at runtime.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe fonts in the UILabel at runtime seemed to be standard size, and System font.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3 (7D175)\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I select a custom font that already exists in the OS, this problem does not occur. This only seems to occur when I use a font that I've added directly to the project."
