        Summary:
        Mac OS X has a Keychain Access.app which allows the user to view and edit all their stored passwords/certificates/secure notes, however, iOS does not.

        As iOS devices are becoming the users primary and sometimes only device, having the ability to view and edit passwords/certificates and especially secure notes is a very valuable feature that can currently only be done on Mac OS X.

        There have been many times on my iOS device I’m prompted for a password that I know is in my keychain, yet I can’t access the keychain on iOS.  This has interrupted my user experience and made me frustrated, because now I have to go back to my Mac or wait until I get back to my home/office to manually open Keychain Access and enter my password manually on my iOS device for future use.

        Please add a Keychain Access.app to the iOS App Store for all recent versions (9+) of iOS.

        Thank you
