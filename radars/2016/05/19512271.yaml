    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Cloud Drive implentation is done in such a CPU intense way that the internal fan goes off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing my 2012 Mac Book Air, at some point cloudd comes up and starts using CPU. At one point in time I even switched of Cloud Drive. I regret that I \"upgraded\" to Cloud Drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot using up all my CPU, just like things worked before....\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsing a lot of CPU, draining my battery...\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nYosemite 10.10.1 \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs far as I understand is this problem known, just to add to the bug report count...\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
