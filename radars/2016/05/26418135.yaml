    description: "Summary:\r\nIn standard configuration from Xcode asserts for example will be included in release mode. Only when defining NDEBUG in Xcode project file it will not be included. Other IDEs for example are doing this. NSAssert also is not included in release mode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd assert() function and run in release mode assert will still be called\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNDEBUG is defined and assert will not be called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNDEBUG is not defined and assert will be called, which is different to NSAssert which is not included in release mode."
