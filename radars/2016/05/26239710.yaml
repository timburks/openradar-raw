    description: "Summary:\r\nAn error has occurred (described in the Actual Results section) when trying connect to a server that requires client certificate authentication using NSURLCredential with AVPlayer even after setting a client certificate in the NSURLCredential.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use NSURLCredential (loaded with the client certificate) with iOS application\r\n2. Connect to a server that supports playback via HLS with AVPlayer\r\n3. Server requests for client certificate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. iOS device sends (client certificate) to server, and passes the authentication\r\n2. Server responds with related video data and starts playback.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe following is the client certificate sent for authentication to which it failed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/C=US/O=Apple Inc./OU=Apple Certification Authority/CN=Apple Root CA, issuer: /C=US/O=Apple Inc./OU=Apple Certification Authority/CN=Apple Root CA\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is it that AVPlayer uses this client certificate instead of the specified one?\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 7.3 (7D175)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue reproduction from devices were 100% however,\r\nwhen we tried it with simulator (using another client certificate), it works fine\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTest Devices„ÄÅwith iOS9.3: iPhone 5s (Model A1453, A1533) iPod touch (5th generation) iPad Air 2 (Model A1566)"
