    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I set accessibilityIdentifier programmatically on an NSPopover (or on the NSView which its contentViewController is associated with), it does not show up in Accessibility Inspector when I mouse over the popover.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with the sample from https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/Popover/Introduction/Intro.html (Version 1.2, 2015-12-17)\r\n2. In MyViewController createPopover, add this line after the popover was created:\r\n   self.myPopover.accessibilityIdentifier = @\"foo1\";\r\n3. In Main.storyboard, select the PopoverView node and use the Identity Inspector tab of the right-hand panel to set Accessibility Identity > Identifier to \"foo2\"\r\n4. Run the app\r\n5. Launch the OS X \"Accessibility Inspector\" app\r\n6. In the popover sample app, click the button to open the popover\r\n7. Mouse over a blank part of the popover\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnder Attributes, accessibilityIdentifier has the value \"foo1\" _or_ \"foo2\".\r\n\r\naccessibilityRole shows \"AXPopover\" however, so it's clear you are targeting the popover for inspection.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\naccessibilityIdentifier is not listed (this is the behavior you see normally when no identifier has been set)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4\r\nXcode 7.3.1"
