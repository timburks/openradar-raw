    description: "## Summary\r\n\r\nOpening a URL in Safari from another app (ex., Mail.app) results in a “Back to…” button in the system status bar. However, if the URL is opened in Safari using Safari View Controller’s “Open in Safari” button, no “Back to…” button is presented, which is a bummer.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\n1. In the app \"Foo\", open a URL in a Safari View Controller modal\r\n2. Tap the \"Open in Safari\" button on the SVC toolbar\r\n\r\n## Expected\r\n\r\n* The URL is opened in Safari\r\n* \"Back to Foo\" appears in the iOS status bar\r\n\r\n## Actual\r\n\r\n* The URL is opened in Safari, as expected\r\n* \"Back to Foo\" does not appear in the iOS status bar"
