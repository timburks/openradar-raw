        Summary:
        When attempting to print from the Contacts app, the print dialog is too big for my 13” MacBook Pro (non retina)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        File > Print > Dialog Box


        Expected Results:
        Dialog box should be scaled for the screen size.

        Actual Results:
        Size is much wider than current display. Print and Cancel buttons off screen to the right.

        Regression:
        Always occurs.

        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
