        Summary:
        I often zip a few files using the "Compress" contextual menu item in Finder, then attach the archive to an e-mail and send them off. Then I drag the archive to the trash. When I try to empty my trash, Finder will now tell me that these files are in use.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Select 3 files in Finder
        2. right-click one of them and choose "Compress 3 Items" in the contextual menu
        3. Create a new e-mail in Mail.app, enter subject and e-mail address.
        4. Rename the archive to something more sensible than Archive.zip, like "non_webcam_filters_one_still_nonworking.zip".
        5. Drag the Zip Archive into the mail message's text area
        6. Send the message off and wait for it to finish sending.
        7. Select the Zip archive and type Cmd-Delete to move it to the trash
        8. Right-click the trash in the dock and choose "Empty Trash"
        9. Confirm the "Are you Sure" message.

        Expected Results:
        10. The file should be deleted, the trash should now be empty.

        Actual Results:
        10. A copy progress window pops up containing the error message «The operation can't be completed because the item "non_webcam_filters_one_still_nonworking.zip" is in use.»

        Notes:
        In general I've found the number of cases where Finder would insist documents were in use has increased greatly. E.g. whenever I delete a movie in iTunes and iTunes moves it to the trash, I get the same behaviour.
