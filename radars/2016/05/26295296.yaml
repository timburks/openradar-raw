    description: "Summary:\r\nSome \"sign in via ...\" buttons rely on opening a new tab, letting you sign in with the selected service, and then close the tab again. Since SFSafariVC doesn't support tabs you get stuck after the website tried to close the tab. Twitter is an example of that\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to any site that has a \"sign in via Twitter\" button, via SFSafariVC (e.g. an RSS Reader that uses it). I will walk through with this one: http://stadt-bremerhaven.de/silicon-valley-staffel-2-meine-serien-empfehlung-fuer-techies/#comments\r\n\r\n2. Tap into the text view below \"Kommentar verfassen\"\r\n\r\n3. A little Twitter icon (among others) will appear, that that\r\n\r\n4. You will get redirected to the Twitter page where you can sign in and then \"Authorise app\"\r\n\r\n5. Tap authorize\r\n\r\n6. You'll get authorized and a blank screen appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet back to the original site\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA blank screen appears, because normally the authorisation happens in an extra tab. Since SFSafariVC doesn't support multiple tabs it will open in the same one. After it tries to close the tab only a blank page remains\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus"
