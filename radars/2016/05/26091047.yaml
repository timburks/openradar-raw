        Summary:
        iTunes icons show switching from pause to play states but the progress bar does not move and no sound is made. Manually dragging the progress bar, toggling play/pause, or any other actions to incite playback are not successful.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Pause playback
        2. Tell OS to sleep
        3. Wake OS next day
        4. Tell iTunes to play

        Expected Results:
        The paused music resumes playing

        Actual Results:
        No sound is made, progress UI reflects iTunes doing nothing.

        Regression:
        None known.

        Notes:
        This has happened on my last three Macbook Pros, so I don’t believe it’s strictly a hardware issue.
