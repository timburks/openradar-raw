    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a dark background in Xcode, the text cursor is hard to find and use.  A lot of people are having this issue and there was previous to Xcode 7.3, a work around for the issue (see https://github.com/egold/better-xcode-ibeam-cursor).  This workaround no longer works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Switch to a dark theme.\r\n3. Try to find the cursor.\r\n4. Move your mouse around a lot\r\n5. Find the cursor.\r\n6. Wait 15 second and try to find the cursor again.\r\n7. Cry because the cursor is lost again.\r\n8. Repeat again starting at step 5.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo have a cursor that can easily be found and used with a dark background\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot finding the cursor.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 7.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWhen using a dark background"
