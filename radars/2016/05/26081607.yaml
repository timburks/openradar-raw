    description: "Summary:\r\nAn API should be available to access the SSID that the iPhone is currently associate with, and details about the connection, such as: BSSID, signal strength(RSSI), channel, noise, transmission rate and encryption type.\r\n\r\nCNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo can be used today to get some of the connection details, but falls short on providing others, and is being deprecated. The new NEHotspotHelper provides signal strength in addition to BSSID and SSID, but the API requires additional entitlements and is not available to non-hotspot related apps.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of use cases for additional wifi connection details. One possibility is enterprise apps. Big companies have complex wifi environments, with multiple WLANs on indoor and outdoor deployments. Such companies could have dedicated apps that end users could install and used to diagnose and report issues on the wireless coverage. This kind of application is impossible without having access to RSSI and noise, for example.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnhancement request. Not applicable.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPublic API designed to access wifi details.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo public api :(\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and iPads"
