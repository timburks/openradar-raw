    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a value is set for the popoverLayoutMargins property on UIPopoverPresentationController, the layout of the presented popover is not affected. In the sample project provided, the preferredContentSize of the presented view controller is set to the width of the presenting view controller's view, and a the left and right popoverLayoutMargins are set to one quarter of that amount. The displayed popover is the same with or without the popoverLayoutMargins set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample app.\r\n2. Press button labeled \"Button\".\r\n3. Observe that popover is much wider than expected size (should be half of screen width, instead is whole screen width).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPopover size would be limited by constraints supplied in popoverLayoutMargins (should be half of screen width).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npopoverLayoutMargins is ignored (popover is whole screen width).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s simulator (iOS 9.2), iPad Air 2 simulator (iOS 9.2), various physical devices running versions of iOS 8 and iOS 9\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UIPopoverPresentationControllerIssue.zip' and 'Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 8.43.14 am.png' were successfully uploaded."
