    description: "Summary:\r\nRecently, I worked on a workout app which needed real time accelerometer data to analyze a user's movement.\r\n\r\nI tried using a combination of updates from the CMMotionManager and recorded data from the CMSensorRecorder to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the CMSensorRecorder varied by Watch.  On some watches, getting recorded data was almost instantaneous, on other watches it took up to 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if all watches returned recorded data in a reasonable amount of time.  Three minutes is too long for an user to wait to see the results of the action they just took.\r\n \r\nOther possible solutions:\r\n1. Allow accelerometer updates to continue in the background if the user gives permission.\r\n2. Pass in all accelerometer updates which occur when the watch face is off when the watch face comes back on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. When the watch face is on, get accelerometer updates using the startAccelerometerUpdatesToQueue method of CMMotionManager.\r\n\r\n2. When the watch face is off, record data using CMSensorRecorder.  The recorder is started once when a workout is started.\r\n\r\n3. Once the watch face is on again, poll the CMSensorRecorder until the data gap caused by the watch face is filled in.  Ignore gaps that are smaller than a set amount.  Through testing, I ignored gaps smaller than 3 seconds.  Getting the batch could take many retries, but when data finally came, the remaining gap was usually less than 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n4. Go back to using live data.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA continous stream of data for the watch to process whenever the watch face is on without a long wait time to continue processing when the watch face turns off and then back on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA continous stream of accelerometer data is returned, but there are delays of up to 3 minutes getting data from the CMSensorRecorder every time the watch face turns off and then back on.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWatch OS 2.2 & 2.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWatch OS 2.2\r\n iOS 9.3.1\r\nXCode 7.3 \r\n\r\nWatch OS 2.2.1\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\nXCode 7.3.1"
