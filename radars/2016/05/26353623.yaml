    description: "Summary:\r\niTMSTransporter metadata does not support localized strings for\r\nTestFlight, even though they are required.\r\n\r\nOur team has gone to the trouble of producing localized text and\r\nscreenshots for our app, which we upload via\r\niTMSTransporter. Unfortunately, a recent policy update requires that\r\nwe also submit localized text to match for our TestFlight builds\r\ninformation (url). We would like to either have the requirement relaxed, or\r\nadd the ability to upload localized TestFlight fields via\r\niTMSTransporter and avoid an error-prone manual process (or developing\r\nfragile screen-scraping tools).\r\n\r\nWe would very much like to support customers from China, India and\r\nEurope in our TestFlight cohorts, as would, presumably, other\r\ndevelopment organizations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpload a localized binary to iTunesConnect and attempt to release it without supplying localized text for \"What to test\". Cannot proceed. The metadata format specified for iTMSTransporter does not include a section for TestFlight information.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither allow TestFlight to continue without localized strings, or add the ability to upload localized strings for TestFlight as we currently do for the main product listing via the iTMSTransporter metadata xml file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TestFlightLocalization.jpg' was successfully uploaded."
