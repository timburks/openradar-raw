    description: "Summary:\r\nThis has bugged me for a long time but for some reason I don't think I've ever reported it before.\r\n\r\nWhen you download and launch a Developer ID signed application, Gatekeeper prompts you for permission to open and launch the app. If you say OK, yes, launch it, you get no feedback and remain staring at whatever app you were in when you launched it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure the System Preferences setting for Security & Privacy of app downloads is set to \"Allow apps from identified developers\".\r\n2. Download any Developer ID signed app e.g. https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/MarsEdit3.7.7.zip\r\n3. Double click the downloaded app from either Safari's download list or from the Finder.\r\n4. From the panel that is presented, asking permission to open the app, click \"Open\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should continue to open as it would were no intervening permission prompt presented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the prompt is dismissed, the app continues to launch in the background but the app from which it was launched, i.e. Safari or Finder, remains frontmost.\r\n\r\nThis is a recurring nuisance and a UX problem for naive users who aren't familiar with the concept of applications being launched but in the background. They are liable to think the app has simply failed to open, in contradiction to their having clicked the \"Open\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.4 (15E65) \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
