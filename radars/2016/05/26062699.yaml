    description: "Summary:\r\nAny enumeration cases imported from Swift to Objective C will not code complete unless they've been both used and compiled once in the context of existing Objective C code in the project. This limits the usefulness of code completion for such enumerations, especially since it's not uncommon for enumeration constants to be used only once in specific development workflows. The end result is you have to manually type out each enumeration case constant at least once.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached ImportedSwiftEnum sample project.\r\n2. Build once to ensure the first imported Swift enum constant, SwiftEnumFirstItem, is recognized by the autocompletion index.\r\n3. Click into the source file SomeObject.m and follow th directions in the comment, attempting to change the case from SwiftEnumFirstItem to SwiftEnumSecondItem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCode completion should assist with the change, offering any of the suitable name matches from the imported enum as possible completions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the enumeration case constants that have been encountered before in the project will be offered as completions.\r\n\r\nSee screen shot for more clarification and evidence of the completion shortcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3.1 (7D1012)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SomeObject_m_â€”_Edited.png' and 'ImportedSwiftEnum.zip' were successfully uploaded."
