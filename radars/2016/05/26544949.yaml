    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the mouse exits an NSView with a toolTip, it begins to fade out. If -[NSApplication hide:] is invoked while the tooltip is fading out, the tooltip becomes \"stuck\". When you return to the app it is still visible. The only way to get rid of it is to quit the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mouse over an NSView with a non-nil toolTip property\r\n2. Wait for the tooltip to become visible\r\n3. Move the mouse out of the view\r\n4. Invoke -[NSApplication hide:]\r\n5. Return the app with cmd-tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tooltip should not be visible after you return to the app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tooltip remains visible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing the attached test program, place your mouse over the red rectangle. Wait for the tooltip to appear. Move the mouse out of the red rectangle. Return to the app and you'll see the tooltip is permanently stuck.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2015 retina iMac, but this bug has been reproducible since at least 2012\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ToolTipBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
