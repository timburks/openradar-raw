    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the startAccelerometerUpdatesToQueue of CMMotionManager is called:\r\n\r\nDebug Builds (From XCode):\r\n\r\nAccelerometer Updates will continue even when the watch face is off.\r\n\r\nRelease Builds (AD-Hoc or Enterprise):\r\n\r\nAccelerometer Updates will stop when the watch face is off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a call to the startAccelerometerUpdatesToQueue of the CMMotionManager class.\r\n2. Print the resulting data to the console so it is easy to see when data is and isn't being collected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI believe the correct behavior is that accelerometer data updates should stop when the watch face is off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe most common behavior is listed below, but the behavior can vary.\r\n\r\nDebug Builds (From XCode):\r\n\r\nAccelerometer Updates will continue even when the watch face is off.\r\n\r\nRelease Builds (AD-Hoc, Enterprise, App Store(Haven't actually tried an App Store build)):\r\n\r\nAccelerometer Updates will stop when the watch face is off.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.2 & 2.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wasted a lot of time thinking my watch app was working because I got very consistent data when I was using builds created in XCode.  Once I put up builds using Enterprise distribution, my code completely broke because accelerometer data stopped when the watch face turned off.  This is a major time sink for developers since code using accelerometer updates can really only be tested using Release builds.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWatch OS 2.2\r\n iOS 9.3.1\r\nXCode 7.3 \r\n\r\nWatch OS 2.2.1\r\niOS 9.3.2\r\nXCode 7.3.1"
