        Summary:
        Search field input is cleared when switching from my Music to iTunes Store.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Go to my music. Try to find out whether you posses a specific song. You don’t, so the search results (I don’t have „searxch whole library checked) return empty. Well, let’s go to the iTunes Store and buy it there! Click on iTunes Store. Nothing in the search field. Why do you clear it when switching tabs?

        Expected Results:
        Text entered into the search field should be persistent. It’s also annoying that switching back from iTunes store to Music clears the search field.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
