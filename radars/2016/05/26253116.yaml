    description: "The maximum length of the host name and of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is 63 bytes per label and 255 bytes per FQDN. Note - Windows does not permit computer names that exceed 15 characters, and you cannot specify a DNS host name that differs from the NETBIOS host name.\r\n\r\nDNS limits the length of each label in RFC 1035 - however, that limit is actually 63. Both in RFC 1035 section 2.3.1 and as clarified in RFC 2181 section 11.\r\n \r\n http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035\r\n http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1\r\n http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-11\r\n \r\nOn OS X 10.11.4, running networksetup, version 1.8.2. It will NOT allow you to set computer hostname to more than 31 characters.\r\n\r\nFor example, this \"networksetup\" command can NOT set the Computer Name to 32 characters\r\n \t\r\nnetworksetup -setcomputername 01234567890123456789012345678901\r\n01234567890123456789012345678901 is NOT a valid computer name.\r\n** Error: The parameters were not valid.\r\n\r\nBut, a length of 31 characters or less will not generate the error and the computer name will be set properly.\r\n\r\nnetworksetup -setcomputername 0123456789012345678901234567890\r\n\r\nThis name is used by Apple Filing Protocol (AFP). AFP originally had a 31 character file limit so this could be the reason that you are unable to surpass the 31 character value, but might not be necessary anymore and could be removed."
