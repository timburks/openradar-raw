    description: "Summary:\r\nHomeKit should allow developers to check whether the user has granted Home Data permissions for the application. Currently there isn't a documented way to do so, and developers have to wait for HMErrorCode.HomeAccessNotAuthorized to see that the application is not authorized.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Perform some HomeKit operation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a property to check HomeKit permission without relying on an error - similar to `isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications` for notifications or `authorizationStatus()` for CLLocationManager\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOperation returns with error HMErrorCode.HomeAccessNotAuthorized. Only then the application knows Home Data access is not available\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, T-Mobile 64GB, using WiFi"
