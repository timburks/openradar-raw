    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nWhen drawing a string into a flipped view (e.g., via -[NSString drawInRect:withAttributes:]), any shadow attribute set via NSShadowAttributeName is ignored depending on a couple of factors, such as…\r\n\r\n- the string's contents\r\n- the string being truncated\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\nBuild and run the attached sample project, NSShadowAttributeNameTest, which draws the same strings with the exact same attributes into a custom view (top) and a flipped subclass instance (bottom).\r\n\r\n(Alternatively, instead of building the sample project, just have a look at the attached screenshot, missingshadows.png, which has all the relevant information.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nAll strings should be drawn with a green shadow in both views.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe non-flipped view behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nThe flipped view, however, skips the shadow for the emoji, as well as the truncated string. (Resizing the window to make the truncated string fit in its entirety makes its shadow appear.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nWhile emoji and other kinds of non-ASCII characters seem to trigger the bug directly, the ellipsis character doesn't appear to be the culprit in the truncated string's case, as demonstrated by the \"Not…truncated.\" test string.\r\n\r\nThis bug is new in OS X 10.11. (First spotted in 10.11.4, but it might have been around since 10.11.0.)\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\nSample project: <https://manytricks.com/radar/26554358/NSShadowAttributeNameTest.zip>\r\nScreenshot: <https://manytricks.com/radar/26554358/missingshadows.png>"
