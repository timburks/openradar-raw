    description: "Summary:\nThe “stack view” button in IB gives no indication it has clicked or worked, making it easy to inadvertently nest too many times.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Start building a UI, say something like the App Store view\n2. Decide to embed a label in a stack view. \n3. Click the stack view button.\n4. Do not see any menu or response.\n5. Click a view more times.\n\nExpected Results:\n- When I click the button, there should be some reaction (shadow, movement, menu). \n- Even better, when I click the button I should get a menu that lets me choose horizontal or vertical stack view\n\nActual Results:\nThere is no indication, so I click multiple times. Then I see my label nested in many stack views, instead of what I wanted which was just a single stack view with my label inside.\n\nRegression:\nNone.\n\nNotes:\nWe teach classes and see students struggle with this regularly. It is easy for us to fix but would be harder for new learners not in a guided class."
