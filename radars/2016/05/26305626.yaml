    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Content Filter extension is currently intended only for organizations with supervised devices, such as schools, who want to block certain content. It would make sense to allow individuals to install an on-demand content filter. This would be useful for many parents who would like to allow their children to safely surf the web, as well as people who would like to block certain types of traffic, for example, in order to be more focused at work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe only way to enable and configure a Content Filter is via configuration profiles on supervised devices.\r\nIt is, however, possible to configure the filter programmatically using NEFilterManager, but only in development builds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis enhancement would enable the installation and configuration of a content filter programmatically, using NEFilterManager. This would be almost identical to installing a personal VPN using NEVPNManager.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConfiguring the content filter programmatically using NEFilterManager fails in Release builds."
