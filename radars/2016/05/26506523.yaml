    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter using Message.app for a while, the app's icon in the Dock shows an unread badge count of 1, even though every thread in the application has been read (I checked, manually).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up Messages.app\r\n2. Receive some messages, reply to some messages.\r\n3. Receive a new message while Messages.app is in the background.\r\n4. Focus the app and click the unread message thread.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe unread badge count disappears when all threads are read.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe unread badge counts stays at \"1\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMessages Version 9.2 (5100)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes killing the Dock process while the app is open will clear the badge, but then it reappears persistently when the next message is received from someone."
