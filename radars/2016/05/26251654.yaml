        Summary:

        On iPad, if a new message compose view is brought up in slide over then you tap away from Messages, the slide it back over, the compose view cannot be dismissed.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Go to any app
        Bring the Messages app into slide over
        Tap the New Message button
        Tap away to get back to the original app
        Slide over Messages again
        Tap “Cancel”
        View won’t dismiss

        Press home button
        Open Messages
        Tap “Cancel”
        View won’t dismiss


        Expected Results:
        Pressing Cancel regardless of previous history of messing about with the app will always dismiss the compose view.

        Actual Results:
        Pressing Cancel does nothing.
