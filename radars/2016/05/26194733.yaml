    description: "Summary:\r\nMany people are experiencing 100% CPU usage when my app (MacID) scans for Bluetooth devices acting as a CBCentral using Core Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nI am not able to reproduce this myself but I have been asking my users to collect diagnostic reports to forward on to you. As a result I can't say for sure which versions of OS X are affected but you should be able to see from the reports.\r\n\r\nUsers are reporting that the system slows down to the point of being unusable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an affected Mac, set up a CBCentral to scan for all devices (do not scan for a specific CBUUID)\r\n2. Note that cfprefsd is consuming high amounts of CPU\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe system should not use 100% of CPU\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system uses 100% of CPU\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.4 (please see attached diagnostic reports also for other possible versions)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe it's related to the writing of preferences to the com.apple.bluetooth.plist file but I am not sure enough to say that for certain in the report. I have many more reports that the bug reporter won't allow me to upload, also."
