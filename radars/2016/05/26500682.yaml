    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using an alertView for text input, button actions dismiss the keyboard with a noticeable delay.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- present alertView (ensure alertView calls `addTextFieldWithConfigurationHandler`)\r\n- Use a button action on the alertView to complete input (ie. Save in example project)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKeyboard should dismiss immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKeyboard dismisses after a 1-3 second delay (ie, on dealloc)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing the return key on the keyboard has the expected result, only dismissing via the alert actions shows the delay. \r\n\r\nhere's another illustration of someone with the same issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26161796/how-to-dismiss-an-uialertcontroller-and-the-keyboard-simultaneously\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iOS\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AlertExample.zip' was successfully uploaded."
