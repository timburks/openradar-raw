    description: "Both AppKit and UIKit provide a series of constants (introduced in OS X 10.11 and iOS 8.2) called NSFontWeightXXX and UIFontWeightXXX. AppKit and UIKit internally retrieve these values from a series of constants exported from the CoreText framework (kCTFontWeightXXX).\r\n\r\nHowever, the CoreText constants are not provided in the CoreText headers despite actually existing. This creates an inconvenience for cross platform code using these values since two implementations must be provided for OS X, and UIKit platforms (iOS, tvOS).\r\n\r\nPlease document the CoreText constants and provide them publicly in the CoreText headers."
