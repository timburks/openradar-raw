        Imagine the most generic and standard UITableView storyboard:
        - ScreenOne has a UITableView for showing items.
        - ScreenTwo is a detail view for an item.
        - Rig up a push segue from the UITableViewCell on ScreenOne to the UIViewController of ScreenTwo.

        Run this, tap on a cell, and ScreenTwoâ€™s detail view pushes over as expected; great.

        Very rarely, when the OS is a bit bogged down (ie. the CPU is under heavy load), if you tap the cell on ScreenOne once, twice, multiple times; it takes a small moment for UIkit to react, and when it does, *several* ScreenTwo instances get pushed onto the nav stack.

        (see attached video for a live app example; or this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5fFdmKNrKU )

        This can be remediated by preventing user interaction on the table view or cell after the first tap; but this is a crude workaround.
