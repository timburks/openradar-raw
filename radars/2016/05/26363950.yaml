        Summary:
        Often a label dynamically adjusts font size to fit smaller frames on smaller screens or longer texts.
        This often makes layout look bad for different labels that should have same font size.
        It was nice if one could set a constraint of "same font size" for 2 labels, so if one shrinks to fit it will shrink the other label's font as well.

        BTW it would be awesome if this would always work for attributed strings.
