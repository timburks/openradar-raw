    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UITableView with autosizing cells, sometimes when using animated updates UITableView will call cellForRowAtIndexPath with an invalid (out of range) indexPath.\r\nThe attached project demonstrates the issue in a 100% reproducible way. The codepath is a bit contrived but the issue also frequently appears in the wild in an app that uses animated updates a lot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nKey points are :\r\n- use autosizing cells\r\n- have cells off-screen whose exact height is not computed\r\n- delete a cell in that off-screen range, and delete the following section, causing the updated range to come on-screen\r\n- call endUpdates\r\nas a result, UITableView tries to recompute the height for an indexPath that is now invalid, causing cellForRowAtIndexPath to be called with an invalid index after endUpdates has been called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncellForRowAtIndexPath: should never be called with an indexPath not in the range defined by the data source after endUpdates has been called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncellForRowAtIndexPath: is called with an indexPath not in the range defined by the data source after endUpdates has been called\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditional comments and a workaround are included in the demo project\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iOS device, the attached project is guaranteed to work on an iPhone 6 sized screen\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TableUpdatesCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded."
