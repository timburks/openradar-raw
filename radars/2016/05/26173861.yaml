    description: "Summary:\r\nI updated 13 apps on my phone (Uber, Eat 24, Evernote, Orderahead, Speedtest, Postmates, Pocket, Overcast, Shyp, Zillow, Giphy keyboard, Strava and Tweetbot 4) using the \"Update All\" button from the App Store and then they wouldn't make it past the launch screen, including the keyboard, it just won't display anymore even though it's in my selected keyboard list. This was fixed by restarting the phone. Force quitting the applications didn't change the behavior.\r\n\r\nThe device console output is attached for each open/crash process. No crash reports were generated from these crashes.\r\n\r\nDoesn't seem to reproduce after ever update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Update applications\r\n2. Open application from home screen or spotlight search results\r\n3. Witness launch screen for split second\r\n4. Witness crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that apps to open and not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps show launch screen and then crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, unlocked on AT&T, iOS 9.3.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Console_output_when_opening_Strava.m', 'Tweetbot_console_output__for_posterity_.m', 'Console_output_for_Uber.m', 'Overcast_console_output.m' and 'Console_output_from_opening_OrderAhead.m' were successfully uploaded."
