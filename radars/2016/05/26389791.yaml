    description: "Summary:\rThe documentation and header comments of NSOrderedSet state that the array and set properties return proxy objects that mirror the contents of the underlying ordered set and changes to that set will be reflected in said proxy objects. This does not work as expected in Swift since the returned objects are of the standard Swift Array and Set types.\r\rSteps to Reproduce:\rIn Swift: create an NSMutableOrderedSet, retrieve the “proxy” array/set objects, mutate the original ordered set.\r\rExpected Results:\rThe proxy array/set objects should reflect the changes made to the original ordered set.\r\rActual Results:\rThe proxy array/set objects are not updated.\r\rRegression:\rThis appears to be a difference between Swift and Objective-C that the documentation does not disclose.\r\rNotes:\rThe attached playground demonstrates the problem."
