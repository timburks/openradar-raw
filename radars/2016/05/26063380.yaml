    description: "Summary:\r\nThe CopySwiftLibs phase unfortunately takes several seconds to complete, and runs far more often than it should practically need to run. The result is a cumulative waste of many minutes when iterating over repeated builds of a project. This is particularly noticeable when doing quick unit testing iterations, and particulary frustrating when the rebuilt code doesn't even involve Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Swift project, or even an Objective C project with a target whose \"Contains embedded Swift\" build setting is set to true.\r\n2. Build once, and observe that the \"CopySwiftLibs\" build phase runs to install the necessary Swift libraries in the built project.\r\n3. Build again without making any changes, and observe that the phase is NOT run again.\r\n4. Make ANY trivial change to any file in the target and rebuild. For example add a space to an Objective C .m file in a target that happens to include/embed Swift content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCopySwiftLibs should be smart enough to only run when there is some expectation that the previously installed Swift libraries are out of date.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCopySwiftLibs runs when virtually any change, to virtually any target that embeds Swift code is made.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 7.3.1 (7D1012)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2014 edition 15\"\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
