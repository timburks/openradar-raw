        Summary:
        The `minBounds` field of the `boundingBox` property of `MDLVoxelArray` holds nonsensical values.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open the attached playground

        Expected Results:
        The bounds of a 1x2x3 box should, after conversion to voxels, be roughly equal to the original bounding box expanded by about half the voxel dimension.

        Actual Results:
        Original asset bounds: min:(-0.5, -1.0, -1.5) max:(0.5, 1.0, 1.5)
        voxelArray.boundingBox min:(-3.30828, -3.30828, -3.30828) max:(0.622759, 1.03655, 1.65724)

        Notice the min values are all equal and are not related (in any obvious way) to the input geometry.

        If the voxels are enumerated and  a bounding box calculated the result is:
        Calculated bounding box = min:(-0.618621, -1.03241, -1.6531) max:(0.622759, 1.03655, 1.65724)

        Occurs on iOS 9.x and OS X 10.11.x
