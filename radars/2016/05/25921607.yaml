    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the Safari View Controller is contained in a container view controller that is set as its delegate, the container view controller will deallocate before the Safari View Controller can finish sending it a safariViewControllerDidFinish: message, after swiping to dismiss. Pressing the done button works properly, but swiping causes the container view controller to deallocate before the transition can complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open sample project in Xcode.\r\n2. Set a breakpoint on line 55 (safariViewControllerDidFinish:) of the ContainerViewController.m file.\r\n3. Run application on device or simulator.\r\n4. Tap the \"Present Safari View Controller\" button.\r\n5. Dismiss the Safari View Controller by swiping from the left edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe safariViewControllerDidFinish: should be called after the swipe to dismiss transition completes. The breakpoint should be hit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe safariViewControllerDidFinish: is not called after the swipe to dismiss transition completes. The breakpoint is not hit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.3.2 (13F61)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s 64 GB T-Mobile, using Wi-Fi\r\n\r\nSample Code:\r\nhttps://github.com/sqwerl/safariviewcontrollerbugs"
