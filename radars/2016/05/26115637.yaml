        Summary:
        When you look up a character in the character viewer, and it’s type-able on your current keyboard layout, it should tell you the key equivalent.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Desire a certain character, like ®, in your writing.
        2. Open the Keyboard Viewer and hold Shift, Option, and Shift-Option to see if you can find the right glyph.
        3. Get tired of searching and just bring up the Character panel. This is the full-size character panel, not the new little one.
        4. Search for “registered”
        5. Get curious about how you would type it more quickly next time.

        Expected Results:
        Along with the Unicode and UTF-8 representations that are listed in the Character panel, it would list the key combination Option-R.

        Actual Results:
        No keyboard shortcut is listed.

        Regression:
        none

        Notes:
        none
