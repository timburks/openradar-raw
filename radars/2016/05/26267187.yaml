    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to automate my companies app, which contains a collection view. I've noticed that when I query the number of cells in the collection view, it returns the incorrect number. In the attached screenshot, you'll see that the app displays \"5 Cells Found\", however Xcode only sees 3 of them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen an app that has CollectionView cells where some are off screen. Query the number of collectionview cells in the Xcode debugger\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode prints out the correct number of cells\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode prints out an incorrect number of cells\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Simulator: Version 9.3 (SimulatorApp-645.9)\r\nXcode Version 7.3.1 (7D1014)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue prevents me (and I'm sure many others around the world) from automating our app correctly. If you simply google \"UI Testing in Xcode collectionview cell count incorrect\" you'll see many others complaining about the issue.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X 10.11.2\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2016-05-13 at 10.03.18 AM.png' was successfully uploaded."
