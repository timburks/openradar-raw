    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile an accessory is connected to the iphone, if you change the language of the iphone, the accessory is unware of any change, and does not proceed through authentication again.\r\nAfter this, if an app looks at the EAAccessoryManager for connected accessories, even though the accessory is physically connected, it does not appear in the list of connected accessories.\r\nNot all accessories do this.\r\n\r\nIt's possible the accessories use different USB modes, where one is a USB device, and the other is USB host, and that causes the phone to not send a reset or do a reset.  I find that automotive head units have this problem with the phone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Connect an accessory that uses USB as a transport, but the accessory is the USB host.\r\n2.  Observe in an app that the accessory is detected by the EA Framework.\r\n3.  Change the language of the phone to any other language.\r\n4.  Observe in an app that the accessory is NOT detected by the EA Framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe EA Framework will always detect any accessories physically connected to the phone, bluetooth or USB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter changing the language of the phone, the EAAccessoryManager does not show any accessories in the list of connectedAccessories, even though the accessory is physically connected.\r\n\r\nMy speculation is because the accessory acts as a USB host, where another accessory that does not have this problem, the Apple device is the USB host.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n iOS 9.3.1 (13E238)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis always reproduces with automotive head units.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6s (Model: MKQX2LL/A), iOS 9.3.1 (13E238), although this has been observed on multiple phones as far back as iOS7"
