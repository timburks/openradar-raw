        Under Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Speech the user is able to set a default speed for the text to speech feature. This option should be readable from inside an application, so that an app is able to - in case this feature is on - configure an AVSpeechSynthesizer to sound exactly the same as the accessibility speech to text feature.

        Currently, such an API does not exist.

        Another approach could be that when setting -[AVSpeechUtterance rate] to AVSpeechUtteranceDefaultSpeechRate, this is no longer a hard coded value of 0.5, but instead adjusts to the users preferred speed. This is a duplicate of rdar://26136891
