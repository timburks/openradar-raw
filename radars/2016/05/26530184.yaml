    description: "Summary:\nThe MDLAsset method\n\npublic func exportAssetToURL(URL: NSURL) -> Bool\n\nwill return true even if it fails to produce an output file. Similarly the method will not throw when it fails to produce a file\n\npublic func exportAssetToURL(URL: NSURL, error: ()) throws\n\nThis bugs could lead to user data loss.\n    \nSteps to Reproduce:\n1) Run the attached playground\n2) Observe that when the export URL is to an existing directory the export succeeds as expected. When an attempt is made to export to a non-existent directory the method still returns true, but no output is produced. The playground tests for this condition and calls fatalError()\n\nExpected Results:\nIf the export fails, the non-throwing method should return false and  the throwing method should throw an error. \n\nActual Results:\nThe method returns true (or does not throw) even when it fails to produce output.\n\nRegression:\nThe problem occurs on OS X 10.11.4 and also on iOS 9.3."
