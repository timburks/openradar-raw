        Summary:
        As I write this, my iMac fans are spinning loudly. I launched Activity Monitor, and found SourceKitService taking upwards of 98% CPU, and never dropping down. I took a spindump, to help you diagnose it. Iâ€™ve noticed other Xcode-related daemons behaving similarly over the last few days.
