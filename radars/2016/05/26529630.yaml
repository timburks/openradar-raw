    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Mac App Store sometimes shows download progress numbers as “NaN GB of NaN GB” instead of showing real numbers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI don’t know of any particular steps to reproduce this, other than to say it shows up under the app update progress bar. Not sure about the “installation” progress bar under the Purchased tab. I’ve included a screen recording of a case where I did reproduce it, but it just seems to happen some times and not others. I’ve seen others tweet about it. A Twitter search turned up two recent ones, for example: https://twitter.com/jaytennier/status/733662932798734336 and https://twitter.com/joshdee_52/status/734080911348637698\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe label under the progress bar while updating apps shows only non-negative real numbers of bytes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe label sometimes shows NaN GB.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems fairly recent, in Mac App Store years - maybe within the last year? But hard to say for sure.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve attached a screen recording, also posted here: http://cl.ly/gIz7"
