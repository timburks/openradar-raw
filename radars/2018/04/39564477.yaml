    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using Contacts.app to edit a contact saved in an Office 365 Enterprise account that was copied from the company's GAL, the contact is somewhat corrupted and contact's details are lost.\r\nThis issue is always reproducible but is triggered only when \"Show contacts Siri found in apps\" is enabled in Contacts.app's preferences and there is at least an e-mail address found by Siri for that contact.\r\nPlease see attached screen recordings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure an Office 365 Enterprise account in System Preferences.app as an Exchange account.\r\n2. Open Contacts.app.\r\n3. Select the Office 365 account's Global Address List in the Directory section.\r\n4. Search for a contact and drag and drop it in the Office 365 account's contacts.\r\n5. Select the contact in the Office 365 contact list and click the Edit button.\r\n6. Edit, add or remove a contact's field.\r\n7. Click the Done button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContact should be edited as intended.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContact's details are lost.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.5 (17F45c)\r\nContacts.app 11.0 (1808.7)\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nApril 19 2018, 5:19 PM\r\n\r\nAfter more research I found that the issue is not related to the Office 365 GAL but it's triggered even by editing contacts created directly in the Office 365 account with the \"New contact\" menu. The requirement is that there needs to be at least an e-mail address found by Siri for that contact."
