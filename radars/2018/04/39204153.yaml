    description: "NetworkExtensions documentation lacks information about which extensions only work on supervised devices.\r\n\r\nFor example, nowhere does it say that NEDNSProxyManager / NEDNSProxyProvider are only available on supervised devices. However, if you open logs from the development device here's what you see:\r\n\r\n-[NEHelperConfigurationManager:562  Warning: allowing creation/modification of a DNS proxy configuration on non-supervised device because the requesting app (poc-dns-ios) is a development version. This will not be allowed for the production version of poc-dns-ios\r\n\r\nDocumentation should clearly state whether an extension does or does not work on non-supervised devices."
