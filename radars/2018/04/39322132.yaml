    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a Mac running macOS 10.13.4 attempts to capture a NetRestore image, it consistently fails during the System.dmg block checksum step with error 2. Issue occurs with multiple source Macs and multiple 10.13.4 capture Macs. macOS 10.13.3 SIU is able to capture the same Macs for NetRestore without error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Boot a source Mac with desired custom configuration in Target Disk Mode and attach it to a Mac running macOS 10.13.4.\r\n2. Open System Image Utility.\r\n3. Configure SIU to create a NetRestore image using the source Mac.\r\n4. Observe failed block checksum and error code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNetRestore image should be created at target path using source Mac's filesystem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSIU fails block checksum of System.dmg file created from source Mac (failure occurs at very end of block checksum step), ends sequence with error 2, then deletes System.dmg.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nBoth the source Mac and the Mac running SIU are running macOS 10.13.4 (17E199). System Image Utility version is 10.13 (829).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSource Mac has a fresh install of macOS 10.13.4 with a local admin account created in Setup Assistant."
