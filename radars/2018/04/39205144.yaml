    description: "Device testing is the most common and natural way to use through the development, and most of the iOS developers use their own phones to run the apps. This phones go to sleep, are used for taking phone calls, etc, so the debugger session, when you run an app on it from Xcode end. When this happens, Xcode displays the following requester and jumps its icon:\r\n\r\n„Lost connection to <phone name>”\r\n\r\nThis requester has to be OK’d before you can continue your development process. This requester is very disturbing. I think it’s necessary to inform the developer about the connection loss, but in a less intrusive way – and exactly that’s what notifications are for.\r\n\r\nPlease change the „Lost connection” alert to a system notification!"
