    description: "Area:\r\nHome App\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe HomeKit camera preview image is black in the HomeApp instead of showing the photo. Tapping the camera and entering the live feed works fine. It is only the preview image that is broken. The image appears black both on the favourites screen and in the room. See attached image. The issue can be resolved temporarily by rebooting the device and the problem returns again after a few days of Home app use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a HomeKit camera to the home app.\r\nLaunch the Home app several times for several days.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCamera preview image should be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCamera preview image does not appear and instead a black image is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 and earlier\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLogiCircle 2 wired camera\r\niPhone 6s iOS 11.3"
