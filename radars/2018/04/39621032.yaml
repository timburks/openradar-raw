    description: "Summary:\r\nFetching data from the remote server using Data(contentsOf:) on Ubuntu does not work in comparison to macOS, where the same line of code works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Swift 4.1-RELEASE snapshot on Linux (in my case it was Ubuntu 17.10)\n2. Open Swift REPL (in my case I needed a correct path for linker as well, `swift -I /usr/include/clang/4.0.1/include`)\n3. Type in the REPL \n```\nimport Foundation\n```\n4. Type in the REPL \n```\nData(contentsOf: URL(string: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSundell/MarathonTestScriptWithDependencies/master/Script.swift\")!, options: .alwaysMapped)\n```\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the function to fetch the data and return it to me. If there is a problem on Linux, I’d expect it to throw an error as the function is already marked as `throwing`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt just returns an empty Data with length=0. On macOS it works as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAfter further investigation the problem is also in `NSData(contentsOfFile:)` and a family, on which `Data(contentsOf:)` relies (based on the open-sourced core-libs-foundation). The line below:\n\n```\nNSData(contentsOfFile: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSundell/MarathonTestScriptWithDependencies/master/Script.swift\", options: .alwaysMapped)\n```\n\nreturns an error that doesn’t really say much to me:\n```\n$E0: Foundation.NSError = {\n  Foundation.NSObject = {}\n  _domain = \"NSPOSIXErrorDomain\"\n  _code = 2\n  _userInfo = nil\n}\n```"
