It is very useful to replace its function with touchbar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdd API to IMK for touchbar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough there is private API for touchbar, it cannot use from normal input methods. \r\nIt requires app-extension version of inputmethod, but it also is private and undocumented feature.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra / 10.13.4 (17E199)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
