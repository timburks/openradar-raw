    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary: On iOS 11, initializing an AVURLAsset with a URL that will respond with status 403 (I've only tried that status, I don't know about other 4xx status codes), the status on the AVPlayerItem does not change to failed. This is a regression, as in iOS 9 and iOS 10, the AVPlayerItem using that asset would enter the failed state and have a non-nil error (although one with an inscrutable error code). On the iOS 11 simulator, there appears to be a deadlock in the network stack. I've attached the backtrace for that case. On an iOS 11 device, I see the following in the console, but again the AVPlayerItem does not enter the failed state or report an error. The following error appears in the debug console:\r\n\r\n2018-04-06 17:04:27.906833-0400 Play One Video[329:44494] CredStore - performQuery - Error copying matching creds.  Error=-25300, query={\r\n    class = inet;\r\n    \"m_Limit\" = \"m_LimitAll\";\r\n    \"r_Attributes\" = 1;\r\n    sync = syna;\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached project. It has a URL that responds with 403.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn error reflecting HTTP status, but I'd settle for the same error as iOS 9/10:\r\nError Domain=AVFoundationErrorDomain Code=-11800 \"The operation could not be completed\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=The operation could not be completed, NSUnderlyingError=0x14e94230 {Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=403 \"(null)\"}, NSLocalizedFailureReason=An unknown error occurred (403)}\r\n\r\n(on simulator it's different)\r\nError Domain=AVFoundationErrorDomain Code=-11800 \"The operation could not be completed\" UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x7f9aecd8faf0 {Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-12643 \"(null)\"}, NSLocalizedFailureReason=An unknown error occurred (-12643), NSLocalizedDescription=The operation could not be completed}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayer is dead to me. No way to detect.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 (15E216)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nModel: iPhone 6s Plus\r\nVersion 10.0 (SimulatorApp-851.2 CoreSimulator-518.19)"
