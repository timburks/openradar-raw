    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 11.1, users wanting to delete a single cookie, or single site's cookies (e.g. appleid.apple.com) are forced to remove all cookies for a whole domain (e.g. apple.com includes apple.com, appleid.apple.com, developer.apple.com)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to multiple sites under the same parent domain (e.g. developer.apple.com, apple.com, appleid.apple.com)\n2. Open Safari > Preferences > Privacy\n3. Click on \"Manage Website Data...\"\n4. Search for (e.g. \"apple.com\")\n5. You can only remove all of (e.g. \"apple.com\")\nIt would be beneficial to be able to select all cookies that are in (e.g. developer.apple.com), but not in (e.g. appleid.apple.com)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAbility to delete cookies in the (e.g. appleid.apple.com, developer.apple.com, and apple.com) separately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly able to delete all cookies that fall under the parent domain: \"apple.com\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
