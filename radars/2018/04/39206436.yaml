    description: "Refer the following gist for the sample:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/alex-swiftify/76147f7386e9d693a82de4adf0feab58\r\n\r\nThe `thisIsBuggy()` function uses relatively simple additive expressions and fails to compile with \"expression was too complex ...\" error:\r\nhttp://take.ms/Ud4Wu\r\n\r\nSimply extracting `x` and `y` parameters of CGPoint into separate variables solves the problem (see `thisIsTheFix ()` method).\r\n\r\nSeems to be a known issue:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29707622/swift-compiler-error-expression-too-complex-on-a-string-concatenation\r\n\r\n... however, I'm reporting this specific case as suggested on Stack Overflow to help Apple Developers, since I'm reading the following:\r\n```\r\nOn the Dev forums, Chris Lattner has asked people to file these errors as radar reports, because they are actively working on fixing them.\r\n```"
