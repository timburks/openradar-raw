    description: "I use an Apple iPhone 7 and Endomondo to track my runs and when cycling. Since updating to iOS 11 in Sep 2017 the tracks for my runs are extremely incorrect. At the same time, other activities like cycling and driving have nearly perfect tracks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis issue occurs whenever I run and track my workout with various apps. Tested with Endomondo, RunKeeper, Strava. If I cycle, the tracks are almost perfect.\r\n\r\nTested in various locations over a 6-month period. None of the updates for iOS fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRunning tracks should be as accurate as cycling tracks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRunning tracks are inaccurate, skipping turns and having huge jumps in the data.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SXmZp\r\niOS 11.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple iPhone 7, plastic case. The same case was used prior to iOS 11. The runs are usually in an open park without any nearby buildings or other obstructions."
