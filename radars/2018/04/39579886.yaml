    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode's plist editor seems to be using 3 separate code paths when it comes to drag-and-drop behaviors. The result is confusing enough that the top StackOverflow results for \"xcode plist editor reorder\" make claims such as \"You can move an entry by grabbing the right side and moving it up, you just can't move it down.\" (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13196834/230615), or \"edit a plist file with an text editor\" (https://stackoverflow.com/a/11225155/230615).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached for the 3 behaviors. The first two screen captures (\"bug-1.gif\" and \"bug-2.gif\") demonstrate the problems. The third (\"not-a-bug.gif\") demonstrates that some of the plist editor's behaviors are correct.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Expect there to be a clear affordance for drag-reordering rows\r\n- Expect to be able to drag vertically for any reordering\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- There's no visual affordance suggesting that one column is draggable while the others aren'tâ€¦not even a change of cursor.\r\n- Reordering \"Items\" requires a horizontal drag\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n[Note for OpenRadar: The animated gifs attached to the bug can be seen in my answer to this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11224938/change-item-order-in-plist-file]"
