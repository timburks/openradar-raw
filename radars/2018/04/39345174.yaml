    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn an iPad, if you present an SFSafariViewController from a view controller that was presented with the presentation style .formSheet, then when the user taps 'Done' on the SFSafariViewController then there is a bug with the dismiss animation; the Form Sheet view controller will briefly appear in full screen before correctly resizing to a Form Sheet size. This results in a jarring back animation when leaving the SFSafariViewController.\r\n\r\nSample project is available here: https://github.com/asos-dylanslewis/SFSafariViewControllerDoneBug\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- On an iPad, present a view controller where the modalPresentationStyle is formSheet\r\n- On the presented view controller, present an SFSafariViewController\r\n- When the page has loaded, tap 'Done' on the SFSafariViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The SFSafariViewController is popped and the Form Sheet view controller is always shown at a form sheet size (in the middle of the screen)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The SFSafariViewController is popped and the Form Sheet view controller is briefly shown at the size of the entire screen, before flashing to the correct form sheet size (in the middle of the screen).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.x"
