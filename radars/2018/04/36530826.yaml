    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using new colour assets introduced in iOS 11 in an IB document (XIB or Storyboard), we aren't able to programmatically alter those colours at runtime. Because the system treats those colours as traits, they get re-applied to the element whenever it's laid out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a sample project, with a Storyboard an and Asset Catalog.\r\n* Add a red colour to the asset catalog, and call it \"MyDefaultBackground\".\r\n* Set the background of the main View Controller in the Storyboard to \"MyDefaultBackground\".\r\n* In viewDidLoad of the main View Controller, change the background of the view to anything else, e.g. green.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe background colour of the view is changed to green and stays that way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view remains \"MyDefaultBackground\" red, because UITraitCollection appears to enforce this colour to be re-applied when the view is laid out.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11, Xcode 9.2"
