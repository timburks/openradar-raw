    description: "According to the App Store Review Guidelines:\r\n4.5.4 Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used for advertising, promotions, or direct marketing purposes or to send sensitive personal or confidential information.\r\n\r\nDespite this being a long-standing App Store guideline, many developers continue to regularly disregard the requirement and send Push Notifications encouraging the user to open the app [1]. By most definitions, that is 'advertising' or 'promotions' and rarely do users want this. That creates a poor user experience for the platform.\r\n\r\nHowever, there does not exist any kind of dedicated feedback mechanism (for users or developers) to report violations of this rule to Apple. Such a mechanism would promote enforcement and lead to a better platform experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nSome ideas here include:\r\n-An integrated OS-based mechanism for users to report offending Push Notifications to Apple\r\n-A privacy setting that signals the user's desired exposure to these kinds of Push Notifications to developers (perhaps defined as 'user-specific- and non-user-specific notifications'). This could be modeled similarly to pre-iOS 10 Limit Ad Tracking behavior (i.e. a Settings.app option coupled with a developer confirmation screen to respect the setting, shown during App Submission).\r\n\r\n[1] Real-world example: https://twitter.com/joshavant/status/990321480234864645"
