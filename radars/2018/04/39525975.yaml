    description: "Area:\r\nMDM\r\n\r\nA supervised device should be able to skip all new Setup Assistant screens and Update Completed screens/dialogs. Using ScheduleOSUpdate a supervised device can be updated to current or specific iOS versions remotely but then any new setup screens are displayed (i.e. Privacy in iOS 11.3). At device setup (during DEP activation or using Apple Configurator) any and all Setup Assistant screens can be skipped (skip_setup_items), when upgrading between iOS versions new screens are displayed. This is an undesired experience for novice users in educational and other environments where these prompts may be displayed to inexperienced/novice users."
