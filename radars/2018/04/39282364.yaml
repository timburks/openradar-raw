    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThere is a mismatch between player item duration and the full loaded time range \r\nof AVPlayerItem while streaming HLS and the network is poor. KVO-ing on duration clearly shows duration switching mid stream but the loaded time Range never satisfies that requirement. Due to this, `isPlaybackBufferFull` and `isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp` and never flipped to true resulting in infinite stall.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on NLC on iOS/mac OS.\r\n2. Setup KVO for AVPlayerItem duration, loadedTimeRange, isPlaybackBufferFull and isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp\r\n3. Play the HLS Stream using AVPlayer.\r\n4. Observe how duration switches midway. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nloadedTimeRanges should add up to the net duration of the item and there shouldn't be an infinite stall. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey don't match which results in player item trying to load forever.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 / Xcode 9.3(9E145)"
