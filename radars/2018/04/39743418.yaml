    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider a two-monitor configuration, primary and secondary. When a full-screen application is running on the secondary display, and I enter Mission Control and then open an application. The secondary display moves back to the first desktop space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) connect a secondary display, and put an application into fullscreen on it\r\n2) enter Mission Control\r\n3) on the primary display, open an application or minimised window from the Dock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe secondary display should return from Mission Control back to the same space (full screen application) that it was in before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe secondary display switches to the first desktop space.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.5 Beta (17F45c)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) - internal display and secondary display. This would probably also happen with three or more displays connected (e.g. have a third display also in a full screen application space), but I can't test this."
