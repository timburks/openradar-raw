    description: "iTunes Connect doesn't have an `apple-touch-icon` set up in its <head>. Because of that, there is no image shown when `itunesconnect.apple.com` is used as a bookmark in Safari. \r\n\r\nSafari users expect to see appropriate images on their bookmarked websites, and it's unusual that an Apple website doesn't support this."
