    description: "Summary:\r\nExample App: PDF Viewer by PSPDFKit\n\nWhen changing the language of the scheme in Xcode and launch the app, the app is localized correctly, however, the iOS 11 Document Browser, which is integrated into the app, is not localized correctly and instead uses the System Language, which is defined in the .GlobalPreferences.plist file.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Edit the scheme in Xcode and change the Application Language to DE for example\n2. Launch the app\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth the app and the document browser in the app should be localized in German.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the app is localized in German, but the document browser is still using English.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.4b\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe’ve tried several workaround but nothing seems to fix this. It’s also a big issue when using Fastlane’s automated snapshot tool to generate screenshots for the App Store in various languages, because all the screenshots are localized properly, except for one of the document browser integration.\n\nPlease see the attached video showing this issue."
