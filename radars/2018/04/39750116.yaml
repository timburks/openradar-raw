    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen playing items in AVQueuePlayer and while connected to AirPlay only first item added ever changes it's status to `readyToPlay`. \r\nDisconnecting AirPlay immediately updates the item status to proper value. \r\nAt the same time status of the player itself doesn't change as the `currentItem` changes. It simply keeps the state from when the first item's been added.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add multiple items to the player queue\r\n2. Observe `status` changes of the player's `currentItem`\r\n3. Observe player status\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Status of the `AVQueuePlayer` changes to reflect its `currentItem` status\r\n- Status of every enqueued `AVPlayerItem` updates properly to `readyToPlay` \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Status of `AVQueuePlayer` changes only as first item is enqueued\r\n- Status of items added to the queue starting from the second one doesn't ever change while connected to AirPlay\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 (15E216) as well as 11.3.1 (15E302)\r\ntvOS 11.3 (15L211)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've included modified AVFoundationQueuePlayer demo project with AirPlay support, with resources changed to ones at - https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/ - as old streams are no longer accessible due to expired SSL certificate."
