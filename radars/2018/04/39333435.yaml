    description: "Summary:\r\nI am encountering a bug in UITextView's (default?) handling of tabs that causes lines containing them to wrap prematurely. This becomes a problem when trying to use them to line text up, and is confusing to the end user. Notice that this paragraph wraps at the edges of the view controller, because the UITextView is constrained to the edges.\r\n\r\nA sentence can have normal spaces, and will wrap as expected, unless it contains a tab character, which causes it to wrap after a certain point.\r\n\r\nIf the tab appears early on in the sentence (before the point at which the wrapping occurs), the tab character will display as expected.\r\n\r\nI have looked into trying to resolve this issue with the layout manager and delegates, but I'm not sure how to alter this behaviour without turning off wrapping altogether, which is obviously not a reasonable solution in all situations (especially for user content)."
