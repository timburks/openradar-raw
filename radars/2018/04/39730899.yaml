    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn iMessage: While selecting individual messages in a conversation (after long press and selecting \"more...\"), if a new message arrives (or even the \"they are typing\" bubbles show up), your selected messages are cleared in memory while appearing to still be selected in the UI. When delete is clicked, nothing happens aside from exiting message selection mode. Furthermore, the messages that HAD been selected can now no longer be selected for deleting if this process is repeated. The selected/not selected status of each message seems to be reset if a different conversation is selected and then going back into the conversation being worked in earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open iMessage on two iOS devices.\r\n* Send device 1 a number of messages from device 2. Five should do it.\r\n* While viewing the conversation on device 1, tap and hold message #5. (Although it really doesn't matter which one is selected first.)\r\n* The popup box with \"COPY / MORE...\" pops up. Select MORE...\r\n* The conversation goes into message selection mode with the first selected message pre-checked.\r\n* Select an additional message (although this bug is reproduceable without selecting an additional message.)\r\n* On device 2, send an additional message to device 1. Wait for it to arrive on device 1.\r\n* Back on device 1, you will now see the newly received message below the selected message(s).\r\n* On device 1, tap the trash can icon to try to delete the selected message(s).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the selected message(s) to be deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the trash can icon is tapped, the conversation leaves message selection mode but the message(s) are not deleted. Further, if go back into message selection mode, the message(s) previously selected will be pre-selected but you are unable to deselect or re-select. And if you try to delete the messages again, you are unable to unless you exit this conversation and go back in.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 9 through current (11.3). Possibly earlier. This bug has existed for a long time."
