    description: "Summary:\r\nMy iPhone 6 was off for months. I havenâ€™t used it and it was turned off. I did buy an iPhone 8.\n\nNow I powered ON the iPhone 6 to wipe it. I wanted to do this with Find My iPhone. But the iPhone 6 does not appear online on FMi on my iPhone 8. The iPhone 6 is asking for my iCloud pass in the settings screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable iCloud and Find My iPhone\n2. Turn iPhone off for months (not sure how long, mine was off for 4 months)\n3. Turn iPhone on again\n4. Check Find My iPhone on another device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone should appear in the FMi list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPhone does not appear online in the FMi list\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI cannot wipe the iPhone remotely. So my iPhone might be in malicious hands, and they might be able to access my data."
