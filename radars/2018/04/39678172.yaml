    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen setting a new `tableHeaderView` on `UITableView` inside an animation block the cells are animated off-screen, but cells that will be off-screen after the animation completes are removed before the animation starts.\r\n\r\nIn the sample I change the frame of the `tableHeaderView` and set the new (updated) `tableHeaderView` inside an animation block. \r\n\r\nSee video and sample attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample.\r\n2. Tap `Change tableHeaderView size.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe frame change of `tableHeaderView` is animated. The cells move to the bottom.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe last cell just disappears without animation. Does only happen if the cell would be completely off-screen after animation finishes.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.3 (15E217)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
