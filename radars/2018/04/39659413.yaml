    description: "Summary:\r\nthread_local does not work for Objective-C classes with ARC but works when:\n\n- we use MRR\n- we wrap it into a simple C++ class\n\nThis seems like an arbitrary restriction, as managing the C++ class is probably even more complex, lifetime-wise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen sample. Run. Observe everything works. Uncomment\n\n// Does not compile\n//static thread_local NSNumber *testARCVariable;\n\nObserve error: thread-local variable has non-trivial ownership: type is 'NSNumber *__strong'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nObjective-C objects should be storable in thread_local variables\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nARC blocks using thread_local with ObjC classes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso tested in Xcode 9.4b1 - same result."
