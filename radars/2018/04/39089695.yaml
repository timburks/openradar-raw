    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicyType and NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicyType is the wrong way around. The header file descriptions are the correct way around.\n\nUsing ‘external’ is a bit confusing without saying external to what. It seems you mean external to the current process: in other words, in the persistent store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the descriptions on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmergepolicytype?language=objc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicyType\nA policy that merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in-memory version by individual property, with the persistent store’s changes trumping in-memory changes.\n\nNSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicyType\nA policy that merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in-memory version by individual property, with the in-memory changes trumping persistent store's changes.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicyType\nA policy that merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in-memory version by individual property, with the in-memory changes trumping external changes.\n\nNSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicyType\nA policy that merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in-memory version by individual property, with the external changes trumping in-memory changes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nToday\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHeader file, NSMergePolicy.h, is correct and says:\n\n// This singleton policy merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in memory version. The merge occurs by individual property. For properties which have been changed in both the external source and in memory, the external changes trump the in memory ones.\nCOREDATA_EXTERN id NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicy API_AVAILABLE(macosx(10.4),ios(3.0));    \n\n// This singleton policy merges conflicts between the persistent store's version of the object and the current in memory version. The merge occurs by individual property.
