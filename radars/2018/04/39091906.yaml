    description: "Summary:\r\nUnable to use macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 (b17E199) full installer to upgrade an existing 10.12.6 virtual machine running in VMware Fusion to 10.13.4. The following error is given: “You may not install to this volume because the computer is missing a firmware partition”. As a 10.13.3 (b17D47) can be used to upgrade a VM, it seems the issue was introduced with 10.13.4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using VMware Fusion 8.5.8 or 10.1.1 running on a macOS 10.12.6 host, create a virtual machine with a 10.12.6 guest OS. The guest OS should have one hard drive and use the recommended hardware configuration.\r\n2. Install the VMware Fusion tools in the 10.12.6 guest \r\n3. Download the 10.13.4 installer from the App Store\r\n4. Launch Install macOS High Sierra.app and follow the onscreen instruction to begin an upgrade on the guest OS' hard drive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe OS upgrade installer should proceed with the upgrade from 10.12.6 to 10.13.4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAttempt to select the guest OS' hard drive as the target for the upgrade. The installer will give the following error:\r\n\r\n“You may not install to this volume because the computer is missing a firmware partition”\r\n\r\nAble to duplicate the same results:\r\n- With the CLI startosinstall command\r\n- Using an installer media created with createinstallmedia\r\n- After booting to the Recovery Partition [on the guest OS/VM] and repairing the internal drive \r\n- With an existing 10.12.6 VM and a newly created 10.12.6 VM\r\n- With VMware Fusion 8.5.8 and 10.1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n17E199\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVMware Fusion Pro 10.1.1 virtual machine running on a macOS 10.12.6 host"
