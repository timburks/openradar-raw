    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you rename a scheme to include a forward slash, it'll rename the underlying .xcscheme file. However, it won't include a slash in the filename (or translate / to :), and instead create a folder with the part before the slash, and name the file with the part after the slash. The scheme will continue to show up in the UI after the rename, until you close and reopen the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create a scheme that includes a forward slash in its name\r\n- Scheme will show up in the list with the slash, and it's buildable from the UI, but not via xcodebuild.\r\n- Close the project and reopen it (or restart Xcode)\r\n- Scheme will no longer show up in the UI either.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUI disallows including a forward slash character, or ideally do the / to : translation when saving, and the reverse transformation when displaying the name.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Version 9.3 (9E145)"
