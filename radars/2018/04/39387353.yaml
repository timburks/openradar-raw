    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari does not provide Reader mode support for blog articles on Weebly-hosted websites (e.g. https://www.calstephens.tech/blog/recap-hack-the-north-2017).\r\n\r\nI use a standard out-of-the-box Weebly blog setup, so it seems unusual that Reader mode would be unsupported. It seems like the above blog post and others like it should be viewable in Reader mode.\r\n\r\nMore examples (all Weebly-hosted blog articles):\r\nhttps://www.calstephens.tech/blog/announcing-ar-planes\r\nhttps://www.calstephens.tech/blog/my-summer-at-airbnb\r\nhttp://www.ginstephens.com/all-blog-posts/insulin-response-why-doesnt-everyone-agree\r\nhttp://templeofthedog.weebly.com/blog/the-joy-of-having-a-vet-next-door-and-the-curse\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNavigate to a blog post on any Weebly-hosted blog (I included five examples in this report). Attempt to enable Safari Reader mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to be able to enable Safari Reader mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Reader mode button doesn't appear, and I cannot enable Safari Reader mode.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.1 (13605.1.33.1.2)"
