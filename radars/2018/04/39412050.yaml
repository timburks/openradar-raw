    description: "Summary:\r\nThe document of awakeFromNib() says:\r\nWhen an object receives an awakeFromNib message, it is guaranteed to have all its outlet and action connections already established.\r\n\r\nHowever for UIViewControllers loaded from Storyboards their outlet and action connections are not yet established when their awakeFromNib() are called. They are only established when viewDidLoad() are called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app.\r\n2. Read console logs."
