    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an app that presents a view controller that differs in orientation from its initial view controller the orientation will occasionally be incorrect after the app returns from the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\na) Hold the device in the portrait orientation for all steps. DO NOT ROTATE.\r\nb) Open Safari to the Apple homepage (or another app that auto-rotates).\r\nc) Build and run attached app on a Plus model iPhone running iOS 10 or iOS 11.\r\n\r\n1) Tap the screen so that it presents the second view controller.\r\n2) Switch to Safari (or another app specified in step b), allow Safari to settle in the portrait orientation.\r\n3) Return to the app.\r\n4) Tap the screen to return to the first view controller.\r\n5) If the initial view controller is drawn correctly, go to step 1. Repeat until the initial view controller is drawn incorrectly.\r\n\r\nIt takes an average of 30 times until the initial view controller is drawn incorrectly. Sometimes a reproduction can be reached after a few iterations, but I have had to repeat steps 1-5 up to 190 times to see a reproduction.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first view controller is in the device orientation and fills the entire screen. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first view controller is drawn in a different orientation than the device orientation, and is partially cut off.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10 and iOS 11 on a Plus model iPhone. Must be an actual device (doesnâ€™t reproduce in the simulator).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApp that supports all orientation or all but upside down.\r\nInitial view controller with default values.\r\nA second view controller that supports UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape.\r\nSee attached Xcode project for specific details."
