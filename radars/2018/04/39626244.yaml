    description: "Area:\r\nApp Switcher\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe App Switcher frequently misinterprets a tap as a Force Quit. This appears to be due to the highly sensitive drag/swipe gesture. A tap with anything other than a carefully direct touch is interpreted as an upward swipe, causing a Force Quit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iPad, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to show the app switcher\r\n2. Tap on an app rectangle, roll your finger 1-2 millimeters upward during the touch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app touched should move up minutely and then return to it's place, or it should be brought to the foreground.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication is Force Quit, losing all current state and unsaved work.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n12.9\" iPad Pro 256gb"
