    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are getting reports since 11.0, the very introduction of UIDocumentBrowserViewController, that icons sometimes overlap with the status bar. This seems to have gotten somewhat better with each release, but it’s still something people give us bad reviews for and blame PDF Viewer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSomething that often works (see also notes)\n\nSet iPhone 7 to German.\nDownload PDF Viewer http://pdfviewer.io/.\nOpen a PDF, scroll.\nClick back.\nObserve icons are in the status bar.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIcons should never overlap the status bar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIcons overlap the status bar:  https://cl.ly/2N11063A0t32\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue doesn’t always happen, and it’s tricky to isolate. Try different iPhones and potentially restart them, use the app for a while, rotate, to eventually trigger this. Sorry that I can’t come up with a coherent pattern that always works."
