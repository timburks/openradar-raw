    description: "Area:\r\nKeyboards, mice and trackpads\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using Caps Lock for switching Input Sources sometimes it does not switch language. It takes 1-2 minutes to reproduce it. I checked on multiple macbooks - same problem everywhere. Also checked on internal / external keyboard - same result. I can make video if you have any problem to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add two languages as input source\r\n2) Select Caps-Lock for swithing between them\r\n3) Open text editor and try to type fast and pressing caps-lock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLanguage always switches\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes language not switching"
