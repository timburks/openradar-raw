    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode won't compile some Attributed Strings using Custom Fonts set in Interface Builder if the fonts are not installed on the Mac OS system of the build machine at build time.\r\n\r\nThis can really impact using Continuous Integration systems to build your app on remote servers where you may not be able to install the fonts to the system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Install custom font on a development machine\r\n- Assign custom font to UILabel / UITextArea using Xcode's IB interface.\r\n- Confirm font works in app on device/simulator\r\n- Commit to source control / package up into a Zip File\r\n- Download and unpack the source code on another machine\r\n(Optionally you can do this on the same machine, by deleting the font from your machine and doing a Product, Clean before next step)\r\n- Compile app and run on device/simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- All fonts work inside the app as designed and implemented at one point if the fonts are in the project properly. \r\nSee Attachment: https://imgur.com/a/2Ib5Qpa\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Font will be missing in cases when set with Interface Builder\r\nSee Attachment: https://imgur.com/a/npbf1tQ\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac OS 10.13.X and earlier"
