    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOur team is very curious to see how we can best use the os_log API in place of existing NSLog and print-based APIs. Within the pages at this URL path https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging, there's a reference to a \"Formatting Log Messages\" page. These references aren't links but probably should be. The \"Formatting Log Messages\" documentation page doesn't seem to exist publicly. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch developer.apple.com for \"Formatting Log Messages\". Look further by searching Google for `\"Formatting Log Messages\" site:developer.apple.com`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould be able to click a link to this page or find it by searching.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCan't find the page anywhere.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\ndeveloper.apple.com as of 18/04/16"
