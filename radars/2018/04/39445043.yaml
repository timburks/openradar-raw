    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen viewing an image whose file extension doesn't match its actual type, Preview can fail to export that file when the file is exported after saving the file (to correct its extension).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Find a PNG whose file extension is .jpeg or used the one attached.\r\n2. Open the file in Preview.app and hit Command-S. Preview will correct the file extension back to .png.\r\n3. Without closing the Preview window, export the file as JPEG.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPreview exports a JPEG encoding of the original image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPreview exports a blank or improperly encoded image instead. Please see the \"exported.jpeg\" file attached for an example.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n10.13.4 (17E199)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
