    description: "If SUT crashes in one of the invocations of xcodebuild, it will be recorded in all invocations runnings at that moment.\r\n\r\nWhen collecting crash logs, test manager should check for device ID and/or PIDs recorded in the crash log and report only relevant crash logs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Check out https://github.com/nickolas-pohilets/rdar-39753004\r\n2. Create two or more simulators of the same configuration (iPhone 6, iOS 11.3)\r\n3. Execute run.sh passing ID's of the simulator devices\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach of the $DEVICE_ID/Logs/Attachments should contain 4 crash reports, which occurred on that device only.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach of the $DEVICE_ID/Logs/Attachments contains (almost) all of the crash reports regardless of the device they occurred on.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b), Xcode 9.3 (9E145), Xcode 9.4b (9Q1004a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E199)"
