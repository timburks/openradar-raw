    description: "I want the ability to annotate methods and properties declared outside my module.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say that I have some custom tooling and API related to providing images and colors to my app. This means I do *not* want parts of my app to be able to invoke `+[UIImage imageNamed:]` directly, because it would bypass my mechanism. (Maybe my mechanism uses that under the hood, but provides an abstraction on top of that)\r\n\r\nI would want to somehow mark `+[UIImage imageNamed:]` as \"unavailable\" or \"deprecated\" or \"replaced\" so that anyone who *forgets* that the abstraction exists would get a nice compiler hint reminding them to not use the +imageNamed: method.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for UIColor: instead of using .green or +colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha:, I provide a \"Theme\" object that defines contextual properties with semantically-appropriate names like \"errorColor\" or whatever. In this case I want to deprecate the UIColor initializers.\r\n\r\nThis extends to LOTS of other things that are all of the form \"don't use that; use this instead\"."
