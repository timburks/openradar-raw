    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I click on the Mac Wi-Fi menu, and I see my iPhone listed as an option for connecting (tethering), the menu shows my iPhone’s LTE signal strength as dots, like in the iOS status bar. However, while I’m connected to tethering, the menu item listing my iPhone doesn’t show the signal strength any more.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to see the phone’s signal strength while I’m connected for the same reason that it’s useful to see its signal strength when I’m using the phone directly: it’s a clue as to whether a page’s failure to load is due to a broken server or a bad connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E202)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
