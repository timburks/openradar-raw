    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe use the httpCookieStore.getAllCookies when running on iOS 11 to check for an existing session cookie before attempting to authenticate the web session with our web service.  \r\nWe have received reports that sometimes the web pages do not load properly.  After adding some analytics tracking, we found that ~16% of the calls to httpCookieStore.getAllCookies do not call the callback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI cannot reproduce this locally.  I have built a sample app, with a tight loop and tracking to detect each call to httpCookieStore.getAllCookies, and the callback - and all succeed.\r\nFrom analytics in the published app, I could not find any correlation on the failed calls for the device, OS version, network connection, or URL being loaded.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe callback to be called exactly once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n16% of the times the callback is never called\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11 - iOS 11.3"
