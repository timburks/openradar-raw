    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen code is being edited in the main editor, with assistant editor open and showing another file, if there are errors in the main editor that can be fixed by applying fix all issues (shortcut: cmd opt ctrl f) and the fix is applied, the assistant editor changes to the same file as the main editor.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Open any project and show assistant editor (shortcut: cmd opt enter)\n2- Make sure different files are open in the main editor and the assistant editor.\n3- In the main editor, write any code that produces an error fixable by Xcode. Example: Make a variable in any function, and make sure that variable is not used. ie let dummy = 0. Xcode will complain about the variable not being used and can apply a quick fix.\n4- Apply quick fix either via the menu bar from Editor -> Fix All Issues or the shortcut, cmd opt ctrl f.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expectation is that the fix fill be applied in the main editor and the assistant editor will remain unchanged. The same goes the other way, when fix is applied in the assistant editor, the main editor shouldnâ€™t change.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlthough the fix is applied in the main editor, assistant editor changes to the same file as the main editor. The same happens the other way so that when quick fix is applied in the assistant editor, the main editor changes to the same file shown in the assistant editor.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.3 (9E145)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
