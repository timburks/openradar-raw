    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you have a today extension, and your MainInterface.storyboard’s primary view controller exists in a separate framework / module, and you make no direct references to that view controller in code within your extension, the extension will successfully install, but will fail to find the view controller at runtime, e.g. with a console log:\r\n\r\n> Unknown class _TtC19SharedExtensionCode19TodayViewController in Interface Builder file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the sample project.\r\n2. Build the \"SharedExtensionCode\" scheme.\r\n3. Look at \"FixEmptyTarget.swift\" for context on the issue.\r\n4. Attempt to run the \"Today Extension\" target on a simulator or device (you may need to do this twice before it appears).\r\n5. Look at the console in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe extension should’ve appeared, displaying \"Hello World\". \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe view controller class couldn’t be found, despite being public in another framework, and properly referenced in \"MainInterface.storyboard\".\r\n\r\nA workaround is to make an explicit reference to the view controller type in code. To do this in the sample project, uncomment line 21 of \"FixEmptyTarget.swift\". Run the extension again and it will work.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.3 (9E145)\r\nSimulator Version 10.0 (SimulatorApp-851.2 CoreSimulator-518.19)\r\niOS 11.3 (15E217)\r\nRunning on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.4 (17E199)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nSample Project: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ok3ec4r3y5k6eq1/TodayExtensionIssues%202.zip?dl=0"
