    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe issue is partially related to rdar://39750116\r\nWhile streaming to AirPlay using AVQueuePlayer, starting from 2nd enqueued AVPlayerItem, the items fail with `unknown` error as soon the playback reaches end. \r\n2nd and later added items don't ever become `readyToPlay` and remain in `unknown` status until the end of playback. The error log doesn't provide any more specific information for the failure reason. \r\nWhile AirPlay is disconnected the player and its current item immediately update their statuses to proper values.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to AirPlay\r\n2. Add 3 items to the player queue\r\n3. Skip (or watch till end) the first item\r\n4. Watch the second item till the end \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThird item starts playing properly and no errors are reported. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAlert with failure is shown. The second item fails with `unknown` error code. Error log does not provide more information about the failure reason. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 (15E216) as well as 11.3.1 (15E302)\r\ntvOS 11.3 (15L211)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've included modified AVFoundationQueuePlayer demo project with AirPlay support, with resources changed to ones at - https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/ - as old streams are no longer accessible due to expired SSL certificate."
