    description: "Summary:\r\nWe are trying to build code for fast drawing which multiplies the color into the PDF.\n\nThis is something other major platforms support, including Android and the Web via CSS: https://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/\n\nOn Android this can be set via an optional Paint property on setLayerType n the view:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setLayerType(int,%20android.graphics.Paint)\n\nOn iOS this can be set via layer.compositingFilter using “multiplyBlendMode”. This works, but the documentation states “This property is not supported on layers in iOS.” as per https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410748-compositingfilter\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDocumentation bug or missing feature/no sample project required.\nI still attach one for completeness, and found https://github.com/arthurschiller/CompositingFilters as open source project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should have official support for blend modes in views/layers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS supports layer.compositingFilter, but documentation states that it does not, so we’re unsure if this can be used.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
