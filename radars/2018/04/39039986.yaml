    description: "Summary: Run Xcode and open a playground. The CPU utilization of the launchd_sim process immediately starts to increase.\r\n\r\nThe CPU utilisation never drops and is sufficient to cause the fans to spin to cool the CPU.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a playground in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is sufficient to just open Xcode without opening a playground or project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nplayground is responsive and machine CPU is not excessive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nplayground is slow and CPU usage is excessive.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode 9.3 (9E145)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nmacOS High Sierra v10.13.4\r\niMac (27-inch, Late 2012)\r\n3.4GHz Intel Core i7\r\n32GB RAM\r\n\r\nThe output from xcrun simctl diagnose is attached"
