    description: "`UISnapBehavior` creates a jiggle, circular movement toward the end of the snapping animation. This is more pronounced when `damping` is higher, like 1.0 and above. Some people have already noticed this since 2015 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31798290/uisnapbehavior-strange-jiggle-swift/49627238#49627238), and this still hasn't been fixed in 2018. Please look into this since the behavior is inherently incorrect is how the spring should work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run the code attached in this report.\r\n- Drag the object up and down, where x-value is fixed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- No jiggle in the axis where there is supposedly no pull / movement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Weird jiggle. See attached GIF.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.3, iOS 11.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached screenshot."
