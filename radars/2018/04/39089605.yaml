    description: "I submit nearly all of my bug reports using my iPad.  You often ask for a sysdiagnose report.  Sometimes, I think the means you are unable to reproduce the bug, and if it's a minor bug I won't bother to create the sysdiagnose report.  It's just too hard to do.  (1) I have to re-read the instructions each time because it can't be remembered.  (2) I have to hold down three buttons at the same time, on different edges of my iPad, and I just don't have enough fingers to hold things steady.  (3) I'm not sure the report is triggered.  If I don't push the buttons are exactly the same time, the iPad might just turn off. (4) I must connect (or airdrop) to my iMac, then search for the file, but I'm not using my iMac.   If you want the report, please make it easier.  Put a button somewhere (e.g., overlay it on every screen) and make it easier to add to the report.  I often hesitate to even submit a bug report knowing you'll be asking for the sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 4/8/18 duplicate of 33626570"
