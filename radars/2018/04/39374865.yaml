    description: "Area:\r\nMenu Bar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn High Sierra, the \"Help\" main menu takes away key status of the app's windows and does not give it back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Opening the \"Help\" menu by clicking on the main menu item\r\n- Hover out of the shown submenu to the bottom, do not exit it by hovering over another main menu item\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAs on Sierra, everything in the app is back to normal and you can continue work.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nHit any key; the currently active app does not accept key events anymore. Clicking into text fields works, but you cannot use the keyboard.\r\n\r\nCmd-tab out and back into the app again (to redraw the window) and you will notice it now is drawn as if it was inactive. \r\n\r\nSo something else has key status, probably something from the help menu.\r\n\r\nKey status can be obtained back by opening the Help menu again but then hover over an adjacent main menu item, e.g. \"Window\". This will work. Probably closes the \"Search\" item in the help for good.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E199)"
