    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 11.3 now allows re-installing system apps via InstallApplication command, but there is currently no way to know if a system app is installed or not. The new feature is then useful only for one-shot command, but not for automated “self healing” of system apps (for instance if a school wants to make sure iBooks is always installed) as MDM system has no way to know if the app is already there or not (and sending InstallApplication commands in any case is not really an option).\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. enroll a device to MDM\n2. send InstallApplicationList command\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. system apps are listed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. system apps are not listed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
