    description: "Area:\r\nMenu Bar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe width of the menu that you see when you click the Audio/sound icon in the macOS Menu Bar is the normal size.\r\nBut when you have AirPods connected, the AirPods don't show up right away - they show up about 1 second after you open the menu bar. \r\n\r\nThe UI bug is that the width of this context menu changes (gets wider) once the AirPods show up as an option -- even if the name of the AirPods is shorter than the other existing audio output device names. Because the AirPods name is not longer, it showing up should not cause the menu to get wider.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect AirPods to iPhone\r\nClick Sound icon in macOS menu bar (with macOS logged into same iCloud account as iPhone)\r\nYou see the list of audio device options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt first the list of audio device options does not include AirPods. Then after a second or so it includes the AirPods. The width of this menu shouldn't change if the menu was already wide enough to display the name of your AirPods.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAt first the list of audio device options does not include AirPods. Then after a second or so it includes the AirPods. The width of this menu UNNECESSARILY gets wider once the AirPods are connected."
