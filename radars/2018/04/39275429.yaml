    description: "Summary:\r\nNew Build system fails for framework dependencies with similar named Test Hosts.\r\n\r\nWe usa a very modular setup with functionality split into different framework modules. \r\nSome frameworks require a test host application to run their unit tests. At the moment, these test host applications are all named \"TestHost\". \r\nWe encounter build failures when building with the new build system.\r\nThis is a regression between the old and the new build system \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Select the old build system.\r\n3. Run the tests of the BuildSystem App (CMD+U). This succeeds without any failures.\r\n4. Clean the project.\r\n5. Switch to the new build system.\r\n6. Run the tests of the BuildSystem App (CMD+U). This fails with errors.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe new build system is able to build and run all the unit tests and build dependencies with the same target name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build fails\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.3 (9E145)\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E199)"
