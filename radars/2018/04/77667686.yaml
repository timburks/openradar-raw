    description: When getting the date time info from an iOS device set to Arizona time, the time is correct (since Arizona does not observe DST) but the timezone name is incorrect thus making time conversions to GMT. The incorrect timezone causes a 1 hour gap between the actual time in GMT and converted time in GMT.
