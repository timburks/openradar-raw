    description: "I've been on vacation without wi-fi for several days, so I had about 40 app updates pending. Upon arriving and connecting to wi-fi, I selected \"update all\" in the App Store app.\r\n\r\nAfter the updates finished, two app icons, the two center icons at the bottom row, got moved to the top left corner and stuck there (see screenshot). The apps in question were Peixe Urbano and Uber.\r\n\r\nAfter locking the device and unlocking it again, the icons went back to their original positions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm not sure if this can be reproduced always, but I'm pretty sure the issue is caused by updating several apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIcons should stay where they are and keep their correct layout after updates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo icons changed their positions and the layout was broken.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.3 15E5189f"
