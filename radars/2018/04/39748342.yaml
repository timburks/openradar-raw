    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening files with NSOpenPanel is really slow, proportionally slow to the number of files being opened. With 200+ files, the UI is unresponsive (sometimes showing the beachball) for up to 20+ seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInitial setup:\n- Install Dropbox for macOS (issue observed with Dropbox version 48.4.58)\n- Enable Dropbox Finder extension (see attached PNG: Dropbox-Finder-Extension.png)\n\n1. Run the provided sample app `SlowFileOpen`\n2. Click the \"Open Files\" button\n3. Select a large amount of files to open (more than 50), you can use the folder \"many-text-files\" provided along with the sample app.\n4. Click \"Ok\"\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSOpenPanel should be dismissed instantly and the thread of execution returned to the app instantly.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSOpenPanel hangs and is unresponsive for several seconds before the thread of execution is returned to the host app (SlowFileOpen). With 200+ files, the UI is unresponsive (sometimes showing the beachball) for up to 20+ seconds.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.4, Dropbox 48.4.58\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease find attached sample project SlowFileOpen with a very detailed README.md file explaining my investigation and observations.\n\nThanks."
