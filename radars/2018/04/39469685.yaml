    description: "In AppKit an application can specify custom accessibility text on an NSAttributedString to override the text that would typically be used (such as for Voice Over).\r\n\r\nIn UIKit, or the iOS SDKs, there is no equivalent functionality, therefore there is no way for custom accessibility text to be provided.\r\n\r\nAn instance in which this would make sense:\r\n\r\n- Add a UITextField to an iOS app\r\n- Set UITextField's keyboardType = .numberPad\r\n- Run the app and navigate to UITextField\r\n- Enable Voice Over\r\n- Input a Zip Code (e.g. 94105)\r\n- Voice Over reads phone number as \"Ninety Four Thousand One Hundred and Five\" instead of reading individual digits \"Nine For One Zero Five\".\r\n- There is no way to override this custom value to ensure Voice Over reads the number as a number and not as a word.\r\n\r\nSee for more information https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstringkey/2870144-accessibilitycustomtext"
