    description: "Tabs are difficult to differentiate with text alone, and would greatly benefit from a usability (and aesthetic) standpoint. This is also something that apparently holds back Safari's marketshare significantly[1].\r\n\r\nLess importantly, as a nice-to-have, favicons should also be added to items in the Bookmarks menu.\r\n\r\nOpinion: this would bring some much-needed personality back to Safari.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://daringfireball.net/2017/08/safari_should_display_favicons_in_its_tabs"
