    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere is a bug where a UIDatePicker will not call the target for `.valueChanged` when the time changes to another one that is twelve hours apart through changing the hour slider.\r\n\r\nAn example of this bug is seen in the Calendar app, but it appear to be a bug in the actual framework.\r\n\r\nThis is described with a Gregorian calendar and US Locale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Calendar app.\r\n2. Tap the '+' button.\r\n3. Tap the table view cell with the static text 'starts'.\r\n4. Scroll the hour component one full cycle. (e.g. if it is set to 6:00 am, scroll the '6' twelve rows down so that it still says '6', but the 'am' will have changed to 'pm')\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe '6:00 am' text should have updated to '6:00 pm' to represent the date selected by the date picker.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe '6:00 am' text remains the same.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n(Calendar: Gregorian, Time Zone: Sydney, Locale: AU) - Shouldn't matte."
