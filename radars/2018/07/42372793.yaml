    description: "Summary:\r\nsafeAreaInsets on UIWindow behavior silently changed between iOS 11 and iOS 12:\n\niPad 10.5’:\niOS 11.4: safe area insets for window: UIEdgeInsets(top: 0.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 0.0, right: 0.0)\niOS 12b4: safe area insets for window: UIEdgeInsets(top: 20.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 0.0, right: 0.0)\n\niPhone X:\niOS 11.4: safe area insets for window: UIEdgeInsets(top: 44.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 34.0, right: 0.0)\niOS 12b4: safe area insets for window: UIEdgeInsets(top: 44.0, left: 0.0, bottom: 34.0, right: 0.0)\n\nIs this expected? Is this documented anywhere? \n\nThe documentation does not mention what is expected for the main window.\nIf we can use the rootViewController’s view as documentation base, then it seems the new behavior is correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached sample project to see output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo change, or a documented change. I can’t find release notes mentioning this anywhere?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis caused regressions in our code which were tricky to find.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis change is problematic because people used that to detect iPhone X: https://twitter.com/LeoNatan/status/1019863191155769344\n\n(That’s not what caused issues for us, we used it to detect hardware insets, rounded corners and sensor housing on iPhone X or future devices, that cannot be hidden via software.)\n\nAttaching our full detection code inclusive hack here: https://gist.github.com/steipete/6bf2f916699eeec176c7a51e79238290 (1000 character limit, so needed to use a Gist)"
