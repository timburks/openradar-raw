    description: "Summary:\r\nmacOS has the autocorrect functionality where in supported apps if you type words which macOS thinks you spelled wrong a correction pops up and if you continue writing by hitting the space bar you accept the correction. Sometimes however the correction is not what you want and you want exactly what you wrote. On classical Macs you have no other option than to move the mouse and hit the small x on the autocorrect suggestion beside the word. On a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar there is this prediction bar consisting of three words. If you type a word which autocorrect wants to correct, the left most word in the prediction bar is exactly what you typed inside „…“ and you can tap it to force macOS to not autocorrect with whatever it thinks you meant. This means when you have a Touch Bar you don’t need to move your mouse and hit the x on the autocorrect prediction on the screen. This is nice.\n\nHowever there is a certain case where this doesn’t work. If you type a dot and then continue lowercase it will autocorrect and capitalize the word after the dot. There is no option to dismiss it on Touch Bar since the left most word of the three-word-prediction bar is also capitalized. All you can do if you don’t like the correction is to move the mouse manually and hit the x beside the at the autocorrect prediction. See attached screenshots.\n\nInstead the left most word on the Touch Bar should also be lowercase so you can tap it to avoid autocorrect making your word uppercase after the dot. Because sometimes you want to abbreviate words with a dot but your sentence is not finished yet. If this is not common in the English language it is however in other languages like German and the issue appears in regardless of the chosen keyboard language.\n\nI don’t know if there are other cases in which dismissal of autocorrection using Touch Bar doesn’t work. I only observed this one case with lowercase letters after a dot. If there are more, they should also be fixed.\n\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65), German localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a MacBook with Touch Bar, use any app that supports autocorrect like TextEdit, type misspelled words, observe how you can dismiss autocorrect by tapping the left most word of the three-word-prediction-bar in Touch Bar. Type a dot and continue lowercase, observe how you can’t dismiss autocorrect capitalizing the word after the dot using Touch Bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsing Touch Bar one should be able to dismiss autocorrect always.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen continuing lowercase after a dot one can’t dismiss autocorrect on Touch Bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
