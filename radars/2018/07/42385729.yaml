    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAutofill works randomly for UITextField with secureTextEntry enabled when textContentType is Unspecified.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create some(for example four) UITextFields with Unspecified textContentType. Enable secureTextEntry for at least one of them.\r\n2. Start typing to different text fields. On some text fields you will observe password autofill, on some of them user autofill and some of them won't have autofill at all.\r\n\r\nNote: You may easily reproduce the issue with the attached sample.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAutofill suggestion doesn't appear or at least autofill is the same for uitextfields with the same textContentType and secureTextEntry. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOn some text fields you will observe password autofill, on some of them user suggestion and some of them won't have Autofill at all. The same text field may have different Autofill suggestions if you switch to them from different text fields. Seems like current AutoFill depends on the previous one.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 beta 4. Previous iOS 12 betas didn't have such issue."
