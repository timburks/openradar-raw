    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen pushing a view controller onto the navigation stack that has a prompt set on its navigation item, the incoming title and prompt don't animate in; they just appear. Additionally, when popping the detail view controller of the navigation stack, the title of the detail view controller immediately disappears, instead of animating out.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a master/detail view controller relationship set up.\r\n2. Set a prompt on the detail view controller.\r\n3. Push an instance of the detail view controller onto the navigation stack.\r\n\r\nSee the attached project and video that demonstrate this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe navigation bar correctly animates the incoming title and prompt.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe prompt and title of the detail view controller just appear.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5318d)\r\n\r\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/grantjbutler/radars/tree/master/42029168"
