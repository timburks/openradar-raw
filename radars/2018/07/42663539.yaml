    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen 2 different targets in the same Xcode project have UIViewController subclasses with the same class name, adding one of them in a storyboard file shows IBOutlets from both view controllers instead of outlets from only the selected class.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a new empty project with a target Target1\n- Add a UIViewController subclass called `ViewController` to Target1 and add an IBOutlet\n- Create a new target Target2\n- Add a UIViewController subclass called `ViewController` to Target2\n- Add a storyboard to Target2 with a `ViewController` class from Target2\n- In the inspector, IBOutlets for *both* `ViewController` classes are available\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly outlets from the `ViewController` class in its target are shown in IB\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOutlets from all classes named `ViewController` in different targets are shown in IB\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n100% reproducible"
