    description: "Summary:\r\nSince UISegmentedControl abstracts away the views used for displaying the segments, it isn’t immediately clear how to make segments accessible when using images instead of text titles.\n\nHow to do this is actually documented, but in a place I found unexpected. It’s in the documentation for accessibilityLabel. (You have to set the accessibilityLabel on the UIImage objects.)\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake a UISegmentedControl using images for segments and try to work out how to make them accessible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo find out how to do this by reading the documentation for UISegmentedControl.\n\nThis behaviour is the intersection of three APIs. I would expect it to be documented on the more specific API (UISegmentedControl) not on the more general purpose APIs (UIImage and accessibilityLabel).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is not mentioned in the documentation for UISegmentedControl. It is mentioned as a special case in the documentation for accessibilityLabel.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10 July 2018\r\n\r\nNotes:"
