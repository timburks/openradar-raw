    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFrequently we are trying to connect Bluetooth Heart Rate monitors to Apple Health, and we are expecting the samples from them to be stored there. However we often find than no devices will store data outside of the Apple Watch, until the phone has been restarted. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Connect a Bluetooth Heart Rate Monitor (Chest Strap or Wrist Strap, Wahoo Tickrx, Polar H7, Mio Link and Fuse, and various other HRMS)  via the \"Settings.app\" and the \"Bluetooth Menu\"\r\n• Once connected successfully check the Health App, \"Heart Rate\" and \"Show all Data\"\r\n• Observe that there are no Data samples from the BT HRM\r\n• Check with Nike Run + (I'm sure it just reads Heart Rate data from Health), no Heart Rate is shown during a workout\r\n• Check the Wahoo Utility app\r\n• Observe Heart Rate. This I believe is since they are reading the HR directly from the device, not from health. \r\n• Restart Phone\r\nRepeat Connection Steps\r\n• Observe that in Health BT HR samples are now being stores (Screenshot attached)\r\n• Observe that in Nike Run + the BPM now displays my Heart Rate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt's expected that if a Bluetooth Heart Rate monitor is connected to the phone through the System Bluetooth Device manager, that Heart Rate Samples will reliably appear in Health. This is critical for us as we are developing an app that uses Heart Rate as a key metric, and we'd like to take full advantage of Apple Health for managing Heart Rate samples.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHeart Rate samples are sometimes in Apple Health, sometimes they are not. A fresh reboot of the device (something that is needed every few days) seems to make it temporarily more reliable. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4, iPhone 7 and 5s recently tested, but it seems to be device independent. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nStandard I guess."
