    description: "an NSTimer initialized with the initWithFireDate:interval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: method will not fire at the specified date if the Mac has slept after the timer has been initialized. it will fire at some later date, the delay is probably proportional to the sleep time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\ninitialize an NSTimer with initWithFireDate:interval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: and a specific date.\r\nput the mac to sleep for a few minutes but wake it up before the fire date\r\nobserve the timer not being fired at the firedate\r\nobserve the timer being fired some minutes/hours later\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ni expect an NSTimer to be fired at the correct fire date if the Mac is not sleeping or off at this date\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSTimer fires at the wrong date\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n• can be worked around by re-scheduling timers after mac wakes from sleep (https://github.com/core-code/CoreLib/blob/master/Mac/JMCorrectTimer.m)\r\n• if the mac is sleeping at the firedate, i would like it to fire as soon as the mac wakes (which would minimize the error) which currently isn't the case either."
