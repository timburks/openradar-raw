    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nmacOS 10.14 beta 3 does not cause drawRect: to be called on a NSScrollView's documentView when it scrolls in my application. The bug only occurs if you build with the 10.14 SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone iTerm2 (https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)\r\n2. Check out commit ccd56bf2d148815eb21537eb072458c7997a4561\r\n3. Build and run with 10.14 SDK and Xcode 10\r\n4. Disable GPU rendering in Prefs>General\r\n5. Produce more than one screenful of output\r\n6. Scroll up\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent is visible after scrolling\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window contents are not drawn. drawRect: never gets called. A solid color area appears where newly revealed content should appear.\r\n\r\nI was able to work around it in commit 7ce65347493c699c4eab288e37f97d0cac98fe92 by explicitly telling the document view to redraw when the scrollview scrolls.\r\n\r\nAlthough copiesOnScroll is off on the scrollview, turning it on did not fix the issue.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14 Beta (18A326h)\r\nXcode Version 10.0 beta 3 (10L201y)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
