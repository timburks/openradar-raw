    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\n\nThe code structure popover menu thingy is really great. (I’m talking about the thing that shows “Jump to Definition”, “Show Quick Help”, “Callers…”, etc. when you command-click in the editor.)\n\nHowever, it has a bug. If I press and hold the mouse button whilst the pointer is over (for example) “Show Quick Help”, then it highlights “Show Quick Help”. When I then drag the pointer (with the button still pressed) to “Jump to Definition”, it does not move the highlight to “Jump to Definition”. It leaves “Show Quick Help” highlighted. However, if I then release the mouse button in this state (pointer over “Jump to Definition” but highlight on “Show Quick Help”), then it executes “Jump to Definition”. In other words, the action performed matches the pointer position, but the highlight doesn’t match the pointer position.\n\nI will attach a video demonstrating the problem.\n\nLove,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Command-click (or control-command-click, depending on your settings) over a function call in the editor.\n2. Move the mouse pointer onto “Show Quick Help”.\n3. Press and hold the mouse button.\n4. Move the mouse pointer onto “Jump to Definition”.\n5. Release the mouse button.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu highlight follows the mouse.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu highlight remains on the menu item under the pointer when the button was pressed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 10.0 beta 4 (10L213o)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
