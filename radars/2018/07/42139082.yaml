    description: "Summary:\r\nWe're testing Drag & Drop capabilities in our application, and we've noticed a rare crash that's not easily reproducible:\r\n\r\nHere's the crash log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Assertion failure in -[_UIDragSnappingFeedbackGenerator userInteractionStarted], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/UIKitCore/UIKit-3698.79.2/_UIDragFeedbackGenerator.m:175\r\n2018-07-12 14:42:51.323435-0500 Viewer[10264:809379] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '<_UIDragSnappingFeedbackGenerator: 0x2811dcfa0: prepared=1> is already being interacted with'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've seen this crash occur when the drag \"lift\" animation is just completed on a UICollectionView, and the user starts dragging. There are no other factors that we've identified as related to the crash occurring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart a drag session by long pressing an item in a collection view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe drag session is started correctly, and no crashes are experienced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, with no clear reason, an exception is thrown from _UIDragSnappingFeedbackGenerator.userInteractionStarted and the app is terminated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
