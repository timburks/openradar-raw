    description: "Summary:\r\nImplementing UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate.documentBrowser:didRequestDocumentCreationWithHandler: enables documents creation directly from the instance of the UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\n\nIt would be a nice, useful enhancement if the \"Create Document\" view that's inserted at the beginning of the item list accepted drops so that the document creation routine could be started directly by dragging content from other applications.\n\nIn our application, a user can create new PDF documents by selecting a series of templates or images to include in the new PDF. Having the ability to kick off the document creation process directly with a dropped item (as collection view does with UICollectionViewDropCoordinator, for instance), would allow us to save the user a couple of steps in the process of creating a new PDF.\n\nExamples:\n- Having both our application (https://pdfviewer.io) and Photos.app side by side in a split-screen setup on an iPad, a user could drag and drop an image from Photos.app to the \"Create Document\" item in our application's instance of UIDocumentBrowserViewController, and our application would automatically create a new PDF document based off the dropped image.\n\n- If the user already has a PDF template in their file collection, they could just open our application and drag that file from the file browser to the \"Create Document\" item to duplicate and start editing the new copy in a single step.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nImplement documentBrowser:didRequestDocumentCreationWithHandler: on a UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Create Document\" item on a UIDocumentBrowserViewController instance accepts UI drops and the drop contents are passed over to the instance's delegate to proceed with the document creation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to create a new document from a dragged item using UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
