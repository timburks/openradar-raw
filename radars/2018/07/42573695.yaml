    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController opens with a non-existing directory on re-installing of the app. This happens when the app is deleted while being inside a directory of the app using the UIDocumentBrowserViewController. This seems to be happening in the iOS 12 betas too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Download PDF Viewer from the app store.\r\n- Tap on ‘Browse’ tab, PDF Viewer local directory.\r\n- Open PSPDFKit sub-directory.\r\n- Delete the app.\r\n- Re-install and open PDF Viewer app.\r\n- Dismiss initial pop-over for what’s new.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should always refresh and load to the root directory of the local storage of the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController opens with a non existent location with the same title of the sub-directory opened before deleting the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
