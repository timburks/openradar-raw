    description: "Summary:\r\nUIActivityViewController does not respect third-party activity types that are included in the excludedActivityTypes property.  For example, I may want to block users from sharing via a specific extension (i.e., Tumblr) for a valid reason (i.e., I am the Tumblr app and it doesn't make sense for me to share to myself) or I want to prevent a user from sharing potentially his or her private data with a social network but allow him or her to share to a productivity app like Dropbox or Evernote.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the Tumblr app for iOS to a device (v3.7.5 at this time)\r\n2. Open the attached ExcludedShareExtensions project\r\n3. Build and run the project to the same device from #1\r\n4. In the Share sheet that appears, tap more More and flip the switch for Tumblr to on\r\n5. Observe that the Tumblr icon appears as a sharing option even though its activity type was included in excludedActivityTypes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Tumblr sharing option should not be visible in the activity view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Tumblr option is visible in the activity view controller even though it was specifically excluded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
