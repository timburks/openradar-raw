    description: "Area:\r\n\r\nCore Animation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCAGradientLayer does not seem to support wide color.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a CAGradientLayer\r\n2. Set its colors to CGColors with a Display P3 color space\r\n3. Note that the colors are rendered without wide color\r\n\r\nHere's a code snippet I used to create the attached screenshot, which creates an all-pink \"gradient.\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet wideCGColor = CGColor(colorSpace: CGColorSpace(name: CGColorSpace.displayP3)!, components: [1, 0, 0.8, 1])!\r\nlet gradientLayer = CAGradientLayer()\r\ngradientLayer.colors = [wideCGColor, wideCGColor]\r\ngradientLayer.locations = [0, 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn attached the screenshot, I have a layer with the wide color being set as the background color, and the gradient layer underneath, which is noticeably \"dull.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe gradient layer should render wide colors as such.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe gradient layer seems to ignore the wide color space.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 10.0 beta 4 (10L213o)\r\niOS Version 12.0 beta 4 (16A5327f)\r\n\r\nThis behavior was also present in Xcode 9.3 building to an iOS 11 device."
