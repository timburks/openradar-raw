    description: "Please provide an option for NSDatePicker to only show the year. I.e. a datePickerElements value of NSDatePickerElementFlagYearMonth\r\n\r\nSimilar to the existing NSDatePickerElementFlagYearMonth flag, this would allow for picking a date by entering only a year value. This beats a NSTextField combined with a stepper:\r\n- works with NSDate\r\n- matches appearance and behavior of NSDatePicker\r\n\r\nIt appears I am not the only one wishing for this feature: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41253203/how-to-show-year-only-in-nsdatepicker"
