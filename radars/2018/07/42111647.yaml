    description: "iOS 12's new and smart \"call this person, it's their birthday\" reminders are fantasticâ€¦ unless you live in a completely different time zone, vow to remember to call them when it's not 1am for them and proceed to forget to acknowledge their birthday at all.\r\n\r\nA small way these alerts could be improved would be to see if the location of the recipient is known (Find My Friends or just an address if it's unambiguous) and adjust the alert based on your own time zone. Obviously this isn't perfect but when it works it would be magic. If this isn't feasible then an option to snooze the alert or make it persist would help.\r\n\r\nHappy Birthday!"
