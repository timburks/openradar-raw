    description: "Summary:\r\nIf UIControlEventTouchDownInside occurs while the button is still enabled, UIControlEventTouchUpInside would be fired even if the button was disabled between tapping & releasing the button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Build & Run app.\r\n3. Tap & hold the button before it becomes disabled (it’s disable after 3 seconds)\r\n4. Release the button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo alerts displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert saying “TouchUpInside” is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInitially I observed the issue with UIBarButtonItem.\r\n\r\nI believe that this behavior violates the UIControl.enabled property contract stated in the docs, namely the following part (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n>>>Set the value of this property to YES to enable the control or NO to disable it. An enabled control is capable of responding to user interactions, whereas a disabled control *ignores touch events* and may draw itself differently.\r\n\r\niOS 12 betas at the time of writing are also affected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
