    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n* Open Calendar on iOS\r\n* Go to Year View\r\n* Scroll to 2038\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Expect 2038 to appear like every other year before it\r\n* Tapping into a month will show the month normally\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* There is 2 Aprils, 2 Julys, and no October. All the years after this are similarly glitchy, and if you scroll back up sometimes the months are out of order.\r\n* Tapping into a month (like April) shows many dates. Some are skipped, some are missing completely\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTest on iPhone with base installation"
