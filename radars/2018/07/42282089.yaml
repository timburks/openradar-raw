    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter a restart of iOS on iPad the home screen icons move together by a small amount in a quick jump upwards after changing the page of the home screen. This happens only once after the boot and then the icons stay like that until a reboot. It might not happen on the first swipe but only after several swipes to change home screen pages. Also sometimes you need to try again and reboot. To me it happens consistently after every reboot but not always with the first swipe.\r\n\r\nAlways reproducible, iOS 11.4.1, iPad Air 2, German language localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake iPad, reboot, unlock and swipe to change home screen page. Observe closely if the icons jump a tiny bit upwards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIcons on home screen should stay at their places and not move.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIcons on home screen change places and move once.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee GIF of problem here: https://twitter.com/philmcole/status/937038248140005384"
