    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be useful to have a public `coder(forViewControllerIdentifier:)` method on UIStoryboard, primarily for the purpose of being able to use initializer injection on view controllers by leveraging `init(coder: aDecoder)`.\n\nDetails on this approach are described in http://holko.pl/2016/12/14/storyboards-dependency-injection/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have public method on UIStoryboard that returns a coder that can be used in conjunction with `init(coder:)` on a view controller (likely specific to that view controller)\n2. Create custom initializer on view controller that takes any number of parameters + coder from step 1\n3. Initialize all dependencies, then call `super.init(coder:)` from the parameter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis provides developers with a way to use initializer injection in combination with storyboards, a much requested feature and major piece of criticism of storyboards\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis isnâ€™t currently possible in any way.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXocde 10 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
