    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"nextTriggerDate\" of a \"UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger\"  should return always the same result for the same Notification request but it seems to return a date offseted from the current time instead of scheduling time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou can find a very simple project at attachment with a repro.\r\n\r\n- Schedule a notification with a UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger, check the \"nextTriggerDate\", it's the correct one\r\n- A few seconds / minute / hours, but before the trigger date, fetch the same request with : \"UNUserNotificationCenter.current().getPendingNotificationRequests\"\r\n- Check the nextTriggerDate, the date is not correct, therefore not the same date returned at scheduling. It's just the current date + the initalInterval, but it should be the scheduling date + interval\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"nextTriggerDate\" should be the same at scheduling and at any time of the life of the notificationRequest\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"nextTriggerDate\" is only valid at scheduling, which make it pretty useless because you can easily calculate it at this time"
