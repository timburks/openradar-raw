    description: "Summary:\r\nUp until macOS Mojave Beta 1, I had no issues booting my external SSD (Samsung PORTABLE SSD T3) that has Windows 10 as a To-Go Installation installed, instead of the inbuilt SSD via the ALT 'boot menu' where you can select a drive.\r\n\r\nNow, in Beta 2, I'm no longer able to do so. When selecting my external SSD, it always boots macOS on my inbuilt SSD and not Windows 10 on my external SSD. As far as I can remember, this issue hasn't occurred in any version of macOS High Sierra.\r\nTo make sure that my external SSD is not faulty and still fully functional, I've tried booting it on two other laptops (not running macOS Mojave Beta 2) and I had no trouble doing so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the boot menu where you can select a drive (Hold ALT-key while booting until drives appear)\r\n2. Select the external-SSD that has Windows 10 installed or some other OS. I don't know if the OS matters.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- After selecting the drive and pressing enter, the Windows 10 Logo should appear after a quick black screen. It then boots as normal on Windows 10 and works with no issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmacOS launches instead, no matter if I select my inbuilt SSD with macOS on it or my external SSD.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14 Beta (18A314h)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\n3,1 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 550 1536 MB\r\nExternal SSD: Samsung PORTABLE SSD T3"
