    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes you need to get a resource from the current bundle, which isn't necessarily the main bundle. It would be useful to have a property for this as it's a common need.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n```swift\nBundle.current.bundleURL\n```\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n```swift\nprivate final class BundleMarker {}\nextension Bundle {\n\tstatic let current = Bundle(for: BundleMarker.self)\n}\n\nBundle.current.bundleURL\n```\n\nWhile it's easy to work around. It's such a common use-case that it makes sense to include it in AppKit itself.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13\r\n\r\nNotes:"
