    description: "Summary:\r\nWe rely on Xcode to do our work. It is not acceptable to prevent Xcode from being opened because iTunes is being auto-updated.\n\nIdeally the music player and developer tools would be isolated. As a workaround it might be okay if developers could specifically disable auto-updating of iTunes, because I do not care at all about iTunes. I want to get my work done.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. There is an iTunes update available.\n2. You quit Xcode because you need to enable or disable indexing, or it just gets itself messed up and needs relaunching.\n3. You try to reopen Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to open Xcode at any time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn alert says: “You can’t open the application “Xcode” because it is being updated.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.5 (17F77)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
