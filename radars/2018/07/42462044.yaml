    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using certain keyboards, like Serbian Latin, Croatian, Hungarian, Dutch etc, Quick Type / Suggestions input bar is not shown above the keyboard. This makes impossible to use password autofill feature impossible to use with those keyboards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add Serbian Latin keyboard in system Settings\r\n2. Implement password autofill in some sample project, as explained in https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/206 - or use the same Shiny app sample code from that WWDC session\r\n3. Switch to Serbian Latin keyboard - quick type bar does not appear\r\n4. Switch to English keyboard - quick type with the password appears\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuick Type bar should *always* appear and it should always show at least the “key” icon for the iCloud Keychain password store.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCustomer should not be forced to install English (or French or German…) keyboard in order to use such an important security helper in an app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated to \r\n\r\n* https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/206\r\n\r\n* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_a_text_input_view"
