    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSample code for Network does not cover error conditions raised by the Network stack that are not described on the header files or documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild and run the nwcat program, and run with the following arguments:\r\n\r\nnwcat -t -v www.howsmyssl.com 44\r\n\r\nThen wait, the server will close the connection.   The sample rather than exiting stays in a loop processing events.   The reason is that \"is_complete\" is set to true, but the documentation on the sample and header files expect \"nw_content_context_t context\" to be not null, and the is_final property on the \"NWContentContext\" to be true, which is not the case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should terminate on its own, and not burn 100% CPU\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBurns 100% CPU, stuck in a loop.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode10 beta 3\r\nConfiguration:\r\nComments"
