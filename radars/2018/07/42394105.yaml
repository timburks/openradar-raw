    description: "Summary:\r\nSample project here: https://github.com/UberJason/ShortcutsWatchOSBugs\n\nIn watchOS 5, a new background refresh task (WKIntentDidRunRefreshBackgroundTask) was introduced to run after an Intent extension is executed, since the Intent extension is a separate process. \n\nThis refresh task is triggered correctly when running an Intent-based shortcut triggered by tapping a platter from the Siri watch face. However, the refresh task is NOT triggered when running an Intent-based shortcut using a Siri shortcut phrase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample project listed above, and follow the instructions in the README or in the iOS app screen. Reproduced for convenience here:\n- In iOS Settings.app, ensure developer settings for shortcuts testing are set (\"Display Recent Shortcuts\" and \"Display Donations on Lock Screen\").\n- Run the iOS app once, which triggers a donation and shows the shortcut on Spotlight.\n- Run the watchOS app once, which sets a relevant shortcut and shows the shortcut on Siri Watch Face.\n- In iOS Settings.app > Siri, create a voice shortcut for the \"Do A foo\" shortcut. The voice shortcut may be something like \"Do It\".\n- Debug the watchOS app, which attaches the debugger to the WatchKit Extension.\n- Go back to the Siri Watch Face, and invoke the shortcut, bringing up the confirmation dialog, and tap \"Do\".\n- Notice that the debugger prints \"Intent did run\" from the WatchKit Extension.\n- Invoke Siri by holding the digital crown, and then speak the voice shortcut (e.g. \"Do It\").\n- Notice that the debugger does NOT print \"Intent did run\" from the WatchKit Extension.\n\nNote that the intent extension *does* run successfully from a Siri voice shortcut. To verify this:\n- Debug the watchOS shortcut in Xcode.\n- Invoke Siri by holding the digital crown, and then speak the voice shortcut (e.g. \"Do It\").\n- Notice that the debugger prints \"Handled!\", which is a print statement from the WatchIntentHandler.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the WKIntentDidRunRefreshBackgroundTask is triggered, as evidenced by the print statement \"Intent did run\". Also note, the Siri custom response does not display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe WKIntentDidRunRefreshBackgroundTask is not triggered, and the print statement is not printed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
