    description: "On devices running iOS 11.1.1, the automatic language recognition for auto-correct does not recognize words from a different language unless that languageâ€˜s keyboard layout is explicitly added under Settings > General > Keyboards > Keyboards.\r\n\r\nThis is counterintuitive because the languages I speak and type are not tied to the keyboard layouts I use. Example: I frequently switch between English and German but want to use a German keyboard layout for all text.\r\nHaving to add these additional keyboard layouts makes day-to-day interaction with the keyboard very cumbersome. My main interaction with the keyboard's language switcher is to switch between the German keyboard layout and the Emoji keyboard. This interaction becomes significantly worse by the need to have the English keyboard layout enabled to make auto-correction work.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Either make auto-correction language recognition completely automatic (like it works on the Mac) or tie it to the languages in my \"Preferred Language Order\" under Settings > General > Language & Region instead of the keyboard layouts."
