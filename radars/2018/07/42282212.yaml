    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you search inside a PDF in Safari the search results are shown overly zoomed in. The found search term is so big it covers the whole screen. This is not ideal since most times you want to know *where* the result is found. So you need to zoom out manually. Wanting to cycle through many results therefore is a pain, since with each result you need to zoom out manually before being able to continue. The PDF should not be zoomed in.\r\n\r\nAlways reproducible, iOS 11.4.1, iPad Air 2, German language localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a PDF containing text inside Safari, search for a word which is contained a few times in the PDF, watch how zoomed in the result appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch results should not appear zoomed in to be able to see where they are located inside the text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch results are zoomed in.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee GIF of problem here: https://twitter.com/philmcole/status/940184228611969024"
