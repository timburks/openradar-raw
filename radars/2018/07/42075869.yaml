    description: "Summary:\r\nEvery day we have some support cases, where In App Purchases cannot be completed on the Mac App Store. The symptom is that the SKPaymentTransaction in the default payment queue remains in the state „.purchasing“ and does not leave it, at least not within  90seconds or a couple of minutes. \nAccording to our reports the customer is left with no error message by the Mac App Store. \niTunes Support claims it would be the developers fault.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fetch an SKProduct\n2. Create an SKPayment with it\n3. Add it to the default SKPaymentQueue\n4. Wait and keep observing the default SKPaymentQueue\n5. Check the SKPaymentQueue`s current entries after 90 seconds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe SKPaymentTransaction in the queue should change from .purchasing to either .purchased or .failed state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe SKPaymentTransaction remains in .purchasing state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happens *only in production* (not sandbox) and not on all computers, we cannot currently reproduce it in the office. Any advice we can give to customers would be useful. Or any advice how to help analyse the issue.\n\nThis does not occurr on iOS."
