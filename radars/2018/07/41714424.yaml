    description: "Summary:\r\nWhilst recording a workout and tracking a route with HKWorkoutBuilder we occasionally receive the error: \"Unable to add data to a frozen series\" while adding data points.\r\n\r\nDTS advised us to raise a Radar for this.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to workout a pattern to what causes this or how often it occurs as we are relying on users reporting this error and the limited logging we have available.\r\n\r\nI have seen it several times from a relatively small user base of less than 100 sessions per week. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart workout\r\nStart tracking location\r\nStart route builder\r\nAdd points to route builder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSave route successfully\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn some occasions receive error: \"Unable to add data to a frozen series\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n4.3.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch"
