    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a recent MacBook if you plug in the charging cable the charging chime is played regardless of your volume setting. This is different to iOS, where the charging chime respects the volume settings and is not played while the volume is muted. Also this is different to earlier versions of OS X since my old MacBook Pro 13“ Mid 2012 didn’t have this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is especially annoying in very quite places like a library, where you don’t want to make any noise.\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro 13“ 2016 with TouchBar, macOS 10.13.6 (17G65), German localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake MacBook, turn off volume, plug in charging cable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHear no charging chime.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHear a charging chime.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
