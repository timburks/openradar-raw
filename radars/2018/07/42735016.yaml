    description: "Area:\r\nApp Sandbox\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsers of Evernote are able to attach PDFs to their notes. If they double click on a PDF attachment, Evernote opens the PDF in Preview and users can make edits to it. Unfortunately they are not able to save those edits. The PDF file is located in Evernote's sandbox and it should be editable\r\n\r\nThis was demonstrated to Christian in the WWDC 2018 Security Lab. He investigated and suggested that I file this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install Evernote from the Mac App Store https://itunes.apple.com/app/evernote-stay-organized/id406056744?mt=12\r\n2. Launch Evernote\r\n3. Create an account or log in with an existing account\r\n4. Create a note\r\n5. Attach a PDF file to the note (drag and drop or File --> Attach Filesâ€¦ from the menu)\r\n6. Open the PDF by double-clicking on its icon in the note editor\r\n7. When Preview opens, edit the PDF (e.g. add some annotations)\r\n8. Save the PDF in Preview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PDF changes are saved\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPreview asks the user to save a new document at a different location\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
