    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are two icons overlaid on the filter text field in the project navigator. They look fine until you focus the text field, at which point they keep a blurred background while the text field becomes pure white.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open the project navigator in the left sidebar (if not already open)\r\n2. observe that the icons within the filter field look fine\r\n3. click on the field to focus it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe icons gain a white background (i.e. they don’t have a separate background)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe icons keep the visual effect view background, now clashing with the text field’s white background\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
