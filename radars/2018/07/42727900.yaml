    description: "Summary:\r\nExternal TestFlight users should be able to purchase a subscription. Instead, TestFlight uses a sandbox and is used to test the subscription implementation.\n\nWe however are interested in test users testing the actual subscription features, and since registration is open (http://boarding-ios.pdfviewer.io/, currently solved via Fastlane, but soon this is an official TestFlight feature as announced at WWDC 2018), this will become more and more of a problem\n\nOur workaround idea is to detect if we are in a TestFlight environment and then just make the app behave like a subscription has been bought.\n\nFor smaller apps, having 2000 potential customers that can’t even purchase the subscription because they constantly test new beta features, also hurts the bottom line.\n\nPlease rethink that and do it like Android: Beta testers can purchase a subscription just like regular App Store users - there’s no difference in handling. Only internal testers get the subscription sandbox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1/12b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
