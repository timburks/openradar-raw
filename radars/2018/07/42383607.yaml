    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you leave the home screen editing for a while, it just exits editing mode automatically after a while. This can happen while typing in the name of a folder.\n\niOS is punishing the user for being slow. This is very rude.\n\nThere are LOTS of reasons the user might be taking a long time, such as being distracted, inexperienced, cautious, tired, or having cognitive or motor impairments.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Put the home screen in edit mode\n2. Go into a folder\n3. Start editing the name of the folder, but take your time. Imagine you are distracted, or are having difficulty finding the right folder name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHome screen should stay in edit mode, editing the folder name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a while, editing ends without the user asking for it.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12 dev beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
