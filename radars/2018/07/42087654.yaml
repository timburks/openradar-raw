    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a project that links a pre-compiled Swift module (specifically a static framework in the attached sample project), the project will build successfully, but if you try to jump to definition on a symbol or the import from the pre-compiled module, you get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCouldn't Generate Swift Representation\r\n\r\nError (from SourceKit):\r\n\"Could not load module: MODULE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Pre-compile a Swift static framework in 1 project\r\n2. Create a new project, copy the pre-compiled framework to the root of the project\r\n3. Add `$(SRCROOT)` to `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` in Build Settings\r\n4. Add `-framework MODULE` to `OTHER_LDFLAGS`\r\n5. Add an import, and a reference to the symbols from the pre-compiled framework\r\n6. Build (this should be successfully)\r\n7. Try to jump to definition on the import, or any of the referenced symbols\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou see a generated representation of Swift module\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get the above error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 3 (10L201y)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- See the attached project for an example (this Swift framework was built with Xcode 10 beta 3, so you must use the same version to reproduce this)\r\n- In Xcode 9.4.1 jumping to definition in this case works"
