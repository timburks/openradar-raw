    description: "In Control Center in iOS 12 beta, one can manually turn on Do Not Disturb and set it to automatically turn off after an hour, until the evening/morning, or after they leave a location.\r\n\r\nSiri in iOS 12 beta doesn’t currently support this functionality. I think Siri should support requests like the following:\r\n• “Turn on Do Not Disturb for [time elapsed]”\r\n• “Turn on Do Not Disturb until [date/time]”\r\n• “Turn on Do Not Disturb until I leave”\r\n\r\nWithout this, a user may use this functionality in Control Center and later request Siri to perform that same functionality, only to find out that the functionality can only be accessed through Control Center."
