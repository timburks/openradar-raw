    description: "Summary: For Turkish-Q full size keyboard, whenever I type 'yok' (which means no, not exists, or a negativity indicator word depending on the context it's used) in a sentence, it's auto-corrected into 'YÖK' (a government organization in Turkey) even I explicitly typed with the letter 'o' not 'ö'. Also the letter 'ö' is already present on the Turkish-Q keyboard. So it's very clear that the intent is to type 'yok'. Strangely, this issue is not present when 'Yok' is typed (e.g. as the first word of the sentence).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: With Turkish-Q keyboard type 'yok' in a sentence (all lower caps and not as the first word of the sentence).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: When space is pressed, 'yok' is expected to remain as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: 'yok' word is auto-corrected into 'YÖK'.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 12 (16A5327f), but the issue is present as far back as iOS 11 maybe even iOS 10. It's a very popular issue among Turkish speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iPhone X but the issue is present in every device."
