    description: "Area:\r\nNetworking\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe train Wifi net of the austrian railways (Ã–BB) is an unprotected Wifi network. Once selected, a window usually pops open where one is shown a web page and has to click a \"Verbinden\" button to accept the terms.\r\n\r\nWith Mojave public beta 2, this window pops up, but then shows no content. Instead, a dialog box appears saying that an error occurred (can't tell you the exact words now because I'm writing this on the train, via this network, to which I then manually connected by opening Safari, at which point I was again sent to the login page, where it worked and  I could confirm it).\r\n\r\nSo, the automatic web confirmation box does not work, whereas it works in Safari."
