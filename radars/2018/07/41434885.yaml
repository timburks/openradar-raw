    description: "Area:\r\nBluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary: When successfully connecting Bluetooth Heart rate monitors (Tested on Wahoo Tickr, Mio Link and Fuse, and other misc devices) to an iOS device, the \"i\" on the right of the cell disappears preventing us from \"Disconnecting\" or \"Forgetting\" the device. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Attach a Bluetooth Heart Rate monitor to your body (I recommend the Wahoo Tickr as a standard)\r\n• Open on your iPhone \"Settings\"\r\n• Select \"Bluetooth\"\r\n• Observe the Heart Rate monitor listed under \"Other Devices\"\r\n• Select your Heart Rate Monitor\r\n• Observe it move to \"My Devices\" and a spinner as it connects\r\n• Observe on successful connection the 'i' on the right of the cell\r\n• Select the \"i\" and see the option to \"Forget Device\"\r\n• Select Back\r\n• Switch focus to the Home screen\r\n• Switch focus back to Settings App\r\n• Observe the \"i\" dissapear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"i\" should stay there, and give the same options as it does for many other Bluetooth devices. \"Disconnect\" and/or \"Forget Device\". \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo \"i\" button is displayed. Without this and the options normally behind it, it's very difficult to remove a Heart Rate monitor from a phone. My options are to either turn off the system bluetooth, or turn off the device. And Heart Rate monitors rarely have an \"off\" switch, you have to wait for them to power down. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4, iPhone 5s (for attached sysdiagnose), usually on my personal iPhone 7\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nFairly standard iPhone 7. The phone is less than a week old, restored from iCloud backup. But I have seen this on several people's phones. I'm fairly sure it wasn't and issue in iOS 10, we have certainly been struggling with it for some time."
