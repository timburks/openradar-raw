    description: "Summary:\r\nWe're seeing incremental install times for individual tests on projects with large resource bundles take upwards of 15 seconds.\n\nNote that this is all in simulator, I have not tested on actual devices since thatâ€™s not important for my team.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. download sample project (sorry about the number of targets)\n2. run full test (Cmd-U) to build and install app\n3. run an individual test (diamond)\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIncremental install should complete near instantly since nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIncremental install takes upwards of 15 seconds to complete.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can provide a larger project if needed, I wrote a script to generate these."
