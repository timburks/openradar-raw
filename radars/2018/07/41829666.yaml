    description: "Behavior of NWUDPSession.setReadHandler() inexplicably changed in iOS 12 Beta (tested up to Beta 3). If maxDatagrams is > 1, the received datagrams are merged into a single packet, rather than added as elements of the Data array returned to the callback. Also, there is no way of splitting the datagrams by length, as they're meant to be atomic and the payload length is outside the scope of the datagram.\r\n\r\nSetting maxDatagrams to 1 mitigates the bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Bind a NWUDPSession to receive UDP datagrams from a peer/server.\r\n- Invoke setReadHandler() with maxDatagrams > 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMultiple datagrams must come as an array of Data objects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMultiple datagrams may come as a single flattened Data object."
