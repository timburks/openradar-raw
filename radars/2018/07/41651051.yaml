    description: When I forget to annotate a tag a member of a Swift class (or the whole Swift class itself) with @objc, but then I use the member (or the whole Swift class itself) from Objective-C, Xcode only says the member or class doesn't exist. However, Xcode should provide a better suggestion and offer a fixit to tag the related member or class with @objc.
