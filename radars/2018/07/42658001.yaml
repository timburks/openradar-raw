    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #42656565\r\n\r\nIt seems AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices doesn’t offer Siri as voice.\r\n\r\nUsing text selection/accessibility offers Siri to speak, but we can’t replicate this using AVSpeechSynthesizer, as the Siri voice isn’t offered or returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCompare text selection -> Speak between http://pdfviewer.io/ and Files.app PDF text selection. We miss API to offer native selection, so we manage this ourselves, and have to use custom Speak logic, and the result is worse than what the System offers here.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should be part of AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices and preferred over compact/enhanced voices. A new quality setting “almostHuman” could indicate the quality increase over enhanced. Siri’s new voice is so good.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOld voice, downgrade over what people are used to from Siri now.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4 and 12b4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
