    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting a view's backgroundColor property in Interface Builder to a Named Color (ie. a color declared in a .xcasset file), it is impossible to change the backgroundColor of this view in its awakeFromNib method.\nThe view keeps the color defined in IB.\n\nNote that awakeFromNib is called and the backgroundColor property is changed, but the color defined in IB is then re-applied *after* awakeFromNib is called.\nThis doesn't happen if the color used in IB is not a Named Color (and is shouldn't happen, as when awakeFromNib is called no further nib-related decoding should be done as per the documentation).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a Named Color is your project .xcassets\n2. Add a view in an IB file (.xib, storyboard)\n3. Set this view color to the Named Color defined in (1)\n4. In the view's class, override awakeFromNib, and set the view's backgroundColor to another color\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen running the app, the background color of the view is the one defined in awakeFromNib at step 4\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe background color of the view is the one defined in IB, at step 3\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 3 (10L201y)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a sample project reproducing the issue.\nThere are two views of the same class \"MyView\", setting the backgroundColor of the views to `red` in awakeFromNib.\nEach of the two views have a custom background color set in IB, the top one to the custom green color, the bottom one to a blue Named Color defined in our .xcassets file.\n\nWhen running the app, the top view is red as expected, but the bottom one stays blue."
