    description: "Area: AppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI note that in macOS SDK 10.4 with Swift 4.2, all of the identifier/name items have been typealiased to String.\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nWhy this and not conformance to ExpressibleByStringLiteral? \r\n\r\nI have *thousands* of lines of resource extensions that no longer compile due to this change. \r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\nextension NSStoryboard.Name {\r\n    static let about = \"About\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension NSStoryboard.SceneIdentifier {\r\n    static let about = \"About\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nThese are no longer their own strong types - they're just Strings, so I can't have the same ID/Name across the types! \r\n\r\nPlease reconsider this change - it's a huge step backwards for type safety in all of the frameworks."

    title: Type aliasing NSStoryboard.Name, NSStoryboard.SceneIdentifier to String is bad and you should feel bad
