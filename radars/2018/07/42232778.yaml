    description: "Summary:\r\nDeselecting the „Show“ checkbox (and the „Shared“ checkbox) of multiple schemes at once is not possible, but would be very helpful when dealing with a lot of schemes. Currently this is not possible, you have to check each box. See attached gif for how cumbersome this can be #firstworldproblems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 Open an Xcode workspace with many projects & schemes\n2 Open scheme editor\n3 Select all schemes but the ones you want to actually see\n4 Click the „Show“ checkbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe checkbox should toggle for all selected schemes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly one checkbox is toggled\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Alternatively a context menu action could be introduced.\n- A common scenario how to end up with schemes is using CocoaPods for dependencies.\n- The issue arrises when doing fresh git clones or using git worktree, because then the user scheme settings are gone as they are typically part of gitignore\n- Related radars:\n— 41883951 Disabling many tests at once in scheme editor is not possible\n— 41884003 Disabling all but selected tests in Test Navigator is not possible"
