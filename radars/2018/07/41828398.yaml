    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome threads in Messages.app can reliably spin-lock the app when selected. Selecting one of these threads causes Messages.app to hang indefinitely, presenting a pinwheel, until it is forced to quit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Select an affected thread using the left-hand sidebar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Messages.app displays the content of the selected thread.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Messages.app stalls for about 2-3s, and then becomes unresponsive to any input - displaying spinning pinwheel - (and is reported as such in Activity Monitor and Force Quit Applications list. The hang occurs before the thread loads. The blue highlight is applied to the thread's table cell in the left-hand sidebar, but the content pane does not change from the previous thread.\r\n\r\nAffected threads produce the same behavior with 100% reliability, even after multiple quits/relaunches of Messages.app or reboots of the computer.\r\n\r\nSee attached video. At timestamp 3s, you can see me select a new thread's cell. The screen recorder is doing Something Clever(tm), but to me (the user) the system cursor is replaced with a pinwheel at this moment.\r\n\r\nI have included two sysdiagnose files. Each was started just before switching to an affected thread (each is for a different thread). I did not force-quit Messages.app until after the sysdiagnose was completed in either case.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- macOS 10.14 Beta (18A326g)\r\n- Messages Version 12.0 (5500)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- See attached system report\r\n\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nComment:\r\n\r\nMichael Ward\r\nJuly 4 2018, 5:31 PM\r\nI did not state this in the initial report, but it is worth noting that these same threads are perfectly viewable under High Sierra 10.13.5, as well as iOS 11.4 and iOS 12 Beta3 devices.  These threads appear to continue to sync just fine between all devices, and notifications are received for the app-crashing threads on the Mojave machine despite being unable to view them."
