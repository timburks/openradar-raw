    description: "Summary:\r\nFrom my observation, Screen Time posts a notification on Sunday around 9am. I can’t find a way to configure this except by turning screen time off entirely. This should be configurable like other notifications.\n\nI don’t want it in Notification Center because (as Steve Jobs said) I don’t want to be the janitor.\n\nI don’t want sounds. I might be sleeping in on Sunday morning. What happened this morning is the iPad sounded then about 30 seconds later the iPhone sounded.\n\nMaybe there is an option somewhere but I can\x1D’t find it. I tried interacting with the notification and looking for new ‘tuning’ options, and I looked in Settings > Notifications, Settings > Screen Time, and searched Settings for ‘screen time’.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable Screen Time.\nLook for a setting to disable Screen Time notifications.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be settings for Screen Time notifications like other apps that use Notifications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan’t find settings for Screen Time notifications.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 dev beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
