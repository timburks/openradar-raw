    description: "Summary:\r\nI have set my Menu Bar (and also the Dock) to auto hide in order to maximize the screen real estate and also have set up three desktops. This doesn’t work reliably however since sometimes the Menu Bar doesn’t appear. This happens sometimes on an app basis, i.e. if a certain app is in the foreground I can’t get the Menu Bar to appear no matter how often I try by moving the cursor up. Sometimes it’s on a Desktop basis, i.e. on Desktop 1 the Menu Bar doesn’t want to appear.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to change apps or Desktops which depends on the cause of the problem (see above). It’s not a functional bug but nonetheless not nice.\r\n\r\nThe problem doesn’t appear reliably nor consistently. It doesn’t happen every day, can happen with different apps, and different Desktops.\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65), German localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a Mac, Set Menu Bar to auto hide, use the Mac for a few days to do work, you will notice that sometimes the Menu Bar will not appear when you move the cursor up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto hidden Menu Bar should appear always when you call it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAuto hidden Menu Bar doesn’t appear always when you call it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is another bug regarding the auto hidden Menu Bar which is that a fully maximized app (not in Fullscreen mode, but window stretched to the upper edge) sometimes can’t be moved up over where the Menu Bar would be even though it is not visible. I will fill a separate Radar for it."
