    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been having a lot of issues working with Xcode 10, as it hangs and beachballs regularly as I'm editing code. \n\nWith Xcode 10, I need to restart my computer often because it seemingly consumes a lot of resources and makes it really hard to work on anything.\n\nChecking Activity Monitor, I've seen the lldb-rpc-server process take above 1.40GB of memory regularly, even if don't have an active session.\n\nI don't know if this could have something to do with the fact that the project I'm working is _really_ big (about 5k files, and more than 150k loc).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Xcode 10 beta 4.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can smoothly work on my code without Xcode hanging and beachballing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsing Xcode is really frustrating because it seems to not be able to keep up with my typing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to be a regression from Xcode 9, where I can still work smoothly on this same project. Attached you can find a sysdiagnose dump from the last time I had this issue."
