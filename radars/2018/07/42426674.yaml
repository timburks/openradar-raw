    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nSDK Version: iOS 12 beta 4 SDK\r\nTrip previews are always displayed from the first item - the API call is limited to 2 parameters: an array of trip previews and text configuration. It's leading to a bad UX from the user perspective when a user selects an item from the list and then see selected trip previews with functionality to switch between them.\r\n\r\nThe current UX Flow:\r\n1) User opens a list of locations\r\n2) User selects the 2d item from the list of 12 items\r\n3) User sees the preview list of item with \"*1* of 12\" title of trip preview\r\n\r\nThe needed UX Flow (which actually works in Apple Maps):\r\n1) User opens a list of locations\r\n2) User selects the 2d item from the list of 12 items\r\n3) User sees the preview list of item with \"*2* of 12\" title of trip preview\r\n\r\nThis could be done for example by extending -showTripPreviews- with -startingIndex parameter."
