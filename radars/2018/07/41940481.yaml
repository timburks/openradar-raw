    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `--quiet` option to `xcodebuild` is quite useful for CI, where you only want to see what's important if your build fails. Sometimes when the build does fail, you'd like to see more context about commands run around the failure. It would be useful if there was a way to output the full log to a file, while still output the quiet log to stdout, just in case you needed it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use `xcodebuild --quiet`\r\n2. Have a build failure\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou want to see the entire log up to the failure\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't see the whole log\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur current solution to this is to emulate this behavior without using --quiet and instead using `xcodebuild | tee somefile.log | xcpretty`"
