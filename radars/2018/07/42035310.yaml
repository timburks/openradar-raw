    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a situation where a resource bundle hasn’t been accessed/loaded at all yet, embedding a view controller from a storyboard in that resource bundle will crash the app. Manually calling `load()` on the resource bundle works, but outputs an error in console: Cannot find executable for CFBundle (<resource bundle URL>).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create brand new app, add resource bundle and add storyboard to resource bundle\n2. Add 1 scene to this storyboard, with a label in it (for demonstration purposes)\n3. From the main target, embed this view controller using a storyboard link. This requires setting the bundle ID for the resource bundle.\n4. Run the app, it will crash at runtime because the storyboard doesn’t exist\n\n5. Getting a reference to the resource bundle at runtime and calling `load()` on it fixes the problem (but logs said error message in console)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI’m not required to call load() manually and the app doesn’t crash without it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes because it thinks the storyboard doesn’t exist\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached project, run the app and notice it crashes. Then, in AppDelegate.swift, uncomment the `resourceBundle.load()` call and it works as expected (except for the error message in console)."
