    description: "Summary:\r\nBy default, AppKit doesn't always crash on uncaught exceptions. It will catch exceptions thrown on the main thread, preventing the application from crashing, but it will also likely corrupt your processâ€™s state. This is not a good default. It's better to crash than to end up in a corrupted state. This is what iOS does.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can fix this bad behavior by setting the following:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nUserDefaults.standard.register(defaults: [\"NSApplicationCrashOnExceptions\": true])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut most don't know about this, however, which means a lot of apps would silently corrupt their own process state without even knowing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected `\"NSApplicationCrashOnExceptions\": true` to be the default behavior.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`NSApplicationCrashOnExceptions` has to be manually enabled.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMore info: https://docs.fabric.io/apple/crashlytics/os-x.html#uncaught-exceptions\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed in a non-breaking matter by only defaulting to true when linked against the latest macOS SDK."
