    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running a test suite containing many test classes the time taken to complete testing with multiple simulators is not significantly less than running on a single device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the projectâ€™s code from this revision: https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-data-model/archive/c511a7a41289fd8a862d6051fda5a2d6f28cf579.zip\n2. Build its dependencies with `carthage carthage bootstrap --platform iOS`\n3. Build with command `xcodebuild -scheme WireDataModel -enableCodeCoverage YES -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6,OS=latest' -derivedDataPath DerivedData build-for-testing`\n4. Run tests in parallel with command `time xcodebuild -scheme WireDataModel -enableCodeCoverage YES -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6,OS=latest' -derivedDataPath DerivedData -parallel-testing-enabled YES -parallel-testing-worker-count 4  test-without-building`\n5. Run tests on single simulator with command `time xcodebuild -scheme WireDataModel -enableCodeCoverage YES -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6,OS=latest' -derivedDataPath DerivedData -parallel-testing-enabled NO test-without-building`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n6. Tests running in parallel finish much quicker than with parallel testing turned off\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. Tests with 4 simulators finish only 20% quicker than running on a single simulator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 4 (10L213o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that even for moderately large test suites (134 test classes with 1789 tests) the improvement is not significant (tested on i7 2016 MacBookPro):\n4 worker: 191 s (-20%)\n3 worker: 180 s (-25%)\n2 workers: 179 s (-25%)\n1 worker: 231 s (-3%)\nParallel tests disabled: 238 s\n\nAttaching .xcresult of all combinations"
