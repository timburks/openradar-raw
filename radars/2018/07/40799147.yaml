    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn the initial iOS 12 beta, a zoomable UIScrollView configured from a storyboard behaves as if it had wrong insets when zoomed in and out, proportional to log(zoomScale)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn an iOS 12 device or simulator, build and run the attached project. Pinch-zoom in or out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the scrollview content, when zoomed in and out, to align with the top-left edges of the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe scrollview content is inset by some value proportional to the zoom\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5288q)\r\nXcode 10 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIssue appears unchanged in iOS 12 beta 2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the view returned from viewForZooming is given a different 'center' to previous builds. Previously this was set to the center-point of the *scaled* view, but now it is equal to the center of view's *bounds* (ie. unscaled). Since the center property is in superview coordinate-space, not the view's local coordinate space, the latter seems wrong.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mike-ferenduros/ScrollViewZoomBug"
