    description: "Summary:\r\nThe best workaround to show a list of actions currently is to use a \"Choose from list\" action, which is not ideal since a choice doesn't necessarily have to be made. It would be great if a list of items could be shown in a prettier fashion than combining it with newlines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:"
