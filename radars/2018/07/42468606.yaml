    description: "Summary:\r\nA really common workflow for me is:\n\n1. Open a storyboard.\n2. Drag a new view controller from the library.\n3. Using File->New File, create a new subclass of UIViewController.\n(3.5. Switch from the newly-created file back to the storyboard.)\n4. Set the class of the new view controller to the new UIViewController subclass in the identity inspector.\n5. Begin creating outlets and actions.\n\nIt would be cool if there were a menu item that basically automated that process. That way, you could drag a new view controller out, select the menu item (or an associated keyboard shortcut), fill in a name for the new subclass, along with any other relevant details (language, project group to put it in, etc.), and Xcode would automatically create the new source code file _and_ set the class of the view controller in the Storyboard in one step.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 beta 4 (10L213o)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
