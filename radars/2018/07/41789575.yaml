    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen loading an item for a class type via loadItemForTypeIdentifier:options:completionHandler, there's no way to track the provider's progress of loading the item. \r\n\r\nThis could either be achieved by providing a progress block or having the method return an NSProgress instance that the user could observe.\r\n\r\nIn our application, the user can import PDF documents via the Drag & Drop APIs on iOS 11, and for large documents (hundreds or tens of thousands of pages), the UI can't show any other activity indication than a spinning view, making the experience suboptimal for the user that's waiting for the document to be imported.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall loadItemForTypeIdentifier:options:completionHandler on a NSItemProvider instance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a way to track the progress of the loading operation via a progress block or a returned NSProgress instance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way of knowing how far along the loading progress is, making our users feel uncertain about the state of the data import.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
