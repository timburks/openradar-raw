    description: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are missing an an attestation API to authenticate a calling application on the backend side (authenticate the application, not the end user).\r\n\r\nIn some cases we want to limit the access to backend API to our application(s). To achieve this, we generally use an embedded secret to sign the requests sent to our backend. It's a bad pattern and a poor solution compared to a builtin attestation API. \r\n\r\nTalking about that with Apple's engineers at the WWDC 2018, they said that there is no simple solution for achieve that, but either the iOS built-in white box cryptography or secure enclave could be candidates to deliver such an attestation.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\nSÃ©bastien Brault."
