    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have Swift code with a call to NSLocalizedString, and I have a comment in between the arguments to the call, `genstrings` handles this just fine but Xcode's new Export Localization feature throws an error and omits this localized string from the results.\r\n\r\nI've attached a project that demonstrates this. The offending NSLocalizedString call looks like\r\n\r\n        _ = NSLocalizedString(\"This is a value\",\r\n                              // Here is a comment\r\n            comment: \"Here is the localized string comment\")\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run `genstrings` on this project.\r\n2. Run `xcodebuild -exportLocalizations` on this project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth the genstrings output and the exported XLIFF should include the localized string.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe genstrings output includes the localized string but the XLIFF output doesn't, and the xcodebuild call prints an error incorrectly claiming \"Argument is not a literal string\".\r\n\r\nI've attached the genstrings output as well as the Xcode 9.4 XLIFF output.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\nXcode 10.0 (10L201y)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven't tested Obj-C here, just Swift."
