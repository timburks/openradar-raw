    description: "Summary:\r\nI have set my Menu Bar (and also the Dock) to auto hide in order to maximize the screen real estate and also have set up three desktops. I fully maximized my app windows (not Fullscreen mode, but windows stretched to the very top). When you make the Menu Bar visible by moving the cursor up, it overlays all that is beneath it including open app windows.\r\n\r\nSometimes however the app windows move down by the distance the menu bar would take in. This is a glitch since they don’t allow themselves to be pushed up again even if the Menu Bar has hidden itself since. This results in an effectively unusable empty strip of screen real estate on the very top.\r\n\r\nThe problem doesn’t happen reliably and also with different applications. I use Firefox a lot so I naturally experienced it with Firefox most times. Also there is no certain action I can attribute the problem to. I switch Desktops a lot and use Mission Control often and sometimes invoking the Menu Bar combined with some of those swiping gestures the bug appears and the window gets pushed down.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is: Sometimes windows reaching into the Menu Bar area get pushed down instead of the Menu Bar overlaying them AND then they don’t allow to be dragged up again.\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65), German localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a Mac, set Menu Bar to auto hide, maximize app windows to the very top of the screen (not Fullscreen!), use macOS for some time, observe how sometimes app windows get pushed down and then don’t allow to be dragged back up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen invoking the auto hidden Menu Bar it should overlay any visible windows on the desktop if they reach into the very top space where the Menu Bar is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen invoking the auto hidden Menu Bar sometimes windows on the desktop that reach into the very top space where the Menu Bar is get pushed down.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is another issue related to the auto hidden Menu Bar which I’ve filled under the title „Menu Bar sometimes doesn't appear while set to Auto Hide“. I think their causes are separate though I’m not sure."
