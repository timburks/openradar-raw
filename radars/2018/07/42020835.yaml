    description: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSince iOS 11, for privacy and security reasons, the cookies are not shared anymore between Safari and the SafariWebViewController instances. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, it can be useful to be able to share cookies/sessions between Safari and SafariWebViewControllers, for exemple for a user journey beginning in Safari and ending in an application with a specific context after being downloaded from App Store.\r\n\r\nIt would be secure and convenient to have a feature like associated domain to securely associate a domain with an application and share the cookie or session associated to this domain with the application through the SafariWebviewController instances.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\nSÃ©bastien Brault."
