    description: "Summary:\r\nTouchBar is an excellent new input device present on the latest Macs. Unfortunately, software support for it in Xcode is desired to be better.  \n\nBelow are a couple of ideas how TouchBar could be made into more useful space when writing code:\n1. When text cursor is over a symbol, display method signature, or\n2. When text cursor is over some text in the code editor, display refactoring actions that can be done on the given object, symbol, selection or context.\n3. Provide a list of commonly used LLDB commands when the cursor is in the console. Display list of user aliases from .lldbinit is also an option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode > View > Customize Touch Barâ€¦\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRich, customizable set of tools useful while writing code, refactoring and debuting. As described above in description field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVery few trivial tools easily accessible from keyboard or mouse (meaning, accessible on main tool bar)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
