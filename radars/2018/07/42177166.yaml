    description: "Summary:  Opening a file using QuickOpen and keyboard shortcuts crashes Xcode sometimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: While editing file \"Foo.swift\" it is desirable to open \"Bar.swift\" in the assistant editor pane on the right.  To do this, I press Command-SpaceBar to pull up QUickOPen, I type the first few letters of my file until I see the file I want in the list.  While holding down Shift-Command, I double click the file from the list and sometimes this crashes Xcode.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The file \"Bar.swift\" opens in the assistant editor pane.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Usually it works fine, but during the course of a work day, it happens about once an hour and work about 8 times an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode 9.4 (9F1027a)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: MacBook Pro 2017 ( High Sierra 10.13.6)"
