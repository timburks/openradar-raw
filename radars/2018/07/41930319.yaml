    description: "Summary:\r\nOccasionally, after a long duration of screensaver (currently observed with sliding panels' screensaver) screensaver starts to drop frames, temperature of the machine rises rapidly with fan speeding up to catch up. \r\nWhen this happens, even after authentication (password / TouchID) screensaver continues to display unable to see the desktop. \r\n\r\nThe cursor seems to move and keyboard input is recognised; resulting in unexpected operation. This allowed hot corner action to interrupt screensaver by sleeping the display thus resolving the situation temporary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Set screensaver to sliding panels (have not checked if other screensavers causes this less or more likely)\r\n- start screensaver\r\n- wait for an hour or so \r\n- if the Mac struggles (fan ramping up, dropping frames, body heating up) attempt to return to desktop; if needed, authenticate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Desktop re-appear allowing user to see window manager functioning and able to operate macOS\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Screensaver continuing to display\r\n- ability to operate without displaying the desktop\r\n- Hot corner action allowing it to sleep display\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra\r\n10.13.5 (17F77)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch 2017) \r\n2.8GHz Intel Core i7 \r\n16GB LPDDR3\r\n1TB SSD\r\nAMD Radeon Pro 560 + Intel HD Graphics 630"
