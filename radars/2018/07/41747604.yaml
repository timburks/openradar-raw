    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile listening to music I have downloaded on Apple Music with AirPods connected, the audio will sometimes lose some of the high, it sounds like a drop in quality but I'm not sure that's what's going on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI haven't found any specific steps that trigger the issue, it just happens randomly. Also not that I have volume limit, EQ and sound check disabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio quality should not drop during playback, especially for music I have downloaded to my phone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAudio quality randomly drops.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe issue only happens when listening to music with the Music app, I haven't noticed the same issue when listening to podcasts on a 3rd party app."
