    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter extensive trial and error I've determined that macOS 10.13.5 and 10.13.6 randomly kernel panic when a USB audio interface is connected to the Mac via a Thunderbolt 3 dock.  The kernel panics usually occur within 24 hours of the Mac being connected to the dock when the audio interface is plugged in.  Exact times can be found in the attached kernel panic logs.\n\nThe dock in question is the Plugable TBT3-UDV (I've reproduced this issue on two different ones; I thought the dock was defective, so they sent me a new one).  The Macs I've reproduced this on are MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) and MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports).  The audio interfaces I've reproduced this with are the Scarlett 2i2 (1st ten) and the Audient iD4.\n\nConnecting the same audio interfaces directly to the Mac's USB port and the dock to the other port prevents the kernel panic from occurring.\n\nI've tried reinstalling macOS, using different USB ports, using different docks, using different USB cables, using different power supplies for all devices involved, and so on.  It took me weeks to narrow this down to this specific cause.  I am unable to determine a specific trigger for these kernel panics.\n\n15 kernel panics are attached, 14 from one Mac (mine) and 1 from another (my wife's).\n\nTo my knowledge these kernel panics did not occur in macOS 10.13.4 and earlier (I purchased and have been using the TBT3-UDV in November of 2017 and had used it without issue for a while with the Scarlett 2i2 attached).\n\nOne thing to note: When these kernel panics occur Bluetooth does not function at the login screen after the restart, but does start working after logging in.\n\nOne other thing to note: I have a Magic Trackpad 2, and when the trackpad is connected to the Mac via Bluetooth and one of these kernel panics occurs the Trackpad stops working all together, not even providing haptic feedback.  I need to flip its switch off and on again to get it to function again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect a USB audio interface, like the ones mentioned above, to a Thunderbolt 3 dock's USB ports, like the TBT3-UDV mentioned above, and then use the Mac normally.  Random kernel panics will then occur, sometimes in minutes, sometimes in hours, but almost always within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo kernel panics should occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKernel panics!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only viable workaround I've found so far is to connect the audio interface to the Mac directly instead of using the USB ports on the Thunderbolt 3 dock."
