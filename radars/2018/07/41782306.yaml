    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have used xcode-select to select a particular version of Xcode as the active version, using `xed .` to open the Xcode project in the current directory wonâ€™t necessarily use the version you have selected. It seems to maybe be using a version determined by Launch Services or some possibly nondeterministic mechanism. It should use the output of `xcode-select -p` (or whatever mechanism xcode-select is using) to determine which version of Xcode to use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have both Xcode 9.4 and Xcode 10b2 installed on macOS 10.13.5 (17F77).\r\n2. Use xcode-select -s to switch to Xcode 9.4.\r\n3. Use xed to use Xcode to open an Xcode project in Xcode.\r\n4. Notice that it opens as expected in Xcode 9.4.\r\n5. Use xcode-select -s to switch Xcode 10b2 to the active Xcode.\r\n6. Use xed again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nxed uses Xcode 10b2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxed uses Xcode 9.4.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.4 (9F1027a) on macOS 10.13.5 (17F77)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
