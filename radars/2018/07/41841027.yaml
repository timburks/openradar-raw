    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe rewritten DVD Player app in macOS Mojave 10.14 (18A326g) lacks AppleScript support, hindering users with remote controls in a HTPC (Home Theater PC) setup from using the software in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- try to control DVD Player.app with AppleScript.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected DVD Player.app to provide an AppleScript interface for third party apps like remote control software, to allow users to control DVD Player.app with an input device of their choice. I expected this AppleScript interface to provide support for controlling at least this functionality:\r\n- DVD menu control (property \"shows menu\" + left/right/up/down/select commands)\r\n- Play, Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind\r\n- Control volume\r\n- Skip Chapter forward/backward\r\n- Go to main menu\r\n- Select subtitles and turn subtitles on/off\r\n- Select audio track\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDVD Player.app can't be controlled through AppleScript.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14 (18A326g)\r\nDVD Player 6.0 (5500.72), Framework-Version 5.9.6 \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina 15.4\" (mid-2012)"
