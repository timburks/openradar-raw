    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen rendering an HTML list into a PDF using UIPrintPageRenderer, page breaks work perfectly when the text is left aligned, however the page is cropped inside the page bounds when the text is center aligned.\r\n\r\nI've tried various methods of layout for the list e.g. <table>, <div>, <ul>, and they all appear the same. The page break is still rendered in the PDF, however it is inside the 2nd page of the document because the first page has been cut short.\r\n\r\nThe same HTML printed to a PDF from Safari on macOS works fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've created a new project to demonstrate the issue. You can switch between the three different versions of the HTML, and for each of the three, you can switch between center and left aligned text. It will then show the print preview of the generated PDF to demonstrate the problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhether the text is aligned left or center, the page break should render at the end of the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the text is center aligned, the page break is rendered in the middle of the second page.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1\r\nTested on both iOS11 and iOS12 devices and simulators. Results the same on all."
