    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Shortcuts app in iOS 12 to create Siri Shortcuts is very powerful, but it would be much nicer to use if it supported dragging URL's and Text directly into the actions list of a workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the Shortcuts app and Safari side-by-side in Split view.\n2. Create a new Shortcut\n3. Go to macstories.net in Safari\n3. Drag the URL from the location bar of Safari into empty actions list in Shortcuts app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to drop the URL and have a \"URL\" action created with the content of the dropped URL: https://www.macstories.com/\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt isn't possible to drop the URL.\n\nYou need to create a URL action manually and drag from Safari and into the text field of this action for drag and drop to work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5327f)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe example given is for a URL but the exact equivalent could be said when trying to drop text into the action list. Shortcuts should create a new \"Text\" action with the dropped text.\n\nA video illustrating this is attached."
