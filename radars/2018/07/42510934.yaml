    description: "The Apple Event Sandbox implementation as of macOS 10.14 Mojave beta 2 (18A314h) lacks essential APIs that apps would need to adapt to and provide a good user experience around the change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIssues with current implementation\r\n\r\n1) timing: apps don't have sufficient control over when the user is prompted for authorization\r\n\r\n2) authorization can't be re-requested. F.ex. in response to a click on an \"Authorize\" button in an alert stating that the app lacks a permission.\r\n\r\n3) lack of context: users lack usage descriptions to inform their decision.\r\n\r\n4) apps canâ€™t query if permission has been granted or not\r\n\r\nPlease provide APIs to request for timing the authorisation (when is prompted), for authorisation to be re-requested, for adjusting the description of the authorisation pop up and for checking if permission has been granted or not."
