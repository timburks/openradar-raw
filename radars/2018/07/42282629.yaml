    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are a lot of glitches with the back button in the left corner of the status bar on iPad. They appear in several different occasions which are all related to switching apps.\r\n\r\n1. Open app switcher\r\nWhen swiping up to invoke the app switcher out of an app, the „go back“ button quickly appears with the current application name before the blur of the app switcher hides it.\r\n\r\n2. Closing app switcher\r\nWhen closing the app switcher to the same application that you opened it from, the back button quickly appears with the current application name before it quickly disappears again.\r\n\r\n3. While invoking Siri out of an app\r\nSee GIF below.\r\n\r\n4. While actually switching apps\r\nThe arrow of the back button overlaps the airplane mode icon.\r\n\r\nYou can most certainly find other actions where the back button appears while it shouldn’t. The animations in iOS are generally too many and interfere with each other, this is only one example of this problem.\r\n\r\nAlways reproducible, iOS 11.4.1, iPad Air 2, German language localization\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake iPad, open some app out of which you can open another (e.g. Twitter and links can open in Safari), invoke action which changes to other app, observe animation of back button in upper left corner. Try opening app switcher from an app and closing it while observing the animation of the back button. Watch how the back button glitches and overlaps the Airplane Mode icon if the iPad is in Airplane mode (Wifi On).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGo back button in top left corner of status bar should appear correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGo back button in top left corner of status bar doesn’t appear correctly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee GIF of number 3 here: https://twitter.com/philmcole/status/957197514817589249"
