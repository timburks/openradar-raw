    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Shortcuts app is translated to a number of languages, but this seems to have been done with no regard for context where many things are translated word-for-word even when they refer to specific technical terms that should not be translated.\n\nI highlight one example that is easy to reproduce but it is a overall problem with the Shortcuts app that translations are done without any kind of context as if made by someone that does not know the Shortcuts app or the Workflow app it derives from.\n\nIf you made a Music app in Danish you shouldn't translate artist names into the local language. Same goes for the shortcuts app. There are things that should never be translated.\n\n\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download shortcuts app\n2. Switch your device to the Danish language.\n3. Open Shortcuts app (called Genveje in Danish)\n3. Create new shortcut\n4. Add the \"Get Contents of URL\" and tap \"Avanceret\"\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH & DELETE should appear as is. They are not supposed to be translated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHTTP methods are shown as HENT, POST, PUT, PATCH & SLET which makes very little sense.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5318d)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
