    description: Often copying email address from various apps can be difficult whether it's in an iMessage bubble, Twitter DM, link on the web etc. This is in part because the text may be just that or it might be a "mailto:" link. Often the resulting copied text is prepended with this "mailto:" bit. When pasted into email fields (like in Contacts) "mailto:" should be automatically removed since it's A) what the user expects and B) easy to miss and difficult to edit (causing confusion down the line when the user goes to email a contact)
