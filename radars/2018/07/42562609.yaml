    description: "Summary:\r\nWebSockets have become ubiquitous across the web in the last few years. Every major browser now supports it out of the box and more and more services are adopting it. Similar to the reasons Foundation provides a high performance, clean implementation for HTTP with URLSession, it makes sense to do the same for WebSockets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a service that uses WebSockets.\n2. Be told that the web front end team finished integrating it weeks ago.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn out of the box api to sit alongside, or on top of, URLSession.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently apps that want to take advantage of WebSockets need to either use a 3rd party library or write their own implementation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
