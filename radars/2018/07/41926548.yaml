    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #41907566\n\nIn our application we allow users to export PDF pages to other applications from a document editor via the iOS 11 Drag & Drop APIs. However, we have no visibility as to where the drop is going to be performed, thus hampering our ability to provide an optimal user experience.\n\nHaving a way to dynamically react to drop proposals from the destination application, our application could, for instance, export a PDF document when the drop location accepts kUTTypePDF or export an image from the page when the drop location accepts a kUTTypeImage.\n\nThere would have to be coordination between the drag and the drop delegates to notify the source that an accepted data type has been updated on the drop delegate, so that the drag delegate can update the UIDragItem associated with the drag session with the appropriate item provider for the accepted data type.\n\n`UICollectionViewDropDelegate` already implements this kind of behavior in - collectionView:dropSessionDidUpdate:withDestinationIndexPath.\n\nI believe having this capability could further improve the usefulness of the Drag & Drop APIs.\n\nOne workaround I tried was starting the drag session with two UIDragItems, one PDF (url) and one UIImage â€” however, this is represented as two individual items to be dragged out of our application. \n\nWhen dragging those items over to Photos.app, it would make sense to Photos.app to pick only the image drop. And if I take that drag session over to Files, for instance, to pick only the PDF drop. The UI would also need to be updated somehow so that it shows as only 1 item (this setup shows a (2) badge on the drag items).\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nImplement Drag & Drop for an application that can export multiple file representations for an item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's a way to communicate, either preemptively or reactively, to the drag source what types of items the expected drop location accepts so that the source can export items in a useful representation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce the drag session is initiated, there's no way to update an existing item provider with new information based on expected/accepted item types from the drop destination.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"

    title: When interacting with the Drag & Drop APIs on iOS 11, there's no way to dynamically update the item providers based on the proposed drop location capabilities.
