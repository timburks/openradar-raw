    description: "Summary:\r\nWith a Swift static library with these characteristics:\n\n1. SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE=wholemodule\n2. ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES\n3. You have 2 files with a specific order in the Compile Sources phase\n\nThe test coverage report fails to be generated with this error:\n\n```\nFailed to generate coverage for target 'WMOCoverageTests.xctest' at path /Users/ksmiley/Downloads/WMOCoverage/build.noindex/WMOCoverage/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/WMOCoverageTests.xctest/WMOCoverageTests: Malformed instrumentation profile data\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Swift static library project\n2. Add a test target for your library\n3. Create 2 source files Foo and Bar, add top level functions in both, reorder the Compile Sources build phase to have Bar first\n4. Add a single test file BarTests, add a test calling the function in Bar\n5. Enable testability and WMO for your library\n6. Configure a scheme to run the tests and gather coverage data\n7. Run the tests and view the coverage report\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA code coverage report is generated showing Foo.swift has 0% coverage and Bar.swift has 100% coverage\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get this error:\n\n```\nFailed to generate coverage for target 'WMOCoverageTests.xctest' at path /Users/ksmiley/Downloads/WMOCoverage/build.noindex/WMOCoverage/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/WMOCoverageTests.xctest/WMOCoverageTests: Malformed instrumentation profile data\n```\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 4 (10L213o)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Use the attached sample project as an example\n- Disabling testability fixes this\n- Using incremental compilation instead of WMO fixes this\n- Putting Foo.swift above Bar.swift in the Compile Sources build phase fixes this\n- The test log, xccovreport, and profdata are attached"
