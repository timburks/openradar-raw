    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scrolling a web page using the arrow keys, pressing down reveals more of the document. However, with PDFs one must press the up arrow instead, to move the document upwards (as if dragging upwards with a finger on an iPad).  This is inconsistent with HTML pages as well as with previous versions of Safari, which treated PDFs the same as HTML pages when scrolling with the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari (or Safari Technology Preview; the bug is present in both) on High Sierra.\r\n2. Navigate to a PDF.\r\n3. If necessary, zoom in so some of the content extends off the screen.\r\n4. Use the arrow keys to scroll the PDF.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you press the down arrow key, it should scroll lower parts of the page into view.  When you press the up arrow key, it should bring the upper part of the page back into view. (And similarly for the left/right arrow keys.)\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe arrow keys scroll in the direction opposite to what one would typically expect in a web browser.\r\n\r\nScrolling on HTML pages works normally; only PDF documents are affected.  The page up and page down keys (as well as spacebar/shift-space) for paging work normally on both HTML and PDF.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nI see this on both\r\nSafari Version 11.0 (13604.1.25.3.2) on High Sierra\r\nSafari Technology Preview Release 34 (Safari 11.0, WebKit 13604.1.27.0.1) on High Sierra\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A291j) on a Late 2014 iMac 27\" Retina 5K."
