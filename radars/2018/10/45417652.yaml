    description: "AVKit\r\n\r\nWe at VLC and our Users would love to adopt and use Picture in Picture on iOS and Mac to display our video content but are currently unable to do so since we're not using AVPlayer to render and display our Video content. Instead we are using OpenGL directly and are therefore unable to work with the existing API that requires an AVPlayerLayer.\r\nThere used to be a way in the past see\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/b3ll/status/610957432278392832\r\n\r\nbut this way of rendering has since then been made unavailable."
