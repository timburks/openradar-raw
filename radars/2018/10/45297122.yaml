    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: I have implemented Associated Domains for my app and everything seems to be downloading correctly:\r\n1. The file is available at https://chesstacticsapp.com/apple-app-site-association\r\n2. The console shows that it downloads the association file successfully: \r\nStarted request for domain 'chesstacticsapp.com', URL 'https://chesstacticsapp.com/apple-app-site-association'\r\nCompleting request for 'https://chesstacticsapp.com/apple-app-site-association', status 0/0x0 noErr\r\n\r\n3. BUT, when I actually try to use a password field, I get:\r\n[AutoFill] Cannot show Automatic Strong Passwords for app bundleID: com.plivesey.chesstactics due to error: Cannot save passwords for this app. Make sure you have set up Associated Domains for your app and AutoFill Passwords is enabled in Settings\r\n\r\n4. I've checked settings and I do have autofill enabled\r\n\r\n(Note, password filling works for the password field. It doesn't work though for the new password field). It doesn't work when creating a new account.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee above. Basically, the feature does not work at all for my app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPassword autofill works. When creating a new account with a new password field, it should recommend a strong password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app only shows the keyboard and doesn't show any options. It also shows an error.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0.1\r\nXcode Version 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOn device (iPhone 6s)"
