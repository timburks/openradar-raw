    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running unit tests for a Framework, Xcode does not attach to the process and therefore does not run the unit tests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a Cocoa Touch framework in Xcode in Swift, with \"Include Unit Tests\" selected\r\n2. Select the iPhone X simulator as the run destination\r\n3. Run unit tests in Xcode with Command-U or Product > Test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode runs the tests successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode fails to run the tests at all, and a dialog appears that says \"Could not attach to pid : <pid>\". The body of the error message says: \"Ensure <FrameworkTests> is not already running, and <username> has permission to debug it.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached SampleFramework project shows the error. Just run the unit tests on the iPhone X simulator and observe the error."
