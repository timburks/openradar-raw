    description: "Area:\r\nAirPlay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen playing an audio file to an Apple TV through AirPlay from an iPhone, duration property from NowPlayingInfo metadata (MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration) is incorrectly displayed: maximum value it can display is -13:31:35, which equals to 48.695 seconds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload a sample app, and play a file that is longer than 13 hours 31 minute 35 seconds.\r\nSample app: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/MPRemoteCommandSample/Introduction/Intro.html\r\nModified version with `self.player.allowsExternalPlayback = false` and added long asset is attached as zip file. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the beginning the playback slider displays correct remaining time, which is equal to file duration. As playback progresses and reaches the end, playback slider displays correct remaining time. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn the beginning the playback slider displays incorrect remaining time, boxed to 13 hours 31 minute 35 seconds. If duration value is less than that, the value is correct. As playback progresses past 13:31:35, playback slider displays incorrect remaining time. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\ntvOS 11.4.1 (15M73)\r\niOS 11.4.1 (15G77)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApp base SDK 10.0, freshly set up Apple TV gen 4 (A1625 32 GB)"
