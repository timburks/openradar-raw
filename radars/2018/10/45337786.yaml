    description: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of UIImagePickerController doesn't allow the selection of multiple medias.  It would be really helpful to have an option to enable a multi select mode on this component. \r\n\r\nToday the only ways are to implement a media picker from scratch which can take a few days or a few weeks (depending on the quality), the other way is to use one of the many libraries out there (random quality / stability).\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are so many open source libraries is maybe a sign that this should be implemented in the framework itself.\r\n\r\nI hope this suggestion will catch your attention.\r\n\r\nThank You"
