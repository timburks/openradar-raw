    description: "Summary: \r\nOn an iPad Pro 10.5\" running iOS 12 GM (16A366), most of the items in my library (containing ~150 items) are duplicated (exactly two copies of most ePubs, most PDFs, some iBooks purchased from the Store). Restarting the device doesn't seem to help. Removing a PDF (for example) and re-adding it from either a Mac on the same iCloud account or directly on the device will result in it being duplicated in every instance I've tried. This issue doesn't occur on my Mac running Mojave nor my iPhone X running iOS 12.1 beta 1 (nor did it happen on the phone when it was running iOS 12 GM). Filtering the view via search or selecting a collection prevents duplicates from showing; duplicates only appear when viewing the unfiltered library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch Books on the iPad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach item appears once\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMost items appear twice\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 GM (16A366)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 10.5\" Wi-Fi (A1701, MQDW2LL/A)\r\nsysdiagnose attached"
