    description: "The Enable Caps Lock setting (settings->general->Keyboards) is not honored by the Smart Keyboard. Tapping the caps lock key still toggles the keyboard between normal and caps-lock behavior. The current state of Caps-lock is not immediately apparent.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to disable caps lock for hardware keyboards. In addition, it would be useful to be able to remap caps lock to the Control or Escape keys, much like one is able to do on MacOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDisable The “Enable Caps Lock” setting in the settings app. Type on the keyboard. Hit caps lock. Type again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Caps Lock to have no impact on the capitalization of letters typed on the keyboard. Also, I would like to be able to repurpose the caps lock key for something mode useful\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe caps lock key still impacts the letter capitalization.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n10.5” iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil."
