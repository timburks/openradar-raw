    description: "When exporting/importing for localization (Editor menu), you getting the last folder you've exported/imported to, and this is very good for importing, but for exporting I should always go 1 folder up ('cause xCode creating new folder and there it putting the .xcloc file).\r\n\r\nSo my suggesting is that xCode will go automatically 1 folder up when exporting for localization (you may want to put it as optional setting for those are won't want this).\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nLet the developer choose if they want xCode to create the .xcloc file in a new folder or just create it.\r\n\r\n***Note that when the localizations' folder name is the same name as the project itself (like it is now) it may cause overriding on the project itself, not a funny thing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIdo."
