    description: "Summary:\r\nThe prime example of AVAudioSession documentation was broken with Swift 4.2: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that the `setCategory(_:)` function was incorrectly marked as unavailable in Swift 4.2, making it impossible to set AVAudioSession category on iOS 9 and older using Swift 4.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a Swift project for iOS 9 (or older)\r\n2. Try to build with Xcode 10.0 or Xcode 10.1 Beta 3 using Swift 4.2:\r\n\r\nimport AVFoundation;\r\nlet foo: Void = {\r\n    if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {\r\n        _ = try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, mode: .default, options: [])\r\n    } else {\r\n        // Required for iOS 9 and older\r\n        // Works in Swift 4.1 and in Objective-C, but not in Swift 4.2\r\n        _ = try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback)\r\n    }\r\n}()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should build without warnings. AVAudioSession.setCategory(_:) should be available in Swift 4.2 for iOS 9 and older the same way as it's available with its Objective-C counterpart `setCategory:error:` (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/1616583-setcategory) \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStarting with Swift 4.2, we get the error \"'setCategory' is unavailable in Swift\". This problem is also mentioned at https://forums.swift.org/t/using-methods-marked-unavailable-in-swift-4-2/14949.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nStackOverflow thread on the matter (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52413107/avaudiosession-setcategory-availability-in-swift-4-2) has suggested two working workarounds for setCategory unavailability:\r\n* Use Swift 4.1 instead of Swift 4.2  (-_-')\r\n* Use Objective-C instead of Swift 4.2 (-_-'')\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 + Swift + iOS 9\r\nXcode 10.1 beta 3 + Swift + iOS 9"
