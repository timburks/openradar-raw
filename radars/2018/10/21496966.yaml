    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"Log In\" link in the upper-left part of the new Developer Forum pages doesn't work. Instead one must log in via other means (e.g., the Member Center page).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to https://forums.developer.apple.com/\r\n2. click \"Log in\" in the upper-left part of the page.\r\n3. Enter your Apple ID username/password\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should log you in and return you to the forum.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get this error message:  This Apple ID cannot be used for this service. Please create a new Apple ID.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm hardly alone in this.  People have been complaining in the \"dev forum feedback\" section of the forum for weeks now: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/5452\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLogging into other developer websites (such as http:// bugreporter.apple.com/ or http://developer.apple.com/membercenter/ or the old forum http://devforums.apple.com/ for that matter) works just fine. Once logged in via another site one can then return to the new forum and use it normally."
