    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a client with Profile Manager on Mac mini.\r\nProfile Manager was set up when Open Directory was mandatory for its operation.\r\nMac mini was later bound to AD.\r\nProfile Manager now exclusively uses AD groups and AD users\r\nProfile Manager was working fine with 10.13.4 and Server 5.6.1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Upgrade 10.13.4 and Server 5.6.1 to 10.14 and Server 5.7.1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Everything works OK\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Sync of users and groups from directories is broken.\r\n- Atempt to sync directory users to (using refresh button in Profile Manager) ends with :\r\n EXCEPTION:  NSError <-[ODRequestor _nodeWithName:] (ODRequestor.m:532): \"(Error Domain=com.apple.OpenDirectory Code=2000 \"Node name wasn't found.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Node name wasn't found., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Node name wasn't found.})\">\r\n    USERINFO: {\r\n        NSLocalizedDescription = \"Node name wasn't found.\";\r\n        NSLocalizedFailureReason = \"Node name wasn't found.\";\r\n\r\n- More in attached log\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nServer 5.7.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what information/log files do you need AND/OR how should I troubleshoot this.\r\n\r\nOn related note. Is it possible to turn off legacy Open Directory? In attemp to do so it says: \"Are you sure you want to stop Open Directory service? Stopping Open Directory will permanently delete Profile Manager data associated with local network users. This operation cannot be undone\". What exactly will happen when I do this?"
