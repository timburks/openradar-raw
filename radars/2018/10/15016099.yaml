    description: "Summary:\r\nA number of man pages are useless as they are simply copies of a template and have not been edited to contain useful information.  iconservicesd(1),  bluetoothaudiod(1), KeychainMigrator(1), GoogleSyncMigrate(1), languagesetup(1), etc. are all completely useless man pages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. run \"man iconservicesd\" on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd expect a document describing the daemon.  (Or perhaps no result at all, as is the case with so many daemons.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niconservicesd(1)          BSD General Commands Manual         iconservicesd(1)\r\n\r\nNAME\r\n     iconservicesd, Other_name_for_same_program(), Yet another name for the\r\n     same program. -- This line parsed for whatis database.\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n     iconservicesd, [-abcd] [-a path] [file] [file ...] arg0 arg2 ...\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n     Use the .Nm macro to refer to your program throughout the man page like\r\n     such: iconservicesd, Underlining is accomplished with the .Ar macro like\r\n     this: underlined text.\r\n\r\n     A list of items with descriptions:\r\n\r\n     item a   Description of item a\r\n\r\n     item b   Description of item b\r\n\r\n     A list of flags and their descriptions:\r\n\r\n     -a       Description of -a flag\r\n\r\n     -b       Description of -b flag\r\n\r\nFILES\r\n     /usr/share/file_name                          FILE_1 description\r\n     /Users/joeuser/Library/really_long_file_name  FILE_2 description\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO\r\n     a(1), b(1), c(1), a(2), b(2), a(3), b(3)\r\n\r\nDarwin                        September 17, 2013                        Darwin\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nThese man pages are in OS X 10.9 build 13A584 â€¦ I don't think they're online yet.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA quick way to find these is to run the following command:\r\n    grep \"Description of -a flag\" /usr/share/man/man*/*\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
