    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an iPhone running iOS 12 is connected using iAp over Bluetooth, apps are registered to the SYNC 3 module. Shortly after the apps have registered iAP disconnects. However, there is no notification about this disconnect to the SYNC3 module.This leaves the app icon visible on the SYNC module and still allows the user to tap on it revealing a nonfunctional app. Issue can be seen with all SYNC 3 compatible apps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to SYNC 3 module via Bluetooth.\r\n2. App registers to SYNC 3 module using iAP over Bluetooth.\r\n3. open app on SYNC 3 module. (You will be presented with an empty template)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niAp should stay connected after apps have registered to SYNC 3 module and user should be able to access a fully functioning app. \r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niAp disconnects after app connects to SYNC 3 module and users access app that is nonfunctional.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 public release"
