    description: "The Mac App Store does not check to see if a user purchased or downloaded software when performing updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create an application with the same bundle ID as any app on the App Store\r\n- (Make sure you are signed into your MAS account)\r\n- App Store will *automatically* update the software as long as the bundle ID matches and version is < AppStore version... even if the user NEVER downloaded it from the AppStore.\r\n\r\nThis is poor practice and could lead to a serious hack! Imagine someone could get software for free using this kind of technique, by spoofing a bundle ID. I'm testing this out right now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- App Store should CONFIRM\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Software gets overridden\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n- All known versions of MAS, including 10.14\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n- 10.14\r\n\r\n\r\nSee my earlier (ignored) bug report of this issue. 34051868 (not posted here; from August 2017)."
