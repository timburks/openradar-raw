    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUILable text is not align vertically correctly with accented languages/fonts.\r\nFor example, Hebrew, it has letters that written in the same hight of english letters, but there are letters that can have some accents above or below it.\r\nRight now the accented part is just cutting off from the label (unless we adding some padding, but it still won't be aligned vertically correctly.\r\n\r\nThis bug affecting also on the subtitles in videos (you should add there also a little but more padding), on buttons' text, on the navigation bar's buttons' text and so on.\r\nThe solution for this problem is quite simple, you just have to do some little checking in the drawText(in rect:) function of the UILabel class, and then recalculate it's hight based on the font hight, what will also solve the vertical align problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust make some UILabel and change it text to accented language text (such as Hebrew, with for example those letters: ״אלקץ״ that all of them will reproduce the problem, except ״א״).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should be aligned vertically correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text it cutting off the UILabel.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0.1 (16A404)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X 64GB\r\nThe language is set to Hebrew"
