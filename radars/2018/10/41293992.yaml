    description: "Summary:\r\nMy iMac upgraded to beta 2 overnight. When I came in to work this morning none of my open windows were minimizable. (The yellow button in the window frame and the Minimize menu item were both disabled.) \r\n\r\nNewly created windows, on the other hand, are minimizable. So for example all existing TextEdit windows are minimizable, but if I create a new window it will be minimizable. The original windows remain unminimizable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run beta 1 on a Mac.\r\n2. Have it configured to restore app/window state when logging back in.\r\n3. Install beta 2 and allow it to reboot.\r\n4. Wait until it logs you back in and restores all your windows.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe minimize command should be available for all windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMinimize only works for newly created windows. All windows that were restored automatically can't be minimized.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots of some windows that can't be minimized. This appears to affect all apps that were restored automatically at login.\r\n\r\nI have not yet tried rebooting to see if this will again be the case when windows are restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14/18A314h\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)"
