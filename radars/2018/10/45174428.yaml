    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUINavigationController has a special animation for hiding the navigation bar when it is done in viewWillAppear.  This should slide the navigation bar horizontally. Unfortunately when this is done from a view controller that is embedded in a split view's navigation controller the special animation is not here and the navigation bar shrinks vertically. This is a problem for a few reasons\r\n\r\n- It can expose content beneath the navigation bar which isn't meant to be seen (eg. the background color of a split view)\r\n- The interactivity of the animation is lost when using the interactive back gesture\r\n- It just looks a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCheck out the sample app here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chrishawkinsnz/WonkyNavigationBarHidingAnimtionInSplitView \r\n\r\nTo see the proper animation:\r\nSelecting \"Show in NavigationController\" then select \"push\"\r\n\r\nTo see the wonky animation\r\nSelecting \"Show in Split View\" then select \"push\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere is the proper navigation bar hiding animation on pushing in a split view context\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe animation is wonky and the navigation bar slides up\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.0 at least\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
