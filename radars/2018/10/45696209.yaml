    description: "Summary:\r\nsimctl io has a recordVideo operation, which lets you specify a mask as an option. From the docs:\n\n```\n  --mask       For non-rectantular displays, handle the mask by policy:\n\t                 ignored: The mask is ignored and the unmasked framebuffer is saved.\n\t                 black: The mask is rendered black.\n```\n\nPassing in —mask=ignored, however, doesn’t seem to do anything. The output is the same as specifying no option, which is the same as passing in —mask=black\n\nThe mask option seems to work for the screenshot operation, however.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iOS simulator\n2. Open a Terminal\n3. Run the line: xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo --mask=ignored ~/Desktop/test.mp4\n4. Switch to the simulator and open some apps, navigate around them, etc.\n5. Switch back to the terminal and stop the recording\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince the mask is to be ignored, the generated video file should be fullscreen, with no black areas for the sensor housing and rounded corners\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe mask is used in all but the very first screen at the start of the recording, and it is black thereafter. This is the same behaviour as passing in no options or the black option\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
