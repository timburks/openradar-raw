    description: "The `info` dictionary in `didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo` isn't filled with the `.phAsset` key if the user doesn't give the developer/app full access to its photo library.\r\n\r\nFrom a permission point of view it might perfectly sense but:\r\n\r\n1/ Nothing specifies/reminds it in the documentation\r\n2/ The developer is likely to elect `UIImagePickerController` instead of full access for obvious privacy reasons, which is then confusing.\r\n\r\nI suggest that single phAsset is given, even without full access permission, since this is my understanding of the usage `UIImagePickerController`."
