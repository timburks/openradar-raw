    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari can't seem to load pages from https://secure.taptogo.net/\r\n\r\nThis is a big problem for anyone in Los Angeles County who rides Metro buses/trains or buses run by several other transit agencies.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to http://taptogo.net/\r\n2. Click the orange \"Go to Sign In\" button on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould get to the login page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get this error instead:\r\n\r\nSafari can’t open the page “https://secure.taptogo.net/ecustomer_enu/start.swe?SWECmd=Start&amp;amp;SWEHo=secure.taptogo.net” because the server unexpectedly dropped the connection. This sometimes occurs when the server is busy. Wait for a few minutes, and then try again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 8.0 (10600.1.3.41) OS X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt doesn't work in Safari on iOS 8 either.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet tried older versions of Safari on OS X or iOS. I'll try to do so later.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10 (14A314h) on iMac (27-inch, Late 2009)"
