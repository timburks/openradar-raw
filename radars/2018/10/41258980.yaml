    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDouble-clicking in text should select by word. Triple-clicking should select an entire paragraph. This functionality is not present in News (or presumably any Mac UIKit app)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an article in News\r\n2. Double-click some text.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should select the word containing the point where you clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf you double-click (or triple-click) and then drag, it just selects by individual character rather than by word (or paragraph).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.14/18A293u\r\n\r\nNews 4.0 (CFBundleVersion 1572.10.5 â€¦ I had to dig it out of Info.plist manually, as the About window in UIKit apps is useless.)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A"
