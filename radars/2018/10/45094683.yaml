    description: "Area:\r\nXCTest\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSetting orientation on the XCUIDevice within a test bundle fails the first time ever but works subsequent times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n```\r\n    XCUIDevice *device = [XCUIDevice sharedDevice];\r\n    device.orientation = UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft;\r\n```\r\nAdd this to a brand new project in a test case and execute the test.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOrientation should change and no crash to occur\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI believe orientation appears to change in the simulator but then a crash and test failure occurs only for the first test.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If the simulator is already running an at least a single test run was attempted any subsequent attempts will successfully pass.\r\n\r\nException message:\r\n```\r\nUI Test Activity: \r\nAssertion Failure: XCUIDeviceOrientationCrashTests.m:19: Failed to set orientation: Error Domain=XCTDaemonErrorDomain Code=15 \"Timed out waiting for confirmation of orientation change.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Timed out waiting for confirmation of orientation change.}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10 (10A254a)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone XR Simulator\r\n\r\nSee also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52426297/swift-timeout-when-unit-testing-orientation-changes-after-upgrading-to-xcode-10\r\n\r\nHappens in both Swift and ObjC and also happens in both legacy and new build system."
