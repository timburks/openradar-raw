    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile swiping change orientation from landscape to portrait and sometimes you will see that the page controller shows half of previous view controller and half of next view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup page view controller with some view controllers\r\n2. Put device to landscape orientation\r\n3. Start a swipe gesture until more that half of view of next view controller appears then change orientation to portrait and during orientation changes release swipe gesture.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhole view of next view controller shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nView of next view controller shown partly or page view controller shows wrong view controller (view controller from what the swipe gesture started)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11, iOS 12\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nany iPhone\r\n\r\nNote: when view controllers have more complex UI (auto layout) then this problem occurs more often and reproduces even easier."
