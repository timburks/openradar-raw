    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of the \"Name\" column in a Finder list view will be stretched horizontally.  Other fields (Size, Kind, Date, etc.) are unaffected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Put a Finder window into list view\r\n2.  Resize the filename column and watch the list of filenames while you do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nText and icons should be rendered correctly at all column widths, with the filename possibly truncated or condensed if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSometimes an icon and filename will be drawn wrong, scaled horizontally as shown in the attached images.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI haven't seen this in previous versions of the Finder."
