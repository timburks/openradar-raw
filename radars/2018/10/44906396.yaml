    description: "Cell swipe actions can only be revealed with used interaction. There is no way to reveal those actions programmatically. `UITableView` should provide a method to reveal and hide cell swipe actions.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need that? Let's look at following example:\r\niOS users know that table cell can be removed by swiping it right, but they will not know about any additional non-standard swipe action. Short initial automatic swipe and unswipe would increase discoverability of any additional swipe actions."
