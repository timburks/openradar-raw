    description: "Summary:\r\nText shortcuts no longer sync between iOS and Mac.\n\nFunny story, true story. I used to rely on TextExpander for these kinds of things, they did a pretty swell job, but when they changed to subscription pricing I decided, 'Apple makes software, why not use them'.\n\nSo I went at it full hog, https://gist.github.com/pjaspers/b152e67b47472828ba60a81d68535476 and while there were some syncing woes in the early days (but that got fixed when the shortcuts went iCloud), it was working well for me. Alas, those days seem to be gone.\n\niPhone and iPad can still make new shortcuts and see them sync almost instantaneously (which makes sense, they are devices of the future). But my trusty Mac, Old Yeller as it is probably called inside the Spaceship, suddenly only saw a subset of the shortcuts.\n\nI know because all the shortcuts were created on the Mac (so I could back them up to a plist because my trust in the syncing was severely damaged by the Early Years), yet when I tried to use ,,btw (basically to let it type my VAT number), it was no longer there.\n\nIt is there on the iPhone, and on the iPad, but no longer on the Mac. I was still there a week ago, but no longer, it went the way of AirPower. The biggest change I can see is the Mojave update I did, somewhere between when I had all my shortcuts and when I only had a subset of them. \n\nAt the moment I've cleaned out all my shortcuts, so the Mac can feel that void and will start syncing again just out of pure shame.\n\n(I have 0 ideas how to fix this)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup text shortcuts so you can do ,,shrug and get a  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to see an ascii representation of that  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see a ,,shrug because the Mac didn't sync that shortcut\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n18A391)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
