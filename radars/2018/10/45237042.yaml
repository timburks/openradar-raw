    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen debugging apps in the iOS simulator that make use of URLSession and CoreTelephony, the logs (specifically in the Xcode log console) are flooded with system logs from these sub systems. I've attached a sample app that reproduces the issue. This app is also available here: https://github.com/benasher44/SystemLogs.\r\n\r\nThis is frustrating because it hides logs we want to see from our app on launch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build and run the sample app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no log output in the sample app because it does not make calls to NSLog or os_log.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe attached log output is produced in the Xcode log console (also see included screenshot).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6\r\niOS 12\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS simulator\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!"
