    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an iPhone is connected via USB to a Mac, and Photos is opened to Import any photos from the Phone, Photos.app for Mac will incorrectly display 'No Photos' for an undefined extended period of time until eventually the photos are recognized and appear to be selected and imported. No loading state is displayed to the user - which gives the impression that Photos does not recognize the photos from the device. \r\n\r\nCould potentially be due to a large amount of Photos on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos.app on a Mac\r\n2. Connect an iPhone containing Photos in the Camera Roll to a Mac\r\n3. Navigate to Devices > iPhone in Photos.app\r\n4. See 'No Photos' displayed on the import screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould display all Photos contained on the iPhone to be imported OR display a loading indicator, to indicate that Photos is doing work to recognize/index all available photos.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n'No Photos' empty state is displayed for an undefined extended period of time.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nPhotos.app v 4.0 (3401.5.160)\r\niOS v 12.0 (16A5366a)\r\nmacOS v 10.14 (18A391)\r\n\r\nReproducible on macOS High Sierra, and iOS 11.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
