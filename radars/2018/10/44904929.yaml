    description: "Area:\r\nReminders\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUnder the Reminder App when trying to delete \"completed Reminders\" I am experiencing a Deleting issue!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have a list of Reminders that fall into the \"Show Completed\" \r\n2) When attempting to Delete the Reminders you need to \"Swipe on the reminders from right to left\"\r\n3) At first you may be able to do it easily on multiple reminders\r\n4) But later on you experience a phenomenon wherein if you tap on delete the Reminder will stay in the same position and not delete\r\n5) You then need to move over to the next reminder and sometimes the previous one will start working or in some cases the reminder that was glitched remains in that state as well as the reminders subsequently that have started to show this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen swiping on Reminders to delete, there should be any kind of issue depending on the number of reminders to delete nor where you swipe or how you swipe\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe problem as I have described in the Steps to Reproduce show that Completed Reminders experience a glitch whereby a user is unable to delete them or tap on another reminder to slide to delete.\r\nUnderstanding of this situation can be easily done using a video which I am going to attach to this bug report.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.0 (16A366)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X 256GB Running iOS 12.0"
