    description: "We need an additional attribute or attributes that can be submitted with a device to ABM that will allow the automatic assignment to specific MDM in that ABM account.\r\n\r\nFor example, when an iPhone is ordered for a 1 to 1 deployment to a user, allow the carrier to make that note so that the device is assigned to the proper MDM to support 1 to 1 deployment.  Whereas, an iPhone going to a retail shared environment would need to be directed to a different MDM and thus would need different attribution from the reseller."
