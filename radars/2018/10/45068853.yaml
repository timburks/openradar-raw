    description: "Area:\r\nCalendar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe CalendarAgent process is using 100% of CPU and its memory footprint  varies from 4 to 7 GB. I noticed it because the fans of the Mac started to blow at max speed.\r\nIt happened some time after I updated the Mac with Security Update Developer Beta 10.13.6 but I don't know if it's related.\r\nThe Console.app \"All messages\" log showed no messages related to Calendar or CalendarAgent.\r\nWhen I opened Calendar.app I saw an alert sign beside one of the Office 365 calendars I have delegated access to.\r\nThe issue lasted for several hours until I restarted the Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI haven't done anything specific to trigger this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalendarAgent should not consume all the available CPU and memory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI had to restart the Mac to stop CalendarAgent to consume all the available CPU and memory.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G3014)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012)"
