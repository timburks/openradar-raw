    description: "Area:\r\nMDM\r\n\r\nMake the MDM command ScheduleOSUpdate available in Simulator. \r\n\r\nWithout support for testing this MDM command in Simulator, testing `ScheduleOSUpdate` via MDM requires physical devices, restricting MDM developers to test the behavior of the command a single time per device. Successful updates cannot be reverted on the device, and devices can only be updated to the latest signed versions, so the test becomes unrepeatable.\r\n\r\nScheduleOSUpdate relies on a multitude of states of the device itself (connection to internet, charging status, battery level, version number, etc), and being able to test the command only once per device is extremely debilitating.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue: \r\n\r\nThis would first require developing a general purpose MDM device simulator of which ScheduleOSUpdates would be just one feature. At this time however, thereâ€™s no intention to create such a simulator."
