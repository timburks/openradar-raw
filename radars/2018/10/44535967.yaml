    description: "I just released a new version of my app that was compiled/built using Xcode 10 and I am getting back new crash reports only on iOS 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2 in [UIImage imageNamed:] calls that never happened before. Nothing in the code or the images has changed in over a year.\r\n\r\nRunning the app through the debugger on a iOS 9.2 Simulator or iOS 9.2 device doesn't result in a crash. But running a release build on an iOS 9.2 device will result in the crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun Launcher v3.1.6 (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launcher-with-multiple-widgets/id905099592?mt=8) on a device on iOS 9.0, 9.1 or 9.2. Load the app and skip the intro to the main screen (Skip, Done) and it will crash immediately.\r\n\r\nSee attached crash logs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would not expect a call to start crashing that has never crashed before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt crashes."
