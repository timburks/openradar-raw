    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Apple TV prompts me to sign in when purchasing/renting something, I have to spell out my password. This is not desirable, for two reasons:\n\n1. Everyone in the room can hear my password, or I must leave the room to authenticate.\n2. Spelling out a password orally means (a) remembering the password, and (b) talking a lot.\n\nSimilar to how my iPhone will wake up and offer a keyboard entry if Apple TV is on a field that allows me to type, it seems as though Apple Watch could offer a simple, single-tap approval to authenticate purchases and rentals.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Rent or buy something on Apple TV with authentication required\n2. Notice youâ€™re prompted to type out or say your password\n3. Cry\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to approve purchases with one tap on your Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou cannot do anything to approve the purchase on your Apple Watch.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\ntvOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
