    description: "Summary:\r\nThe double / triple click text selection shortcuts that are standard on macOS apps don’t work properly on the UIKit Mac apps (like News and Stocks).\n\nFor instance, triple clicking on text in Safari will select the whole paragraph. Dragging while clicking will select the subsequent paragraphs. There’s even an affordance for continuing the drag if the user quickly clicks a 4th time.\n\nNews and Stock don’t seem get that right with any regularity. Sometimes the third click will select the paragraph, sometimes it won’t. Trying to drag to increase the selecting will instead drag the current text instead of selecting subsequent text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an article in News\n2. Triple click on some text\n3. Drag while clicking\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text selection behavior should match the macOS standard\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn’t. Sometimes, it starts dragging a single word. Other times, it’ll treat the selection as an in-line selection (instead of paragraph selection). Sometimes, it selects the current paragraph and drags that text instead of continuing the selection (although that might be an inadvertent 4th click with the aforementioned affordance).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14 (18A391)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
