    description: "Summary:\r\nThird party workout apps hang on starting workout session is Apple Workout app has an active workout session. The call to HKWorkoutSession::startActivity will simply never return if another active workout session is running. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Start a running workout using the Apple Workout app\r\n- Start a third party workout app like Intervals Pro: Workout Timer or ProRun. For Intervals Pro, first create a running workout using the Walk/Run template\r\n- Third party app hangs because its waiting for the workout session to either start or fail.\r\n- Stop the Apple Workout app\r\n- Kill the third party workout app\r\n- The green sensor light remains until the watch is rebooted. \r\n- The third party app still doesn't work until the watch is restarted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The third party app should get an error saying another workout session is active. This is what happened with previous version of watchOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The call to HKWorkoutSession::startActivity never returns\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nwatchOS 5 and 5.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSeries 4 watch, but likely all watches."
