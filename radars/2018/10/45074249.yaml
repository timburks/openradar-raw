    description: "Summary:\r\nIn \"System Preferences\" => \"Desktop & Screen Saver\", you can set a wallpaper for the current space. So you can switch to the space you want to change the wallpaper for and then set the wallpaper. There should be a way to do this programmatically too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to specify which space to set the wallpaper for with the `NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL` API.\n\nI would suggest adding two new methods to `NSScreen`. One for getting all the spaces in the screen (so you could set a wallpaper on all spaces), and one for getting the active space. Using these new APIs, you could get the space you want and then be able to specify it to `NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL` as an option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's currently no way to do this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-wallpaper/issues/4"
