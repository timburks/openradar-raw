    description: "Summary:\r\nOn my iPhone 6 the icon representing a folder sometimes doesn't match the actual contents of the folder. There's an empty gap in the preview icon in place of one of the apps inside. This happens after moving an item into the first page of a folder that has more than one page of apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Create a folder that has 10 apps, so the first page of apps in the folder is full and there is second page.\r\n2. Move another app into the folder and put it on the first page of apps in the folder.\r\n3. Press the Home button to exit app-moving mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon for the folder should be an accurate preview of the apps on the first page of the folder.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nOnly 8 of the apps in the folder will be represented in the folder icon, with an empty gap in one of the 9 possible positions.  I think the position of the gap is correlated with the recently-moved app, but I'm not certain.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0/15A5278f\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
