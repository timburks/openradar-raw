    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen resizing a save sheet in Preview, the controls in at the bottom of the sheet don't move fast enough to track the resizing of the sheet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a file in Preview.\r\n2. Bring up the Save Asâ€¦ sheet\r\n3. Click the disclosure button if needed to allow you to resize the sheet.\r\n4. Resize the sheet rapidly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll controls should smoothly move/resize to match the size/position of the sheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe controls at the bottom (Format, filter, encryption, etc.) lag behind the changes in the size/position of the sheet.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOther applications I've tried work fine.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached movie shows the problem."
