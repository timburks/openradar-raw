    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen importing localization from .xliff file, that having \"\\n\" character in the string, xCode telling that their \"Missing Translate in the import\" and \"Missing Translate in the project\" and just don't importing them.\r\nxCode replacing the \"\\n\" characters with literal line brake (Enter), and as you know, double quotes doesn't supports line brake.\r\n\r\nThe most un-understandable thing here is that I read reports on this bug in very old discussions ((((2015)))) in the Apple Developer forum and they said that they'r reported on it, So why this ***serious bug*** is still existing?!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake `NSLocalizedString(\"First Line\\nSecond Line\")` in your project, export it, translate it to `שורה ראשונה\\nשורה שנייה` (for example) and see that when you are trying to import it back to eXcode you'r getting \"Missing Translate in the import\" and \"Missing Translate in the project\" prompt message because xCode doesn't know how to convert line brakes back to \"\\n\" (you don't even should to convert the \\n's to literal line brakes on the export).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nxCode should export and import the strings with \\n and not convert it to line brake at any step of this process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxCode is converting the \\n to line brake which making problems on translating and importing it back.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS ‏10.14 ‏(18A391‏)\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)"
