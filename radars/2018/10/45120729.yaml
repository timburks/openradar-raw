    description: "Area:\r\nWatchKit\r\n\r\nPLATFORM AND VERSION\r\nwatchOS 5.0. Simulator and on device.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM\r\nPicker scrolls to index 0 when status area is tapped.\r\n\r\nThis is most clearly a problem when using push segues, where in other versions of watchOS, tapping in the status area would perform a \"back\" operation.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n1. Build and run.\r\n2. Tap anywhere in the status bar area.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: Picker scrolls from 50 to 1.\r\nExpected: Picker does nothing. (Run on watchOS 4 for an example of this.)"
