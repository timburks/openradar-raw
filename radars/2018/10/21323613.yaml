    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Maps it is handy to be able to type the name of a contact to look up where they live. But if the contact has accent marks, you have to type the accent mark or they won't appear in the search results. (e.g., typing \"cecile\" won't find a contact named \"Cécile\")\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts\r\n2. Create a new contact for \"Cécile ----\"\r\n3. Open Maps\r\n4. Type \"cecile\" into the search field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should list Cécile in the search results.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does not list Cécile unless you remember to hold down the E button to get an \"e\" with an acute accent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 9.0 13A4254v\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt works fine in Maps on OS X. I type \"cecile\" and up pops \"Cécile ----\"\r\n\r\nI think it may have worked properly back in iOS 6 and earlier. I'm pretty sure it broke in iOS 7, and it's definitely broken in both iOS 8 and iOS 9. (I meant to report this a long time ago, but I kept forgetting to do so.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 128 GB AT&T"
