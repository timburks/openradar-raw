    description: "Summary:\r\nIt’s very useful to make crosslinks in Notes when you collect a lot of data in notes. Nowadays the only solution is to make separate folder for each separate topic and move all related notes to it. While it’s not possible to use folders as tags (when one note can be in multiple folders/tags) it will be very useful to make cross links.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Notes.app on macOS or iOS\nCreate two notes\nTry to create link from first note to the second one\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou are able to make cross links\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no ability to create cross links\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:"
