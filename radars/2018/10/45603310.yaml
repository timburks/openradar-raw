    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an application, distributed outside of the App Store, using the Apple Installer that installs an application to /Library/Services. This application includes both Service menu items and a Safari App Extension. When installed to /Library/Services, pluginkit does not register the Safari App Extension automatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Install the attached application using drag and drop to /Library/Services.\n2) Open Safari’s Extension tab of Preferences\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n“Xinet CM” appears as a, disable, extension\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not present.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6 (16G1510)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnly workaround I have found is to run:\n\npluginkit -a /Library/Services/Xinet\\ WebNative.app/Contents/PlugIns/Safari\\ App\\ Extension.appex/\n\nThis is not recommended according to the manual page. It is not clear to me if this would have to be run for ever user on the system.\n\nNote, the attached application’s on disk name is “Xinet WebNative.app” but it uses LSHasLocalizedDisplayName and InfoPlist.strings to appear as “Xinet Contextual Menu Support”"
