    description: "Summary:\r\nRight click > Refactor > Rename... on class name doesn't change the file name itself and make the file color red.\r\nThe only way to fix it is to find the file in the finder and change it manually to the new name, this is absolutely not the right way to rename file. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRight click > Refactor > Rename... on class name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should rename also the swift file itself name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't rename the swift file itself name.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS ‏10.14 ‏(18A391‏)\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)"
