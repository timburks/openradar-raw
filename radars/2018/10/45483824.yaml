    description: "Summary:\r\nOn macOS Mojave some apps support taking photos or scanning documents via an attached iPhone. It would be super helpful not only to take a photo or scan a document but take a screenshot of the attached device in there as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- start Camera Continuity in a supporting host app\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- add \"Take Screenshot\" between \"Take Photo\" and \"Scan Documents\" menu entries\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly \"Take Photo\" and \"Scan Documents\" menu entries exist\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
