    description: "Area:\r\nSafari\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a focused input element (i.e. keyboard open) is removed from the DOM through JavaScript, iOS automatically dismisses the keyboard without restoring the ability to select text. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. save attached index.html somewhere\r\n2. serve the file so that iOS Safari can view it\r\n3. Observe selecting text works\r\n4. Focus the text field. Selecting text is now disabled. This appears to be by design.\r\n5. click \"remove field\" button, which removes field from the DOM\r\n6. Observe selecting text is now broken, even though the keyboard was auto-dismissed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter clicking the \"remove field\" button, I expect to be able to select text again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't select text.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.0 (16A366), multiple devices\r\nWe cannot reproduce it on iOS 10.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe index.html is a minimal example to reproduce the issue. The actual use case is a simple React app with a form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindex.html attachment:\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\">\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>Observe selecting text works</li>\r\n    <li>Focus the text field.
