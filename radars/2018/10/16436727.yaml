Drag a link from Safari into Messages.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt ought to create a link in the message, just as you'd get with the Edit->Add Link... menu item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt inserts a file attachment instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9.3/13D21\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
