    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we try to compile VLC for iOS for the Appstore something in Xcode 10 10O23u allocates too much wired memory to the point where the macbook becomes unresponsive.\r\nChanging from building with dwarf and dsyms to only dwarf resolves it but this is not an option for a shipped App.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. clone VLC for iOS from: https://github.com/videolan/vlc-ios \r\n2. pod install in the terminal\r\n3. build the app for the appstore or change the building to dwarf with dsym when you build for simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nit builds \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmemory pressure is up freezes the Mac \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10O23u"
