    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary: Calling readdir() from multiple threads apparently acquires a global kernel lock, making directory traversal operations from multiple processes extremely slow as the number of parallel I/O operations increases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI have a Gist at https://gist.github.com/indygreg/a50e187f5372807cdcab5ac12bc2feea that demonstrates the issue using Python.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if read-only parallel I/O scaled linearly (within reason). Other filesystems (like EXT4) don't exhibit excessive kernel CPU time performing the same type of I/O operations in parallel.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be useful if the APFS developer documentation documented which I/O operations are subject to global locks so developers know how to optimize parallel I/O under APFS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nParallel I/O performing readdir() results in excessive CPU time being spent in the kernel acquiring locks.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nI've reproduced on macOS 10.13.6 and 10.14 on a MacBook Pro 15.1. Others have reproduced on other devices running macOS. I assume the issue is intrinsic to APFS.\r\n\r\nPerformance on 10.14 is noticeably better than 10.13. But performance is still slower lagging, especially when compared to Linux/EXT4.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nNothing special. Was able to reproduce on a fresh 2018 MacBook Pro straight from Apple."
