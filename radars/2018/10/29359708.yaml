    description: "Summary:\r\nOn some computers running macOS Sierra each Facebook notification is repeated many times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sign into Facebook.\r\n2. Allow Facebook notifications in notification center.\r\n3. Wait for something on Facebook to cause a notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification should appear exactly once in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach time a Facebook notification is received, it appears N times in Notification Center where N is some integer that tends to be consistent on any given computer, but can vary between computers.  For example, I currently receive 19 copies of every Facebook notification on my iMac at work.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.2/16C48b\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNotifications on iOS 10 devices don't seem to be affected.  Just some Macs running Sierra.\r\n\r\nSigning out of Facebook or deleting/re-adding it in the Internet Accounts preferences pane doesn't seem to help, nor does toggling notifications off/on in the Notifications preferences.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis seems to happen on all versions of Sierra (10.12.0, 10.12.1, and the first three betas of 10.12.2) but not on Yosemite or El Capitan."
