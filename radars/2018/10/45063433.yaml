    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m trying to convert a relatively small, pure Objective-C framework project from MRC to ARC. In both Xcode 10.0 and Xcode 9.4, if the new build system is active, conversion to ARC fails. Additionally, Xcode 10 crashes after “completing” the conversion. Conversion to ARC works fine with the legacy build system.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project (also available here: https://github.com/armadsen/ORSButtonBar/tree/c3659d7f52dbae6e1b0b33169e8c19ba96257bf0)\r\n2. Make sure the new build system is selected in Project Settings.\r\n3. Select Edit->Convert->To Objective-C ARC…\r\n4. Make sure the ORSButtonBar.framework target and all its source files are selected for conversion.\r\n5. Follow the prompts to start the conversion\r\n6. Click Check, then Next to start the conversion\r\n7. See the “Review changes:” diff previewer appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe diff preview shows that all source files have been converted to ARC by removing retain/release/autorelease calls.\r\n\r\nClicking save applies the changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the first file in the project (ORSButtonBarView.m) is converted to ARC. The other source files are unchanged.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, clicking Save causes Xcode to crash. Note also that clicking Cancel then Discard Changes after the changes preview appears also triggers a similar crash to trying to save the changes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug (minus the crash) also appears in the last release version of Xcode 9.4.x if the new build system is selected. In both Xcode 9 and 10, if the legacy build system is used, conversion to ARC works fine."
