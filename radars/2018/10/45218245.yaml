    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the device is set to use anything other than the base language of the \".intentdefinition\" file, it is impossible to use custom intents that return a response.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a custom intent that has a response that is just a single string. Use English as the base language of the .intentdefinition file.\r\n2. Implement a simple Intents extension to handle this custom intent.\r\n3. Localize the .intentdefinition file into another language e.g. Spanish.\r\n4. Run the intent on a device configured to use English, the Intents Extension will be able to construct the custom INIntentResponse object correctly and Siri will return the correct response.\r\n5. Switch this same device to Spanish and run the same custom intent - the Intents extension will crash when trying to set the custom response's properties and Siri will therefore just state that there's been \"a problem\".\r\n6. Run the intent on a device configured to use a language that the app has NOT been localized into, the Intents Extension will fall back to English, and will therefore be able to construct the custom INIntentResponse object correctly and Siri will return the correct response.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Intents Extension should be able to set the properties on the custom INIntentResponse object without an exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn exception (attached) is thrown when the Intents Extension tries to set the property on the custom INIntentResponse object.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10 (& 10.1 beta).\r\niOS 12 (& 12.1 beta)."
