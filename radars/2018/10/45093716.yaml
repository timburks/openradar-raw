    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 12, when creating a UIViewController that only contains a WKWebView, PDF files do not correctly render. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate and push a view controller which has a WKWebView constrained to the top of the superview. Load a PDF when the view loads.\r\n\r\nChanging the web view's scrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior to .always still has the initial bug, but is usable after scrolling once. However, this messes up the expected/correct behavior on iOS 11.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTop of PDF is below the navigation bar, and is completely visible. Same behavior in iOS 11 and below.\r\nLeft simulator in screenshot.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTop of PDF is at the top of the superview, and doe not respect content inset margins.\r\nRight simulator in screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10 GM, iOS 12 simulators/device (iPhone XS/iPhone 6s)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nExists in brand new project as well as existing project. Targeting iOS 9, so cannot use Storyboards for WKWebView."
