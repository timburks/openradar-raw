    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nView controllers contained in UINavigationController are not laid out to fill their parent view controller's bounds when a push transition occurs at the same time as an interface orientation change. Our QA has filed this as a bug in our application, but I have been able to reproduce it in other apps, even apps that are released by Apple (see attached videos for examples).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTrigger a push transition while rotating. In our app, we can reproduce this fairly consistently, but I've had a slightly harder time doing so with other apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nContent view controller's view should fill the UINavigationController's view after rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent view appears to retain its frame from before the rotation event.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niPad 9.7 inch (MP2J2LL/A)\r\niOS 12.0.1 (16A404) (Our QA team has been able to reproduce this bug for several version of iOS before 12)"
