    description: "Area:\r\nVideoToolbox\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe decompression session will freeze irrecoverably while playing a video that includes a certain sequence dropped frames. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlay the attached video on an iPhone XS in Safari\r\n(here's a link to my site http://mattdonahoe.com/dropbox/decoder-freeze.mp4 )\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nVideo is playable, and after playback you can scrub back to the beginning and replay.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt will reach the middle and freeze. You will not be able to play it again. The session will go black.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.0.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone XS (and XS Max)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that I found this why investigating a freeze bug in my video streaming app. When this happens in my app, I am forced to kill the app. Upon rebooting, the very first VTDecompressionSession I create will hang for 10 seconds before failing, and then things will work again. It surprises me that problems persist between app launches!"
