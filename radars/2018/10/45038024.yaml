    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS 11 introduced smart dashes. They follow certain rules to when to replace dashes with en/em dashes. However, the replacements fail if text, that lies after a dash, is selected. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Notes on iOS or use any other default UITextView with smart punctuation / dashes enabled.\r\n2. Type 2- (2<dash>)\r\n3. Type a word, select the word\r\n4. Type another dash with the word selected\r\n5. The word is correctly replaced with an en dash, however the dash after the 2 is still present. This dash should be removed as well.\r\n\r\nThe same applies for other replacements, where one or two dashes get replaced with an em dash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"2-[word]\" should become \"2–\" (2<en dash>).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"2-[word]\" becomes \"2-–\" (2<dash><en dash>).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4.1, iOS 12.0 (16A366)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nStandard UITextView, Smart Punctuation enabled."
