    description: "Summary:\r\nCarPlay is rock solid on iOS 10.3.3, but in the betas of iOS 11 it has been very flakey.  Overall it's gotten a lot better over time and in beta 7 it's usually stable as long as I don't invoke Siri, but once I do press the button for Siri it's a big gamble as to how it will perform (assuming it doesn't crash the CarPlay experience entirely).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone 6 to CarPlay-enabled vehicle. (I use a 2017 Ford C-Max with Sync3.)\r\n2. Start the Music app and begin audio playback.\r\n3. Switch to the Maps app and begin navigation.\r\n4. Invoke Siri and make requests.\r\n5. If everything is still working properly, repeat step 4 a few times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps, Music, and Siri should all function normally as they do in iOS 10 and nothing should crash, the screen should refresh consistently and smoothly in Maps, music playback should continue normally without pausing, skipping, or static noises.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nSiri often fails to function properly. It's more likely to misbehave when other apps are active, hence my suggestion to run Music and Maps while testing.\r\n\r\nAfter pressing the Siri button on my steering wheel, it often takes 10-20 seconds before Siri responds. And sometimes it never does. When this happens it seems to greatly affect overall system performance. Audio playback becomes choppy or has static sounds. Screen refreshes can become very slow.\r\n\r\nSometimes the CarPlay environment exits entirely and I'm kicked out to the Ford Sync3 screen. Sometimes CarPlay will resume automatically after 15-20 seconds. Other times I have to physically disconnect and reconnect the USB cable to get it back.\r\n\r\nI get a strong impression from the symptoms that a memory leak or other resource allocation issue may be at fault.\r\n\r\nIf I avoid using Siri, I generally don't usually have any trouble with CarPlay in beta 7, but I have had a few audio issues when doing nothing more than starting my car and initiating audio playback in Music.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Siri works perfectly, even with Music playing and navigation in progress. So the problem isn't 100% repeatable.  But about 90% of the time I'll have problems after just a few Siri interactions.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0/15A5362a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou guys are making progress.  Back in beta 1 the audio would skip if I tried to have Maps and Music running at the same time. In beta 2 the audio was ok, but Maps would start lagging more and more (my displayed position would be up to a mile behind my actual position, and the frame rate of updates would drop to single digits).  I reverted to 10.3.3 for a two week road trip (as I needed Maps to be stable, and wanted my Music too) and didn't switch back to iOS 11 until after beta 7 was out.\r\n\r\nI'm happy that Maps and Music are usually usable now, if I don't use Siri, but obviously Siri needs to be fixed so I can safely interact with my phone without having to use the car's touch screen. (And to do things like texting that can't be done on the touch screen.)\r\n\r\nI assume this will be quickly closed as a duplicate, because it seems like you ought to be well aware of the current glaring problems with CarPlay, but if not I'd be happy to provide more information about the problems I'm seeing.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWhen running iOS 10.3.3 I never encounter any problems with CarPlay, no matter how many simultaneous tasks I ask it to perform."
