    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen Configuration Profile with Filevault 2 payload is installed during setup assistant (before user creation), Filevault encryption is not enforced on next logout. I don't know if this is a correct behaviour. If yes it should be document somewhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. There is a Mac in DEP with MDM server assigned\r\n2. MDM has configuration profile with Filevault 2 payload assigned for this Mac. Filevault is to be enforced. Personal recovery key should be presented to user and sent to MDM server.\r\n3. Mac goes thourgh Setup Assistant, enrolls to MDM server, install configuration profile with Filevault payload\r\n4. User is created\r\n5. User logs in.\r\n6. User logs out.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser should be prompted. Deffered Filevault encyption should start.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. \r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nWhen configuration profile with Filevault 2 payload is installed AFTER user is created in step 4. On his next logout he is presented with Filevault promts (enter pasword, personal recovery key, OK dialog).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMDM Server: Profile Manager or AirWatch 9.4\r\n\r\nfdesetup status: Filevault is Off  fdesetup showdeferralinfo: { Defer = 0; OutputPath = \"/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/fdesetup.plist\"; ProfileUUID = \"9090d80b-274b-48c4-aaa1-5150cbd8323e\"; ShowRecoveryKey = 1; Usernames = ( \"_mbsetupuser\" ); }"
