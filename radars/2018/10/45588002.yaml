    description: "Summary:\r\nOn Xcode 10, when autocompleting a file name inside a `#import \"â€¦\"` statement, Xcode will only propose files in the same directory as the file currently being edited.\n\nNote that it does not appear to be the case when creating a new project, but the bug is quite consistently reproducible in my pre-Xcode10 project.\n\nMy project is mainly in Objective-C, with some mix of C++, and some Swift for UI tests.\nI'm using Clang modules, Cocoapods\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a file in a directory\n- Add an `#import \"\"` statement\n- Position the cursor inside the quote\n- Press Ctrl + Space to open the autocomplete menu\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode proposes to autocomplete to all files (or at least headers) in the project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode proposes only files in the same directory as the current file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReproduced on Xcode 10 GM and 10.1 beta 3 (10O45e).\n\nI unfortunately cannot share the project I'm reproducing this on, but I attached a short video demonstrating the issue.\n\nPlease don't hesitate if you need more info, I'd be happy to help resolve :)"
