    description: "Playgrounds is a fantastic resource for prototyping user interfaces. However there are some aspects of an iOS interface that Playgrounds just can’t express.\r\n\r\nEspecially since iOS 11 and the iPhone X, things like the status bar, safe area insets, home indicator, etc. form essential parts of the UI design process. While you can design interfaces while entirely ignoring them, you’re gonna have to make a whole lot of adjustments and fixes to code that works and gives the correct results in Playgrounds to do the same on a real device with those elements.\r\n\r\nThis would be alleviated if Playgrounds’s live preview window offered a way to set a device, much along the lines of Storyboards. Like with storyboards, all this feature should do is set the resolution of the live preview window, and show a status bar and/or home indicator as appropriate. This would make it possible to prototype and write production level UI code right in Playgrounds"
