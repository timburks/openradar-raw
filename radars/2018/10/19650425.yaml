    description: "Summary:\r\nA minor bug, but I found it slightly annoying.  If no windows are open in Apple Remote Desktop 3.8 (380A95), the Preferences command is disabled. In order to open the preferences window one must open another window (any window at all) before the command\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Remote Desktop.\r\n2. Close any open windows in Remote Desktop.\r\n3. Click on the Remote Desktop menu and note that \"Preferences…\" is disabled.\r\n4. Select the \"About Remote Desktop\" menu item (or any other menu item which opens a window.)\r\n5. Open the Remote Desktop menu and notice that the \"Preferences…\" menu item is now enabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Preferences…\" menu item should always be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Preferences…\" menu item is disabled anytime the \"Close\" menu item is disabled (i.e., when no windows are open).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n3.8 (380A95)"
