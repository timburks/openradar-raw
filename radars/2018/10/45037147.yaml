    description: Let's say we have 10 MKAnnotations that get clustered when zooming out. (clusteringIdentifier set) Now I zoom in and can see all of my annotations. Now I want to disable clustering for one single annotation. I don't see a way to do this. If I set the clusteringIdentifier to nil, on one of my annotations it doesn't have any effect.
