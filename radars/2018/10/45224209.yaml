    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen creating a landscape splash screen in a storyboard, the safe area inset on the LHS of the device isn't obeyed meaning elements are displayed in a different position to when the app is fully loaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project.\r\n2. Disable portrait modes in project settings.\r\n3. Add some UI element to your splash screen and constrain it's leading edge to the safe area of the view controller. Important not to add a navigation controller or tab bar as we aren't in our case.\r\n4. Add the same UI element to your main interface with identical constraints\r\n5. Witness the UI element jumping about on screen between splash and full launch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UI element should not jump about at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe video\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI element jumps to the right when the app launches fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 10.0, iOS 12"
