    description: "Summary:\r\n- UI tests start to crash with an error like: \"Application state is still unknown for com.SampleDeveloper.SampleApp (pid:1111)\" when running from xcodebuild. For example, if while testing an app crashed because of some error, like an force unwrap, the Simulator will hang and won't let to run ui tests that were queued after it for some time. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a project with some number of ui tests\r\n2. Launch them all via xcodebuild\r\n3. Have an app crashed while running one of the tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA test where the crash appeared, should fail, tests that should run after it will run as usual. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA test where the crash appeared fails and hangs a simulator for some tests (5-10) with a message: \"Application state is still unknown for com.SampleDeveloper.SampleApp (pid:1111)\" or \"Unexpected test interruption without any failures reported\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 10.0 (10A254a)"
