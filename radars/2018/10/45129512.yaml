    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter recent change on iTunes Connect website by Apple, we are unable to create any Sandbox Test accounts to test In-App Purchase/Subscription of WSJ iOS app. \r\n\r\nMost of the time 'validation errors' shown without any indication of what the error is or in which field the error is. \r\n\r\nSometimes account gets generated but account doesn't stick. After creating the account, it shows up on the list along with existing accounts, but once the iTunes Connect screen is refreshed, newly created account disappears. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n>Login to iTunes Connect\r\n> Go to Users and Access\r\n> Click 'Testers' below Sandbox on the left\r\n> Tap + to create an account\r\n> Enter F. Name, L. Name, Email, Password, Security Question/Answer, DOB, Territory\r\n> Click Invite\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTest Account created and added on the list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nValidation Error"
