    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the new Mac App Store, in macOS 10.14, there is lack of indication about things like app download progress, loading page (after click cmd + R), empty pages (like no updates are available) and etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to App Store, try to click cmd + R and see there is no indication that the page is really getting refreshing.\r\nAlso you can see that the updates section is just a blank page if there are no updates, also if there are recent apps that have updated, it won't say there are no new updates.\r\nTry to download some app from the App Store and see there is only a spinning wheel which no indicates about the progress of the download (while you can see it at the Launchpad).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should be indicated about the page loading, like we would in the old App Store.\r\nWe should get some text instead of empty page when something has been not found/there is no results for some operation and etc.\r\nWe should get the download progress directly from the app page in App Store, like it was in the old one and like it is in iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI think the steps to reproduce describing exactly what are the actual results.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS ‏10.14 ‏(18A391‏)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\r\nLanguage set to Hebrew (BTW, you should translate the App Store to Hebrew)"
