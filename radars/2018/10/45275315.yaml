    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the camera, when you press on the last image thumbnail (in landscape orientation) and starts to swipe between the photos, there are some lags;\r\nSometimes one image and the image after it are showing together (half of each one).\r\nSometimes the images order is incorrect and it can move you to the last image from the 3rd one (for example) and at most of the times this happening, there is some loop that stuck on 3-4 images and won't let me to get to the other images (it seems like it happens more when I'm swiping fast).\r\n\r\n*It's happening also when using the camera to scan documents (in the Note app, for example), I'm recommending you to check also the UIImagePickerController, 'Cause it may effect other apps that using the camera too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to the camera app, press the last image thumbnail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt shouldn't be so laggy.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is very laggy and making the problems I'v described in the description.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0.1 (16A404)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X 64GB\r\nThe language is set to Hebrew (if it's related to this issue)"
