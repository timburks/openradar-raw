    description: "Summary:\r\n* Focusing an <input type=password> field breaks text selection and thus copy&paste.\r\n* It does not happen on iOS 11. It happens with iOS 12.\r\n* The STR below are one variant of this issue.\r\n* Similar scenarios exist through React with \"autofocus\" where React eventually calls input.focus(). Navigating away from the page with the password field (and thus the field being removed from the DOM) does *not* fix the issue. Until page reload, text selection stays broken. Workaround here is to click some field that brings up the keyboard and dismiss it, which restores copy&paste.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. save attached index.html somewhere\r\n2. serve the file so that iOS Safari can view it\r\n3. Observe selecting text works\r\n4. focus password field\r\n5. observe selecting text fails\r\n6. dismiss keyboard\r\n7. observe selecting text works again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to select text regardless of focus on a password field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText selection is broken / appears to be racy (at least one can get the magnifier for text selection for short amounts of time).\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment: index.html\r\n\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\">\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n  <p>Focus the password field, then try to copy and paste this text.</p>\r\n  <input type=\"password\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"
