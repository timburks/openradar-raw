    description: "Summary:\r\nHaving to type `$ swift package` every type I interact with Swift Package Manager gets tiring fast. Would be nice if it was also exposed as `$ spm`. All other programming languages have a short command for their package manager. For example, Node.js has `$ npm`. Ruby has `$ gem`. Python has `$ pip`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to type, for example, `$ spm init` to initialize a new package.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to type `$ swift package init`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
