    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a project structure where we have a library included via cocoapods as a so-called development-pod. Whenever changes are made in a file inside the library they are not re-compiled when building our app. Only a clean build helps to make changes available in the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a project setup similar to our (see the attached example project).\r\nOpen the attached workspace and run the app. You will notice a crash on viewDidLoad() of the ViewController. There you will see further instructions to experience the issue. For completeness here they are again:\r\n* Run the app\r\n* Experience a fatal error\r\n* Remove the line where the fatal error is created\r\n* Run the app again (NO clean build)\r\n* Observe that the app will still be terminated by the fatal error you just removed\r\n* Do a clean build to finally get rid of the fatal error\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* App does not crash anymore after removing the fatalError from the library\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* App still crashes because of that fatalError\r\n* Breakpoints don’t work either because the source you see and the compiled one are not the same anymore\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nProject with cocoapods integration of self-owned library."
