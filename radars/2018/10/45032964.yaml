    description: "I building CarPlay app. And i did start sync task feature between iOS device and CarPlay app. I did build route with two route choices on iOS device. And if i choose route choice at iOS device i want to automatically choose it on CarPlay. But i can't because CPTrip do not have some activeRouteChoice property. Only one thing i can do - recreacte CPTrip with activeTrip on first place at routeChoices array. It is so bad and showing not needed animation. Please, make an opportunity to set active route choice via code.\r\n\r\nP.S. I check Google Maps CarPlay app. They have a same problem(i can see it by CPTrip showing animation)"
