    description: "Summary:\r\nNew watchfaces not visible in app.\n\nHi there, long time mac user, first time WATCH user. I bought a new version 4 WATCH and was looking for the 'Infograph' watch face. I couldn't find it anywhere in the Watch.app on the iPhone, but could find it when force touching on the WATCH itself.\n\nIn fact the Watch.app doesn't display any of the new watchfaces, the block below 'New in watchOS' is also empty, so I think something might be rotten in Denmark.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Watch.app on iPhone\n2. Press 'Face Gallery'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect there to be some faces below 'New in watchOS'\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBelow 'New in watchOS' is just an empty bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS running 12.0\nWatch running 5.0.1"
