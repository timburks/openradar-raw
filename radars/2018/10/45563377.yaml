    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have 2 people in my contacts that work at the same place. They have the same work number. A few apps on the Watch seem to be confused by this fact. Both Walkie-Talkie and whatever app sends replies to Activity achievements have both had this issue. See below...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. To reproduce the issue with Walkie-Talkie you'll need someone in your contacts list that has an Apple Watch Series 4 and a work phone number (I will refer to this contact as C1 later).\r\n2. Add/edit a different contact so that they now have the same exact same work phone number at C1. (this will be contact C2).\r\n3. Open Walkie-Talkie app and make sure that C1 is marked as available.\r\n4. Go to a different app and then back to Walkie-Talkie. Contact C2 is often also shown as available even though they were never invited.\r\n5. You may have to toggle the availability of C1 in Walkie-Talkie a few times to get this to happen. You may also have to leave/kill the Walkie-Talkie app and then return to the app after killing it.\r\n6. I've seen this happen many times -- it isn't just a one time thing.\r\n\r\n1. Today something similar happened with Activity achievements which caused me to look into what the hell was going on.\r\n2. I got a 'October Move Achievement' on my Watch related to person C1.\r\n3. I replied with one of the options the app gave me. (Yay great job!)\r\n4. The watch sent the text to person C2 (as seen in my Messages app on the phone) and used the work phone number that's shared between C1 and C2.\r\n5. I know this because my cellphone provider sent me a text saying they translated the text to speech and left a message on an answering machine or something...\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBecause two people share a work phone number shouldn't mean anything to any app. It wrongly seems to be linking C1 and C2 together in various apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWalkie-Talkie and whatever app sends Activity achievements get confused because two people have the same work number.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nwatchOS 5.0.1 (16R382), Apple Watch Series 4"
