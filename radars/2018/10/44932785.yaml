    description: "Area:\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nI'd like to suggest to allow to lock the Mac from the Apple Watch if the \"unlock with Apple Watch\" option is active.\r\nIf you are near the Mac and someone else is trying to open it, it will open because of the Apple Watch is close to it, but if I don't want someone else will be able to access the Mac if I'm not the one how using it?\r\nAlso, if you'll tap on the unlock new button on the Apple Watch when the message of \"Your Mac has been unlocked with this watch\" (what I'm suggesting here), the Mac will ask for password and won't accept TouchID or open with Apple Watch until the user will type the Mac password (like in the first time after restart or after some time of no accessing to the Mac).\r\n\r\nI think is a little and needed feature that many Mac & Apple Watch users will like to see. \r\nThanks,\r\nIdo."
