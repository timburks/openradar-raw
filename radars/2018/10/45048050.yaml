    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring a debugging session, I noticed that my breakpoints inside of a defer block were never being hit, yet I could clearly see logging from inside those blocks going to the console.  \r\n\r\nI created an example reference project to demonstrate this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Clone the following project: https://github.com/intere/DebugDeferBlocks\r\n2. Set breakpoints in ViewController.swift at lines 17 and 20\r\n3. Run the project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDebugger stops at line 20, then after continuing the debugger stops at line 17\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDebugger stops at line 20, then after continuing it never stops again.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n(Running on MacOS Mojave 10.14 (18A391))\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNothing specific"
