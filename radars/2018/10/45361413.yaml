    description: "Summary:\r\n[In-App Purchase Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/Products.html) describes several product types but there is no obvious way in StoreKit for developers to identify the type other them writing business logic on their own.\n\nFor example, when app received a call in SKPaymentTransactionObserver function `func paymentQueue(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, updatedTransactions transactions: [SKPaymentTransaction])`, the app can only get productIdentifier to decide what to do next. For auto-renewable subscription products, app often can need just call finish transaction since backend server already dealt with the recurring events. \n\nThat decision logic needs to be written somewhere in the app or developer's backend server matching productIdentifier -> product type. We believe this information should be provided by StoreKit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement In-App Purchase\n2. Receive SKPaymentTransaction upon transaction status updated (especially upon app launch)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the product type (consumable, non-consumable, manual subscription, auto-renewal subscription) of this transaction\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeveloper only get transaction.payment.productIdentifier and need to check the id mapped to which product type. The mapping is written in the app(which is kind of hard code) or backend server(which takes more time and is bad for user experience).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know there is .subscriptionPeriod in SKProduct since iOS 11.2 but it's not enough. The better way is to create and provide a new SKProductType and can be accessed in SKPayment and SKProduct."
