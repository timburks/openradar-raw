    description: "Summary:\r\nAs the title says, the window of a FaceTime audio call can not be moved or minimized. This is very unpleasant, since it makes for example browsing in Safari difficult, since with multiple tabs open you can’t reach the right most tab anymore, which is covered by the FaceTime call window.\r\n\r\nEspecially on MacBook Pros with TouchBar the window is not necessary, since the same information is displayed on the TouchBar already.\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro 13“ Mid 2016 TouchBar, macOS 10.14 (18A391), German localization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart FaceTime audio call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFaceTime audio call window in the top right corner is movable and minimizable. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14 (18A391)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
