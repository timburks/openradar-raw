    description: "Summary:\r\nContent of the table view when it's part of a page-based navigation interface becomes clipped after presenting modal view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- (Use the sample project) or setup a page-based navigation storyboard where one of the interfaces has a table\r\n- Navigate to the table interface\r\n- Tap on any cell to present other interface controller modally\r\n- Close modal interface controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTable can be scrolled and all its contents are reachable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTable's content is clipped and scrolling bounces early, as if the interface controller was scrolling instead of the table. There is a behavior similar to the nested scrolling views.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nReproducible on:\r\nwatchOS 5.0.1 (16R382)\r\nwatchOS 5.0.1 (16R381)\r\nwatchOS 5 Simulator (Xcode 10.1 beta (10O23u))"
