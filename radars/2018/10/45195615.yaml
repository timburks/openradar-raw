    description: "Hi Apple, \r\n\r\nThese are the suggestions submitted by several users to improve SHORTCUTS...\r\nlisted on this page at Reddit:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9nabnu/what_improvements_should_apple_make_to_shortcuts/\r\n\r\n1. a way to organize shortcuts in folders\r\n2. a way to have my own icons on shortcuts\r\n3. a way to trigger a shortcut by an alarm\r\n4. While loops\r\n5. Better organization on the home page\r\n6. Filtering the home page by title, widget, share sheet, Siri recorded phrase, etc\r\n7. Case insensitive search in the gallery\r\n9. Write/modify/read some kind of native database.\r\n10. Overlay text on image, inc formatting the text in different ways.\r\n11. Set own choice of quality for a GIF.\r\n12. To be able to add to a list with external means.\r\n13. I think it would be great if they made a Swift Block item where you can run arbitrary Swift code. \r\n14. Make it possible to have subroutines inside an app, not an external shortcut.\r\n15. Make it possible to create a shortcut that contain its sub-shortcuts, so we can send it to someone in one package.\r\n16. The ability to clone individual action steps as an alternative to bouncing back into the master list of actions. \r\n17. An action to return to the iOS home screen after an action runs.\r\n18. Favorited action steps appearing at the top of search results, like pinned tweets.\r\n19. Ability to set audio output like HomePod or AirPods.\r\n20. Built in location and time triggered actions.\r\n21. Action separators for better organization. See Headers in Things 3 for an example. Just a simple bar with a header title to divide groups of actions.\r\n22. Triggers by * time * location * astronomical, sunrise/sunset, moon phase * control center.\r\n23. Ability to create/edit shortcuts on https://icloud.com (Desktop). This would be so much easier than creating shortcuts on my phone screen. \r\n24. Shortcuts app on Apple Watch, bring it back! \r\n25. The option to perform actions on a watch. – i.e. put my watch in theater mode or change a face. \r\n26. Take a picture silently, without the shutter sound on the iphone. This is good to create anti-theft scripts... taking the suspect photo. \r\n27. Let it be accessible by siri with phone locked, if the action needs phone unlocked, sure. But those actions that can be done manually without unlocking should go through. \r\n28. And weather shortcuts! \r\n29. An action to have access to the Siri conversation that activated the shortcut, and the NLP parsed sentence, to pull intent, dates, places other bits of info would be nice. \r\n30. Some sort of CASE action, its a lot less messy than lots of if then else. \r\n31. Share sheet Shortcuts filtered on the content they can accept. \r\n32. Give shortcuts the ability to create rich notifications that you can interact with. Feed rich content back into Siri, pictures etc. \r\n33. Lock iPhone with no need to do anything else by user \r\n34. Define shortcuts « type » to organize them easier Like photos type Health ou activity type IPhone management type (for wifi, Bluetooth, etc.) \r\n35. Ask for certain actions when connected to a certain bluetooth or wifi Example: welcome in your car, where are you going sir? Hole, work, other adress? Connected to wifi at home? Play relaxlist, ... Ask for actions on certain location  \r\n36. The ability to type a command in a Shortcut as if you are using the “Type to Siri” command. Certain items or requests are easier to ask by speaking than command lines. i.e. Hey Siri, is my garage open?"
