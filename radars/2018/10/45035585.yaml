    description: "Summary:\r\nNew in watchOS 5 is the ability to dynamically add or remove notification actions from the notification interface. While developers can indeed add or remove notification actions from the interface, actions that are added are not sending any response to the iOS app, making this feature unusable in practice.\r\n\r\nThis feature is described in WWDC 2018, Session 206, What's New in watchOS:\r\n\"Well, new in WatchOS 5, you can now adjust the action buttons that are shown at runtimeâ€¦ which will give you the flexibility to change the action buttons based on how the user interacts with the elements in the interactive notification interface.\" (https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018-206/?time=533)\r\n\r\nPlease watch video, and check out attached sample project for bug reproduction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. iOS app to schedule a notification 10s later so that Watch can pick up the notification\r\n2. watchOS dynamic interactive notification controller to add actions by changing the notificationActions property\r\n3. Tap on any of the new UNNotificationAction that are added\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS app to receive the notification response via the delegate func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS app does not receive any response at all.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B5068i)\r\nwatchOS 5.1 (16R5568d)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
