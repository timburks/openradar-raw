    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMojave switched from drawing a dashed red underline under misspelled words to using the red circles from iOS. TextEdit continues to use the dashed red underline but it appears to fight with the NSTextView; when zooming in/out (e.g., with pinch zoom on a trackpad) you can see the red circles drawn, then erased, and then the dashed underline drawn instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Type some random text into TextEdit. Note the indicator for misspelled words.\r\n\r\n2. Pinch to zoom in/out and observe the flickering dashes/circles.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Misspelled words should have a row of red circles drawn under them.\r\n\r\n2. It should animate smoothly when zoomed in/out.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. TextEdit draws red dashed underline. In Mojave it should have red circles instead.\r\n\r\n2. It looks like the NSTextView draws the new-style red circles first, only to have them replaced with red dashes by TextEdit. This conflict is visible while zooming.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've attached a video of the problem in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.1 Beta (18B50c)\r\nTextEdit 1.14 (340)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)"
