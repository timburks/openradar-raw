    description: "Area:\r\nSecurity Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nTrying to create a change password form and neither UITextField with the new-password textContentType is suggesting an automatic secure password. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a view controller with 3 UITextFields.\r\n2. Set \"Secure Text Entry\" on all three.\r\n3. Set the Content Type to \"Password\" on the first and \"New Password\" on the second two.\r\n4. Setup a webcredentials associated domain.\r\n5. Run the app on a device with AutoFill Passwords enabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first UITextField should display a password or the \"\U0001F511 Passwords\" keyboard accessory. The second two UITextFields should have an Automatic Strong Password generated and autofilled for them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first UITextField behaves correctly. The second two do not generate and autofill an Automatic Strong Password.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the \"\U0001F511 Passwords\" keyboard accessory behaves oddly. If you tap through the fields in the form:\r\n* It displays for the first, as expected.\r\n* It stays on the second, which doesn't make sense because this is supposed to be a new password.\r\n* It hides on the third, which is expected.\r\n\r\nIf you tap back from the third to the second, it does not appear for the second.\r\nAlso, if you go from the first to the third, it does not appear on the third, nor does it appear when going from the third to the second.\r\n\r\nIt appears to behave the same if the UITextFields are contained in a UITableView (as demonstrated in the example code) or just embedded directly in a view controller's view.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A366)\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)"
