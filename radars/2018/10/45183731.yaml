    description: "Summary:\r\nSandboxed apps must use the `SMLoginItemSetEnabled` method to enable/disable enable an app to be launched at login (through a helper app). Usually, you would have a checkbox in the app's preferences to toggle it, like `[ ] Launch at login`. The problem is that there is no way to know whether the helper app is set to be launched at login or not. So you can't correctly show the status in the checkbox. The `SMLoginItemSetEnabled` method only lets us set the status, but not check it. We could persist the status to UserDefaults, but then it could easily get out of sync (Has happened to my app before). A common workaround is to use `SMCopyAllJobDictionaries` to check the status [0], but that API has been deprecated since macOS 10.10 with no replacement...\r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin/blob/8cb7d331a02acb61250857e05cee20bcb8f0be98/LaunchAtLogin/LaunchAtLogin.swift\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected there to be a way to check the current status of `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`. There could be a method called `SMLoginItemIsEnabled` that would accept a bundle identifier and return a bool of whether it's enabled or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHave to use UserDefaults which can be buggy or a deprecated API (SMCopyAllJobDictionaries).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelevant GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin/issues/12"
