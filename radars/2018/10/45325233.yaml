    description: "Area:\r\nUserNotifications Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe have a popular push notification SDK (OneSignal). Our SDK allows apps to attach images to their push notifications dynamically. To do this, we register buttons/etc. to a UNNotificationCategory in a Notification Service Extension.\r\n\r\nThis has worked perfectly since iOS 10. However, now in iOS 12, we are seeing occasional issues, especially for newly installed apps, where actions/attachments registered to a UNNotificationCategory don't show up on notifications. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a Notification Service Extension target to an app\r\n2. In the Notification Service Extension in the `didReceiveNotificationRequest` method, create a `UNNotificationCategory` and add some actions to it, and register the new category using `UNUserNotificationCenter.current.setNotificationCategories([your_category])`\r\n3. To make sure the notification uses this category, on the `UNMutableNotificationContent` instance, set the `categoryIdentifier` to be the same as the category created in step 2\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe notification should now have the buttons from step 2. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHowever in our testing (and for many app developers using our SDK), notifications often seem to ignore the category identifier and don't show the correct actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 12.0.0"
