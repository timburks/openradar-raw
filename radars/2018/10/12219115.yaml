    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf Fast User Switching is enabled, then when the screen is locked (because the user has set it to lock when the screen saver is actie or the machine goes to sleep) it should display a \"Switch User\" button.  But on Mountain Lion, the \"Switch User\" button is not displayed if the machine is bound to an Open Directory server.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  enable Fast User Switching in the \"Users & Groups\" pane of System Preferences.\r\n2.  Bind the machine to an Open Directory server and enable network accounts.\r\n3.  Lock the screen\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should display the \"Switch User\" button at the bottom of the screen whenever it's displaying the password field to unlock the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere's only a \"Cancel\" button.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt worked fine with the exact same setup in Lion (and earlier).  It also works in Mountain Lion if the machine is not configured to use the Open Directory server.\r\n\r\nI've tried it on both 10.8.0 and 10.8.1, and it doesn't work on either.  It's also not working for me on 10.8.2 build 12C31a but I have not yet tried the newer seed (build 12C35, I think) that just became available.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFast User Switching works from the menubar as one would expect.  It's just when the screen is locked that I have trouble because the option doesn't appear.  Until this is fixed, i can't deploy Mountain Lion in my shool's labs.  (Otherwise when a student locks the screen, nobody else will be able to use that computer.)  I guess we'll be stuck with Lion until winter break, at least."
