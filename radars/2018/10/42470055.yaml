    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen defining a protocol with a static property and extending a class that already has a property with that name, Xcode fails with a segmentation fault error and an internal error occurred message, if the static property is defined with a get and set in the protocol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download sample project\r\n2. Open file Protocols.swift\r\n3. Modify declaration of property openSettingsURLString from \"static var openSettingsURLString: String { get }\" to \"static var openSettingsURLString: String { get set }\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project shows a specific error informing that the extension doesn't conform to the protocol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode shows a message error: \"An  internal error occurred. Source editor functionality is limited. Attempting to restore...\"\r\nThe project shows a segmentation fault: 11 error\r\n\r\nVersion/Build\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)"
