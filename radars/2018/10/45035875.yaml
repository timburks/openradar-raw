    description: "Summary:\r\nThe trash has this useful feature where you can right-click an item in the trash and select \"Put Back\" to put it back where it came from. AppKit has a method for programmatically trashing a file; `FileManager.default.trashItem()`. It would be useful if you could programmatically put a file pack from the trash. Apps could use this to be able to undo a trash operation. Undo is an important functionality in macOS apps and this missing API makes that much harder to achieve.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected there to be an API for putting files back from the trash. Could be something like `FileManager.default.restoreTrashItem()`, that would accept the original path of a trashed item, find it in the trash, and put it back where it came from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to achieve this now, other than manually reverse engineering the `.DS_Store` file format and parse out the originals paths of the trash items.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelevant GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-trash/issues/1"
