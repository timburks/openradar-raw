    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen configuring an IMAP account on iOS, a \"sent messages\" folder is created and selected for sent messages.\r\nI need to use the \"Sent\" folder.\r\nI can select it in the preferences, but most often, it falls back to \"sent messages\", and ignores my configuration.\r\nIt sometimes work by deleting the \"sent messages\" from another client, and selecting the \"Sent folder\" again on iOS, but this is hacky as hell. Not the experience I expect from an apple device.\r\n\r\nThis has been around for ages. Is there any chance that it is fixed some day ?\r\nThis is a serious problem, that makes using my iDevices to send mails a counter productive mess.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- on an imap server, create a \"Sent\" folder\r\n- configure the imap account on an iOS device -> the folder for sent messages is set to \"Sent messages\"\r\n- go to the account preferences, in the advanced section of the mail account, and select a \"Sent\" folder -> everything seems to work fine\r\n- go to the mail application -> the \"Sent messages\" folder is used for sent messages. The preference we just set was reverted.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe setting I have entered should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe setting I have entered is reverted\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11, iOS 12 (at least)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 5\r\niPhone SE"
