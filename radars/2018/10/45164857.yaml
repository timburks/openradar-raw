    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are a lot of useful menu bar apps out there, but the screen real estate on some MacBooks are limited. Would be great if macOS had the ability to manually hide certain menu bar icons. This could be a System Preferences pane. When you hide an icon it could show a `<<` button on the left of the menu bar icons, that when clicked, would show them all temporarily. Then you could hide the ones you don't use often but still want available. This is in similar fashion as the third-party apps Bartender [0] and Vanilla [1].\n\n[0]: https://www.macbartender.com\n[1]: https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:"
