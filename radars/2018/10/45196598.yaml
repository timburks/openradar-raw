    description: "Area:\r\nHealthKit\r\n\r\nCurrently only energy, length and mass HKUnit can be formatted via EnergyFormatter, LengthFormatter and MassFormatter. But all the 3 formatters' documents say we should use MeasurementFormatter instead. So HKUnit should work with MeasurementFormatter directly. Another benefit of that is we can support many more units.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that in the Defining and Converting Units and Quantities article(https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples/units_and_quantities/defining_and_converting_units_and_quantities) that \"You can use MeasurementFormatter to localize quantities such as length, mass, and energy. \" But I couldn't find how. I'm not sure if I missed some API or the doc is incorrect."
