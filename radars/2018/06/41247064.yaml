    description: "Summary:\r\nCAShapeLayer stops rendering path after a certain amount of points reached. This is a regression in iOS 12. This can be easily reproduced in http://pdfviewer.io/ (v 2.4)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart drawing on a page, continue a few minutes drawings strokes until it disappears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStrokes should not disappear after a certain set of points\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee attached gif for details or Twitter: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1008761873829974016\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur drawing algorithm is quite sophisticated and we even use a maximum point limit.\nPath works on Simulator + View Debugger, but fails on an actual device.\n\nI did not provide a sample project as per discussion with Apple Engineer Bartosz Ciechanowski (Core Animation).\n\nThanks for looking into that."
