    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary: A user reported crashes in iTerm2. The cause was opening menus having menu items with custom views.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI gave the user a build of iTerm2 that did not have any menu items with custom views. They reported the crashes continued until they stopped opening the Help menu (since its search field is a custom view).\r\n\r\nWith Zombies enabled, I could see that a CarbonWindow was accessed after dealloc.\r\n\r\nI'll attach the output of malloc_history showing where the object was allocated and a crash showing where it was accessed after dealloc.\r\n\r\nLots more info is in the linked bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMac OS X 10.13.4 (17E199) running on MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
