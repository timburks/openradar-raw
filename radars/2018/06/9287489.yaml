    classification: App Store UI Bug
    created: "2018-06-27T16:44:11.407959Z"
    description: Numerous people and I have at least once mistakenly tapped on “Done” instead of “Sign In” when signing into App Store, after which the view is dismissed and they have to enter the credentials again... This UI is terribly designed and outrageously frustrating to users. A simple fix could be to add a “Cancel” on the left and replace “Done” with “Sign In”. To reproduce the problem, simple try to log in into App Store on an iPhone.
