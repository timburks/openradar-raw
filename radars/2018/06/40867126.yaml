    description: "Summary:\r\nI tried adding my Bitbucket Cloud account to Xcode 10, but it failed each time.\r\nI have 2FA activated on my Bitbucket account, so that might be the issue here.\r\n\r\nI first tried with my Bitbucket password, but it failed with an unreadable error (see rdar://40866556). I then tried creating an app password for Xcode on Bitbucket and using that, but whatever combination of permission I tried (even all of them) I always got the same error back \"Unauthorized access\".\r\n\r\nAlso, if the solution implies to create an app password in Bitbucket, it would be nice to know which permissions Xcode needs to function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry adding a Bitbucket Cloud account with 2FA enabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can add my Bitbucket account to Xcode, even with 2FA turned on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen adding the account, authentication fails.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E202)"
