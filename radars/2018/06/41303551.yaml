    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\n\nConsider the attached test project. In it, I have an AppKit xib. The xib contains a window. The window’s content view contains two NSTableViews. Each NSTableView has a single column. Each column’s custom class is set to SuperDuperColumn. The SuperDuperColumn class has an IBOutlet property:\n\n@property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet NSTableColumn *correspondingColumnInOtherTable;\n\nEach column’s correspondingColumnInOtherTable property is connected to the column in the other table.\n\nThis all works fine at runtime: the columns’s outlets are correctly set.\n\nThe problem is that ibtool emits warnings about the outlets at compile time:\n\n…/MainMenu.xib:AGR-HJ-rNP: warning: Outlet 'correspondingColumnInOtherTable' of 'Corresponding Column In Other Table' is connected to 'Corresponding Column In Other Table,' an invalid destination (Objects inside view based table views may only be connected to the table view's delegate.) [9]\n\nI think I understand why this warning might be relevant for an object (like a row view or a cell view) that might be replicated long after the table is originally deserialized. But it doesn’t seem relevant for a table column, which is deserialized once along with the table itself and not replicated later.\n\nSo, in summary, please stop complaining about my cross-referencing table columns.\n\nThanks,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 10.0 beta 2 (10L177m)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
