    description: "Summary:\r\nDue to recent legal issues, CallKit functionality should be disabled to users in China.\r\n\r\nThere is no easy way to know if an app was downloaded from Chinese AppStore. This led us to remove the app from sale completely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an app that uses CallKit\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n2. Have an easy API which we can check and see if the app was downloaded from Chinese AppStore\r\n3. Disable CallKit functionality for these people\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The update gets rejected and we have to make app not available in China\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
