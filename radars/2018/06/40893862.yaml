    description: "Problem:\r\nCurrently in macOS High Sierra and in the forthcoming Mojave, there is no distinction for applications that offer trials.\r\n\r\nApplications with free trials are grouped together with apps that are free, this is wrong and confusing.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\nThere should be a third grouping alongside the existing ‘free’ and ‘paid’, ‘paid with n-day trial’ – where the developer can set up how many days the trial lasts.\r\n\r\nMore detail:\r\nhttps://bitsplitting.org/2018/06/06/ersatz-free-trials/"
