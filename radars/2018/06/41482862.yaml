    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently when calling AVAudioPlayer.play() while in AVAudioSession mode PlayAndRecord, there is a significant delay between the play() call and the audio file being played. There is an especially long delay when the output route is to a bluetooth walkie-talkie device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect a bluetooth device to the phone under test.\r\nRun the attached sample app (BluetoothDelay).\r\nTap the Play Alert button\r\nWait a few seconds (2-3)\r\nTap the Play Alert button again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe audio plays immediately after tapping the button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe audio plays about a second after tapping the button. If you tap the button again immediately, the audio plays right away. If you wait a few seconds before tapping the button again, the audio plays after about a second of delay.\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to depend on the state of the iOS system to some degree. There have been times when it usually played audio immediately and only had a delay after leaving the app and then returning to it. More commonly the delay recurs after waiting just a couple of seconds after playing the audio.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4 (15F79)"
