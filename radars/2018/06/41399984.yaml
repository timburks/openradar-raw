    description: "Area:\r\nCore Bluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter updating to iOS 12 beta 2, in multiple apps whenever I try to start advertising via the CBPeripheralManager no other device's CBCentralManager discovers the advertisement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIf you check if the CBPeripheralManager state is powered on, that successfully works. Then when calling .startAdvertising() with advertisementData on the PeripheralManager the peripheralManagerDidStartAdvertising() function gets called without any errors. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would except other apps CBCentralManager to discover that advertisement, but they do not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo other apps CBCentralManager discover the advertisement from this device.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThe device trying to advertise is an iPhone X on iOS 12 beta 2. (All this worked fine on iOS 12 beta 1, but broke on the newest update)"
