    description: "In iOS 12.0 Beta 1, Ajax cross origin requests are failing from WKWebview with the error \"Preflight response is not successful. XMLHttpRequest cannot load [url omitted] due to access control checks\". This happens even when the remote server is setting \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" as a response header.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Make an Ajax cross origin request from a page running inside WKWebview being served off localhost on a device running iOS 12. Ensure the server being connected to is returning a \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" header.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The request should succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The request fails with an error in console: \"Preflight response is not successful. XMLHttpRequest cannot load [url omitted] due to access control checks\"."
