    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently Xcode betas are only available as full downloads from the Apple developer website. These downloads, despite being compressed, tend to be over 5 gigabytes in size.\n\nDepending on the speed of your internet connection, even the 5 gigabyte download can take multiple hours if not an entire day or more to download. So even though OTA delta updates of iOS betas allow faster downloads, developers canâ€™t update iOS devices either because new Xcode builds are required to build for them.\n\nThis problem could be lessened quite a bit by distributing Xcode betas through the Mac App Store, like with Safari Technology Preview. Delta updates would greatly reduce the pain of downloading the latest Xcode betas.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nNotes:"
