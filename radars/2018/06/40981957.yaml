    description: "Area:\r\nTerminal\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen you open a second tab, and the tab bar apperas, you loose 3 rows. Say you where running 80x24, after opening the second tab, your terminal are now 80x21. But it gets worse: when you close the second tab and the tab bar disappears, the window size is changed to 80x23 â€“ at least you tried, Apple.\r\n\r\nI have a workaround for this, which is to always run with the tab bar shown. But to get 80x24 when I do that, I need to configure Window Size under Preferences > Profiles > Windows to use 27 Rows, otherwise, it starts as 80x21.\r\n\r\nThe video below is using Terminal Version 2.8 (400) (macOS 10.13.3), but the behaviour is the same in Terminal Version 2.8.2 (404) (macOS 10.13.4).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Configure Terminal via Preferences > Profiles > Windows to use a Window Size of 80 Columns and 24 Rows and to show Dimensions in the Title\r\n* Open a new window, observe that the dimensions is 80x24\r\n* Open up a new tab or use View > Show Tab Bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the window does not change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the window changed to 80x21.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS High Sierra Version 10.13.4\r\nTerminal Version 2.8.2 (404)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n?"
