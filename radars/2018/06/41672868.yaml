    description: "Summary:\r\nImage if your iPhone played an annoying sound every time it was unlocked, even when set to silent, and the only way to disable this was to also limit emergency alerts. This is what I’m observing with iOS 12 on iPhone SE.\n\nOn unlock with Touch ID, the iPhone vibrates. The vibration motor is audible on iPhone SE. In a quiet environment, everyone around you will hear a vrrrrrrrr! each time you unlock your iPhone. It doesn't feel good either. This feedback is way too strong for such a common action.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnlock an iPhone SE with Touch ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone should unlock, displaying changes on screen and then the user can calmly do what they wanted to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPhone vibrates as it unlocks, distracting the user. It’s like the iPhone is saying HEY I WAS UNLOCKED WHEN YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE HOME BUTTON, JUST LIKE THE LAST 1000 TIMES YOU DID THIS!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 dev beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only way to disable this that I’ve found is to disable vibration entirely with Settings > Accessibility > Vibration. As the screen there says, this also disables vibration for emergency alerts such as earthquakes which would be nice to keep turned on."
