    description: "Summary:\r\nStoryboards and XIBs are often modified when they are just being opened. This sometimes causes huge diffs for simple changes, including minor frame/rect changes (0.5 - presumably due to using Retina vs. non-Retina monitors), tools versions at the top of a file, moving XML around.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpening an IB file should not modify the file in any way whatsoever\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSeemingly randomly, IB files are modified\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:"
