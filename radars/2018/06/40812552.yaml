    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen parallel tests are enabled the total test time displayed in the test report is much lower than in reality.\n\nOur test suite runs in 57s on one simulator, but when parallel tests are enabled the total test time displayed is 8s (see screenshot).\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEnable parallel testing and run tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWith two simulators the total test time should be reduced by around 50%\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTotal test time displayed is around 8 times less\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOn the screenshot the right side is without parallel tests, left side with parallel tests running on 2 simulators. The total run time seems to be about right - 138s on 1 simulator and 66s on 2 simulators."
