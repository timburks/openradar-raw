    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, it is impossible to delete apps from App Store Connect without having released an actual app on it once.\r\n\r\nSometimes, either on purpose or by CI accident, new apps are registered in App Store Connect, without the intention of ever actually releasing the app under that SKU. \r\n\r\nFor example, an agency might make a placeholder SKU to be able to release a Testflight build before the client is able to set up their own environment. Or someone might have made a command-line mistake, which caused a new SKU to be created with a typo.\r\n\r\nThese situations happen often, and they clutter the App Store Connect dashboard, without having a way to delete them. Currently the only way to delete these SKU's is by submitting a working app, perform all the necessary steps to get it released (including App Review) and then promptly delete that same app.\r\n\r\nI understand that Apple actually registers these SKU's somewhere and they shouldn't be deleted once created. However, a way to at least get rid of them in the developer's App Store Connect dashboard would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
