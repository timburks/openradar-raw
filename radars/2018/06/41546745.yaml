    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs a developer I've found creating custom instruments to be a very intriguing opportunity to see more data and context during profiling. This is really great! I found it very frustrating to develop an instrument though, given the lack of documentation. This compounds with the current UI that requires editing XML by hand with limited support from Xcode. I was very pleased to discover the excellent documentation that lives in Instruments, in Help > Instruments Developer Help. This is very comprehensive and makes creating custom instruments much easier. It took me a long time before I happened to find this documentation, though. If it was mentioned in any of the relevant WWDC 2018 videos I must have missed it, and searching on developer.apple.com doesn't seem to show any references to it. I think this is a really great resource for custom instrument developers but it needs to be easier to find it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to look in typical places, like Xcode, WWDC sessions or developer.apple.com for .instrpkg format documentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFind links to comprehensive documentation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo results because it lives only in the Instruments help menu\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nInstruments Version 10.0 (10L177m)"
