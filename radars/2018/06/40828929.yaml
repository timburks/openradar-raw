    description: "Since hospital systems that support HealthKit Health Records are not available in all areas and the systems available are production-only, there should be a way to specify a development server for testing Health Record APIs. Additionally, since health records are private and sensitive information, even if a developer happens to live in an area that has a health system that provides health records, they may not want to use their own private record for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a way to specify the FHIR metadata endpoint of a server and use that for testing so that a developer can both test the validity of their own FHIR implementations on the server side, as well as generate the necessary test data for their HealthKit apps omg the client-side. A possible implementation might be in a way similar to how GPS data is provided for testing in the Xcode build scheme.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, some vendors like Epic, Cerner, and AllScripts have pre-existing sandbox servers available to members of their development program. These servers provide well-know credentials for records that could be loaded or used as test data. Even if these servers are only available in the simulator it still provides a means of testing different use cases for medical records and data."
