    description: "Summary:\r\nUIDocumentBrowserViewController currently doesnâ€™t allow integration of any custom UI into its own window. We would like to request the ability to provide our own UIViewController for integration into the document browser tab bar. This could be used to present a settings UI, or other similar views.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen PDF Viewer by PSPDFKit. Observe that settings can be accessed via a button on the top navigation bar. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a dedicated tab for Settings. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nObserve that settings can be accessed via a button on the top navigation bar. This is hard to discover.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11+\r\n\r\nNotes:"
