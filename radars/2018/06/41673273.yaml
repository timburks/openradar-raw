    description: "Summary:\r\nThe fluid redirectable home screen and app switching gestures introduced on iPhone X and brought to iPad with iOS 12 are really wonderful. Navigation feels great and is so fast to use.\n\nPlease bring this feature to all iPhones!\n\nYes, you can click the home button to go to the home screen, and double click it to go into multitasking, but this feels so clunky and slow. The common task of going back to the previous app would be so much faster and more fun if you could swipe up slightly from the bottom and slide over to it, like you can on iPad.\n\nOr to put it another way, I think moving Control Center to a more inconvenient place is worth it to have better access to app switching. The fact that these devices have home buttons too isnâ€™t really relevant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSwipe up from the bottom of the screen on and iPhone with a home button with iOS 12.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to slide across to recent apps, pause to get the app switcher, or swipe up to get to the home scree.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGet boring Control Center.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 dev beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
