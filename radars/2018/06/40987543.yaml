    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have an app that track user location in background and posts to a server so your friends can see where you’re (similar to “Find my Friends”).\n\nWe often evaluate different solutions to balance between power usage and GPS accuracy. It’d be great to have an API to track how much battery your app has been using in a more accurate way that wouldn’t be relative to other data (as displayed in Settings.app).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to measure if the changes you’re making to your app are resulting in a better power efficiency \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. You could call an API that would return how many Joules or Kilowatts you’re app have used during the period that you’ve passed as parameter\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. You can’t do that\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere’re some alternatives like profiling with Instruments, but it doesn’t scale. We’d like something that we could measure power efficiency with our beta testers in their real life usage patterns.\n\nWe’ve done something to try to infer that based on how much time our app is being used in background and which location API is being called, but we’d like something more precise."
