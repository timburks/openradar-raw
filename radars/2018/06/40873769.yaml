    description: "I'm trying to use Playground to test our application but can't since Playground can't find the symbols in runtime.\r\n\r\nOur application contains a core framework(\"MagistoCore\"), which uses CocaPods with misc third parties (AppsFlyer for example), some are static other are dynamic.\r\n\r\nI've narrowed the problem to a simple project which illustrates the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile MagistoCore framework.\r\n2. run TestPlayground.playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe method MyTest.printMe() should print \"*** WORKS ***\" into console\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayground execution failed:\r\n\r\nerror: Couldn't lookup symbols:\r\n  __T011MagistoCore6MyTestC7printMeyyFZ\r\n  __T011MagistoCore6MyTestCMa\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n1. remove \"-framework \"AppsFlyerTracker\" from OTHER_LDFLAGS in Pods-MagistoCore.debug.xcconfig will fix the issue\r\n\r\n2. I'm at the WWDC 18, please add aprantl@apple.com to any.\r\n\r\n3. Sample project attached.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n-\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
