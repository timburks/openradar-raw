    description: "Summary:\r\nSince Xcode 10, when a Playground is created using File » New » Playground with an Xcode project opened, the playground is added as a file to the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an Xcode iOS Project (f.e. Single View Application)\n- Create a new Playground with File » New » Playground\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayground opened as separate window and not added to the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayground is added to the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 2 (10L177m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn many cases it seems illogical to embed playgrounds in Xcode projects because they are \"mini-projects\" themselves.\nThis leads to confusion with beginners, f.e. you can do \"Product > Build\" with a playground open then and this builds the project the playground is embedded in and does not refer to the opened playground.\nMaybe it makes sense to embed playgrounds f.e. as documentation in regular Xcode projects but imho it should be possible to prevent the playground being added to the project / maybe it should not be the default to add it - I feel I should explictly request \"add this playground to my project\".\nMaybe in the Save as dialog when creating the playground, the Group option could have a \"None/Don't add to my project\" state, and maybe this could be the default."
