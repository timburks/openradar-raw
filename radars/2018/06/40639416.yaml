    description: "Summary: Minimizing a home screen website causes it to completely reload when opened again. This happens every time. The session, and anything you were doing or any data you had entered is lost without warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Visit twitter.com in Safari on iOS. Tap share and then add to home screen. Open the newly created icon on your homescreen. Interact with the text fields on the login page, and then minimize the application. Open it again shortly after, and you will find that anything you typed in the text fields has been reset.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Nothing should change. You should resume where you left off.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Website gets reloaded.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11.4 (15F5079a)"
