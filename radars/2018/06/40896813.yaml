    description: "Assuming that the  \"Manage Plug-Ins…” UI in the Mail Preferences is following the Safari Extension principles:\r\n*  All mail Plug-Ins must be activated through the “Manage Plug-Ins…”.\r\n*  All Mail Plug-ins are off by default.\r\n\r\nMay I highlight that there is one **major** difference between Safari Extension interaction for users. It is possible to open the Safari Extension preference via:\r\n*  double-clicking .safariextz\r\n*  [SFSafariApplication showPreferencesForExtensionWithIdentifier:completionHandler:]\r\n\r\nThis allows developers to guide users to the place where they can install an extension.\r\n\r\nPossible solution to open the prefs & “Manage Plug-Ins…” window:\r\n\r\n*  Register .mailbundle file extension\r\n*  URL schema\r\n*  AppleScript command, like already exists for System Preferences. \"reveal: Reveals an anchor within a preference pane or preference pane itself\"\r\n\r\nThis would strike a balance between ensuring user consent and simple installation experience.\r\nComments"
