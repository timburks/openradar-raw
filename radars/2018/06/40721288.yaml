    description: "There seems to be active changes being made to how images are displayed when a user switches Invert Colors on or off. \r\n\r\nThe current state as of Release 57 (Safari 11.2, WebKit 13606.1.18) Makes images appear in their original colour scheme in both inverted and non-inverted states.\r\n\r\nThis makes reading images that contain black text on a whim background, such as images of text commonly seen on Twitter and Facebook, impossible to read for people who use Invert Colors to be able to read text.\r\n\r\nThere was a period where Safari Technology Preview would present the images in their original colour scheme but if the user switched out of 'invert colors' the image would be inverted. This was a good workaround in my experience as photographs would be visible but images containing text could be read by turning off invert colors.\r\n\r\nPlease be mindful of the reason people use invert colors to view content, which is ultimately more important than photographs appearing the rich tway round. This is an accessibility feature, not an aesthetic one."
