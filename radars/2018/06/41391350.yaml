    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\niOS Photos can search photos with places. But it does not support search photos for user's current location, which is very useful when revisiting a place.\r\n\r\nSuggest to add search photos of current location with keywords like: \"here\", \"this place\" in Photos."
