    description: When typing on the iOS keyboard in US English at least, typing "tastey" auto corrects the word to "tastes". Based on the location of "Y" relative to "S" on the keyboard, it's clear that "tastey" is a misspelling of the word "tasty" in this case. The user is not trying to type "tastes".
