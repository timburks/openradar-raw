    description: "Summary:\r\nIn early iOS 11 betas, the speed limits were displayed in Canada on Maps. Public releases are missing this feature. I know it's working overall because as soon as I drive into the United States, I see speed limits on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrive in Canada.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee limits in Km/h.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo speed limits are displayed."
