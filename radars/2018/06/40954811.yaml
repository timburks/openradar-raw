    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the recent improvements to Do Not Disturb, it would be great to also have the option to automatically enable Do Not Disturb during calendar events. Ideally this wouldnâ€™t apply to all-day events and can be toggled on a per-event basis with configurable default value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create calendar event at certain time\n2. During this time, DND automatically is enabled\n3. At the end of the meeting, DND is turned off again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:"
