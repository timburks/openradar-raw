    description: "Summary:\r\nIn-app purchases are increasingly replacing paid downloads as the way to pay for apps, but Family Sharing has been left behind since it only works with paid downloads\n\nNon-consumable in-app purchases should be treated like paid downloads and shared between accounts in the same family.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download some free app with non-consumable in-app purchases from the app store, for example Working Copy:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8\n\n2. Make a non-consumable purchase by going to Settings (gear button in the upper left corner) then tap \"Unlock Pro features\", then tap \"Unlock for all your devices\" and complete the in-app purchase.\n\n3. Switch to some other device signed into another App Store account part of the same Family Sharing plan as the one that just made the in-app purchase.\n\n4. Download Working Copy again.\n\n5. Enter settings and tap \"Unlock Pro features\" and now tap \"Restore Previous Purchases\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe in-app purchase made from the other account part of the same Family Sharing plan should be restored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing is restored.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
