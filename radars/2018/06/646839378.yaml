    description: "As a developer I should be able to fetch the changed contacts from the notification or the contactStore instead of iterating over all of the contacts over and over again.\r\nAdd an api in CNContactStore to fetch the changed contact from a time duration i.e. a delta of contacts. \r\nOther alternative can be to pass the changed objects in the CNContactStoreDidChange notification."
