    description: "Summary:\r\nDear World Wide Developer's Conference organizers,\r\n\r\nWhen we walk around WWDC, our badges tend to bounce around and flip over. When we stop walking, they have about a 50% chance of settling with the printed side facing our bodies, hiding our identities from our interlocutors.\r\n\r\nPlease print our names on both sides of our badges so we can more easily discover and remember each others' names.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWWDC 2018\r\n\r\nNotes:"
