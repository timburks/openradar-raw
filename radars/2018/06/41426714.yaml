    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have multiple pre-compiled binaries that were built with different Objective-C compiler versions, ld can produce this warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome object files have incompatible Objective-C category definitions. Some category metadata may be lost. All files containing Objective-C categories should be built using the same compiler.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful if this warning also included the specific categories that violated this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Link a project with categories from multiple binaries from different compiler versions that use class properties + -ObjC\r\n2. Get this warning\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe warning includes the category file name causing the issue\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to binary search your pre-compiled binaries until you figure out which 2 are incompatible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nld64-351.8 (Xcode 9.4.1)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the newest version of the ld source dumps, this warning is produced here https://github.com/michaelweiser/ld64/blob/ff67689fc5414c05cef1aa8042457738d8f9aba2/src/ld/passes/objc.cpp#L1311-L1323"
