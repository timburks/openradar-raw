    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 11, Xcode could not capture GPU frame when using OpenGL ES. What is showing on the status bar of Xcode is something like \"no capture boundary is found\". However, when the same app running on iOS 10 or below, the GPU frame could be successfully captured.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a simple OpenGL ES app and debug it on iOS 11. Then click the 'GPU Capture' button on the Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe GPU frames could be successfully captured. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens and the status bar shows 'no boundary found'. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nAny version since iOS 11. \r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN.A."
