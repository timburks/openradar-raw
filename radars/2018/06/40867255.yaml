    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to load some assets that are not in the main bundle but in a framework. To get the framework path I use -[NSBundle bundleForClass:] with a class in my framework. On the simulator, I get a path in the DerivedData folder that is removed soon after launching the app, so loading the assets fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPut any asset in a framework and try to load them in the simulator. Use -[NSBundle bundleForClass:] with a class defined in the framework.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should receive a path that is a subdirectory of my main app's bundle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI receive a path like \n\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/<app name>/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/<framework name>.framework\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease forward to Breckin Loggins with whom I discussed this at WWDC."
