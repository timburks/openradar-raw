    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSelecting a highlight color in System Preferences > General doesn't affect the menu item selection color. I'm making the assumption, based on the dynamic behaviour of the image beside the Appearance preference, that in addition to the tint color for segmented controls, the focus ring, text selection, etc. the menu selection color should also change.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open System Preferences.app\r\n2. Open the General pane\r\n3. Select a different accent color, which will also change the highlight color\r\n4. Note that the popup button colors in the pane change. If you click one of these buttons, the presented menu doesn't use the same color\r\n5. Select some text in Safari, note that the selection color matches the preference\r\n6. Open the Apple menu in the menu bar, note that the menu selection color has not changed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf the dynamic image beside the General > Appearance preference is meant to indicate that the menu selection color should change along with other colors in the system, then that should happen when the highlight color is changed. \r\n\r\nIf the dynamic image beside the General > Appearance preference is not meant to indicate that the menu selection color should change then another image would be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe menu selection color doesn't ever change from the default blue.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n10.14 Beta (18A293u)\r\n13\" Macbook Air, mid-2012"
