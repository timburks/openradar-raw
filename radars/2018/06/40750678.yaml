    description: "Summary:\r\nThe macOS bundled Python 2.7 comes with pip which is still linked against OpenSSL 0.9.8  which is so geriatric that it cannot connect to PyPI anymore since they require a sane TLS 1.2 connection.\nDue to that Python and pip have become useless since you cannot install any packages anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsudo pip install whateverypythonpackageitdoesnotmatteranymore\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npip should be able to establish a TLS 1.2 connection over HTTPS to install packages from PyPI.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npip will only do TLS 1.0 which correctly fails to connect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPython 2.7.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's just sad to see Apple let macOS rot to such a slow death because nobody seems to care about it anymore."
