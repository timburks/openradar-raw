    description: "i expect the new 'iTunesLibrary' framework to be an (improved) alternative to accessing the iTunes Library through the ScriptingBridge mechanism.\r\n\r\nthe ScriptingBridge allows to access the 'lyrics' tag of an locally stored MP3 file. this works fine except for scenarios where Apple doesn't want lyrics to be read (Apple Music, streaming, etc).\r\n\r\ni expect the new  'iTunesLibrary' framework to provide the same support for lyrics for locally stored files. \r\n\r\nso, please add a \"lyrics\" property to the \"ITLibMediaItem\" class"
