    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter the Apple TV has been awake for a number of hours I begin to experience issues with video playback. The only solution I have found is restarting the Apple TV.  This affects all video playback that requires HDCP. Here are some examples. \r\n\r\n- iTunes Movies - Content will not stream in HD or 4K. If you disable Quick Start to force HD/4K playback, the Apple TV displays an HDCP error message. A reboot of the Apple TV resolves this issue.\r\n\r\n- Netflix - Content will begin playing and audio can be hear bu there is no video. Apple TV UI and Playback controls are visible and accessible. A reboot of the Apple TV resolves this issue.\r\n\r\n- Amazon Prime - Video content never loads. A reboot of the Apple TV resolves this issue.\r\n\r\nRestarting the TV does not resolve the issue. The Apple TV itself must be restarted. HDCP then starts working as expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be mitigated by sleeping the Apple TV after each use, however this then interferes with the Apple TV's role as a HomeKit hub.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect Apple TV to a Sony TV (other TVs have been reported to experience the same issue, but I have the issue with a Sony Bravia)\r\n2. Leave the Apple TV awake for a number of hours. \r\n3. Attempt to playback video with copy protection.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo would begin playing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo does not begin playing (See examples in summary)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTV OS 11.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple TV 4K plugged into Sony Bravia 4K HDR TV via the Belkin High Speed HDMI cable recommended by Apple."
