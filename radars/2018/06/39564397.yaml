    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nthe path_helper tool used to set the PATH does not read the /etc/paths.d directory in a reliable way. It used to do so alphabetically, but this seems to no longer be the case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCopy the attached paths.d files into /private/etc/paths.d and run /usr/libexec/path_helper\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/some/path/4:/some/path/3:/some/path/2:/some/path/1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/some/path/1:/some/path/4:/some/path/2:/some/path/3\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMac OS X : 10.13.4\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPost filing comment:\r\n\r\nI have found someone who has provided a patched version of path_helper to resolve this issue -- https://gist.github.com/nohillside/a4da0e1bb00135de163a7d4059b69fd5\r\n\r\nThat said, I deploy software to people that adds its path via the paths.d mechanism and would like to avoid enforcing that they use a patched version of path_helper, so that patch doesn't work as-is for me.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
