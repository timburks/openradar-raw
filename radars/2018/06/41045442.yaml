    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOur app builds, bundles, and ships its own build of sqlite. We use a newer version of sqlite than is available in iOS 11 or earlier. iOS 12 has upgraded its version of sqlite, and now the APIs we use, such as sqlite3_prepare_v3 and sqlite3_bind_pointer, have availability annotations that mark them as iOS 12+ only, which mean our app now fails to build with these kinds of errors:\r\n\r\n'sqlite3_bind_pointer' is only available on iOS 12.0 or newer\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Write some code with sqlite3_bind_pointer or any other sqlite functions that are marked as only available in iOS 12.\r\n2. Build the latest sqlite from source and embed this in the app\r\n3. Build the app/program\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app/program builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe build errors with \"'sqlite3_bind_pointer' is only available on iOS 12.0 or newer\" despite the function being in the library that was built from source and is therfore always available.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.5\r\nSwift 4.1.2 release toolchain (cannot use 4.2 due to https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7341)"
