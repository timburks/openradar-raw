    description: "It'd be great if crashes during XCTest unit test runs would be written to the file system within the test result bundle. It would also ensure that it happens before the unit test runs completes.\r\n\r\nRight now, in our CI environment, we sleep for 45s after a failed test run and then look in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` for new files since the start of the test run. This is our current approach for finding out if there was a crash that occurred during the CI test run. It is a waste of CI resources most of the time to wait that long generally (especially if a crash didn't happen), but there is no clear indicator of when the crash log file is being generated. We've also run into instances in the past where the crash dump file wasn't yet generated at 30 seconds, when tests had clearly crashed and I found the crash file was on the file system of the CI machine created a few seconds after.\r\n\r\nA reasonable alternative to this might be to have a clear indicator that a crash has occurred during the tests and the crash dump is in the process of being generated so that we know when to expect the file to appear and how long to wait for.\r\n\r\nAnother approach to addressing this might be to include a signal handler in XCTest that dumps the stack frames to the console for the test that broke output before the app gets torn down.\r\n\r\nParsing xcodebuild's console output is not seem like a super reliable way to detect this, and it won't inform us when the crash file has finished being created."
