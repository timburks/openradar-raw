    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen returning a custom success respons for a custom intent when a Siri Shortcut is triggered, Siri will always say \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a custom intent in an .intentdefinition file.\r\n2. Add a custom success response to that custom intent with a template.\r\n3. Add an intent extension.\r\n4. In -handle(intent:completion:) return your custom success response when your custom intent is triggered.\r\n5. Configure a Siri Shortcut that triggers your custom intent.\r\n6. Trigger the Siri Shortcut.\r\n\r\nOr even better: order some beers using the attached sample project. Launch the app and press the buttons to order beer to donate some intents. Then configure the Siri Shortcuts from Settings.app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSiri reads out loud a string specified by the template for the custom success response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSiri says \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode version 10.0 beta (10L176w). iOS 12 beta 1."
