    description: "Summary:\r\nAs mentioned during https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/417/, one way to isolate behavior during integration (UI) tests is to have a mock server.\n\nIn practice, however, this is a bit hard. It envolves embedding a HTTP server on your UI Tests target like described in https://envoy.engineering/embedded-web-server-for-ios-ui-testing-8ff3cef513df.\n\nItâ€™d be much easier if this would be supported officially with XCTest APIs. Bonus points for Xcode integration to provide static files as responses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:"
