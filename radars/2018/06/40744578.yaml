    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for UIAppearance.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf:) currently has the following description:\n\nReturns the appearance proxies when the object is contained by one of the specified classes.\n\nThis does not at all describe the behavior and appears simply incorrect. From that description, you would think that this:\n\n        UILabel.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [RedView.self, BlueView.self]).textColor = .white\n\nDoes the same as this:\n\n        UILabel.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [RedView.self]).textColor = .white\n        UILabel.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [BlueView.self]).textColor = .white\n\nBut it does not, instead the array is treated as an ordering: “labels that are contained in instances of RedView that are contained in instances of BlueView”. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the docs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDocs describe behavior.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn’t. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nReal behavior is hinted at in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiappearance but rather cryptic imo."
