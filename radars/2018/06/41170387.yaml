    description: "(Note: This was originally submitted as a code-level support incident, but they told me to file a bug report and refunded my credits).\r\n\r\nIn preparation for all of the upcoming macOS color changes (i.e., Dark Mode), I was attempting to use colors defined in an xcassets file. I reference the colors through their name like this:\r\n\r\nNSColor(named: NSColor.Name(\"App Control Foreground Color\"))\r\n\r\nI would expect, if the specified color name didn't exist in any of the available resources, that this NSColor initializer would return nil (due to the optional initializer), and I would be able to write code like this:\r\n\r\nNSColor(named: NSColor.Name(\"App Control Foreground Color\")) ?? NSColor.textColor\r\n\r\nInstead, if the named color does not exist, the initializer creates a non-color with an unspecified color space. This, in turn, can really just makes things get colored as transparent when in use and generates no warnings.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a color using the NSColor(named:) initializer where the name specified doesn't actually exist in the bundle.\r\n2. Observe the NSColor is not initialized as nil, despite the optional initializer, and is instead an invalid color.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA 'nil' value return from my optional NSColor initializer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn NSColor object, but one with an invalid colorspace.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.5 \r\nxCode 9.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac Retina 5k, 27-inch, Late 2014"
