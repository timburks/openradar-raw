    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 12.0 beta 1, cross origin requests are failing in WKWebView with the error “Preflight response is not successful”, but I cannot see any preflight requests being attempted via the Safari Web Inspector.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake a fetch call from a page running inside WKWebView\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn OPTIONS request should be made to the server, followed by the actual request (if the OPTIONS request was successful).\r\nBoth requests should be listed in the Network tab of the Safari Web Inspector.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo OPTIONS request appears to be made.\r\nAn error is logged to the Safari console: “Preflight response is not successful. fetch cannot load [url omitted] due to access control checks.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also rdar://40807782 and possibly rdar://40495434 (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186312)"
