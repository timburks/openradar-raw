    description: "Summary:\r\nA common pitfall when developing app is to have memory leaks. It would be great to have an ability to write tests for checking this.\n\nA possible workaround would be to have a list of “weak” variables to important objects of the app (e.g. NSManagedContext). Then during tearDown of the test check that all the “weak” variables are nil - this shows that the objects did get released. Unfortunately the current implementation of XCTest prevents this because each test invocation is wrapped inside @autorelease pool which gets flushed only after “tearDown” is finished. The obejcts are finally released later than it’s possible to fail the test.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
