    description: "For AVAudioSession mode PlayAndRecord, the ring/silent switch is ignored. Some apps, like games, want to preserve the behavior of a silent app when the ring/silent switch is active under all possible AVAudioSession modes. The current workaround is to include UI controls for soft muting, which is counter to platform convention and demands UI real estate better used for something else.\r\nPlease consider providing a function, property, or delegate to allow interrogating and/or responding to switch status. Thanks."
