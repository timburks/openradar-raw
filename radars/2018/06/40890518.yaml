    description: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThe new AuthenticationService [1] in iOS 12 allows for supplying usernames and passwords to the system, which in turn can then be auto filled by the system into the login form that is currently displayed to the user. In addition, iOS 12 allows to auto fill one time passwords send to the user via SMS.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a lot of services which do not send one time passwords via SMS (like Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, Amazon, ...). Instead they use a third party app for generating these one time passwords for the user. These apps generate the code using two RFC standards:\r\n* RFC 4226: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226\r\n* RFC 6238: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238\r\nExamples for such applications are Google Authenticator [2], OTP Auth [3] and Authy [4].\r\n\r\nNow my suggestion: Why not allow these one time password applications ([2], [3], [4], ...) to supply the one time password to the system? Why is the one time password auto fill restricted to codes sent via SMS?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRoland\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices\r\n[2]: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8\r\n[3]: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384?mt=8\r\n[4]: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8"
