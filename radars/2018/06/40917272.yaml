    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you do a two-finger swipe up to read every control on the screen, and the current screen is a UITableViewController containing just one row, after the row is read by VoiceOver it jumps down to the middle of the screen.  This does not occur if the table has two or more rows.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached sample project on a physical device with VoiceOver enabled and do a two-finger swipe up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe label in the table view cell should be highlighted and read by VoiceOver and nothing else on the screen should change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe row jumps down to the middle of the screen after it's read.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.4 (15F79)  (note, the bug is not seen on my iOS 10.3.3 device)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMy iOS 10.3.3 device is an iPhone 6 Plus, and my iOS 11.4 device is an iPhone 8 Plus."
