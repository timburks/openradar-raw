    description: "Screen Time is a great feature during the week, since I want to stop being on my phone from around 11:30pm. However, on the weekend I'll frequently be out after this time, and don't want access to my phone to be restricted.\r\n\r\nThis is also a problem with Do Not Disturb; I don't want restriction during the night on the weekend, but I do in the week. Ultimately my daily schedule is different from week days to weekends.\r\n\r\nThe Bedtime feature in Clock handles this well, and I believe Screen Time and Do Not Disturb should as well."
