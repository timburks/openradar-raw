    description: "Summary:\r\nWith macOS 10.12 SDK, running on macOS 10.12, 1 year is 1 sidereal year. With macOS 10.12 SDK, running on macOS 10.13, 1 year is 365 days. This seems to disregard the concept of leap years entirely! This makes it no longer usable for any amount of time longer than a few months.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if this is intended, give us an enum for what kind of year we want (tropical, sidereal, Gregorian, etc)?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse DateComponentsFormatter to make a string from `(365.242189*24*60*60)`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nResulting string is `\"1 year\"` on both platforms\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nResulting string is `\"1 year\"` on macOS 10.12, but `\"1 year, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds\"` on macOS 10.13\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.12, macOS 10.13\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 8.3.3, Xcode 9.4"
