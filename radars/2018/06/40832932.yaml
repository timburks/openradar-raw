    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 11.3.1, my iPhone X showed up in my MacBook Pro’s WiFi options running in macOS 12.13, even without “Personal Hotspot” enabled, which was great. Now that I’ve installed iOS 12 Beta 1 on my iPhone, it no longer shows up in my Mac’s WiFi list. If I explicitly enable “Personal Hotspot” I can connect to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWith an iPhone that presents itself in a Mac’s WiFi list with iOS 11 and macOS 12.13, update the iPhone to iOS 12 and attempt to connect to it via the Mac’s WiFi list. WiFi & Bluetooth should be enabled on both devices & the iPhone’s “Personal Hotspot” toggle should be Off in Settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPhone should appear in the list of WiFi options on the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPhone doesn’t appear in the list of WiFi options on the Mac.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
