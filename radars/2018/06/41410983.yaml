    description: "In Xcode 9, the source editor removed editor placeholders when the user pressed enter.  This left the developer to manually type boilerplate parameters.  It was madening, since previous behavior would simple default to the placeholder text when pressing enter.  Xcode 10 recently reintroduced better usability for editor placeholders when hitting the return key by changing the placeholder into source code matching the placeholder.\r\n\r\nBut this is only going half-way.  Developers still have to arrow back to give blocks and closures parameter names after Xcode auto-completes the types.\r\n\r\nAn example closure with placeholders (feel free to paste into Xcode):\r\n\r\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {}, completion: { (<#Bool#>) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThe boolean parameter in the completion should, when pressing enter, default to a reasonable default, such as the parameter name specified in its header doc, or if one isn't present, default to a camel-case of its type.  In the above example:\r\n\r\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {}, completion: { (finished: Bool) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nFor other situations where a header doc is not present, default to a camel-case variant of the type.  For the given placeholders:\r\n\r\n    NetworkController.fetchBaseController(\"idspispopd\", completion: {(<#BaseController?#>, <#Error?#>) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nIt should produce this output when expanding the placeholders:\r\n\r\n    NetworkController.fetchBaseController(\"idspispopd\", completion: {(baseController: BaseController?, error: Error?) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nAlternative Variants\r\n\r\nAdditional complexity could be added that when enter is pressed on a editor placeholder, that the types-text is created, but editor placeholders are created for parameter names.  For example:\r\n\r\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {}, completion: { (<#Bool#>) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThis would expand out to:\r\n\r\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {}, completion: { (<#finished#>: Bool) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThe developer coulf press enter again to take the suggested name, or alternatively start typing their own:\r\n\r\n    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {}, completion: { (completed: Bool) in\r\n        <#code#>\r\n    })\r\n\r\nTaking this final form, developer productivity would be dramatically increased, as well as enhance understanding of what specifically the parameters to closures are asking without having to consult the documentation.  I realize it is probably too late to squeeze this into Xcode 10, but it would be quite dreadful to go another year (or more!) with the current behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration."
