    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 12, MapKit doesn't support annotation callout views with buttons that stretch from top to bottom of the callout. Instead, the button is confined to a square frame with margins.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached sample project and run it on iOS 12.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe blue button should stretch over the full height of the callout.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blue button is confined to a square frame with margins.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've also attached two screenshots of iOS 11 and iOS 12.\r\nThis bug is very critical for us and we haven't found a workaround yet."
