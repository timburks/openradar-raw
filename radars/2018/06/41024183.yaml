    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nCurrently, when iOS 12 tells you that you have reached an App Limit that you've set (e.g. your 1 hour on Facebook is up), there's an Ignore button right at the bottom of the screen for you to easily bypass your limit.\r\n\r\nThe intention of App Limits seem to be for those of us who have had our self-control hijacked by social media and gaming companies.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it should be harder to ignore an App Limit so that we don't easily ignore it and keep using the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior: I should have to navigate back into App Limit Settings manually in order to turn off the limit I already set up. It would also be great if I had the option of telling my phone not to let me back in regardless, but at least add some additional friction.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior: I can easily tap Ignore at the bottom of the screen whenever I reach an App Limit, and continue using the app I want to limit myself from using."
