    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode successfully generates and displays test coverage for any source files in iOS application or CocoaTouch framework targets. When Mach-O Type is changed to Static Library for CocoaTouch framework targets, test coverage is no longer displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSample project is located at: https://github.com/cihancimen/StaticFrameworkCodeCoverage\r\n\r\n1. Create an iOS app project with unit tests.\r\n2. Create an CocoaTouch framework with unit tests.\r\n3. Change CocoaTouch framework's Mach-O Type to Static Library.\r\n4. Drag & Drop CocoaTouch framework's Xcode project into one of iOS App's groups.\r\n5. Add CocoaTouch framework as a target dependency to the iOS App target.\r\n6. Enable Gather Coverage Data for both targets.\r\n7. Run Product -> Test.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth application target and framework target's test coverage is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly application target's test coverage is displayed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.3 (9E145)"
