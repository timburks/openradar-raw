    description: "I have started supporting localization in my app and wanted to use the Interface Builder Assistant Preview to verify my layouts in different locales and languages. Unlike the storyboard, the Assistant Preview window does not render custom subclasses of UIKit view classes correct.\r\nWhile @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable work, override calls to `draw`, `drawText`, `intrinsicContentSize` are not respected, breaking any value in the Assistant Preview window.\r\n \r\nIs this an established bug? Does anyone know a workaround?\r\n \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/ says the following:\r\n \r\nPreview\r\nUse the Preview mode to quickly view your interface in a variety of situations without having to run your app, dramatically speeding up the iterative design process. You can view your app in portrait or landscape format, on a previous version of iOS, on different screen sizes, and more.\r\n \r\nWithout custom view support, this is simply not possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOverride instrinsicContentSize in a subclass of UIView and alter it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe storyboard live view and assistant preview window both render the custom view correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe storyboard assistant preview window uses the base class instrinsicContentSize and fails to render correctly"
