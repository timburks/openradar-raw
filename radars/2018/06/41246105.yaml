    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode applications share the same preferences and build cache (in Derived Data folders). Most of time these files cannot be use across different Xcode versions. \n\nFor example, when trying on New Build System between the legacy one, or Xcode 10 between Xcode 9, we often need to Clean Build Folder or the build will failed.\n\nThese issues can be solved by introduce path settings per Xcode version. Or I believe you can find a better solution so that developers don't need to Clean Build Folder after switching to a different Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project on Xcode 9.3.1 and build it with New Build System (Shared Workspace Settings)\n2. Close Xcode 9.3.1\n3. Open the same project on Xcode 10 beta 1 and build it with New Build System (Shared Workspace Settings)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild succeed.\nEach Xcode has different Derived Data paths and won't mess around each others' cache data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBuild failed with many kinds of error because it loads caches generated by other Xcode.\nClean Build Folder and try again will build successfully.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode can change Derived Data paths settings in Preferences or Per-User Workspace Settings, which is great. But these settings are shared between different Xcode versions. \n\nThis is a common issues so I don't provide a sample project."
