    description: "Use-case: Although I am trying to switch careers to be a full time dev, I am currently a Corporate Jet Pilot. Thus, I have a private iPhone and a work iPhone. When I am busy preparing the aircraft for the next sector, I get many notifications about that next sector on my work iPhone. However, because my AppleWatch is paired to my personal iPhone, I have to stop what I am doing to check whether the notification is something important like an updated departure time, or change of destination, or something unimportant like a marketing update. I know that many AppleWatches can be paired to a single iPhone (probably useful for devs, but not for 'real people' who are more likely to have a single watch and multiple iPhones).\r\n\r\nFeature: Pair to 2 iPhones. A Primary iPhone, as now, would be the manager of the AppleWatch, but a Secondary iPhone would be to forward notifications.\r\n\r\nImplementation: Watch settings on the Primary iPhone to add a switch for \"Allow Secondary\". Watch settings on Secondary iPhone to add a \"Pair as Secondary\" option."
