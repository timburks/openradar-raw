    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new feature that recognises a workout that was made without being started by the user triggers a notification when the workout already finishes, and, if the user activates it, can lead to a workout being tracked way more than necessary.\r\n\r\nI believe that the watch (since it can suggest the start, and end of a workout), should automatically start, and finish a workout, when the user acts on a notification.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Without starting an workout, go for a walk\r\n2. After a while, stop the walk\r\n2.1. At some point, in the previous steps, you will have received a notification telling you that a workout was detected, DO NOT act on it\r\n3. After some minutes out of the work-out, act on the notification by recording the walk\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe workout should start, and stop right away, recording the walk that happened, but already finished\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe workout keeps running, so, if the user is not fully aware, it gets being tracked for a long time\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0 (16R5283r)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nModel MR352LL/A"
