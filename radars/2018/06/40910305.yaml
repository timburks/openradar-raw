    description: "Summary:\r\nDear file vaulters and/or bootstrappers,\r\n\r\nI have a MacBook Pro with two partitions. On one partition I have macOS 10.13.5 installed. On the other partition, I have macOS 10.14 beta 1 installed.\r\n\r\nBoth partitions are protected by FileVault. Both installations have two users. The 10.13.5 partition has one admin user (my normal login) and one normal user (for my daughter). The 10.14 beta 1 partition has one admin user (mine) and the guest user.\r\n\r\nWhen I boot the macOS 10.13.5 partition, the FileVault unlock screen shows icons for both users. I can select a user using the arrow keys or the mouse.\r\n\r\nWhen I boot the macOS 10.14 beta 1 partition, the FileVault unlock screen shows icons for both users. However, the arrow keys have no effect. I can only select a user using the mouse.\r\n\r\nPlease bring back arrow key navigation for the FileVault unlock screen.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
