    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum() to write a UIImage to the user's photo library crashes the app even though ab NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription is specified in the app's Info.plist.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is inconsistent with the information provided in the documentation regarding the key, i.e. \"[...] this keys governs read and write access to the userâ€™s photo library\" (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW73).\r\n\r\nSpecifying an NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription fixes this crash. However, according to the docs, both keys are not required to use this function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run provided sample project\r\n- Tap the \"Save to Camera Roll\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe sample.png image is saved to the device's photo library.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes with the following error: \"This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXCode 10 (10L176w)\r\nVerified on iPhone 7 running 15F79 and iPhone 6S+ running 16A5288q\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-"
