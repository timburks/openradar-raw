    description: "The Apple Maps app displays multi-floor, indoor maps for a number of locations. We'd like to see these in MKMapView, too. There should be APIs to display the floor picker, get notified of floor changes and to programmatically change the floor.\r\n\r\nSee screenshots of the MapKit and Apple Maps display in comparison."
