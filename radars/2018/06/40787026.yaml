    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a response is returned by the service worker and the user is in Private Browsing mode, the Set-Cookie header appears to be ignored. The cookie specified in the Set-Cookie header is not set. This happens for files returned from the cache and from the network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have created this repo which contains all of the code and steps necessary to reproduce this issue: https://github.com/cdegit/service-worker-cookie-demo\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n- Create an HTML document that installs a simple service worker (I used sw-toolbox to configure it)\r\n- Serve that HTML document with a cookie in the Set-Cookie header\r\n- Open that document in Safari on iOS 11.4 in Private Browsing mode\r\n- Check that the cookie has been added\r\n- Delete the cookie and refresh the page\r\n- The HTML document is now returned by the service worker, and the cookie is not set\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cookie in the Set-Cookie header is set\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cookie in the Set-Cookie header is not set\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4 and iOS 12 in Private Browsing mode. I can reproduce this on the Simulator and real devices. This issue does not occur on iOS 11.3.1."
