    description: "Summary:\r\nIn our App we use DeviceCheck to secure a two week trial.\nThe month-level resolution of DeviceCheck makes determining when the trial was started quite imprecise.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet a bit via DeviceCheck api to mark a trial consumption\nReinstall the App\nCheck the bit via DeviceCheck api\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe response reveals at an at least weekly granularity when the trial was started.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe response reveals only on monthly granularity when the trial was started\nThus depending on interpretation the customer may get restored a trial that is two weeks to long or short.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
