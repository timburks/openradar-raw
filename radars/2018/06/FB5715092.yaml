    description: "Area:\r\nSiri\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you create a Siri shortcut custom command that finishes with the word \"list\", when triggering it after \"Hey Siri\", the device will try to list reminders, and fail. When you edit the shortcut command to something without the work \"list\" on it, it works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use an app that donate an intent, or user activity\r\n2. Go to Settings -> Siri & Search -> More Shortcuts\r\n3. Find the shortcut related to the previously donated intent, or user activity\r\n4. Tap on the \"+\" sign associated to the shortcut\r\n5. Tap the record button\r\n6. Record a custom command that finishes with the word \"list\"\r\n7. Go to the home screen\r\n8. Call Siri with \"Hey Siri\"\r\n9. Say the custom command previously recorded\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should execute the actions associated to the shortcut\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri tries to find a reminder list with a title similar to the text of the custom command\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 (16A5288q)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X (MQAC2QL/A)"
