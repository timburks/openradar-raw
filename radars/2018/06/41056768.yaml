    description: "When connecting an iPhone to SYNC 3 for the first time, the iOS alert message displays “App Not Installed. The accessory SYNC 3 uses an app you do not have installed. Would you like to get it from the App Store?”\r\n \r\nThis message implies that there is only one app, not multiple, that can be used with SYNC 3. The message should indicate that none of the compatible apps are installed the phone."
