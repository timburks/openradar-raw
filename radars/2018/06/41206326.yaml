    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNSColor returns incorrect color objects for applications built with the 10.13 (or earlier) SDK, when called early during application initialization. Specifically, the call is made before NSApplicationMain is called.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that applications that have not been rebuilt with the 10.14 SDK look bad on macOS with a mix of light and dark colors, and the there may also be text contrast usability issues.\r\n\r\nThis happens at least for [NSColor windowBackgroundColor], and maybe for other colors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake sure macOS is configured for dark mode. Log[NSColor windowBackgroundColor] components first thing in main().\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n[NSColor windowBackgroundColor] returns a light Aqua background color with components of 0.925490.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n[NSColor windowBackgroundColor] returns a dark mode background color with components of 0.196078.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14 Beta (18A293u)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAppearance: Dark"
