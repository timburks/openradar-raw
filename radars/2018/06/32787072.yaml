    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using Xcode I've noticed that the Project Navigator (list of all folders and files on the left-hand side-bar) may expand unrelated folders during certain actions. Further, after tapping the disclosure icon to re-minimise the erroneously expanded directory, if you then navigate to another tab (e.g. the Source Control Navigator) and back to the Project Navigator, the directories will have once again expanded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Create a new Single View iOS app via the template called 'Test'\r\n3. The project is created with defaults including an expanded 'Test' directory in the Project Navigator\r\n4. Right-click on the test directory and add new file > Swift file > Named 'Test'\r\n5. Minimise the 'Test' directory so the Project Navigator displays two minimised directories, 'Test' and 'Product' within the expanded 'Test Project'\r\n6. Navigate to the Source Control Navigator\r\n7. Navigate back to the Project Navigator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo see the same directory layout state as Step 5.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe layout is the same as Step 4. My folder layout configuration has not persisted.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is the simplest situation to reproduce this issue. It is also repeated in many other situations. For example, try minimising all folders in the directory again, and adding a new top-level group. You will find the other, non-related, directories expand. Try minimising all the directories again. Then add a file to the new group. All the directories will expand... etc."
