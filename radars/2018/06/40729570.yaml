    description: "Summary:\r\nSince iOS 11 or one of it’s dot releases, several apps including some from Apple (like the App Store app) have a bug where you may push the same view controller any number of times by touching another cell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with the standard “master detail” template in Xcode and run it on device.\n2. Create a bunch of rows with the plus button.\n3. Touch one of the rows and hold with one finger. \n4. With another finger, tap on another row N times. \n5. Release the first finger.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe detail view controller is pushed once on the stack.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe detail view controller is pushed N times on the stack.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.3.1 (9E501) on macOS 10.13.4 (17E202)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA possible workaround is to do something like:\n\n    override func shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier identifier: String, sender: Any?) -> Bool {\n        return navigationController?.topViewController === self\n    }"
