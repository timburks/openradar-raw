    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting an image on an image view, Interface Builder doesn’t provide a way to specify in which bundle/target to look for this image.\n\nIt appears that at runtime the main bundle is used, but when dealing with resource bundles they could well live in a different place. This behavior is especially bad because the image does appear in IB, so seemingly everything works.\n\nIt would be better if the same target was used as the IB file, and even better if there was a way to specify the target like we can do for setting the class of an IB object.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached project, notice no image shows up and console logs the image can’t be found. Also notice how the image does show in Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can specify the bundle where the image/resource lives\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot specify the bundle and the image doesn’t show at runtime, although it appears to work in IB\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll recent\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis applies to any resource (images, videos, etc.) in IB and on any class. Setting an image on a button should allow me to do the same, for example."
