    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a label is put in the content view of a UIVisualEffectView in a nib or storyboard, and constraints are added from the label to the UIVisualEffectView, Interface Builder will be happy and there are no warnings â€“ but when running, warnings show.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached project, also at https://github.com/skagedal/radars/tree/master/constraints-against-visual-effect-view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither: \n - Interface Builder does not allow this or shows a warning. \n\nOr:\n - Runtime does not give warnings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFollowing output in console:\n\n2018-06-15 16:44:59.789440+0200 ConstraintsAgainstVisualEffectView[31128:347952] [LayoutConstraints] The view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint: <NSLayoutConstraint:0x6040000994b0 UILabel:0x7fc8ece048e0'Here's a label'.leading == UIVisualEffectView:0x7fc8ece04680.leading + 16   (inactive)>\n\tWhen added to a view, the constraint's items must be descendants of that view (or the view itself).
