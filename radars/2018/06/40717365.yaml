    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen presenting modal view controller on top of UIDocumentBrowserViewController the presented view controller is missing from the Window hierarchy. Effectively, when trying to cascade 2 or more modal view controllers on top of UIDocumentBrowserViewController, only first is presented. Every next attempt to present is discarded. The presented modal view controller is not reachable from the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup UIDocumentBrowserViewController as a root view controller\r\n2. Prepare two instances of view controller to present on top of document browser: modal1VC, modal2VC\r\n3. Present view controllers, one after another\r\n3.1. browser.present(modal1VC, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n3.2. browser.present(modal2VC, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`modal2VC` is visible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`modal1VC` is visible\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode version 9.4 (9F1027a).\r\niOS 11.4"
