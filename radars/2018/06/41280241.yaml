    description: "Use-case: Although I am trying to switch careers to be a full time dev, I am currently a Commercial Pilot. Due to my 'roster' I have to sleep at variable times each day in order to be fit to fly millions of dollars worth of aircraft, and more importantly, passengers. However, the current, static, DND falls short of my needs. It is quite frustrating to get a 'Move' buzz 10 minutes before my alarm, or worse still an even greater time before. Moreover, on my 'off days' I will usually not even set an alarm, in order to catch up on sleep and reduce the accumulated fatigue.\r\n\r\nFeature: Add a 'DND while Sleeping' (switched) setting.\r\n\r\nImplementation: The 'quick and dirty' option would be to adjust the DND Schedule time whenever an alarm is set. The really cool Apple solution would be to use the movement tracking which is already there, (I use _DavidSmith's Sleep++ to auto-track sleeps) to detect when the user is in a 'sleep activity' and then mute notifications."
