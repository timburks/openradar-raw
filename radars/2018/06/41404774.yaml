    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, an album I create publicly has a nice iCloud.com page, but from that page there is no way to subscribe to this album. This would be a nice addition to have.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen shared photo album on the web\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect a \"subscribe\" link that requires me to log in and then open the Photos app (either on iOS or macOS) to show this shared album.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI canâ€™t subscribe from iCloud photo albums on the web\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12 and before\r\n\r\nNotes:"
