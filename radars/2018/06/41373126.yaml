    description: "The section of \"The Swift Programming Language\" that documents the oldest deployment target for Swift applications was inexplicably removed from the Swift 4.0.3 version of the manual, and is still missing in the 4.2 version as far as I can tell.  It is impossible locate any current definitive statement of minimum target version compatibility, which seems unnecessarily confusing. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch the Swift documentation for the phrase \"minimum deployment target\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search returns text with this important information, such as the following text from the documentation before the 4.0.3 version:\r\n\"The Swift compiler and Xcode enforce a minimum deployment target of iOS 7 or macOS 10.9. Setting an earlier deployment target results in a build failure.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such text is found."
