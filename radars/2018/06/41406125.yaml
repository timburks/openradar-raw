    description: "Summary:\r\nFor some categories of custom intents, Siri won’t respond when using a custom success response. This applies to, but may not be limited to, the “Run” and “Do” categories.\r\nWhen using one of the two categories with a custom success response, Siri will never respond with anything. Changing the category to “Order” will cause Siri to respond.\r\n\r\nNote that it works perfectly for the “Run” and “Do” categories when using a custom failure response.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an intent definition and a custom intent with the category “Run”.\r\n2. Create a custom success response for your custom intent.\r\n3. Somewhere in your app, donate an interaction with your custom intent.\r\n4. Setup a Siri Shortcut based on your donated interaction from the devices Settings.\r\n5. Trigger the Siri Shortcut.\r\n6. Observe that Siri never responds.\r\n7. Delete your shortcut.\r\n8. Change the category of your custom intent to “Order”.\r\n9. Re-run the app and make the donation from step 3 again.\r\n10. Setup a Siri Shortcut based on your donated interaction from the devices Settings.\r\n11. Trigger the shortcut.\r\n12. Observe that Siri now responds correctly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should support custom success responses for all categories of custom intents, including “Run” and “Do”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri does not support custom success responses for all categories of custom intents.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
