    description: "Summary:\r\nSharing photo albums over iCloud is a great way to have a privacy-conscious shared album with multiple people. The fact that it’s optionally visible to the public on the web is also fantastic.\n\nWhat’s missing is a way to share an album with multiple people without all of them seeing the other people that were included. If I share an album with family and friends, I (as the owner of an album) don’t necessarily want to expose their names, phone numbers, or email addresses exposed to each other. \n\nAs someone who receives an invite for a shared album I want to be able to opt-out of having that displayed anywhere. If someone shares an album with me and 5 others, that doesn’t mean I want that to be known.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create shared album\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can select whether recipients should be known to each other\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12 and before\r\n\r\nNotes:"
