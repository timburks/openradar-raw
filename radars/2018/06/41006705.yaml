    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are some cases when in UI tests we need to rely on frames in remote views (such as keyboard). After rotation the frames are broken\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have UI test that has software keyboard visible\r\n2. Rotate device to landscape\r\n3. Get the frame of any of the keyboard keys\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. It should reflect the position on the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. The frame is wrong\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdded a sample project that prints the location of ‘q’ key on keyboard. When running on iPad this is what we get after rotating to landscape:\r\n\r\nFrame of button 'q' after rotation = (263.999924659729, -5.614757537841797e-05, 79.0000205039978, 93.0000205039978)\r\n\r\nWhich is clearly wrong because it is on the left border of the screen so frame’s x value should be 0."
