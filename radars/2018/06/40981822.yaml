    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe values returned in imagePickerController(_ picker: UIImagePickerController, didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo info: [String : Any]) for keys UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage and UIImagePickerControllerCropRect do not match what's shown to the user when they finish editing an image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build this sample project for iPhone 8 Simulator (or similar): https://github.com/aivars/photo-Picker-Tests\r\n(Note: this is not my code)\r\n\r\n2. Tap 'Select image', 'Photo Library', 'Camera Roll' and the second image. Try to match the crop to the left screenshot in the GitHub repository (expected result) and tap 'Choose'.\r\n\r\n3. Observe that the results resemble the right screenshot instead. The image returned by UIImagePickerController is shifted roughly 20 pixels upwards from what you would expect.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSeems to have been introduced in the iOS 11 SDK. Making a duplicate for the iOS 12 SDK. (Previous bugs include 34714906, 36292067, 37532436).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)"
