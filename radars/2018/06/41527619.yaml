    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a storyboard from the issue navigator (cmd+5) instead of the project navigator (cmd+1), the positions of the view controllers in the storyboard are respected, and they may appear overlapping each others.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project with a storyboard\r\n2. Add a UINavigationController to the storyboard\r\n3. Add a UIBarButtonItem to a UINavigationItem of the storyboard, with its style set to \"Plain\"\r\n  (The only purpose of steps 2 and 3 is to create a warning in the storyboard)\r\n4. Open any code file in the project\r\n5. Open the issues navigator (View > Navigators > Show Issues Navigator, or cmd+5)\r\n6. Click on the warning related to the UIBarButtonItem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe storyboard opens, with its view controllers layout'd as the user positioned them before leaving the file for the last time \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe storyboard opens, but the view controllers are in seemingly random positions, sometimes overlapping each others and making the storyboard difficult to read / navigate.\r\n\r\nNote that switching to another file, and re-opening the storyboard using any other means (like selecting it in the project navigator) fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 2 (10L177m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIIRC, this is not specific to Xcode 10, I encountered the issue in previous versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nVideo and project demonstrating the issue are attached."
