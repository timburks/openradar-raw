    description: "Summary:\r\nIn WWDC 2018, the country pin was chosen based on the developer account’s country. This is commonly not the country you’d call “home”. \n\nOne example is a Brazilian (aka me) living in US. I’d rather have a Brazil pin. However, picking where you were born is also not the best option, as one might have moved to another country and lived there for a long time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a WWDC ticket\n2. Check in \n3. Look at the pin you’ve received\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. It’d be a country you like/identify yourself with\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. It’s another country\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nWWDC 2018\r\n\r\nNotes:"
