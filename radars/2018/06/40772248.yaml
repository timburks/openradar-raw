    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a configuration profile (either via MDM or via Apple Configurator) configures a WiFi configuration with a proxy (automatic) configured, updating the profile to remove the proxy configuration is not taken in consideration by iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Create and install a configuration profile that set a WiFi connection to a proxy using an automatic configuration (PAC file).\r\n\t\t\t<key>ProxyPACURL</key>\r\n\t\t\t<string>http://yourproxy.local/proxy.pac</string>\r\n\t\t\t<key>ProxyType</key>\r\n\t\t\t<string>Auto</string>\r\n2 - Validate the device is configured and connected to the WiFi network; Also check on the device in \"Settings > WiFi\" that it is configured with the proxy you have set\r\n3 - Update the same profile (keeping the same UUID) and remove the proxy\r\n \t\t\t<key>ProxyType</key>\r\n\t\t\t<string>None</string>\r\n4 - Replace the old profile on the device by the updated version that have no proxy anymore\r\n5 - Validate the device is still connected to the WiFi network\r\n6 - If you look at \"Settings > WiFi\", the proxy is still configured\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect that the update of the WiFi profile removes the proxy if it is not set anymore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe proxy is still configured.\r\nThe only workaround found is to completely remove the wifi configuration from the device (ie: remove all the profiles referencing to this SSID on the device) and install the profile again.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested on:\r\niOS 11.3.1 (15E302)\r\niOS 11.4 (15F79)"
