    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPad when a remote view (e.g. file picker) is presented in a popover the .frame property of items inside it is wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an UI test that shows any remote view (e.g. file picker) in a popover on iPad\n2. Check .frame property of an item inside the view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. It is returned in screen coordinates\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. It is returned in relative coordinates\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 b1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdded example project with UI test that opens a file picker and prints the frame of “Cancel” button inside it. The results are:\n\nFrame of cancel = (251.0, 3.0, 61.0, 44.0)\n\nWhich is clearly wrong because it is not so close to the top border of the screen (see screenshot)."
