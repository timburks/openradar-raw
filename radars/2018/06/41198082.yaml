    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ergonomics of the undocked Object Library in Xcode 10 is...uncomfortable.  There are many situations where I need to drag multiple items in quick succession, but removing the object library from the inspector panel means I have to click multiple times to drag an additional component.\r\n\r\nI am aware of holding down the option key to keep it persistent, but this, again, is more cumbersome than necessary.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds like being grumpy about changing something that has been there for literally *forever*, but this feels like a really odd usability choice given the minimal friction for interacting with the library in the past.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode Version 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nConfiguration: macOS 10.13.5"
