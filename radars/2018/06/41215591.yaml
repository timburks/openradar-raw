    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen pushing a new view controller onto a UINavigationController’s stack, there’s a nice animation that eases out. However, during that animation (especially the last 30% where it slowly finishes), touches are ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Turn on slow animations in the simulator (to make the issue even easier to reproduce)\r\n- Push a view controller onto a UINavigationController\r\n- Tap a button in that view controller during the animation\r\n\r\n(I attached a simple sample project)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button should respond to touches\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button doesn’t respond to touches. UI feels unresponsive.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I know what button/control to hit next and I tap it right away then it’s always going to ignore the first touch, which makes it frustrating.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
