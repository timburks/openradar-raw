    description: "Summary:\r\nYou're unable to specify a custom bundle/module for an image in IB. In code you can load an image from a bundle with `UIImage(named:in:compatibleWith:)`, but this functionality is not exposed in IB. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a storyboard or xib file with an Image View\r\n2. Specify an image from an asset catalog in bundle of another module (it will even be suggested if the module is in the same project)\r\n3. Run the app and notice the image does not show at run time\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to specify a custom bundle in IB so that the image is loaded at run time, much like you can specify a module when setting a class in IB (see attachment).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is not loaded since the correct bundle isn't specified, so it defaults to the bundle of the storyboard/xib file and fails to load it.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.4 (9F1027a)"
