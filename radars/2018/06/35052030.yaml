    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen searching for files using the searchfs() function, the process takes about five times as long on an APFS volume than the same search on a HFS+ volume with the same contents.\r\n\r\nThis is quite significant. While searching for file names on a SSD-equipped MacBook's boot drive used to take only 5-10 seconds pre High-Sierra, the same search on the APFS-upgraded disk now takes a minute or more.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a large HFS+ volume, clone it and convert the copy to APFS.\r\nThen perform a search (e.g. for some unlikely-to-exist file name) on both volumes with searchfs, and record the time it takes to finish on each. Repeat several times to deal with potential caching.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch on APFS should be as fast as on HFS+\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMuch slower on APFS.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.0 as well as currentl 10.13.1 beta.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate (May 5, 2018):\r\n\r\nProblem persists. Still the same. Even with the latest 10.13.5 beta (17F66a). It has not improved a bit."
