    description: "Area:\r\nSceneKit\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nIf hit test is done in a SceneKit scene with nothing but a ARSCNPlaneGeometry in there, the hit test crashes the app. (EXEC_BAD_ACCESS).\r\nThe error occurs on iOS 11.3 and Xcode 9.4 by using the ARSCNPlaneGeometry available since ARKit1.5 (which is included in iOS 11.3).\r\nWhen a \"normal\" SCNPlane is used for visualising the plane found by ARKit, everything works as expected and the hit test succeeds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Take the attached sample app and execute it\r\n2. Wait until a horizontal plane was detected\r\n3. Then tap on the screen with the red cross in the middle pointing to the plane\r\n4. App crashes :(\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHit test shall return all nodes which are located in the hit test's direction\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes because of an error during the hit test calculation\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSee attached sample project\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached sample project"
