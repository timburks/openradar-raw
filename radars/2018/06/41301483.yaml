    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen editing a photo in Photos.app, touching and holding on the photo reveals the original before edits were made. When attempting to preview the original while editing levels (brightness, color, B&W), Photos.app crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos.app.\r\n2. Open any photo (not video).\r\n3. Tap Edit.\r\n4. Tap levels (dial icon in the toolbar).\r\n5. Select the disclosure arrow for Light.\r\n6. Tap the photo above the list of Light levels that appears.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe photo should revert to its unedited state as long as the touch is down, then revert back to showing edits when the touch is lifted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPhotos.app crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5308e)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X"
