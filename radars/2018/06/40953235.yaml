    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running UI tests in a testing lab sometimes an unexpected system alert pops up - low battery, pending update, icloud alerts etc. This fails the current and all further UI tests until the alert is dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run UI test\n2. Experience an unexpected system alert\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The alert should not impact the UI test\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Current and any future UI test fail on this device.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is an API (addUIInterruptionMonitorWithDescription) to close system alerts, but it works only when alert is expected, e.g. we are asking for location permissions. It does not help in cases where the alert shows up unexpectedly."
