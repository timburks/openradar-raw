    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter working with Siri Shortcuts extensively for a period of time, the feature will end up in a state where it no longer works at all. This is true for all devices signed into the same iCloud account.\r\n\r\nWhen in this state the following occurs:\r\n\r\n1. When trying to add a new Siri Shortcut from the Settings app, the UI will prompt the user to speak a phrase. When the record button is pressed, the Siri waveform will appear and adjust as the user speaks. When the recording stops, the UI will still look as on the attached screenshot. Pressing the “Stop recording” button will start a new recording in this case.\r\n\r\n2. Asynchronous APIs stop responding. E.g. INVoiceShortcutCenter.shared.getAllVoiceShortcuts never invokes the completion block.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens at around 14:25 in the attached sysdiagnose.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse Siri Shortcuts extensively for an hour or two on multiple devices signed into the same iCloud account. Perform actions such as the following:\r\n\r\n- Create new Siri Shortcuts using Settings.app\r\n- Delete Siri Shortcuts using Settings.app\r\n- Install apps that use Siri Shortcuts\r\n- Delete apps that use Siri Shortcuts\r\n- Create Siri Shortcuts from within apps using the public API\r\n- Delete Siri Shortcuts from within apps using the public API\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri Shortcuts should still work. I.e. it should be possbile to add and delete shortcuts from the Settings app and the public APIs should call their completion blocks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri Shortcuts stops functioning.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
