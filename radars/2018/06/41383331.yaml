    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://33451838\n\nIn our project we don’t use a file header for files at all, and the FILEHEADER key in IDETemplateMacros.plist gets us very close but still inserts // at the beginning. It would be great if the entire FILEHEADER had to be set by the developer (including the first `//` and even the following blank line) so that teams that don’t use the file header can completely opt out of it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add IDETemplateMacros.plist with FILEHEADER key that’s entirely empty\n2. Add new Swift file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file has no file header at all and the first line just reads `import Foundation`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe contents of the file are\n\n//\n\nimport Foundation\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
