    description: "Summary:\r\nBad Access (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) crash whenever Error is casted to CKError from any CKOperation completion handler.\r\n\r\nUsing the error directly is okay, however straight after casting to a CKError type will produce this issue. \r\n\r\nReported this issue to multiple labs at WWDC, however engineers have told me to file this bug. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Perform any CKOperation and precondition it to return an error. (Turn off iCloud to get \"Not Authenticated\" error)\r\n2. Implement the completionHandler \r\n3. Print out error directly - OK\r\n4. Cast the error to CKError\r\n5. Print error as CKError - NOT OK\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould cast to CKError and be used without crashing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes after using the casted variable\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\niOS 12"
