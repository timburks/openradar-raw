    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why constraints to safe area layout guides in Interface Builder can't be set to \"Use Standard Value\"?\r\n \r\nPrior to Safe Area Layout Guides, we had leading/trailing margins and Top / Bottom Layout Guides:\r\nI understood that pinning views to the leading and trailing margins didn't have access to \"Use Standard Value\" because these margins already provide a standard value from the edges.\r\nTop and bottom layout guides, on the other hand, merely indicated where top and bottom edges extended to, excluding navigation bars and status bars etc. Unlike leading and trailing margins, they didn't by default provide a standard distance from these bars etc, so constraints pinned to the Top and Bottom layout guides *did* have access to \"Use Standard Value\".\r\nTop and Bottom Layout Guides are now deprecated in favor of Safe Area Layout Guides, which perform a similar function, indicating an area that will not be covered up by UIKit components such as Tab bars, Navigation bars etc. In iOS at least (tvOS seems another story) the safe area doesn't seem to indicate the edge + a standard distance (as leading and trailing margins did). But constraints don't have access to \"Use Standard Value\" either.\r\nThis means that if we use Safe Area Layout guides to constrain a view to the edges, we no longer have access to standard distances.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrag a button for example onto the storyboard, pin to the top and left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ability to set the constant for the constraint as \"Use Standard Value\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Use Standard Value\" is greyed out.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.3.1 (9E501)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
