    description: "Summary:\r\nApple Maps introduced the “bottom drawer” component a few years ago. Apple Music also uses a similar pattern.\n\nOn iOS 12, more system apps are using this component, as Stocks, Voice Memo and Shortcuts. Some 3rd party apps also adopt this patten, like Doordash.\n\nThere’re available libraries that implement this (e.g. https://github.com/52inc/Pulley) but they don’t always get all the details right. Even Apple’s app apparently have different implementations among different apps, so having an unified API would also be helpful there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to implement a bottom drawer with an UIKit component\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can use a new shiny API.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou either roll your own or use a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
