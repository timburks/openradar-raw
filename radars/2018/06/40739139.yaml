    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe found that the test app crashes when it's releasing a MKMapView object at the render process. The map has a hybrid style and rendering only the Apple's tiles.\r\nMost of the time it happens after second attempt when tiles are cached.\r\nPlease run the attached test app and check the crash logs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open app on iOS 11.\r\n2) Tap the 'Show Map Screen' button\r\n3) The Map View Controller is appeared\r\n4) The map rendered all tiles\r\n5) Tap the 'Close Map' button\r\n6) Quickly repeat open/close the map screen\r\n\r\nIf you installed the test app first time please wait to cache Apple's tiles (You need to see them on the map). If you can not crash then re-run app and try on the device too. If you are not lucky then use the marks in the MapViewController class. Please follow them and uncomment necessary lines of code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould not be a crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe crash happens in 2-8 attempts.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nThe source code is attached.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11 on iPhone/iPad device\r\n\r\nProject here: https://github.com/dedmakarMD/Texture2D_Crash\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEmail from Apple:\r\n\r\n\"Hello Anatoli,\r\n\r\nThere has been a status change for an issue you reported in Bug ID 40739139. \r\n\r\nThe original bug report is now awaiting final verification.
