    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scrolling to the bottom of a file in Xcode 10, the last line is scrolled all the way to the middle of the screen. This lets me believe there are empty lines below the last line. If this is actually a \"feature\", it is ugly and I don't like it at all. To the very least, there should be an option to disable it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
