    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nRoyal TSX freezes on Mojave DP1 when scrolling the sidebar (navigation panel). This doesn't happen all the time but very often and can be triggered easily when just navigating around the interface, then trying to scroll again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Royal TSX. Open a document with sufficient objects to require scrolling. Try scrolling with the trackpad (the regular scrollbars still work most of the time).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSOutlineView should scroll.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSOutlineView is frozen and so is the rest of the UI (sometimes).\r\nConsole.app reports these two suspicious logs:\r\n* [ERROR] - Attempting to get capabilities from device with no cursors\r\n* Backdrop does not use selection tint color.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14 Beta (18A293u)"
