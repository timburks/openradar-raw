    description: "At the moment, there is only a write API for SSReadingList that can be used for adding new items to the reading list. To make the reading list more powerful and for making it fully replace services like Instapaper or Pocket, there should be an API for reading items in that list. \r\n\r\nRegarding privacy concerns: read operations should require the user's permission. This could be implemented similar to access the user's photos, reminders, contacts, etc.\r\n\r\nI think, this would greatly improve the overall usefulness of the reading list."
