    description: "Summary:\r\nGetting a couple crashes when using a Result enum with a generic associated type. One of the crashes occurs when passing a block property directly to an escaping block parameter. The other seems specific to having HTTPCookie objects be in the associated type of the enum case.\r\n\r\nI have created and attached a demo project. Much easier to show than tell.  It also lives here: https://github.com/crayment/ResultCrash\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the tests in the demo project. On Xcode 9.4 the tests run fine (with new or old build system). On 10.0 beta (10L176w) two of the tests will demonstrate the crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Swift lab at WWDC pointed out one of the crashes is in swift_getEnumCaseMultiPayload\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
