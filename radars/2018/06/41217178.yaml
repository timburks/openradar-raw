    description: "Hyphenation Factor on NSParagraphStyle does not respect the language of the text.\r\nIt may work perfectly for text in English, but it is unusable for German â€“ Line breaks are splitting words at positions which is just obviously wrong for Germans.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the sample project on an iPhone X Simulator, to see the wrong hyphenations.\r\n\r\nAs reference the wrong hyphenations (as performed by the OS) are given below, as well as the correct german hyphenation.\r\n\r\nwrong: hau-seigenen\r\ncorrect: haus-ei-ge-nen\r\n\r\nwrong: de-shalb\r\ncorrect: des-halb\r\n\r\nwrong: Dat-en\r\ncorrect: Da-ten\r\n\r\nwrong: Spe-icherung\r\ncorrect: Spei-cher-ung\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHyphenation and line breaks should respect the language of the text and be correct for the language the text is in. If the correct language can't be detected automaticallt, the option to set a locale on a paragraph would probably help.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHyphenation and line breaks are incorrect when using German text.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X Simulator, Locale en_us, iOS 11.4 SDK, Xcode 9\r\niPhone X Simulator, Locale en_us, iOS 12 Beta 1 SDK, Xcode 10 Beta 1"
