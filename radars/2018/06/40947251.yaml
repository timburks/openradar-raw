    description: "We received a report from an user that when trying to play back video in the app, a dialog popped up asking for microphone access permission. This is likely a bug since the app does not use the microphone, it uses AVPlayer for video playback. The app can be downloaded from https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases/tag/6.0.3\r\n\r\nSee attached video."
