    description: "Bug ID 36292515, marked as duplicate of 34605822.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince 10.12, the file promises from pasteboard API seems to have changed. It is no longer possible to get a file promise from an e-mail drag & drop operation, to read meta-data from.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI used to be able to detect a dropped e-mail thread by calling draggingInfo.namesOfPromisedFilesDropped(atDestination: ...) and then pasteboard.string(forType: \"com.apple.pasteboard.promised-file-url\") would give me the projected file path. Now, this method no longer works and I cannot figure out how to get the file promises from a drag & drop operation from Mail.app. (I require a file reference to read mail-thread meta-data)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pasteboard offers some method of meta data\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJust a title is supplied\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSwift 3 / Swift 4\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nSince macOS 10.12\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHere's my (verbose..)
