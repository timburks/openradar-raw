    description: "With the announcement of iOS 12, there are now 3 different ways for apps to provide the system data that seem to have a lot of overlap:\r\n\r\n1. Siri shortcuts (NSUserActivity and INInteraction)\r\n2. Home Screen Quick Actions (UIApplicationShortcutItem)\r\n3. Spotlight indexing (CSSearchableIndex)\r\n\r\nIt seems like something could be done for both developers and users to help unify these. For example, it seems reasonable that a user may want to see their shortcuts instead of (or in addition to) home screen quick actions.\r\n\r\nI don't have a grand unified vision here, but think it is something that Apple could come up with."
