    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you try to lower the priority on an active, required constraint, the error message you get is confusing, especially to non-native English speakers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt lower the priority on an active, required constraint, for example, like this:\r\n\r\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n        let view = UIView()\r\n        self.view.addSubview(view)\r\n        let constraint = view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.heightAnchor)\r\n        constraint.isActive = true\r\n        constraint.priority = .defaultLow\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message is clear and unambiguous.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message is:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Mutating a priority from required to not on an installed constraint (or vice-versa) is not supported.  You passed priority 250 and the existing priority was 1000.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10L176w) on macOS 10.13.5 (17F77)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem is dues to the placement of the “(or vice-versa).” It should be modifying the “from required to not,” but since it comes after “on an installed constraint,” it’s hard to tell whether it perhaps is referred to vice-versa-ing the installed constraint. I think a clearer message would be something like this:\r\n\r\n'Mutating a priority from required to not (or vice-versa) on an installed constraint is not supported. You passed priority 250 and the existing priority was 1000.'\r\n\r\nNote: this is not a regression. This is how the message has been as far back as I can remember. It was just brought up because a non-native English speaker in a Slack group asked for help in deciphering the message."
