    description: "Summary:\r\nSnapshot view tests are powerful because they can allow testing more code with a simple image diff comparison.\n\nItâ€™d be really useful for the iOS (and macOS) community to have first-party support for this, integrated with Xcode so you could se failing snapshots directly in the context of your unit tests.\n\nCurrently, 3rd party solutions are available, https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case being the more popular one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to write a snapshot test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can use a XCTAssertSnapshot function\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou need to use https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case or a similar 3rd party tool\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nNotes:"
