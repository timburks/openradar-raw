    description: "Dear Xcoderinos,\r\n\r\nThe Emacs-like kill/yank actions don't always insert all the killed text in Xcode's editor. I'm attaching a video demonstrating the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the video, I start with an empty plain text file and type exactly this sequence of keys:\r\n\r\n    return\r\n    a\r\n    return\r\n    b\r\n    return\r\n    up-arrow\r\n    up-arrow\r\n    control-k\r\n    control-k\r\n    control-k\r\n    control-k\r\n    control-y\r\n\r\nThe control-y (yank) keystroke should insert all of the text killed by the four prior control-k (kill) keystrokes. That is, it should insert \"a\", newline, \"b\", newline. Instead, it inserts newline, \"b\", newline. The \"a\" is lost.\r\n\r\nI verify that the text is truly lost (rather than just not displayed) by opening the file in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nPlease make Xcode insert all of my killed text.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob"
