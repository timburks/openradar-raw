    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Interface Builder builders,\r\n\r\nThe “Add New Constraints” popover is fine and dandy for adding equality constraints. However, I often want to add an inequality constraint (a greater-than-or-equal or less-than-or-equal constraint), especially for width or height.\r\n\r\nAdding an inequality constraint is cumbersome. First, I have to add an equality constraint in the popover. Then, I have to find the new constraint in the document outline or in the constrained view's Size inspector so I can change its relation.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'd like: at the left side of each text field in the “Add New Constraints” popover, show the relation using the appropriate character: =, ≤, or ≥. Then, let me change the relation in either of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. The character is actually an NSPopUpButton, and if I click it, show a menu of all three relations so I can choose the one I want.\r\n2. (Expert mode) If I type =, <, or > in the text field, change the relation to match.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
