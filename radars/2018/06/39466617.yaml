    description: "Wether it being eSim, or not, I can see no reason, why I can't configure a MacBook with LTE or other mobile networking!\r\n\r\nYou probably have thought of an ARM cheap handling that, but the increasing amount of macs with ARM, could likely help with this, whilst still being power efficient, ofcourse I don't need x86 LTE power requirements!"
