    description: "Having the ability to set Memoji as contact photos would be ideal for most people. Snapchat has their Bitmoji which is tied to a users account, and when you add a friend, that friend's Bitmoji is displayed in your friends list. Having the ability to set a Memoji as your \"Me\" contact card on your device should be able to filter through to all of your friends who have your Phone number or email address in their contacts and then displayed in Appropriate UI's. Messages, Phone.app, Contacts.app & FaceTime app to name a few. \r\n\r\nFeature Request for iOS 12.0.0 Messages & Memoji"
