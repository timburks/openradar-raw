    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen maps recalculates a route it frequently recalculates to a completely different path than what the user chose. I get in my car in my parking garage, choose a route, drive out of the building and Maps loses the route I chose while I'm leaving. This is frustrating and means I have to reselect the route I actually wanted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Maps, and choose a destination.\r\nChoose route suggestion 2 or 3, not the one Maps originally chose.\r\nStart turn by turn navigation.\r\nBe somewhere with low gps signal, lose and regain signal, causing the navigation to recalculate. My apartment building parking lot is the perfect candidate for this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps recalculates the destination along the same route.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMaps resets to the original suggestion, sending you on the highway you didn't want, or saving two minutes but sacrificing 8 kms, a tradeoff you chose not to make."
