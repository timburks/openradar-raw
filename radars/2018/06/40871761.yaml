    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently only classes defined in public ObjC headers are visible to Swift. To avoid leaking implementation details it would be useful to have ability to extend framework private ObjC classes in Swift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a mixed ObjC-Swift framework\n2. Define a class “Foo” in ObjC and make the header private\n3. Add a private module map that exports “FooFramework_Private” module with the header “Foo.h” from step #2\n4. From Swift file do “import FooFramework_Private” and try to make “extension Foo {}”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. Should be possible\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. Error building - “FooFramework_Private is not found”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was looked at by several people in WWDC Swift labs and seems to be a bug. Quote from Jordan Rose about the underlying reason: “VFS is interfering with finding the private module map because it’s trying to shadow the public module map”"
