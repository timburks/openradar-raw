    description: One of the projects I work with has a policy of sorting the project with xUnique before each commit. I feel this is dangerous as this is a 3rd party tool and it has not been updated in 2 years. But what is really dangerous is how Xcode re-orders the project file so often. Whenever any change is made the project may change in unrelated yet significant ways. Whatever is causing it could be prevented so that at least the current order is preserved. And if there were a sort option built into Xcode that would be very helpful. Since Xcode 10 is still in beta please consider building this functionality into the final release.
