    description: "- When randomized execution order is used,\r\n- and this reveals a problem,\r\n- we need a way to keep rerunning tests in the same order, so that we know when we have successfully addressed that problem.\r\n\r\nExample from RSpec: http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/blog/2012/01/04/rspec-28-is-released/\r\n\r\nNice-to-have: Even with the same seed, the order may change if tests are added / deleted / renamed. It would be nice if Xcode noted these test names, and warned me if\r\n- I am specifying a seed to use for shuffling, and\r\n- any test names have changed."
