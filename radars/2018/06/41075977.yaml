    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #8102097\r\n\r\nAt WWDC, there's always the problem of making sure your badge faces the right way if you want people to see your name. At SXSW, they had the same information printed on both sides of the badge. \r\n\r\nAll previous WWDCs have had the same problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRandomly flip the badge. 50% of the time it will show the front with your name and company, and 50% of the time it'll show the back side, which just has a bar code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhichever side of the badge is visible, I expect to see useful information.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nHalf the time, the badge shows a barcode instead of name and company.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe you don't want people to read your name off your badge. You could always put your badge in a shirt pocket. Or use a fictitious name. Or your Twitter screen name.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
