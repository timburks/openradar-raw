    description: "Summary:\r\nA common practice with SVG icons is to bundle several icons into a single svgs file as symbols, and then reference them from the HTML using a <use xlink:href=“icons.svg#symbol-name”> tag. This fails in WKWebView on pages loaded from file URLs.\n\nIt is possible to load images, audio, and other resources (but not XHRs) from file URLs, so it’s not clear why SVG symbols would be treated differently.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee sample project at https://github.com/dpogue/WKFileTest/tree/svg-test (zip file of project attached).\n\nThere is a variable in the ViewController.swift file to switch between UIWebView and WKWebView.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe webkit logo should render in the blue div.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn UIWebView, the svg file shows.\nOn WKWebView, the div appears empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is an issue that is blocking us from moving from UIWebView to WKWebView."
