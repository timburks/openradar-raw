    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #41134915\n\nIt would be nice to get the same action sheets using for long pressing links in UITextView in our custom UI.\n\nWhen long pressing a link in a UITextView, an action sheet is shown. The actions available in the action sheet depend on the type of link. The system handles many types of links, including web URLs (https:), phone numbers (tel:) messages (sms:) and email (mailto:). Each type has its own set of actions. UIKit is smart about which actions are available, handling things like email availability and calling a number via an iPhone when using an iPad.\n\nMany (maybe all) of these actions are also available for links in WKWebView or SFSafariViewController.\n\nWe make PSPDFKit: a framework which renders PDF documents, which can contain any type of link. It would be nice if we could get all the of same features users expect when long pressing on links.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to match UITextView’s UI when long pressing on links.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI’m imagining UIKit providing some kind of factory method that supplies a preconfigured UIAlertController given a URL and a source view & rect or bar button item. With the source info it could for example present a UIActivityViewController (for Share…) without further involvements from the calling code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo convenient API from UIKit for this.\n\nWe can implement some of these actions manually ourselves, but this is tedious work and we risk missing some cases handled by UIKit. In practice, we’re going to mimic UIKit for the common case (web URLs) and probably say that’s enough.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
