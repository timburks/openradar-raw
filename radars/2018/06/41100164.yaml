    description: "Area:\r\nExternal Accessory Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFord’s SYNC3 infotainment system allows our customers to use the Waze application (and other similar Mobile Navigation applications) on their iPhones for navigation by way of projecting the map onto the infotainment system’s UI. One of the challenges our customer’s face is the need to bring the app to foreground on the iPhone device for the map to stream. We are overcoming that challenge by making use of the ‘RequestAppLaunch’ feature provided by iOS.\r\nHowever, when the device is locked and a ‘RequestAppLaunch’ request is sent, then the application is not brought to the foreground (Active State) on the device even after the device is unlocked. While this may be the expected behavior, our ask is whether your team might consider modifying this behavior so that applications are brought to the foreground (Active State) thereby allowing our customers to have a better and safer navigation experience from their iPhone.\r\nIs there any way to bring App to Active State when iPhone is locked?\r\nWe do observe a user consent popup, to allow CarPlay when iPhone is locked. How do we enable this for our apps?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iPhone to SYNC via USB and ensure the device is locked.\r\n2. Make sure the Waze application registers on SYNC and is seen on SYNC’s HMI under the “Apps” page.\r\n3. Using the command line utility provided on SYNC, send a ‘RequestAppLaunch’ message to the device with the ‘AppLaunchMethod’ set to ‘Launch without user alert’ and using the bundleID of the Waze application.\r\n4. Unlock the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Waze application should be on foreground on the iPhone upon unlocking.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Waze application is not on foreground on the iPhone upon unlocking\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.4 public release"
