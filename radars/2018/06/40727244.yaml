    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I'm preprocessing my Info.plist file using a defined prefix header, changes to the prefix header do not cause the Info.plist file to be re-preprocessed. This largely defeats the point of preprocessing the Info.plist in this manner and requires me to do a clean build to get a properly updated Info.plist.\r\n\r\nI've attached a project that demonstrates this. The main target depends on an aggregate target with a build phase that updates the prefix header, and the main target uses that prefix header to preprocess the Info.plist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the project. It should display the date it was built at.\r\n2. Build and run again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe second run should print a different date (the date of the second build).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second run prints the same date as the first.\r\n\r\nIf you inspect the build logs, the second build log will have re-run the build script phase to update the prefix header, but it will do absolutely nothing for the main target.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4 (9F1027a)"
