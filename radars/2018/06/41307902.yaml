    description: "Summary:\r\nWe work on PDF Viewer (https://pdfviewer.io/) and provide a custom PDF renderer which is more accurate than Apple’s stock PDF renderer. This results in a sub-par user experience, as Apple’s stock render engine is used in UIDocumentBrowserViewController, where some annotations are missing, have incorrect rotation or are wrongly sized.\n\nOf course in an ideal world Apple should render PDF with 100% accuracy, however there’s a lot of ambiguity especially for annotations without appearance stream, so it will never look 100% like our renderer. People are confused when the thumbnails look different to when they open the document.\n\nPlease allow to override even system-handled UTIs inside UIDocumentBrowserViewController. I do not expect such a hook to work in Files app, but we’d really like to be accurate in our own app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.4.1 and iOS 12b2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
