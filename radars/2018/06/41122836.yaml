    description: "## Problems:\r\n\r\n#1 In order to allow a third party application to access Mail data, the user has to follow a lengthy procedure:\r\n\r\n- Open System Preferences\r\n- Navigate to Security & Privacy > Privacy > Application Data\r\n- Unlock the pane with a password\r\n- Click the “+” button\r\n- * Pitfall *: the open panel opens to the ~/Documents folder. The most unlikely place to find application.\r\n- Locate the application which may still be in the Downloads folder\r\n\r\nThis behavior is different from the one seen in the Accessibility privacy settings. This list of applications lists applications that have requested interest in controlling the computer. The user simply needs to approve by adding a checkmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n#2 This procedure does not tell the user what the application intends to do with that data. For access to contacts, photos, etc. Mojave mandates the existance of a Info.plist string with a description of why access is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested resolution\r\n\r\n1. New Info.plist string to describe why access to application data is needed\r\n2. Have Privacy > Application Data list all applications that include this Info.plist key\r\n3. Get user approval by having her tick the checkmark next to the application\r\n4. At this time present the Info.plist string and request confirmation"
