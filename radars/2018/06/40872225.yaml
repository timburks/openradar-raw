    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter the introduction of the new system it loosed a very important feature - be able to access the log and easily get it out of the device.\r\n\r\nOur use case that we currently have, but is not possible with new system is outlined in the steps below\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add extensive logging to various parts of the app\r\n2. User experiences some issue where app goes into a weird state\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The user taps a button in the app settings and is presented with email compose screen with log files attached\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. User needs to trigger sysdiagnose by tapping a specific key combo\r\n4. Wait 10 mins or so\r\n5. Navigate deep inside settings and find sysdiagnose file in between hundreds of other files\r\n6. Have a way to actually send the ~300mb file to developers\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta (10L176w)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are lots of good improvements that would make life quite a bit easier - performance, all the private data sanitization that is just not very useful if we donâ€™t have an easy way to get the log files out of device."
