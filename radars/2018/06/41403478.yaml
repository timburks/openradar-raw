    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is a double space after a period in the Import Settings dialog box in iTunes for Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes.\r\n2. Open Preferences.\r\n3. Go to the General tab.\r\n4. Click Import Settings….\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the text in the UI has more than one sentence, the sentences will be joined by a single period followed by a single space.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are two spaces between “Use this option if you experience problems with the audio quality from Audio CDs.” and “This may reduce the speed of importing.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.7.5.9 for Mac\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI had a hard time finding precedent for this, sine multiple sentences in Apple UI text are rare, but I found two places that agree with me that there should be one space:\r\n1. In System Preferences → Notifications, there is a single space between the first and second sentence at the top of the preference pane.\r\n2. All of the copy on apple.com uses one space after periods.\r\n\r\nScreenshot also uploaded at https://cl.ly/sVLr"
