    description: "Summary:\r\nWe're in the middle of a redesign of a large brownfield app. We're introducing a new font across the app. Changing this was easy: we changed the font name in a couple of place (we have like a \"UIFont+Company.swift\" extension, which has methods for `smallFont`, `mediumFont` etc), and we were done. The designers now want to apply different line heights across the app. In order to achieve this we're going to need to change _every_ call site where we set `.text` on a `UILabel` by wrapping the text in an `NSAttributedString`, which has an `NSParagraphStyle` set on it. This is a _much_ larger effort. `UIFont` has a `lineHeight` property but it is inexplicably `readonly`. I understand that making this `readwrite` would complicate the API surface, but it would make changes like this a few orders of magnitude easier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- try to set `lineHeight` on a `UIFont` instance\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- the line height would change\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- the line height does not change\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nNotes:"
