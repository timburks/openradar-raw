    description: "The iOS Raw Engine does not support the \"Lossless Compressed\" variant of the RAF file format (Fujifilm's RAW implementation).\r\n\r\nThis variant is useful because it makes RAF files half the size. The X-T2 camera, for example, can use this variant for a few years now.\r\n\r\nNot having the support on iOS (and macOS) is a huge problem for photographers who are using Fujifilm's cameras.\r\n\r\nI've attached a \"Lossless Compressed\" RAF file. If you open it in the Photos app on iOS, a blank thumbnail will be visible instead of the actual photo.\r\n\r\nWhat I found peculiar is that the Import Sheet (in the Photos app) of the SD Card Reader (that you sell) does show thumbnails for \"Lossless Compressed\" RAF files. As soon as the import is done, however, the thumbnails disappear.\r\n\r\nSo, two suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The Photos app should show the thumbnails of \"Lossless Compressed\" RAF files, like it does in the Import Sheet. Even if it's 1080p JPGs thumbnails, that's enough for quick browsing and culling.\r\n- The Raw Engine should support \"Lossless Compressed\" RAF files, which would allow third-party apps to handle those files as well (Darkroom, Affinity Photo, etc.)."
