    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen using an URLSession with Resumable data we are seeing the following errors:  Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=14 \"Bad address\" in iOS 12.\r\n\r\nOnly happens iOS 12, downloads complete as expected in iOS 11 & 10.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the file system after the downloadTask has been cancelled, the file with the resumable data appears to be added to the file system correctly however the OS does not seem to be able to load this data with the downloadTask(withResumeData:) method.\r\n\r\nIn the example project we are using an OperationQueue with Operations as this represents where we are seeing the error in our app however the error can be replicated by calling task.cancel(:) normally so does not appear related to the OperationQueue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n         1. Create Operation with URLSession downloadTask, add to queue, start downloading file.\r\n         2. Cancel downloading,  triggers save of resume data\r\n         3. Create Operation with resumable data, add to queue.\r\n         4. Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=14 \"Bad address\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ndownloadTask(withResumeData:) to continue using resumable data and eventually complete successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ndownloadTask(withResumeData:) method returns the following error and download does not complete.\r\n\r\n2018-09-26 13:56:35.538762+0100 ResumeDataExample[24928:2934196] Task <FE9372B8-44A5-4603-8B05-55211A66E9CF>.<2> finished with error - code: -1002\r\nError Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=14 \"Bad address\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode 10 / iOS 12"
