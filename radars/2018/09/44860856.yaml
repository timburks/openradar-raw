    description: "Summary: Starting from iOS 12 the layout is not performed until the content is scrolled to the end, which does not allow to position attachments properly. \r\n\r\nNotes:  According to documentation of `NSLayoutManager` it's stated that:\r\n\r\n... both glyph generation and layout were always performed, in order, from the beginning to the end of the document.\r\n\r\nAnd prior to iOS 12, setting `UITextView.attributedText` caused layout and as a result:\r\n\r\n`NSLayoutManagerDelegate.layoutManager(_ layoutManager: NSLayoutManager, didCompleteLayoutFor textContainer: NSTextContainer?, atEnd layoutFinishedFlag: Bool)`\r\n\r\nwas called with `layoutFinishedFlag` set to true. As of iOS 12 it's not the case and this does not allow to update position of attachment glyphs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Build and run the TextViewTest sample application a device with iOS 12\r\n2) Press the plus button in the navigation bar (perhaps several times for iPad)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText becomes bigger and positions of red and green rectangles is changed accordingly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRed and green rectangles disappear (see attached screenshots)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A366)\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n- Cannot be reproduced on iOS 10 and 11 as setting `UITextView.attributedText` causes layout (see attached backtrace for iOS 11.4)\r\n- Can be worked around by calling `NSLayoutManager.ensureLayout(for container: NSTextContainer)` on updating `UITextView.attributedText` -- tap `Enable Workaround` in the sample application to check it out\r\n- Cannot be reproduced if the content fits the screen or it's not \"sparse\" (contains lots of new lines, but continuous strings only)\r\n\r\nAttachment can be found following the link: https://goo.gl/myQ7ft"
