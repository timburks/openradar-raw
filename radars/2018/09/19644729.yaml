    description: "Summary:\r\nI know this is going to get duped, so I'll try to keep it brief.\r\n\r\nWe need Metal support in the iOS Simulator. Developers understand that performance characteristics vary radically between physical devices and their development systems. There has never been an excuse for not doing on-device testing and profiling. But by the same token, iOS-exclusive technologies such as OpenGL ES have enjoyed support in the Simulator since their introduction. Being able to run in-development apps in the Simulator helps developers ensure the correctness of their algorithms and makes development substantially faster. Developers can't even compile/test apps that make only light use of Metal in one portion of their app, without #ifdef'ing out such code when compiling for the Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write an app that uses Metal in any capacity whatsoever\r\n2. Attempt to run it in the iOS Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app runs, even if performance is not representative of real-world devices\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app fails to compile, because Metal is not supported in the iOS Simulator."
