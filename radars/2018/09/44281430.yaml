    description: "Area:\r\nSiri\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Ducks are an extremely popular college sports team in the state of Oregon.\r\n\r\nWhen asking Siri, “when do the Ducks play?” or “what was the Ducks score?”, it returns results about a different team called the Ducks. I believe it’s a hockey team in Southern California.\r\n\r\nVery few people in the Pacific Northwest, who ask about the Ducks, are asking about the California hockey team.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAsk Siri, “What was the Ducks score?”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n“Oregon won 62 to 14 yesterday against Portland State.” (this is what “OK Google” told me)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSiri told me about a hockey playoff game from last spring. See screenshot.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.4.1 (15G77) on iPhone X model MQA92LL/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n* My location is the Portland, Oregon metro area. Siri doesn’t seem to take this into account.\r\n* I frequently re-ask the question as “what was the OREGON Ducks score”. While this works, Siri never remembers my preference. The next time I ask about the Ducks, it once again returns information about the wrong team.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/natesilva/f4e206156ff08780527a4429347b9b03/raw/56d05b926720abb08cf671119fcace7ff271f7d3/IMG_A3946B9F870B-1.jpeg"
