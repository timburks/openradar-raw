    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a project contains several targets that produce a framework with same name, xcodebuild will randomly build a wrong target if it’s used as a dependency for currently built target.\n\nExample:\nTarget “some_library” produces “some_library.framework”\n\nWhich depends on a one of (depending on the platform):\n\nTarget “dependency_mac” produces “dependency.framework”\nTarget “dependency_watch” produces “dependency.framework”\n\nExecuting command:\n\nxcodebuild -project some_library.xcodeproj -scheme some_library -configuration Release -sdk watchos clean archive\n\nWill randomly trigger either the “dependency_watch” or “dependency_mac” to be built and fail during the linking stage if the wrong one was selected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) navigate to the provided workspace\n2) xcodebuild -project some_library.xcodeproj -scheme some_library -configuration Release -sdk watchos clean archive\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn watchOS version of the some_library should build and link properly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDepending on what I assume is a fair roll of a dice, the target will build successfully or not.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve been only able to reproduce this using xcodebuild command-line utility and not with full Xcode itself."
