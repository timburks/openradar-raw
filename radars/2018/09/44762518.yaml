    description: "Summary:\r\nThe AVPlayerViewController places the controls way off screen randomly, despite all constraints being set appropriately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the sample app on an iPhone 8+, real device. It seems possible, but more difficult to reproduce on the simulator.\r\n\r\nCan also see this in the `Sample-Screenshot-Of-Broken-AVPlayerViewController.PNG` provided.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdiAyyakad/AVPlayer-Radar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayer bar should appropriately be displayed in full on screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayer bar often is actually off screen.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4.1, iPhone 8+ (A1864)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
