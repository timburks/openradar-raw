    description: "Summary:\r\nDynamic Type makes it possible to configure a larger font size in a single place on an iOS for all applications, including portions of the UI that are not “content” (i.e. it will make a button’s text larger, too).\r\n\r\nmacOS, however, has font size settings scattered across the system. I usually need to go into each individual application and press Command-Plus. This usually makes only the “content” part of the application have a larger font, whereas most of the user interface remains the same.\r\n\r\nThere are work-arounds such as using Zoom or setting different scaling options in Display settings but there are drawbacks: the former makes a portion of the screen invisible and must be activated manually, the latter usually makes everything blurry, especially with external monitors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
