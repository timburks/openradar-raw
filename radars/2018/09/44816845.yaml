    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen submitting an iOS + watchOS app in Xcode to the App Store, the following error is returned, even though iOS deployment target is set as iOS 11\r\n\r\n> ERROR ITMS-90081: \"This bundle is invalid. Applications built for more than one architecture require an iOS Deployment Target of 3.0 or later\"\r\n\r\nIf changing watchOS target to above 2.0 (to 3.0), error goes away.  \r\n\r\nApp Store Connect seems to be checking the wrong OS version (checking watchOS instead of iOS)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS + watchOS app in Xcode and set the iOS target version to 11 and the watchOS target version to 2.0.\r\n2. Archive and submit the app to the App Store in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should be submitted to the app store without any trouble\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp is rejected with the error \r\n\r\n> ERROR ITMS-90081: \"This bundle is invalid. Applications built for more than one architecture require an iOS Deployment Target of 3.0 or later\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
