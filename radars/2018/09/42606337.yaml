    description: "This bug has been marked by Apple as a DUPLICATE OF 17334851\r\n--------------------------\r\nSummary:\r\nWith 10.13.6, I am experiencing mail loss, the scrambling of mail messages (mail bodies attached to unrelated headers, and the failure to present html mail correctly.  As an example of the last, I will open a new message and see formatting instructions for the message.  If I delete and then reopen the message, it will present correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is when retrieving mail from a linux server running postfix and dovecot.\r\n\r\nI can access the same server without difficulties using Microsoft Outlook, which is what I am now doing.\r\n\r\nNo changes had occurred in the configuration of the linux server, except possibly software updates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRetrieve mail normally from server.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll mail retrieved without loss or scrambling. All messages presented correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.5 (3445.9.1)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------"
