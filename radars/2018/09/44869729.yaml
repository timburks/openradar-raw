    description: "Summary:\r\nMojave brought us some beautiful dynamic desktop wallpapers, but no way to produce our own. There is so much potential for creativity with this technology. Please give us an official API to easily generate such wallpapers from a list of `NSImage`s and some metadata.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected there to be APIs to generate and parse the special HEIC files used for dynamic desktop wallpapers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's currently no official way to do this.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:"
