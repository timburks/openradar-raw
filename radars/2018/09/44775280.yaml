    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you have custom fonts in your application, but some developers don't have them installed on their machines (or on CI machines), when they build and run the app, the fonts have silently been replaced with San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Run the attached sample project for an example, make sure you don't have Lobster installed in Font Book.app)\r\n\r\n1. Download a custom font like Lobster https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lobster and install it on your machine\r\n2. Create a new iOS project, and add the Lobster font file to the app target\r\n3. Open the storyboard\r\n4. Add 2 labels to the view controller\r\n5. For one label, set it to use attributed strings, and change the font to Lobster\r\n6. For the other label, keep it as plain, and change the font to Lobster\r\n7. Run the app, both labels should be using Lobster\r\n8. Open Font Book.app and delete Lobster (you might have to clear the macOS font cache after doing this)\r\n9. Build the app again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth labels are still using the Lobster font\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe plain label correctly uses Lobster, but the attributed label falls back to SF.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode/IB 10.0 (10A255)\r\niOS 12.0 simulator\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- If you open the storyboard on a machine without the fonts it will \"fix\" them and default back to SF, but even this won't particularly happen on large teams.\r\n- Interface should error when building if the font isn't available\r\n- It shouldn't matter if the font is installed on macOS since it is still bundled with the iOS app"
