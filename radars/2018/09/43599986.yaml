    description: "When loading an App Store/iTunes item using SKStoreProductViewController on iOS 12 (GM), the loading is significantly slower than on previous iOS versions.\r\n\r\nSome testing in two different apps using SKStoreProductViewController gives that the loading is approximately 4 times slower. That's 12 seconds on iOS 12, which makes the feature almost unusable."
