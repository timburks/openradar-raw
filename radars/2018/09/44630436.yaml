    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's very common when you record on iPhone to end up with videos with the incorrect orientation. The Photos app supports correcting most things about images, and it's a shame it doesn't support correcting such a common issue. There are apps on the App Store that can fix the orientation, but they're all low-quality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:"
