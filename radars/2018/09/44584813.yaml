    description: "Summary:\r\nThe generated interface shown for some stdlib types (iâ€™ve only looked at CountableRange at this point) is missing integral type constraints.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. use `CountableRange` as a type anywhere\r\n2. cmd-ctrl-click it to show the definition, getting redirected to Swift > Collection\r\n3. note that there are no constraints whatsoever\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe constraints, as seen here: https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/61ac13b86d1f66c5ca9e067de9e3a51cdc6e0ef7/stdlib/public/core/Range.swift#L895-L896\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nno constraints, as shown in the attached screenshot. just `public typealias CountableRange<Bound> = Range<Bound>`\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
