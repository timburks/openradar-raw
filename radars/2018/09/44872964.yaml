    description: "Summary:\r\nOn this docs page: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/1618259-addtarget\r\n\r\nThere is a typo in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the Discussion section. The sentence reads:\r\n\r\n>The control maintains a list of its attached targets and actions along and the events each supports.\r\n\r\nit looks like the author tried to use both “along with” and “and,” and ended up mixing them together. It should probably read:\r\n\r\n>The control maintains a list of its attached targets and actions along with the events each supports.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
