    description: "Summary:\r\nThe description of the method is:\n\n> Returns the URL for the desktop image for the given screen.\n\nBut the API sometimes return the URL to the **directory** of the active wallpaper image. This should either be fixed or the docs should be amended. Preferably fixed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to the \"Desktop and Screen Saver\" preference pane in \"System Preferences\".\n- Set the wallpaper to a custom image in a directory of images.\n- Check the \"Change picture\" checkbox.\n- Run `NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageURL(for: NSScreen.main!)` in Playgrounds.\n- Notice that it returns the URL the directory of images, not the active wallpaper image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected it to return the URL to the active wallpaper image, even when the \"Change picture\" option is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt returns the URL the directory of images, not the active wallpaper image.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBecause of this, there's no way to always reliably get the active wallpaper, which makes the method pretty useless. Currently, I have a hack in place that reads the value directly from the SQLite database [0] used to store it, but that could break at anytime.\n\n[0]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-wallpaper/blob/60fbc41e5a10d3953e0c269d314078bb66245d33/Sources/wallpaper/Wallpaper.swift#L41-L55\n\nRelevant GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-wallpaper/issues/7"
