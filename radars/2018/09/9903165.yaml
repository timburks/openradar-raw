    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"My Top Rated\" list in iTunes now displays not only songs but also top-rated Podcasts\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly music should be displayed like in older versions (or at least only unplayed podcast episodes, which would make some sense at least) \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll episodes of a top-rated podcast are displayed, regardless of wether they were already played before.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly tested on Lion with iTunes 10.4 (80)"
