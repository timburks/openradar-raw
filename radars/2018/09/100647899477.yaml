    description: "Summary: \r\nAfter performing an iOS update on a device, the device will reboot and display two screens (\"Update Completed\" and \"Get Started\") whereby manual intervention is required to continue using the device. While this might not be an issue for consumers, it is an issue for enterprises with a large fleet of service devices running iOS in single-app mode where the expected post-upgrade behavior would be to reboot back into the configured app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set an iOS device to use single-app mode for any compatible application\r\n2. Perform an iOS update\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device should finish the update and then reboot back into the pre-configured single-app mode application without user intervention.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPost-reboot, device will display \"Update Complete\" screen where user must hit \"Continue\", then the device proceeds to \"Get Started\" screen where user must hit \"Continue\" again before the device will be in a usable state.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to defeat the purpose of using single-app mode as these iOS post-update screens take precedence/priority over pre-configured single-app configurations."
