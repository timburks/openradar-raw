    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOver the last week a Xamarin customer and I have been tracking down a strange graphics corruption bug introduced in 10.14, and we have it down to code that does not use mono at all. \r\n\r\nHere is the original report: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/4509\r\n\r\nIt appears if all the following are true for me:\r\n\r\n- Building with Xcode10GM\r\n- Running on macOS 10.14\r\n- Launching from Finder or via \"open\" on the command line\r\n- In a project with a xib _not_ a storyboard as the main entry point\r\n\r\nThe customer has had a slightly different configuration to reproduce, so be aware, but this reproduced 100% of the time for me:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nProject setup  (or just use the attached project):\r\n- Create a new xcodeproject for macOS in Objective-C\r\n- Replace the storyboard with a xib\r\n- Add the following code in AppDelegate.m to show the graphics corruption when it occurs: https://gist.github.com/chamons/49f0e10259c2b422be1a61251eec3f49\r\n- Add the following code in main.m  https://gist.github.com/chamons/911807ae6bd7f63acbb00dd44cc1c53f\r\n\r\nThat code in main.m is a simplified invocation of one mprotect call in mono_jit_init. \r\n\r\nExecution:\r\nrm -fr build/ && xcodebuild -project MProtectMadness.xcodeproj/\r\nopen ./build/Release/MProtectMadness.app\r\n\r\nIf you reproduce the issue, you will see a modal dialog with a faint outline drawing nothing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA random mprotect call shouldn't corrupt graphics\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt does.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14 (18A391)\r\nXcode Version 10.0 (10A254a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
