    description: "We found that our app will crash in iOS9.0~iOS9.2.1, which was archived and uploaded by Xcode GM(10A254a).\r\n\r\nAccording to the crashlogs, app may crash randomly and unexpected when invoking some specified APIs from system frameworks, such as CFNetwork, UIKit, etc.,\r\n\r\nWe tried to debug with an iOS9.1 device but everything is OK, however that issue will be reproduced if running app downloaded from AppStore and TestFlight. \r\n\r\nWe have also tried to archive with the released Xcode version(10.0, 10A255) but nothing work.\r\n\r\nReally don't know what exactly cause crash. Sometime app will crash when click tabbar item, but sometime not. There is not any particular steps to reproduct that issue."
