    description: "Area:\r\nCarPlay\r\n\r\nRepo:\r\n1. enable DownTime from, say 10 pm to 7 am\r\n2. Go for a drive after 10 pm\r\n3. Try and play a song in the Music app\r\n4. The song fails to play, with no indication why\r\n5. Pull over somewhere safe and ignore screen time limit for the music app\r\n6. Songs now play. \r\n\r\nScreen Time should be disabled when connected to a CarPlay device, or there should be an option to automatically disable it when connected to a CarPlay device."
