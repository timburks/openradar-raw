    description: 'Since ARKit 1.0, the framework includes internal functionality to record and replay data collected in an AR session: ARRecordingTechnique, ARReplaySensor and other related SPI. While at the moment this functionality is likely used for internal purposes like QA testing, a tool such as this would be very useful for third-party developers too. It could radically simplify iterating over an AR user experience, and also enable automated testing of AR features: a session recorded indoors or outdoors could be replayed within the debug build of the app, simulating real usage, with expectations around appâ€™s behaviour under recorded circumstances. Combining this with existing UI testing mechanisms in Xcode, even user interaction with the scene could be simulated and validated, without having to constantly rely on a human tester and correct reproduction of the intended use case.'
