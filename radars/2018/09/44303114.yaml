    description: "It should be possible to configure a stack view so that it constrains its arranged subviews to the readable content guide of the stack view.\r\n\r\nThis could be similar to the cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth property of UITableView.\r\n\r\nAt present you can configure a stack view to layout its content relative to the layout margin of the stack view:\r\n\r\n    stackView.isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement = true\r\n\r\nBut there is no way to have the stack view use the readable content guide. The current workaround is to embed the stack view in a container view and constrain the stack view to the readable content guide of the container view.\r\n\r\nThis is extra work and adds an extra view to the view hierarchy that would be unnecessary if you could use the readable content guide of the stack view directly."
