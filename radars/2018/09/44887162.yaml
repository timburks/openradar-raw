    description: "Summary:\r\nSpotlight search by default shows developer results even if Xcode is not installed. This is surely a bug since the usual home user doesn’t need and want developer search results show up.\n\nAlso this bug is so old that there are plenty of tutorials Google on how to work around this. The trick is to install Xcode or create a dummy app with the name „Xcode“ so that the „developer“ entry shows up in System Settings -> Spotlight -> Search Results and you can untick it.\n\nThanks for finally fixing this after more than 5 years! (irony off)\n\nmacOS 10.14 (18A391), \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake any clean install of a macOS on any Mac, search for something unspecific in spotlight (for example type „ap“ or something which gives a lot of results)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo developer search results should show up since Xcode is not installed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDeveloper search results show up like .class files etc.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14 (18A391)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/231829/how-to-disable-developer-search-results-in-spotlight-on-a-mac/\nhttp://lmgtfy.com/?q=developer+search+results+spotlight+bug"
