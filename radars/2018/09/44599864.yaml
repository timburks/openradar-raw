    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary: Sometimes, on iOS 12, SQLite will crash when multiple libraries try to access it concurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: There are no easy steps to reproduce it. We have multiple 3rd party libraries accessing SQLite, and this was not resulting in a crash on iOS 11 and older. But on iOS 12, our users are experiencing crashes, usually on application launch.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app does not crash, and all 3rd party libraries can access SQLite successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The app is crashing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:  iOS 12.0\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: All devices and configurations."
