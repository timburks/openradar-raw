    description: "Area:\r\nControl Center\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\"Screen Time\" displays time I have spent on the github.com website as being associated with octohub, an app I have never installed and which is not officially associated with the github.com domain\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit github.com in safari\r\n2. Display \"Screen Time\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. \"Screen Time\" reports time spent on github.com as github.com, not some other random app\r\n2. A not-installed, non-official app cannot \"steal\" reporting for a website domain\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Screen Time\" reports time spent in octohub, despite it not being installed and not being an official github.com app\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 1.12.0\r\n\r\nAdditional details:\r\ngithub.com does not indicate it is an associated domain for that app (neither https://github.com/apple-app-site-association nor https://github.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association returns a manifest)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
