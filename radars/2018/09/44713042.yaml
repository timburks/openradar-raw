    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Series 4 watch supports new watch faces, most notably Infograph and Infograph Modular. However, several system apps have complications for other watch faces that aren't available on these two. In particular, several system apps have complications for the .modularSmall family which act purely as app launch shortcuts, yet don't have corresponding complications for the .graphicCircular family, despite these two families being very similar in layout on the Modular / Infograph Modular faces. \n\nA few examples (not complete) of apps with .modularSmall complications but not .graphicCircular:\n- Reminders\n- Messages\n- Alarm\n- Find My Friends\n- Home\n- Maps\n- Phone\n\nWithout knowing how much effort goes into developing apps at Apple, it seems like it should be very straightforward to add support for these apps on the .modularSmall family and simply use the same icons (or scaled versions). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
