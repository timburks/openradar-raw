    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an input that would require webview centering is clicked, the viewport is repositioned to center that input, as iOS has traditionally done. However, when dismissing the keyboard, the viewport is not re-positioned properly back to its original position.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached test case on a device or simulator. Tap the text input field to open the keyboard. Tap the Done button on the keyboard to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard overlay closes and the web view is positioned as before: filling the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard overlay closes, but the web view does not return to its original position, leaving a space at the bottom of the screen. If rubberband bounce scrolling is disabled, it is not possible to return the web view to its intended position.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe test project is also available on GitHub: https://github.com/dpogue/WKScrollTest/tree/ios12-keyboard"
