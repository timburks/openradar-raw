    description: "It's not hard to accidentally start taking a video in the wrong orientation. This is why Photos provides so many ways to correct photo orientation (gestures, hot keys, buttons). There is no way to correct videos. This is a small easy win. If you are reading this and in a position to help, please be our savior. \r\n\r\nSigned,\r\nThe Misaligned"
