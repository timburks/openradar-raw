    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you call AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget() and get back a result of either noErr or errAEEventNotPermitted, change the app’s permission in System Preferences, then call \nAEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget() again, the result does not change to the new state that you just set in System Preferences. Relaunching the host app is required to see the change “stick”.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Run \"tccutil reset AppleEvents\" in Terminal.\n2. Launch the attached “AppleEventPermissionsTesT” app and click the \"Determine Permission\" button.\n3. When prompted for access, click \"Don't Allow”. You should then get an alert saying “Apple event not permitted”\n4. Open System Preferences > Privacy and check the box for AppleEventPermissionTest > Finder to allow AppleEventPermissionTest to send Apple events to the Finder.\n5. Return to this app and click \"Determine Permission\" again. Even though we have now granted permission, we still get a \"not permitted\" result.\n6. Quit this app and launch it again.\n7. Click \"Determine Permission\" again. After relaunching, we now get the correct “event permitted\" result.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanging the test app’s permission in System Preferences should immediately change the result returned by calling AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget().\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe result only changes after you quit and relaunch the test application.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14 Beta (18A384a)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
