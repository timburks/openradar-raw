    description: "Area:\r\nGraphics & Imaging\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have two Dell P2715Q monitors connected to my MacBook Pro via Mini DisplayPort, with the computer closed (its internal screen turned off). Night Shift does not work properly across both monitors. Sometimes it will work properly for the first monitor but refuse to turn off for the second monitor; sometimes it does not work at all. When I open the Displays control panel, the first monitor has Night Shift configuration options but the second one doesn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect two monitors to a 2015 15\" MacBook Pro and close the lid so that the two external displays are the only ones active. Turn the computer on and allow Night Shift to activate on schedule, then try to use the computer later after Night Shift should have turned off.\r\n\r\nOr try toggling Night Shift in the 'Today'/'Notifications' sidebar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNight Shift activates properly on both screens and deactivates properly, either on schedule or when manually prompted. Displays control panel allows Night Shift to be turned on or off on both screens.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNight Shift activates properly on one screen and refuses to deactivate on another, or activates on one screen and does not activate on another. Displays control panel does not allow Night Shift configuration on second screen.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15 inch, mid-2015). 2.5 GHz Core i7, 16 GB memory, AMD Radeon R9 M370X (2048 MB) and Intel Iris Pro (1536 MB) graphics."
