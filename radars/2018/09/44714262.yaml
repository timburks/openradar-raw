    description: "Summary:\r\nMaps should take evacuation zones into account when determining the best route to take.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI’m filing this after hearing a story from my mother-in-law. She was driving in the greater Boston area on September 13th, 2018, the same day as the series of gas explosions: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/lawrence-massachusetts-explosion-gas-fire.html\n\nShe was not in an affected area, but she was driving home from work a few hours after the explosions started, and she was using Apple Maps to navigate home. Maps routed her through North Andover and the adjoining towns, even though police were going door to door and telling people to evacuate due to explosion risk. She says there was a convenient alternate route that would have worked if she’d known about it in advance.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaps knows about an in-progress police evacuation, and chooses an alternate route.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMaps was oblivious to the evacuation, and apparently the police activity on the roads was not sufficient to trigger a reroute based on road congestion.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
