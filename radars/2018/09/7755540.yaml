    description: "Summary:\r\nTrying to correct a name of a person in iphoto, written with a german umlaut is corrected to the original spelling immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Person named \"Hugo M端ller\", try to correct his name to \"Hugo Muller\" or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHaving a possibility to change the \"端\" into a \"u\" without being corrected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEntered letter is immediately undone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRenaming is, as far as I know, only possible by renaming M端ller -> Maller -> Muller (a being any letter other than 端 or u)"
