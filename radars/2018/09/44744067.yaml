    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m using a calendar app that publishes its events as intents for the Siri watch face. It’s my personal calendar, so I’m not worried about being spammed. I want 100% of the intents that it publishes to my watch face. However, this does not appear to be the case with the current implementation. I know the Siri watch face is supposed to learn from my behavior and show things it thinks are relevant, but I don’t want to risk missing an appointment or meeting because the algorithms weren’t smiling on me that day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use the Calendar app on the Siri watch face.\n2. Observe that every single timed event shows up on the watch face.\n3. Switch to a third-party calendar app.\n4. Enable it to publish intents to the Siri watch face.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEvery event from the third-party calendar app appears on the Siri watch face.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly some events appear.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Apple Calendar app appears to get special dispensation to publish all events, which I presume is a carryover from watchOS 4 or whenever the Siri watch face was introduced. I think one way to solve this could be to issue a special entitlement or have a special plist key for apps like calendars where it only makes sense to use them with the Siri watch face if they can publish all their events.\n\nOther examples of apps in this category might include:\n\n- pill reminders\n- workouts/break timer/stand reminders\n- daily prayer or meditation reminders\n- chore reminders"
