    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you use `NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL` to set the desktop wallpaper to an image, then later delete that image and rename another image to the same name, then set that image as the desktop wallpaper with `NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL`, the desktop wallpaper doesn't update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached Playground while being able to see the desktop wallpaper and notice that the desktop wallpaper never changes to the \"chicken-dog\" image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected calling `NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL` to always update the wallpaper, even if it's the same URL as the existing wallpaper, since the image at that URL might have changed.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, expose some way to force update the cache.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't update. Probably some kind of caching.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:"
