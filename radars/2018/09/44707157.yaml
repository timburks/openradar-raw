    description: "When a presenting a modal, if Now Playing View is used inside a horizontally paged interface controller, it appears misaligned.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached project.\r\n2. Tap the Modal Segue button.\r\n\r\nA non-modal paged interface controller is also included at the root level for convenience.\r\n\r\n(This can be more clearly seen on device, where having music playing will make the track description overlap with playback controls.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNow Playing View should look as it does a non-modal paged interface controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNow Playing View is misaligned.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nwatchOS 5.0 -- Now Playing View is not available on earlier versions."
