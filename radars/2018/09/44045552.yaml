    description: "Summary:\r\nReminders for macOS can sort reminders in a List by due date (View -> Sort By -> Due date) which I find useful as a way to prioritise things to do.\r\n\r\nIt seems itâ€™s not possible to automatically sort entries by due dates on iOS. It seems manual sorting via drag-and-drop is the only way to change the ordering.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to automatically sort entries by some common criteria (e.g. due date).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly manual sort by drag-and-drop seems to be possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
