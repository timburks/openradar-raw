    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter a pinch open to zoom has occurred and the view is then returned to normal size (pinch close) then an orientation change event occurs (the device rotated) the WKWebView zooms in on its own when it should not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a view with a WKWebView in an iOS application.\r\n2. Pinch open to zoom on the WKWebView\r\n3. Pinch close to return view to normal state\r\n4. Rotate the device to create an orientation change event.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe WKWebView should perform the orientation change without automatically zooming\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe WKWebView automatically zooms in when the orientation change occurs\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11.4"
