    description: "Summary:\r\n\"What is app signing?\" [1] in the Xcode documentation contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n> Distribution certificates belong to the team and one type of distribution\r\n> certificate (with the exception of Developer ID certificates) is allowed per\r\n> team. Only the Team Agent or Admin role can create distribution certificates\r\n> (if youâ€™re enrolled as an individual, you are the Team Agent). \r\n\r\nHowever, I was just able to create a second Distribution certificate and then sign and upload a build to App Store Connect with it.\r\n\r\nFurther, I discovered a stackoverflow answer [2] with an email from devprograms@apple.com saying the following:\r\n\r\n> From: devprograms@apple.com \r\n>\r\n> To: \r\n>\r\n> Re: Apple Developer Program Support\r\n> \r\n> Hi\r\n> \r\n> Per your request, I'm following up with information regarding the\r\n> certificate limitations on both the Apple Developer Program and Apple\r\n> Developer Enterprise Program.\r\n> \r\n> Each of the programs are able to create distribution certificates\r\n> however the Apple Developer Enterprise Program can have two active\r\n> certificates, while the Apple Developer Program is able to have three\r\n> active certificates. When viewing the Certificates, Identifiers, and\r\n> Profiles Portal, if the option to create a certificate is grayed out,\r\n> you have reached the active limit and an existing certificate will\r\n> need to be revoked to in order to proceed.\r\n> \r\n> Both of the programs are able to revoke and re-create certificates as\r\n> much as they wish as the limitation is only regarding active\r\n> certificates.\r\n> \r\n> Due to the certificate limitation, it's often better to export and\r\n> share the certificate if it's necessary to have available on multiple\r\n> systems. The following URL explains how to export the certificate\r\n> using Xcode.\r\n> \r\n> https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH31-SW7\r\n> \r\n> If you have any further questions, please let me know.\r\n> \r\n> Best regards,\r\n> \r\n> Brian Apple Inc.\r\n\r\n[1] https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3a05256b8\r\n[2] https://stackoverflow.com/a/38195289/9636\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3a05256b8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation should match the gist of the contents of the email.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDocumentation incorrectly states that a Team can have only one Distribution Cert."
