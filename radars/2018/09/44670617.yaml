    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a modal view controller has a custom animator, when dismiss(animated: Bool, completion: ((Bool)->Void)?) is called on its presenting view controller, its view hangs around on screen and becomes unresponsive. By switching out of the app and back in, one can get back to the presenting view controller.\r\n\r\nThis only appears to crop up in iOS 12.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unzip & open the attached project in Xcode. \r\n2. Build & run on any device or simulator running iOS 12.0.\r\n3. Press the “Present” button. \r\n4. Press the “Dismiss” button. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPre iOS 12.0: The modal (black) view controller visibly dismisses with the animation described in DismissAnimator.swift lines 17-38.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS 12.0: The modal view controller’s view does not visibly change and becomes unresponsive. The animation’s completion block beginning at line 28 in DismissAnimator.swift is not called. The modal view controller’s view’s frame property is updated to the correct value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nManually switching out of app & back in seems to do away with the unresponsive view."
