    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Interface Builder builders,\n\nWould you like to crash Interface Builder? Here's a way: copy an NSWindow from a storyboard and paste it into a xib. I'll attach a project for testing, and a video demonstrating the crash using that project.\n\nLove,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. File > New > Project.\n2. Choose the macOS Cocoa App template.\n3. Turn on “Use Storyboards”.\n4. Name the project after your favorite variety of apple.\n5. Save the project.\n6. File > New > File.\n7. Choose the macOS > User Interface > Empty template.\n8. Save the xib as Empty.xib.\n9. Open Main.storyboard.\n10. Control-shift-click the window in the storyboard and choose the NSWindow from the pop-up menu.\n11. Edit > Copy.\n12. Open Empty.xib.\n13. Click in the canvas.\n14. Edit > Paste.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the window to be pasted into the xib.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhat actually happened was the sudden disappearance of Xcode, followed shortly by an “Xcode quit unexpectedly” dialog box.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
