    description: "Summary:\r\nCrash logs are important source of information when interpreting results of executing UI tests as part of CI build.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in Xcode 10 reliability of the reporting decreased. Now instead of generating a crash report, test runner reports a non-informative assertion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun tests from demo project - https://github.com/nickolas-pohilets/rdar-39753004 using Xcode 10.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4 crash logs are generated every time when tests from demo project are executed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1-2 crash logs are generated, in other cases crash is reported as an assertion: Application state is still unknown for com.example.CrashInTest (pid: ...)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\nSimulator: iPhone XR, iOS 12.0 (16A366)"
