    description: "Area:\r\nSiri\r\n\r\nIn Brazilian Portuguese the Siri trigger phrase is \"E aí, Siri\". The \"E aí\" part is actually pronounced as three syllables and very clumsy to say many and many times. I bet this is a motive for many people not use Siri in Brazil. Better options are:\r\n- OK Siri (I know...)\r\n- Ô Siri (pronounce as \"oh siri\", or \"Osiris\")\r\nOr, obviously, custom trigger phrases.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
