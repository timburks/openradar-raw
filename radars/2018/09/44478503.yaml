    description: "Summary:\r\nIn macOS 10.14 developer beta 11 (18A389), unchecking a Finder extension in the Extensions preferences pane fails to disable the extension: its menu item remains in the Finder contextual menu, and its process continues to run (as observed in Activity Monitor), until the user logs out and logs back in.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, at this point, checking the Finder extension does not restart it until the user logs out and in again.\r\n\r\nIn macOS 10.13, unchecking the Finder extension does deactivate it after about 15â€“20 seconds, and checking it again reactivates it almost immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a Finder extension such as \"What's Your Sign?\" <https://objective-see.com/products/whatsyoursign.html>.\r\n2. Observe that its item (\"Signing Info\") appears in the Finder contextual menu, and its process is active in Activity Monitor.\r\n3. Open the Extensions preference pane, locate the WhatsYourSign item, and uncheck it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu item is no longer present in the Finder contextual menu, and its process is terminated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu item continues to appear in the Finder contextual menu, and its process continues to run, for the duration of the current login session.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14 developer beta 11 (18A389)"
