    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen Xcode 10 builds an app including a Photo Editing extension, it always adds a dependency to MapKit, even when the main app and the app extension does not make use of maps functionality. This caused App Review rejection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a single-window macOS application with Swift 4.2 as the programming language (use the sample template from Xcode).\r\n2. Add a Photos Editing extension to the app.\r\n3. Build the application on macOS High Sierra.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSince this is essentially a “blank application”, the dependencies should be minimal.  Specifically there must not be any dependency to the MapKit framework.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode includes “libswiftMapKit.dylib” into the application bundle’s Frameworks directory. In turn this forces the app to have a dependency to MapKit and causes App Store review rejection if the app does not have maps functionality.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached sample project. This project is essentially created from Xcode sample templates. The build results is in folder \"Build-Debug\" and was obtained from the debug build of the project whereas the project is in folder \"TestApp\". You can see for yourself that in package `TestApp.app` in the `Frameworks` folder there is `libswiftMapKit.dylib` despite there is no \"import MapKit\" statement in the project.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n- Xcode 10 version 10.0 (10A254a)\r\n- macOS High Sierra version 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n- MacBook Pro early 2013\r\n\r\nSample Project: https://github.com/adib/Xcode-10-MapKit-Dependency"
