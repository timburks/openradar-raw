    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to upload a build of an app with a deployment target of iOS 11.0 (and watchOS 4.0), App Store Connect fails with the error:\r\n\r\nERROR ITMS-90081: \"This bundle is invalid. Applications built for more than one architecture require an iOS Deployment Target of 3.0 or later.\"\r\n\r\nThe check is obviously wrong since the deployment target is 11.0 which is later than 3.0. Also, the iOS app is only built for one architecture, arm64.\r\n\r\nThe app was built using the Xcode 10 GM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 (10A254a)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
