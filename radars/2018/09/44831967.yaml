    description: "Summary:\r\nGoing to use the Mickey Mouse face as my specific example.\n\nOn Series 4, the watch automatically curves complications around the watch face, similar to the Infograph face. However, new complications (such as UV index) aren’t supported, even though they would (I think) render correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn Series 4 Apple Watch\n\n1. Add Mickey Mouse face\n2. Attempt to add UV Index complication\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can add the UV Index complication\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can’t add the UV Index complication\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0 (16R364)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdded a screenshot showing the curved complications on the Mickey Mouse face."
