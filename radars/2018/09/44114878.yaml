    description: "Area:\r\nMessages Framework\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nConverting rects from other windows to the coordinate space of views inside a Messages app extension window produces incorrect rects. The Messages app window is shorter than the screen's height but reports a frame origin of 0,0 causing all rects (and presumably points) to be off by the delta between the heights of the app extension's window's height and the screen height.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached demo project.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n- Create Messages app extension\r\n- Register for notifications when the keyboard's frame changes\r\n- Convert they keyboard's frame to the extension's root view controller's view's coordinate space and determine the intersection with the view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRects converted to a Messages app extension window's coordinate space should account for the fact that the window is not full screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nConverted rects are incorrect.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nHappens on iOS 11.0 through iOS 12.0 (16A5354b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\nXcode 9 and Xcode 10"
