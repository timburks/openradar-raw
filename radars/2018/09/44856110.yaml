    description: "Summary:\r\nThe transition of the tab bar is not correct on iPhone X when popping a view controller that have hidesBottomBarWhenPushed set to true.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an app that uses tab bar on iPhone X/XS\r\n2. Present any view controller modally, dismiss it\r\n3. Push a view controller onto the navigation stack\r\n4. Observe glitched tab bar during push animation\r\n5. Pop the view controller from the navigation stack\r\n6. Observe glitched tab bar during pop animation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe transition looks as on other iPhones, e.g. iPhone 7. That is, the tab bar doesn’t have visual glitches during the transition and stays of the same size all the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tab bar is „squished” vertically during both the pop and push transition. It only gets back to normal, expected size after the transition is complete.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the attached AppDelegate file that has a sample code for app that allows you to reproduce the glitch. Run it in iPhone X/XS simulator/device."
