    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageURL` method is useful for getting the currently active desktop wallpaper, but for dynamic wallpapers it just returns the HEIC file, which contains all the images, but there's no way to know which of those images are currently being shown on the desktop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to the \"Desktop and Screen Saver\" preference pane in \"System Preferences\".\n- Ensure it's set to a dynamic wallpaper.\n- Run `NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageURL(for: NSScreen.main!)` in Playground.\n- Notice that it returns a HEIC file, like \"file:///System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.heic\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected there to be a way to get the currently shown image of a dynamic wallpaper.\n\nThis is important for being able to imitate the desktop, for example, for hiding the desktop icons momentarily while doing a screen recording.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere no way to find this out, which makes the `NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageURL` method not reliable in all cases, even less when dynamic wallpapers gets popular.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelevant GitHub issue: https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-wallpaper/issues/17"
