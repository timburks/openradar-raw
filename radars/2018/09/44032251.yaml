    description: "I am running the 10.14 Mojave beta (10A377a) on a 13\" MacBook Pro with an eGPU (the Developer edition). When I launch the Books app with its window on the display attached to the eGPU and open a book, the text of the book is not visible.  Turning off the eGPU and relaunching Books restores proper behavior and the book is visible again, as does dragging the Books window to the MacBook's internal display and restarting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start up a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) with an External Graphics Development Kit connected (via an Apple Thunderbolt 3) cable. The eGPU is attached to a Dell P2715Q monitor running at 3840x2160 resolution with a USB-C to mini-DisplayPort cable.\r\n2) Launch Books; if it does not appear on the external display, drag its window to the external display and then relaunch it.\r\n3) Open a book.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text of the book is visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Books window is blank, except for the title of the book at the top of the window."
