    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen having two Xcode's (Xcode 10 beta 6 and Xcode 9.4) on our privately hosted CI machine we need to delete unavailable simulators to start in clean state which is only to have one simulator that we want to use. \n\nSometimes `xcrun simctl delete unavailable` gives us mysterious error:\n\n> An error was encountered processing the command (domain=com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimError, code=164):\n> Errors encountered while deleting multiple devices.\n\nI can see that some simulators have invalid state, such us `Creating`. Do you have any tips on how to avoid this type of error and in general how we should manage simulators when simultaneously we use two different Xcode versions?\n\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run `xcrun simctl delete unavailable`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n`xcrun simctl` should delete unavailable simulators.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`xcrun simctl` doesn't delete unavailable simulators.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
