    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Italian is selected in the Siri language preferences, the invocation of a voice shortcut relative to an INPlayMediaIntent is answered with the correct translation (\"solo un momento\" = \"just a moment\"), followed by a pause, and another utterance with only one word \"punto\" (Italian for \"full stop). The same thing is reflected in the UI where \"solo un momento\" is displayed over the Siri UI, and the character for full stop is displayed all alone under the Siri UI. (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nWhat makes this bug problematic is that the second utterance comes with an extraneous AVAudioSession interruption began notification, that is not followed by an interruption ended notification. This makes it very hard for developers to resume playback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect Italian as Siri Language in the preferences.\r\nInvoke Siri and pronounce the utterance corrisponding to a INPlayMediaIntent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should say \"solo un momento\" or something like that, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri says \"solo un momento\" some seconds of pause and then says \"punto\".\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
