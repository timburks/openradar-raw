    description: "When a view controller is pushed on a UINavigationController while another transition is in progress, the viewControllers property isn't updated synchronously before pushViewController:animated: returns.\r\n\r\nThis can be triggered for example by pushing a view controller shortly after another one (either in the same run loop cycle like in the attached demo app, or with a short delay).\r\n\r\nThe problem can also be triggered when a modal presentation animation is running while pushViewController:animated: is called. This can be tried out by replacing the first push in the demo app (ViewController.m:16) by:\r\n[self presentViewController:blueVc animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Build and run the demo app\r\n- Tap the \"Demo!\" button\r\n- Watch the app's logs in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe last log message should list three view controllers: The original and the two that were pushed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe last log message only lists two view controllers: The original and the first one that was pushed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1 (9F2000)\r\nSimulatorApp-851.2\r\nCoreSimulator-518.22\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11.4 (15F79) on iPhone X simulator\r\n\r\nOnly for Open Radar, not part of the original radar:\r\nHere's the contents of ViewController.m, the only file with relevant code.\r\n\r\n#import \"ViewController.h\"\r\n\r\n@implementation ViewController\r\n\r\n- (IBAction)demoTapped:(UIButton *)sender {\r\n    UIViewController *blueVc = [UIViewController new];\r\n    blueVc.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.blueColor;\r\n\r\n    UIViewController *redVc = [UIViewController new];\r\n    redVc.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor;\r\n\r\n    UINavigationController *nav = self.navigationController;\r\n    NSLog(@\"[before] navigationController.viewControllers = \\n%@\", nav.viewControllers);\r\n\r\n    NSLog(@\"pushing %@\", blueVc);\r\n    [nav pushViewController:blueVc animated:YES];\r\n\r\n    NSLog(@\"[between] navigationController.viewControllers = \\n%@\", nav.viewControllers);\r\n\r\n    NSLog(@\"pushing %@\", redVc);\r\n    [nav pushViewController:redVc animated:YES];\r\n\r\n    NSLog(@\"[after] navigationController.viewControllers = \\n%@\", nav.viewControllers);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@end"
