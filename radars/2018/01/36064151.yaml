    description: "`LAContext` has `biometryType` property. But the value is `none` if `canEvaluatePolicy(_:error:)` failed.\r\n\r\n\r\ne.g. I want to show a message like this for a user:\r\n\r\n\"Oops, this app is locked out! If you want to use Touch ID for this App, then check the Setting app -> 'Touch ID and Passcord'.\"\r\n\r\nBut my app can't detect what kind of biometric auth the device supports at the moment due to the current specification. So I changed the above message like this:\r\n\r\n\"Oops, this app is locked out! If you want to use Touch ID/Face ID for this app, then check the Setting app -> 'Touch ID & Passcode' or 'Face ID & Passcode'.\"\r\n\r\nIt's boring and less readable.\r\n\r\nI think, whether the method is succeeded or not is not related to know what kind of biometric auth a device supports.\r\n\r\nSo I believe it would be nice if LAContext has a new way to get biometryType even if canEvaluatePolicy(_:error:) failed."
