    description: "Summary:\r\nIn order to test some keyboard functionality, it's important to test what happens when the user taps certain keys such as the \"Next\"/\"Done\" button on the software keyboard, etc. It doesn't seem to be possible to force the iOS simulator software keyboard open or closed when launching UI tests\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build UI tests in Xcode\r\n2. Include something like tester().tapView(withAccessibilityLabel: \"Next\") in the UI test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test always passes because the software keyboard is consistently displaying\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe software keyboard has to be manually enabled if it's not already\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n10.12.6 (16G29)"
