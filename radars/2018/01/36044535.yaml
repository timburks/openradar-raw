    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA POST-request with Basic-Authentication Header and wrong credentials leads to a challenge response without the ResponseBody by the server. \r\nThis causes the problem that we need to send the former request with the wrong credentials a second time and the actual 401 Response with the ResponseBody from the server.\r\n\r\nThis issue has the sideeffect that our server application adds two failed login attempts instead of only one. We were able to reproduce this issue on a different server (see attachments).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSend a POST Request to any HTTPS Server endpoint with incorrect credentials.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo Challenge Response.\r\nResponse 401 with Response Body.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChallenge Response without Response Body of the Server\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10, 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI included a example project sent by \"The Eskimo\" from Apple technical Support."
