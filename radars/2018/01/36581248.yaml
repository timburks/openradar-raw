    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen deleting at the end of the last line of text which is also the second line of text overall, with the first line being empty (i.e. only a newline character), the insertion point is drawn too far to the top. The NSLayoutManager computes a wrong line height.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(1) Configure a NSTextView to have non-default line heights, e.g. using a larger font size\r\n(2) Replace the text with an empty line and type in the second line, note how the insertion point is drawn correctly\r\n(3) delete from the end of the second line with backspace; note that the insertion point's height is appropriate, but its Y-coordinate is off\r\n\r\nIn code:\r\n\r\n    textView.font = NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: 30)\r\n    textView.insertText(\"\\nhit backspace at the end of this paragraph; note that the print'ed lineFragmentRect.height is 14 until you enter something into the first line\", replacementRange: NSRange())\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen deleting with backspace at the end of the second (and last) line of text, the insertion point should stay in line and move back horizontally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe insertion point moves back horizontally by the width of the deleted character but also some pixels to the top.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nmacOS SDK 10.13"
