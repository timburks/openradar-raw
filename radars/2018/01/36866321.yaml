    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 11.3 restores the App Store behaviour of the Updates tab showing the size in MB of each update. These numbers appear to be incorrect, however.\n\nI’ve taken Snapchat as an example here, but the same point applies to other apps. The size listed in the app’s product page is 129.2MB. The installed size on my device after applying the update is 128.3MB. However, the size for the update is shown as 230.5MB.\n\nPerhaps this is the size of the full binary as uploaded by the developer, or it’s the size before app slicing, delta updates, etc. are calculated.\n\nWhatever the cause is, having this size reported within the Updates tab is just misleading. Users may hold off on updating apps because of these, and it can even lead to users deleting apps entirely assuming that size constitutes the app’s installed size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the App Store updates tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe size listed alongside each app reflects the actual amount of data that updating that app will consume\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s not even close\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.3 beta 1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
