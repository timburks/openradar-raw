    description: "I want to access the user's call history. This can be really useful for helping business users easily classify their phone calls as personal or work. Right now I only get a little bit of information with the Call Observation API, but that only works if my app has been running.\r\n\r\nI should be able to access the call database after the user grants permission for me to do so, and then query that database for calls, durations, participants, etc."
