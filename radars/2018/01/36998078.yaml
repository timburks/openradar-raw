    description: "We'd love to move our app to use large titles but we feel that even with the ability to specify a font, that they still don't allow enough options for us to make them fit our brand. If we could center the large titles, that would go a long way to make the large titles fit our brand better.\r\n\r\n`UINavigationBar` has a `largeTitleTextAttributes` which allows a `paragraphyStyle` to be specified. The `NSMutableParagraphStyle` has an alignment property that can be set to `.center`. But even when this property is set, the large titles are still left aligned. It would be great if this setting allowed the large titles to be centered."
