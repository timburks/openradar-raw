    description: "Right now I can only manipulate my own passes in the pass library.\r\n\r\nWith user permission, I'd like to get access to every pass in the user's library. This would include the ability to query for passes that have changed since a previous timestamp, as well as retrieving the raw pkpass zip blob.\r\n\r\nI want this because I'm working on an app that works with the user's passes, and asking the user to manually share every single pass in their library with my app is tedious, and does not allow my app to get updated versions of the passes."
