    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a SeeAlso documentation callout is added to the documentation comment for a symbol, it does not display in the Quick Help dialog for that symbol.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Xcode\r\n- Create a new project (of any type, but for example, a macOS Command Line Tool)\r\n- In a Swift file, declare a symbol, such as `struct Foo { }`\r\n- Build the project, and verify that it builds successfully\r\n- Add a documentation comment before the symbol. This documentation comment can be either a block comment, surrounded by /** and */, or a single-line comment, beginning with ///.\r\n- Add a SeeAlso callout within the documentation comment, in any of the following forms:\r\n    - SeeAlso: Bar\r\n    + SeeAlso: Bar\r\n    * SeeAlso: Bar\r\n    - seealso: Bar\r\n    + seealso: Bar\r\n    * seealso: Bar (Note: this form, when inserted inside a block comment, is parsed as \"seealso: Bar\" and displayed as plain text, because the leading * is stripped out to allow for a leading * on each line to form a vertical bar in the documentation comment)\r\n- Build the project again, and verify that it builds successfully\r\n- Option-click on the symbol `Foo`, Command-Control-click on the symbol and click Quick Help, or place the cursor on the symbol and open the Quick Help inspector\r\n- Observe the result\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe SeeAlso callout and its contents are rendered in the quick help window, with a bold heading reading \"See Also\", as described in the Markup Formatting Reference here:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/SeeAlso.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH45-SW1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe SeeAlso callout is not rendered in any form (either its contents or the heading, in plain or formatted text). See the attached file \"actualresults.png\".\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- Xcode 9.2 (9C40b), macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 (17D47)\r\n- Xcode 9.3 beta (9Q98q), macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 (17D47)"
