    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen asking user for an image with UIImagePickerController, it returns a scaled image in the info dictionary for both original image & the image pointed to by the url. It seems to always return an image scaled within 2048x2048.\r\n\r\nThis person ran into this too and leveraged library APIs to work around it:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/88147\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add 4000x6000 sized or similar image to Photos on a device or simulator without iCloud Photo Library.\r\n2. Open an app with UIImagePickerController\r\n3. Choose large image\r\n4. Check returned image size in UIImagePickerController's delegate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOriginal image is returned at 4000x6000 size in delegate call.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWe get an image sized at 1365x2048 instead.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2/15C107 (Simulator)\r\niOS 11.2.2/15C202 (iPad Pro 9.7\")\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 9.7\" with iCloud Photo Library\r\niPad Pro 9.7\" Simulator 11.2 with iCloud Photo Library\r\niPad Pro 9.7\" Simulator 11.2 without iCloud Photo Library"
