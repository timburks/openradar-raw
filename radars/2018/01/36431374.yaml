    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using HealthKit in an app you need to add the privacy descriptions to the Info.plist. \nFor HealthKit those are:\nNSHealthShareUsageDescription \nNSHealthUpdateUsageDescription\n\nThe issue is that if your App only reads data from HealthKit it still requires to add both. But itâ€™s only required by iTunes Connect. There is no error or warning while compiling or running the code, you just see it when uploading the build for distribution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add HealthKit.framework to your App\n2. Add only NSHealthShareUsageDescription description in Info.plist\n3. Upload the build to iTunes Connect\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe upload succeeds as the App is NOT using write APIs\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe upload fails with the error \nERROR ITMS-90683: \"Missing Info.plist key. This app attempts to access privacy-sensitive data without a usage description. The app's Info.plist must contain an NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
