    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone HIG (https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/progress-indicators/) states that \"On all devices except iPhone X, a network activity indicator spins in the status bar at the top of the screen as networking occurs\". So the iPhone X doesn't show the network activity indicator at all.\r\n\r\nIMO, there should be some sort of network indicator on iPhone X, too. In a previous iOS version (a Simulator beta?) I noticed a horizontally bouncing line (~ 50 pt wide) that was displayed in addition to the usual status bar icons. IMO that was a great idea and I don't understand why it didn't make it into the current release.\r\n\r\nNot displaying the network activity indicator at all is a bad solution because it requires developers to either abandon it completely or to provide alternative solutions just for a single device (device fragmentation).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
