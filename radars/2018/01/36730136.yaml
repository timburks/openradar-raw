    description: "Summary: When there's a doc-comment for a constant in Objective-C code, Xcode is capable of showing a comment in the autocomplete box, but not in the Quick Help Inspector on the right. See the screenshot attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake this code sample:\r\n\r\n/**\r\n *  This is a comment to TTTest;\r\n */\r\nstatic NSString * const TTTest = @\"test\";\r\n@interface TestClass : NSObject\r\n@end\r\n@implementation TestClass\r\n- (void)testMethod {\r\n    TTTest; // <----- this line\r\n}\r\n@end\r\n\r\nMove cursor to \"TTTest; // <----- this line\". See Quick Help Inspector on the right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nQuick Help inspector shows the \"This is a comment to TTTest;\" comment. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt shows \"No Quick Help\". It used to work in the past, but then it broke down.\r\nAlso, you can start typing \"TTTest\", and you'll be able to see \"This is a comment to TTTest;\" at the bottom of the autocomplete box, so it's correctly recognized as a doc comment, it's just not displayed by the Quick Help pane.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.2 (17C205)"
