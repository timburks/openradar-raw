    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile implementing an interactively dismissible controller that doesn't cover the entire screen and can be dismissed with a pan gesture, I came across a weird behavior where the animation jumps back to it's initial position and then back to where it is supposed to be. Sample project: https://github.com/sjavora/interactiveDismissalGlitch\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch the app on device (the issue seems less visible/present on the simulator)\r\n2) open the modal controller using the button\r\n3) slowly drag up or down (works in both directions)\r\n\r\nVideo of issue: https://github.com/sjavora/interactiveDismissalGlitch/blob/master/glitch.mov?raw=true\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animated view controller follows drag movement.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animated view controller briefly returns to initial position.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 9.2, High Sierra 10.13.2"
