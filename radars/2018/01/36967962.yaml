    description: "Summary:\r\nSet app whitelist for all MS Office 2016 apps in Keychain Access for my client certificate, but none of the MS Office apps seem to be able to access the certificate or private key.\r\nCertificate/Key combination works fine via Safari, allowing me to access Office 365 via the web interface.\r\nWas working fine in Sierra, failed immediately after upgrading to High Sierra. Certificate/key have been tested on a windows 7 laptop, and a windows 7 virtual machine, and function as expected.\r\nLogs indicate secd is disallowing the MS apps access to the keychain, stating:\r\n\r\ndefault\t10:04:48.077069 +1100\tsecd\tMicrosoft Outloo[7730]/1#14 LF=0 copy_matching Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-34018 \"Client has neither com.apple.application-identifier, com.apple.security.application-groups nor keychain-access-groups entitlements\" UserInfo={NSDescription=Client has neither com.apple.application-identifier, com.apple.security.application-groups nor keychain-access-groups entitlements}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpening any Office software (tested with Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, Word from the installer I was provided, as well as the latest Teams from their website, and OneDrive from both Microsoft installer, and via the Mac App Store), and attempting to sign in with my account credentials causes it to try and present a login window for my Enterprise Office 365 account (Microsoft calls this 'Modern Authentication'). \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnce the certificate is recognised, a 2-factor authentication process should start (as part of my company's authentication process for cloud services), which if completed successfully, should authenticate me to my Office 365 account for that app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the handoff from Microsoft's login page to my enterprise one, accessing the cert/key in keychain fails, which then presents me a failure window from my enterprise.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.3\r\nHas been an issue since 10.13.0 and persisted through all updates.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHas been managed via MDM (though it seems the same cert problem is causing Airwatch MDM to crash regularly). Have tested without MDM and manually installing the certificate, which allows Safari to use the cert/key for authentication, but the Office apps still don't work."
