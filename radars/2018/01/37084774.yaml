    description: "Summary:\r\nBased on the Web Audio and Media Source Extension specifications, it should be possible to connect an AudioNode to a MediaStreamDestination and, in turn, specify the stream property of that destination as the srcObject for an Audio element. This process works successfully in Blink/Chrome.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n<html>\r\n<audio id=\"a\" controls>\r\n<script type=\"module\">\r\n  const context = new webkitAudioContext();\r\n  const destination = context.createMediaStreamDestination();\r\n\r\n  const audioElement = document.getElementById('a');\r\n  audioElement.srcObject = destination.stream;\r\n\r\n  // trigger events on AudioNodes connected to destination\r\n</script>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAudio should play as if nodes were connected to the context destination, but controlled via the Audio element.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari shows an audio playback state in the status bar, but no audio is ever heard. Auto play audio blocks are disabled.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSafari 11.0.3 (12604.5.6.1.1)\r\nSafari Technology Preview 11.2 Release 48 (12606.1.2.2)"
