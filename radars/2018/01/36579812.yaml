    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the following conditions are met, HLS streamed subtitles always appear in the middle of the screen instead of the bottom:\r\n* Phone is in portrait mode\r\n* Subtitles are enabled\r\n* Video has a landscape aspect ratio (e.g. 16x9)\r\n* AVPlayerLayer's videoGravity property is set to AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspectFill\r\n\r\nThe preferred position to display the subtitles should be on the bottom of the screen, like in all other scenarios.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and run the HLS Catalog sample app (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/HLSCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html)\r\n2. Click on 'Basic Stream'\r\n3. Enable 'CC' Subtitles\r\n4. Change the video gravity by clicking the second button on the top left\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSubtitles are displayed on the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSubtitles are displayed in the middle of the screen. They are displayed in the same position as if the video gravity was still AVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspect."
