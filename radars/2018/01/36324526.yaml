    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the morning of January 5, 2018, “About the security content of macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, Security Update 2017-002 Sierra, and Security Update 2017-005 El Capitan” https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208331 listed macOS 10.11.6 and 10.12.6 as having been patched against the Meltdown exploit (CVE-2017-5754). By lunchtime time that designation had been removed. \r\n\r\nEven if 10.13 had been a flawless release most organizations wouldn’t have deployed a brand new OS en masse just three months after its release. As such, it would be unfortunate if Apple felt access to key security updates be tied to having deployed only the latest available OS release. \r\n\r\nOrganizations have workflows and third-party applications they need to coordinate release schedules with when considering upgrades, and they should be able to plan for support of at least OS version N-1, if not N-2, when it comes to security updates. \r\n\r\nWhat will be Apple's response for 10.11 and 10.12 when it comes to patching the Meltdown and Spectre (CVE-2017-5715 & CVE-2017-5753) vulnerabilities?\r\n\r\nImpact: 1300 machines\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKernel, Safari and other system-level patches available to mitigate vulnerabilities if possible. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo patch available at this time\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.11.6 / 15G17023\r\n10.12.6 / 16G1036\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
