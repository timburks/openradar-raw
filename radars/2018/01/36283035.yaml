    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter double tapping to selecting an cell and navigating to is corresponding detail view controller, UITableView insists to set Voice Over focus on this cell in viewDidAppear in later navigations even though another cell has already taken the focus before navigating to detail view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app on iPhone.\r\n2. Tap + button 3 times to insert 3 cells.\r\n3. Tune on Voice Over.\r\n4. Focus on the 3rd cell.\r\n5. Double tap to navigate to detail view.\r\n6. Navigate back to master view.\r\n7. Make sure UITableView correctly focuses on the 3rd cell. If not(another bug I suppose), repeat 5â€“6 until it does.\r\n8. Focus on the 1st cell.\r\n9. Use 3 finger horizontal swipe gesture to trigger navigation.\r\n10. Navigate back to master view.\r\n11. See UITableView incorrectly focuses on the 3rd cell instead of the 1st cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!tagHHRyT!9krsOxHRf0NWugOSo2V79dR3Gxz4R5ApVflc6y014eo"
