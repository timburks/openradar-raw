    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen implementing a `UITableView` with iOS 11's new swipe actions API, if only `trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt` is implemented, or if `leadingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt` returns `nil`, swiping towards the leading edge will correctly show the actions, but swiping in the opposite direction will _not_ hide the actions. \r\n\r\nIf both functions return non-nil and non empty `UISwipeActionsConfiguration`, swiping in the opposite direction used to open the line will successfully close it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSwipe towards the leading edge of a line that only has `trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt` implemented. Once open, swipe in the opposite direction. See the Reminders app for an example.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe actions to be hidden in the same manner as when both leading and trailing APIs return non nil, non empty values (the line returns to its closed state). See the Mail app for an example.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell does not close. Only closes if the cell is tapped or the `UITableView` is scrolled.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11+\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
