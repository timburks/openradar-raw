    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you select multiple files in Files app and share them via \"Copy to App\" action, only one file is ever imported and processed.\r\n\r\n- Practical examples I can reproduce: Procreate, PDF Expert app. Please see screenshots.\r\n- Code: AirDropSample (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/sc2273/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40013842-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2)\r\n\r\nI am aware that the `Inbox` path might have been changed (https://stackoverflow.com/a/47415226/1452174), but in code, I can see that no additional files are imported at all. No more files in `Documents/Inbox`. No more files in `tmp/` or `tmp/<bundle-ID>-Inbox`. This also happens in my own project.\r\n\r\nPretty sure this is a dupe since it's a pretty serious one for UI. Please let me know if this has been fixed. If not, please let me know if you'd like another sample project in Swift 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have some files ready in Files app (iOS 11).\r\n- Select multiple files in Files, then select action \"Copy to App\". For PDF Expert, I just pick a few PDFs. For Procreate, I pick a few .procreate files. For AirDropSample, I pick a few .customprofile files.\r\n- The app the files are imported (Procreate / PDF Expert / AirDropSample) will have **exactly one file** imported.\r\n\r\n- If you perform multi-files import via AirDrop, multiple files are correctly imported.\r\n- If you perform Drag and Drop for iPad, multiple files are correctly imported. However, on the iPhone this is a problem. You can't import multiple files at once at all.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Copy to App\" should correctly import multiple files!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Copy to App\" imports only one file. This happens for many apps including real-world ones like Procreate / PDF Expert.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.2 (15C202), Xcode 9.2 (9C40b) for AirDropSample.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPlease see screenshot."
