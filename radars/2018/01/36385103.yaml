    description: "Summary:\r\nOn macOS 10.13.2, right-clicking on an external HD formatted as HFS+ triggers an AFPS conversion.  Once complete, the encryption will proceed.  This is is a lengthly process, and is not desirable in certain situations (such as for a Time Machine backup drive).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Format an external HD as HFS+.\r\n2.  Enable Time Machine on the external HD (optional).\r\n3.  Right-click on the external HD in the Finder, and click “Encrypt <drive name>…”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4.  The drive will be encrypted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4.  The drive is converted from HFS+ to APFS.\r\n5.  The drive is encrypted.\r\n6.  Upon finally remounting (my 2 TB USB 3.0 drive took several days for this process to occur), you will receive a notification that a backup cannot occur, as Time Machine requires HFS+.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOnce following these steps, your only option is to format the Time Machine drive, losing data in the process."
