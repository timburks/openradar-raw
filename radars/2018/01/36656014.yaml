    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease route this to MDM Documentation.\nMDM documentation stays that SetupConfiguration command has been replaced by AccountConfiguration. As an MDM vendor, it would be very helpful to know which command is supported on which version of macOS, as we still support old versions. This \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdd a table where for SetupConfiguration and AccountConfiguration each macOS version is said to support the command or not.\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
