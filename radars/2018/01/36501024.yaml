    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nI write an application that I would like to adapt to macOS' dark mode and use the dark vibrancy mode accordingly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the best method to determine whether a user has chosen the dark menu bar and Dock style in the General System Preferences is to read the user's NSGlobalDomain.\r\n\r\nIf possible, it would be preferable if this information was exposed in a public API. Thanks!"
