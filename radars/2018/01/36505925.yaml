    description: "Changing the Siri Voice Feedback Setting does not change Siri voice feedback behavior. Siri always responds with audio.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn a Watch Series 3, go to Settings -> General -> Siri and update to different modes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen Always On, Siri should respond audibly in all Siri Watch interactions. When \"Control With Silent Mode\" Siri should respond audibly except when the watch is in silent mode when it should just respond with on screen text. When set to \"Headphones Only\" Siri should only respond audibly when using headphones.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo matter what setting is used Siri always responds audibly. When set to \"Control With Silent Mode\" and turning off sound on the Watch Siri responds audibly. When setting to \"Headphones Only\", Siri responds audibly when no headphones are connected.\r\n\r\nUpdate on this. After a little more testing I've noticed that simple Siri interactions such as sending an iMessage or setting a reminder to adhere to the Voice Response Settings. Other interactions, such as HomeKit do not. I expect the Voice Response Settings to be a global setting that applies to all Siri interactions."
