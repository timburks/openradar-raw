    description: "Summary:\r\nThe multiple tabs in Xcode nicely support the notion of looking at different code/assets/editors at the same time. Sadly opening files from the navigator will always open the content in the current tab even if another tab has this file already open.\nSafari is more intuitive here because it switches to that tab. That leaves the previous tab alive, giving a better overview and the chance to switch easily between multiple files.\nIn contrast Xcodeâ€™s implementation often ends up in multiple tabs having the same file open - forcing the user to close/go back within the tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- open fileA.swift in tab #1\n- open another tab #2 and open fileB.swift there\n- click on fileA.swift in the navigator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Xcode switches focus to tab #1\n- tab #1 shows fileA.swift, tab #2 shows fileB.swift\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Xcode open fileA.swift in tab #2\n- tab #1 shows fileA.swift *AND* tab #2 shows fileA.swift\n(- complicated way to see fileB.swift again)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSafari in comparison has the more intuitive and helpful approach where it detects wether an URL is already open in a tab and switches to it."
