    description: "NSWindow beginSheet:completionHandler: presents wrong sheet\r\n\r\n\r\n-NSWindow beginSheet:completionHandler: has a serious bug on systems prior to 10.13 \"High Sierra\".\r\nwe can reproduce the bug reliably on 10.10, 10.11 and 10.12.\r\n\r\nbasically the problem is this. if you terminate the sheet shown by the new\r\n-beginSheet:completionHandler:\r\nAPI call with the old method\r\n+NSApp endSheet:\r\ninstead of the new method\r\n-NSWindow endSheet:\r\nthen the next beginSheet:completionHandler: call may present the wrong sheet, not the one that is passed to it, but the previous one.\r\n\r\nhere is the short and obvious version of the bug: https://pastebin.com/bJpWgA2B\r\n\r\nand attached is a complete ZIP archive of a quite minimal Xcode sample exhibiting the issue. running the app shows a sheet. after clicking a button a second sheet is shown. on high-sierra the correct, second sheet is shown - as this is the one passed to beginSheet:. on older systems the first sheet is shown instead which is obviously not what should happen."
