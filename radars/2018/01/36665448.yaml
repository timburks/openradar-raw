    description: "I'd like a web service call that I, as a pass provider, could use to directly insert/update a pass in the user's pass library.\r\n\r\nI'd need API on PKPassLibrary to get an authorization token for the user (and this would only work if the user has an iCloud account enabled), but with this authorization token, I could make a server-to-server call with a pkpass payload that inserts or updates the pass in the library that has the same type identifier + pass serial.\r\n\r\nAs an example of how this could be used, if I buy a movie ticket on Fandango.com, Fandango could use this API to automatically insert my tickets in to my pass library. Ditto for purchasing plane tickets, event tickets, signing up for store accounts, etc.\r\n\r\nThis could really expand the scope of the pass system and make it a lot more user-friendly."
