    description: "I am the author of a Workflow for AlfredApp (https://www.alfredapp.com/) on macOS that integrates with both Apple Maps and Google Maps.\r\n\r\nThe workflow currently permits intermediary waypoints between the origin and destination for Google Maps, but at this time cannot support the same for Apple Maps on MacOS as waypoints in-between the origin and destinations are not supported for directions. Therefore, this request is to add intermediary waypoints for directions on Apple Maps (including in the URL handler scheme), as soon as this is supported, I will migrate it over.\r\n\r\nThe workflow is detailed at https://github.com/stuartcryan/advanced-google-maps-alfred-workflow so you can see what it does and the use case behind it. The issue tracked on my side for this is https://github.com/stuartcryan/advanced-google-maps-alfred-workflow/issues/22 and will track this there until such time as if/when waypoints are available on Apple Maps.\r\n\r\nThanks so much team, greatly appreciated."
