    description: "(Screener: Please redirect to Dev Pubs)\r\n\r\nDocumentation > Foundation > Errors and Exceptions <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/errors_and_exceptions> should provide motivation or explanation of what customizing of error bridging means to a Swift application developer. Alternatively, an article in that section of the documentation or a chapter in the \"Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C\" book would be nice. <https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md> remains the most comprehensive reference for this feature, which is undesirable. I have now at least 3 times encountered a teammate trying to build this feature on their own because they didn't know the standard one existed. This lack of awareness in the community reduces the quality of error-handling by third-party applications on Apple platforms."
