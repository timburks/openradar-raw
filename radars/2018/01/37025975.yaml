    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a XIB or storyboard contains an NSButton that has a title, but the button's image position is set to \"NSImageOnly\" in the XIB, adding a localized strings file for that XIB (base localisation + strings file) will enforce the button's imagePosition to NSImageOver. Apparently, this happens when -[NSButton setTitle:] is called with the localized title, at which point NSButton will change the image position to NSImageOver.\r\nThis is unfortunate, since it won't allow buttons to have imagePosition NSImageOnly initially but still have localized titles (without having to manually overwrite the image position change in viewDidLoad, etc.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open, build and run the attached sample app project \"NSButtonImagePositionBug.xcodeproj\"\r\n- check the button in the center of the main window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- since button properties in XIB are specified as image position \"NSImageOnly\", the button should just display the image, but not the button title \"Button\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- button title \"Button\" is overlayed over the button image\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.12 and macOS 10.13 (have not yet tried other versions of macOS)"
