    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 11 introduced named capture support using the -[NSTextCheckingResult rangeWithName:] API, thanks for that.\n\nIt would be useful to extract all named capture group matches in a dictionary. I wrote this as an extension on NSString (https://stackoverflow.com/a/48309290/235297) but the code is a bit ugly because there's no API to find out the list of named capture groups. I assume this information is already available internally so please provide one add this readonly property on NSTextCheckingResult:\n\nvar namedCaptureGroups: [String : String]? { get }\nReturns a dictionary with all matching named capture groups and their matched values.\n\nAlternatively, the `components` property could be changed to a ` [String : String]?` type so it can return arbitrary string keys in the dictionary, not only the predefined NSTextCheckingKey constants.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
