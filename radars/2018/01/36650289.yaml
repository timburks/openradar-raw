    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen noncontiguous layout is disabled and -[NSFontManager fontPanel:] is called with \"create = true\", then the text view will fail to update itself properly when writing text.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- disable noncontiguous layout on the text view\r\n- create the fontPanel early on (e.g. during applicationDidFinishLaunching)\r\n- enter text into the last line of the text view\r\n- prepend this last line with new lines by hitting enter, moving it down\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- the last line of text would draw 1 line further down with each press of the Enter key\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- the last line of text disappears for a split second, then reappears (in the next drawing pass?) at the expected location\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nmacOS 10.13.2 (17C205)"
