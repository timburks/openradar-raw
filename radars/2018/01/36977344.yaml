    description: "PHLivePhoto request fails to load live-photos with effects (not with default(\"Live\")) from external storages as internal iDevice memory (App's Documents for example), remote server and even from App's bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Take a live-phone\r\n2. Apply any effect you'd like to it\r\n3. Export this live-photo to external storage or remote server\r\n4. Try to load transferred file by function\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc request(withResourceFileURLs fileURLs: [URL], placeholderImage image: UIImage?, targetSize: CGSize, contentMode: PHImageContentMode, resultHandler: @escaping (PHLivePhoto?, [AnyHashable : Any]) -> Swift.Void) -> PHLivePhotoRequestID\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Observe error, you will see\r\n\r\n``` \r\nError: Invalid video metadata\r\n[AnyHashable(\"PHLivePhotoInfoErrorKey\"): Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=-1 \"(null)\", AnyHashable(\"PHLivePhotoInfoCancelledKey\"): 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: for the just live-photos it works great.\r\n\r\n=============== Answer ==================\r\n\r\nPHLivePhoto is meant to represent a photo/video pair. It is displayed in a PHLivePhotoView and can be played by touching it.   A Bounce or Loop is not a Live Photo and is not intended to be displayed as a PHLivePhoto in a PHLivePhotoView. The video should simply be displayed and looped."
