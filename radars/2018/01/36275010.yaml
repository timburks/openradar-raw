    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is unclear how to test SKProductStorePromotionController.\r\nThe article https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in_app_purchase/testing_promoted_in_app_purchases does not mention anything about how to test visibility updates for instance.\r\n\r\nIn our app the calls complete without error but nothing happens, neither with a sandbox user nor with an actual app store user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the article \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in_app_purchase/testing_promoted_in_app_purchases\r\n2. Try to find out how SKProductStorePromotionController is expected to behave with an App Store sandbox user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should mention how SKProductStorePromotionController behaves in sandbox.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no information on this.\r\nAlso not in the headers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn our app we have no success with SKProductStorePromotionController.update(storePromotionVisibility:for:completionHandler:). When trying to hide promoted IAP after a fremium IAP purchase, the completion handler is called without error, but the App Store shows all IAPs nevertheless."
