    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems an unexpected user experience that you can add a tag to a file with UIDocumentBrowserViewController or the Files app from the Share sheet. Why would you use this then there is a separate Tag command in the menu? What does tagging have to do with sharing?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open PDF Viewer (https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-viewer-read-review-annotate/id1120099014?mt=8) or the Files app and find a file somewhere.\n2. Long press the file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo not be confused why I’m given the option to tag a file I chose to share.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can tag a file from the share sheet even though there’s a Tag command right next to Share in the menu.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf this problem was resolved then rdar://36248346 would be resolved as the share sheet could be standard."
