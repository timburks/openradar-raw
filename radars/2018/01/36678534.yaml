    description: "SVG is \"the way\" to deliver cross-platform, scalable vector graphics. There needs to be public API to take and SVG file and render it. Maybe it gives you back a static image, or maybe it gives you a series of CALayers composited together, or something else.\r\n\r\nEither way, this API needs to exist. The fact that iOS developers have had to resort to trying to parse SVG documents using NSXMLParser since iOS 2 is pretty lame, especially considering that the functionality exists in WebKit."
