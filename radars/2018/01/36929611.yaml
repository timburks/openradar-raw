    description: "I'd seen this error in analytics logs before, but never myself. However, it popped up today after starting an ARKit app immediately after powering up an iPhone X.\r\n\r\nHere's the code that displays the alert:\r\n\r\nlet title = NSLocalizedString(\"AR Failure\", comment:\"Augmented Reality failure\")\r\n        \r\n        messageManager.show(message: title)\r\n        arStateImageView.image = #imageLiteral(resourceName: \"ar-unavailable\")\r\n                \r\n        let nse = error as NSError\r\n        \r\n        let failureReason = nse.userInfo[NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey] as? String  ?? \"\"\r\n        let recoverySuggestion = nse.userInfo[NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestionErrorKey] as? String ?? \"\"\r\n        let message = String(format:\"%@\\n\\n%@\\n%@\", error.localizedDescription, failureReason, recoverySuggestion)\r\n        \r\n        let alert = UIAlertController(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n        \r\n        switch nse.code {\r\n        case ARError.Code.cameraUnauthorized.rawValue:\r\n            // Redirect user to settings to fix things\r\n            alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: NSLocalizedString(\"Settings\", comment: \"\"), style: .cancel, handler: { (action:UIAlertAction) in\r\n                \r\n                UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string:\"App-Prefs:root\")!, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)\r\n            }))\r\n        default:\r\n           break\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: NSLocalizedString(\"OK\", comment: \"\"), style: .default, handler: nil))\r\n        \r\n        self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n\r\nThe recoverySuggestion text displayed was \"Make sure that the application has the required privacy settings.\"\r\n\r\nIn this case, the error was unrelated to privacy settings - I retried to start the AR sessions a couple of seconds later and all was fine. I suspect it was related to the timing of starting a session immediately after a cold start on the device.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: revise the recovery suggestion text to suggest waiting and retrying."
