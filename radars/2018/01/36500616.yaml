    description: "I am the author of a Workflow for AlfredApp (https://www.alfredapp.com/) on macOS that integrates with both Apple Maps and Google Maps.\r\n\r\nThe workflow currently permits searching of cycling directions with Google Maps, but at this time cannot support the same for Apple Maps on MacOS as cycling directions are not supported. Therefore, this request is to add cycling directions for Apple Maps, as soon as this is supported, I will migrate it over.\r\n\r\nThe workflow is detailed at https://github.com/stuartcryan/advanced-google-maps-alfred-workflow so you can see what it does and the use case behind it. The issue tracked on my side for this is https://github.com/stuartcryan/advanced-google-maps-alfred-workflow/issues/21 and will track this there until such time as if/when cycling directions are available in Apple Maps.\r\n\r\nThanks so much team, greatly appreciated."
