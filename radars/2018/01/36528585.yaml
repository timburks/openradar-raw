    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMagic Trackpad 2 unresponsive to quick right-to-left swipes, from the right edge of the trackpad. I went to the Apple Store and verified with a technician that this issue is present on multiple brand new Magic Trackpads, and on two separate machines running macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra.\r\n\r\nThis could be a bug in the hardware, firmware, or software. Hopefully not in the hardware itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get any Magic Trackpad 2 and hook it up to any machine running any version of macOS.\r\n2. Put your finger anywhere near the right edge of the trackpad.\r\n3. Swipe quickly from right-to-left.\r\n4. You will see the cursor barely move, after a short delay.\r\n5. This issue is not present when swiping in any other direction on the trackpad, including top-down, left-to-right, and down-up, or when the right-to-left swipe is executed from the middle of the trackpad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe cursor moves around the screen with appropriate velocity.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou will see the cursor barely move, after a short delay.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n10.13.2 (17C205)\r\nMagic Trackpad 2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nApple Store technician verified that this issue is present on multiple brand new Magic Trackpads, and on two separate machines running macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra."
