    description: "Summary:\r\nMail.app hangs while inserting recipients in a new e-mail window.\r\nI'm attaching a screen recording while reproducing the issue, please note that the SBBOD is not visibile on the video but it started at about 2:50.\r\nMacs that are experiencing this issue use three (3) Office 365 Enterprise accounts configured as Exchange accounts with Contacts enabled (please see the attached screenshot for an example). It seems that at a certain point Mail.app hangs while looking up names in the company's GAL (Global Address List) or in the accounts' contact lists. I've been able to reproduce the issue also with two (2) Exchange accounts with Contacts enabled and even with only one (1) account but, in this case, I had to quickly insert many more recipients to trigger the hang.\r\nIn the company I'm currently working for this issue is heavily undermining the feasibility to continue to use the native Mail app as the primary MUA on the top executive management's Macs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compose a new e-mail and start inserting recipients picked up from the company's GAL (see attached video).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app should not hang.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app hangs.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D39a)\r\nMail.app 11.2 (3445.5.20)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll the Macs have Mail Act-On 4.1.3 [1] installed but I tried to uninstall it and Mail.app still hangs.\r\n\r\n[1] https://smallcubed.com/mao/\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nLogs, screenshots and System Profile.zip\r\nMail hang.mov\r\nsysdiagnose_2018.01.19_19-55-40+0100_4088_Mac_OS_X_iMac12-1_17D39a.tar.gz\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Oct 23, 2019 at 8:00 PM\r\nThis is an older report and much has changed since it was filed. If this is still an issue for you on macOS 10.15, please file a new feedback. Thank you."
