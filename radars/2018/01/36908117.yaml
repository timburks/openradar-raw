    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is no documentation explaining how to use the Xcode file and project templates. It is very useful to be able to create our own custom file and project templates. Xcode appears to support custom templates stored in the ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates folder but there is no documentation explaining how it is supposed to work, the format of the xctemplate folder or the TemplateInfo.plist file.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)"
