    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen I collapse all groups in the project using Option+Left Arrow on the root item in the outline view that is the Project Naviator, all items collapse. When I expand the root project item, only its direct descendants become visible as expected. But once I switch to any other Navigator tab and back to the Project Navigator, a lot of groups and sub-groups are expanded again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- collapse groups in Project Navigator\r\n- switch to any other Navigator\r\n- switch back to Project Navigator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- the same outline view items are visible as before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- most groups are expanded even though they were \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)"
