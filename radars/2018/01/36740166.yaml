    description: "Area:\r\nSoftware Update\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D39a) Developer Beta 5 failed to properly shutdown and reboot when updating to macOS 10.3.3 (17D46a) Developer Beta 6.\r\nSince I'm attaching a sysdiagnose that contains the system logs, it may help you to know that I turned the Mac off with the Power button at about Jan 22 16:25.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Update from macOS 10.13.3 Developer Beta 5 to macOS 10.13.3 Developer Beta 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Mac should reboot automatically during the installation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter starting the update from the MAS, the Mac displays the usual modal window with the Apple logo on a grey background, a progress bar and an estimated time remaining to complete the installation. After some time, the screen goes black, the mouse pointer disappears but the Mac never reboots and the user is forced to long press the Power button to turn off the Mac. Then, after turning the Mac on and inserting the password of a user enabled to unlock the FileVault encrypted startup disk, an installation progress window is displayed (please see the attached \"Installation window.jpg\" photo) and the update seems to complete successfully.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D39a)\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D46a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac12,1 --> iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011)\r\nFileVault encrypted HFS+ startup volume\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nInstallation window.jpg\r\nsysdiagnose_2018.01.22_16-50-49+0100_Mac_OS_X_iMac12-1_17D46a.tar.gz\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni\r\nApril 26 2018, 11:27 AM\r\nThis issue has been verified by the developer as resolved."
