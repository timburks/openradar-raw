    description: "Area:\r\nApp Switcher\r\n\r\nSummary: I can cause spring to crash on my iPhone X while switching apps by swiping on the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. start overcast play something. 2. go into workflows and trigger a  workflow that sends a sms. 3. after it finishes and you send the workflow, on the iPhone X, swipe to the right to return to overcast and it stops playing and you see the spinning circle, springboard crash.  My question is is this an ios bug, a workflow bug, or an overcast bug?\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: App switches to overcast\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Springboard crash. Video of the crash attached. https://youtu.be/GEdxIhIl_yk\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iPhone X Verizon iOS 11.2.1 (15C153) Workflow 1.7.7 Overcast 4.0.1 (617)"
