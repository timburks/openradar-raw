    description: "Summary:\r\nAs soon as the user hits the share button on mobile Safari, it automatically sends multiple requests to the server, to receive the apple-touch-icon.png logo for the home screen. This is all valid, however it does offer a potential way for website owners to track when their users share content using the Safari share sheet. By using a custom apple-touch-icon.png name for each user (append some kind of user ID), advertising companies could use that to track their users.\r\n\r\nI personally don't believe this is a high-impact issue, as the possibilities to abuse it are fairly limited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run a local web server with a simple HTML page\r\n1. Open it on the iOS simulator and hit the share button\r\n1. Look at the server logs and see the requests that were just received\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
