    description: "Summary:\r\nWebsites in my history are being removed when I navigate to them from the DuckDuckGo search engine. This does not happen when using Google.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Visit duckduckgo.com\r\n2. Search for \"hacker news\"\r\n3. Click on the top search result (not the wikipedia entry)\r\n4. Wait for the Hacker News page to load\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nnews.ycombinator.com (hacker news) should show up as a visited website in my history.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe DuckDuckGo search page for hacker news shows up in my browser history, but not the site itself. Even more strange, the title for the search page shows the title for hacker news, not DuckDuckGo.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGoogle does this correctly, and I believe removes the search page from history, not the other way around."
