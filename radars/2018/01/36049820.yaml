    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating an archive from an app bundle containing large files, the productbuild tool fails, even though there's more than enough memory and disk space to accommodate the output. If the offending files are removed, the command succeeds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an example macOS project in Xcode 9.2 (I used the \"Game\" template).\r\n\r\n2. Build and export to an app bundle called \"game.app\".\r\n\r\n3. Check that productbuild works as expected by creating a package from game.app:\r\n    productbuild --component game.app /Applications game.pkg\r\n\r\n4. Copy 9500 MB of random data into the app bundle.\r\n    dd if=/dev/urandom of=game.app/Contents/Resources/large.data bs=1024x1024 count=9500\r\n\r\n5. Run productbuild again:\r\n    productbuild --component game.app /Applications game.pkg\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStep 5 succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStep 5 fails with the following message:\r\n    productbuild: error: Can't write temporary package to \"/var/folders/xf/qmcjj_pj6w1881964qmb4s540002kj/T/TemporaryItems/(A Document Being Saved By productbuild)/com.mycompany.game.pkg\" (Cannot write package to \"/var/folders/xf/qmcjj_pj6w1881964qmb4s540002kj/T/TemporaryItems/(A Document Being Saved By productbuild)/com.mycompany.game.pkg\".).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn step 4, if the byte count is lowered to 7500 MB, productbuild succeeds. I haven't determined the exact threshold that triggers the failure."
