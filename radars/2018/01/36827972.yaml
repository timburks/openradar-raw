    description: "This is a dupe of https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5004456819163136. See the original copied below.\r\n\r\nThis definitely gets a +1 from me. In the past, I've gotten similar functionality by implementing a basic HTML parser that supports a limited subset of the HTML spec (mostly <b>/<strong>, <i>/<em>, <u>, <sup>, <sub>) and then included HTML in my localized strings, done the substitution, and then passed that string to the HTML parser, which produces an attributed string I could use in UI. It would be really great if Foundation supported this, so I wouldn't have to do those kinds of shenanigans.\r\n\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nLet’s say you have the string:\r\n\r\n*John Doe* and *1 other* liked this\r\n\r\nThe stuff inside the asterisks should be bolded when shown in a label.\r\n\r\nIdeally, when you’re putting this sort of thing in a strings file, you’d have something like:\r\n\r\n“NAME_AND_OTHERS_LIKED” = “%@ and %@ liked this”;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this sort of string doesn’t play nicely with formatting. I can substitute in the values  (“John Doe” and “1 other”), but there’s no way to know which sub ranges to bold on the attributed string without re-finding those strings, which isn’t totally reliable (because the substituted-in string may appear multiple times, and I can’t reliably infer that it should always be the first one, for example, because the rules of a particular language may enforce a different order).\r\n\r\nWhat would be nice is if I could do (pseudocode):\r\n\r\nNSAttributedString *name = @“John Doe” + bold style;\r\nNSAttributedString *others = @“1 other” + bold style;\r\nNSString *format = NSLocalizedString(“NAME_AND_OTHERS_LIKED”);\r\nNSAttributedString *final = [[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithFormat:format, name, others];\r\n\r\nI’d also like to be able to use another attributed string as the format, so I can have some pre-applied styles and then substitute in some otherly-styled text."
