    description: "Update January 20th, 2018: Apple has marked this on bugreport.apple.com as a duplicate of \"35947309\", which unfortunately does not seem to have an OpenRadar entry. Regardless, this hopefully means that a human has read and acknowledged this bug.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nBasic playback functions within the media player framework cause immense lag/hanging on the main thread.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou must be running a physical device with iOS 11.2 or higher to reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nI have built a project which you can use to reproduce this issue. You can find the project along with more info here: https://github.com/edwinfinch/mediaplayer_lag_ios-11.2_demo\r\n\r\n0. Queue the user's music library using [MPMediaQuery songsQuery] through the system music player controller\r\n1. Play music through the system music player controller\r\n2. Keep track of the current playback time on the main thread and notice the immense lag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe main thread should not hang. It doesn't hang in iOS versions below 11.2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe main thread hangs for up to 12 seconds.\r\nYouTube video demonstrating this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlKdZIIoMu0\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n* XCode version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n* iOS version 11.2.1 (15C153)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n* Almost 4000 songs in media library, however this issue is reproducible on any size of media library. As well, even with the same sized media library, this issue did not occur on iOS versions below 11.2.\r\n* Music.app is still installed and was never uninstalled.\r\n* Music permission properly granted and never changed."
