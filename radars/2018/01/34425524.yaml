    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Safari has a lot of open tabs, it will hang for a few seconds when opening and closing a tab. Not always, but a few times every day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a lot of tabs open in Safari and open/close tabs throughout the day.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpening/closing the tabs should be instant.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari will often hang when opening a new tab or closing an existing one. The time Safari spends being unresponsive seems to be proportional to the number of tabs. 50 tabs is enough to _definitely_ notice it. 200 is enough to go into the Activity Monitor to take a sample (it hangs for about 20 seconds on my 2016 15\" MacBook Pro).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.0 (13604.1.38.1.6)\r\nIt also happened with every single version of Safari with Sierra.\r\nI've tried a few clean installs since then and also used a 2015 13\" MacBook Pro for more than a week while mine was being repaired and I didn't notice the same slowdowns.\r\n\r\nAfter I took a sample, I saw that it really did have a link with the Touch Bar (AFAICT), so I looked into disabling Touch Bar support for Safari but it's not supported (it would if I disabled SIP to change the binary but ugh no thanks).\r\n\r\nStill happens in Safari 11.0.2 (13604.4.7.1.3)"
