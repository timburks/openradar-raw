    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen adding many (>~1k) annotations to an MKMapView, zooming in and then zooming out, some of the annotation views will consistently render as invisible (annotationView.layer.isHidden == true). The issue is fixed by manually changing the annotation view's layer.isHidden to `false`. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n(See sample project) - Add many annotations to a map view (sample project adds 10k). Zoom in such that only ~10 views are visible. Possibly adjust the pitch of the map (place two fingers on the map and drag up). Zoom out such that ~100 are visible. Pan/zoom around and note that some of the annotations have disappeared (easy to view in the sample project, as items in the annotation grid will be obviously missing). \r\n\r\nYou can also check out the view debugger to see that the annotations have a frame-space in the view, but are invisible. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat annotations are rendered accurately and consistently, and are never made to be hidden unexpectedly. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAnnotation views are made to be hidden unexpectedly and seemingly randomly. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.5 (15D60)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nReproduced on iPhone 8 Plus and other devices"
