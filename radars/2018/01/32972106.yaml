    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening the attached ePub, iBooks on iPad (latest update of iOS 10) shows an empty page with nothing but the empty progress bar at the bottom. Strangely, the book index does display correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter adding this ePub to the library, previously imported ePubs that opened correctly before will also start behaving the same way as described above. Deleting the attached ePub from the library restores functionality again.\r\n\r\nThe ePub file seems to be valid and displays without problems in iBooks 4.8 under iOS 9.3.2 and on latest iBooks on OS X Sierra.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nImport ePub below from email or web.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to view ePub content pages.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAn empty 'reading' screen is presented, without text or page numbers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niBooks 4.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad, latest iOS 10 version, latest iBooks version.\r\nComments"
