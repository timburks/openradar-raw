    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UIReferenceLibraryViewController is presented as a popover and then multitasking/split screen forces the view controller to be presented full screen, there is no way to dismiss the UIReferenceLibraryViewController apart from going back into full screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Launch an app on an iPad that presents a UIReferenceLibraryViewController as a popover.\r\n- Initiate multitasking and split the screen such that the UIReferenceLibraryViewController is now presented modally.\r\n- Notice that there is no means to dismiss the UIReferenceLibraryViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould expect \"Done\" button to appear in the top right corner of the UIReferenceLibraryViewController when the presentation style changes. Note that if we do this in reverse starting with full screen presentation as going to a popover that the \"Done\" button remains.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Done\" button does not appear and use must exit split screen to dismiss the UIReferenceLibraryViewController.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nConfirmed in iOS 11, perhaps others."
