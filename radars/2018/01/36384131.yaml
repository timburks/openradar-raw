    description: "Area:\r\nCore Graphics\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn CoreText’s implementation of the AAT ‘morx’ table, rearrangement verbs get ignored when the variable-length part of the marked sequence is empty. This behavior does not match the ‘morx’ specification, which says that ‘x’ represents an arbitrary sequence of glyphs. It’s not 100% clear from the spec whether ‘arbitrary sequence’ includes zero-length sequences, but it would certainly make sense to interpret the spec this way — other implementations (eg. fontkit) have taken this path. (It might be worth clarifying the spec).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the Unicode text rendering test suite [https://github.com/unicode-org/text-rendering-tests] and check test case MORX-4: [https://rawgit.com/unicode-org/text-rendering-tests/master/reports/CoreText.html#MORX-4]. The test fonts are linked from the test descriptions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests should pass, as they do with fontkit: [https://rawgit.com/unicode-org/text-rendering-tests/master/reports/fontkit.html#MORX-4]\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTests for CoreText are failing. See [https://rawgit.com/unicode-org/text-rendering-tests/master/reports/CoreText.html#MORX-4] for test report.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 (16G1114)"
