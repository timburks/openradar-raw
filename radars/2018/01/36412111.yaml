    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nModification of a member of a collection that is itself a lazy instance variable causes the collection to be copied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere is a sample Xcode project at https://github.com/cmyr/swift-lazy-perf\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nModification of the collection should be in-place.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe collection is copied before each write. If the collection is not trivially small, frequent modifications significantly degrade application performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 (16G1114)"
