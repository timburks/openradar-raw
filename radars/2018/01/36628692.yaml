    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\n\nWould you like to crash the window server? I will tell you how.\n\nOpen the attached project. In Main.storyboard, you will find a View Controller scene. It has a view hierarchy with a stack view labeled “Root Stack”. The root stack contains two container views and some other stuff.\n\nFind NSPredicateEditor in the Object library and drag it to the root stack, just after the nested stack view, before the second container view.\n\nXcode now makes a very very large view. Then your monitor(s) turn black. Then you are shown the login screen.\n\nI will also attach a window server crash report for your amusement.\n\nLove,\nRob\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do that stuff I said above.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA predicate editor (which we should call a preditor for short).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash. Or, if you make the View Controller scene narrower, maybe not crash, but a 10000-point tall view, which is also suboptimal.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b) / macOS 10.12.6 (16G1114)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
