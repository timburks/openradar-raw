    description: "Summary: iPads permanently fixed outside conference rooms in our office building. Using <name removed> app in Guided Access mode. Powered via Power over Ethernet and WPA2 wireless profile distributed via <MDM name removed>. If Cisco wireless LAN controllers are rebooted for code maintenance, iPads often do not grab the wireless network after the controllers fully come back up. Confirmed this occurs on iOS 10 to latest iOS 11.2.5. DHCP leases are set for 24 hours but the network dropping doesn't seem to coincide with the DHCP request. iPhones running iOS 10-iOS 11.2.5 do not seem to have any issue but they are not static devices and they are not in Guided Access mode either.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Reboot Cisco WLC, in morning handful of iPads all show as being down since the outage. Go to iPad, turn off Guided Access, and no wireless network is selected or connected. Open up Settings... and go to wireless and the iPad connects back to the profile with no issues. Finally, put iPad back in Guided Access mode and iPad functions as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: iPad should be able to connect back to the access point via DHCP even if in Guided Access mode. If the AP or WLC goes down during an outage, the iPads should connect back after everything comes back up.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: iPad doesn't connect back up to wireless network while in Guided Access mode after network outage.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Occurring on iOS 10 through iOS 11.2.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iOS 10 through iOS 11.2.5. iPad Air and iPad 5th generation devices being powered via Power over Ethernet. WPA2 wireless profile distributed via <MDM name removed>. <app name and versions removed>."
