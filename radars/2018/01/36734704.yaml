    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nCurrently, the layout of title and buttons on UINavigationBar is bad when back button title is long but not too long. The title is pushed by the back button to the right so no longer centered. Run the sample app on iPhone 6 in portrait mode to see the issue.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, when back button title is too long, back button's title will be automatically \"shortened\" to \"Back\". Change the mast view controller's title to \"Master View Controller with Long Title\" and run the sample app again to see.\r\n\r\nI think the title should be always centered.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!tWx2xI4Y!r2Foy6ZmZdP9HMgGL3oQxMf_BjzSdOZVwPzmoNemtMI"
