    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I set year to a value smaller than the passed in date's year the result is nil, if bigger the date is reset to Jan 1 and time to 12 AM.\r\n\r\nI cannot make sense of it. I think it is buggy. I didn't try other usages.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!ZOg21Aha!semx5pKUpa-WrJO5VDUNifGqujv2d-8OZ1QnxNAG-OI"
