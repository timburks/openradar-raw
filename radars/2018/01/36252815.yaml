    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new iOS 11 App Store shows a very prominent “Family Sharing” entry in the Supports section. This is great for many apps, but until non-consumable IAPs support Family Sharing this is very confusing for customers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAccess an App Store page of a Freemium app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDoesn’t show Supports Family Sharing if the app requires IAPs to fully work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n“Family Sharing” entry in the “Supports” section\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving the Family Sharing entry is only a work around. I’d prefer if you add Family Sharing support for IAPs. radr://36252701"
