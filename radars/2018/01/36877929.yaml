    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a UINavigationBar with prompt, when a view controller (also with prompt) is pushed, the navigation bar doesn't animate the title and back button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen \"Push\" is tapped, the navigation bar should animate its content. When going back, the content should be animated likewise.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNeither content is animated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen the prompt is removed, the animation works as usual.\r\n\r\nAlso, a CGPostError is thrown (I've enabled a break point for that) and an error is logged:\r\n\r\n[Unknown process name] CGAffineTransformInvert: singular matrix.\r\n\r\nThis worked fine in iOS 10.3."
