    description: "Summary:\r\nI commute daily on a train, and though I’d love to keep it turned on with the default “Automatically”, I had to switch it to “When Connected to Car Bluetooth” because it would activate all the time on the train. Frustratingly, I’ll manually deactivate it, but if I get up, go to the bathroom and go back to my seat, it turns back on. I kept it on automatic for a while hoping there was some ML around when I deactivate it, but it appears there isn’t\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set DND while driving to activate “Automatically”\r\n2. Board an Amtrak train going north along the Hudson River from Penn Station (or vise-versa)\r\n3. Receive text message\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS figures out I’m on a train by any one of the following:\r\n1. It sees the Amtrak’s wi-fi network with continuous high signal strength\r\n2. It’s aware I’m actively using my MacBook\r\n3. It sees that I’ve been walking around while moving forward upwards of 40 MPH\r\n4. My position is moving along a set of tracks that show up as such in Maps\r\n5. Through some machine learning, it sees that I deactivate it manually under any of the scenarios above\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDND while driving repeatedly messages people telling them that I’m driving\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
