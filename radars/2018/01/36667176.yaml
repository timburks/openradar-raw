    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWallet.app does not show the \"Copy to {app}\" action for apps that accept pass data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n• Create an app that imports the \"com.apple.pkpass\" and \"com.apple.pkpass-data\" UTIs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n• When sharing a pass from Wallet.app, there's an action in the share sheet to \"copy to {app}\", because the app supports importing the kind of data that Wallet is sharing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n• The action is missing.\r\n• DTS does not know why it is missing (TSI #677562293)\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n• If I mail a pass to myself, I see the action show up when I try to share the attachment from Mail\r\n• If I bring up the \"Add Pass\" screen in Mail and then look at the actions from that screen, the action is missing.\r\n• Attached is a sample iOS app that defines the necessary configuration, according to QA1587 (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1587/_index.html).\r\n• I determined the UTIs used by Wallet by creating an Action extension and introspecting the NSExtensionItems passed to the extension. I want to avoid using an extension because it's an extra step in my app's workflow I don't need."
