    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `accept` attribute of an `<input type=\"file\">` restricts which file types may be selected in an HTML form. This does not work properly on iOS, both in Safari and UIWebView/WKWebView. A value of \"application/pdf\" should only allow PDF files, but iOS allows all file types. A value of \"image/jpeg, application/pdf\" should allow JPEG and PDF files, but iOS only allows JPEG files. This is especially problematic, as users now cannot select PDF files, while that should be possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open this example form in iOS (Safari/UIWebView/WKWebView): https://jsfiddle.net/Lcv9mznf/4/\r\n2. Tap \"Choose File\" for the three inputs\r\n3. Choose \"Browse\" to select a file from the system file picker\r\n4. Navigate to an iCloud Drive folder containing various types of files (JPEG, PDF, â€¦)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- First input (\"image/jpeg\"): Only JPEG files can be selected\r\n- Second input (\"application/pdf\"): Only PDF files can be selected\r\n- Third input (\"image/jpeg, application/pdf\"): Only JPEG and PDF files can be selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- First input (\"image/jpeg\"): Only JPEG files can be selected (correct)\r\n- Second input (\"application/pdf\"): All file types can be selected (INCORRECT)\r\n- Third input (\"image/jpeg, application/pdf\"): Only JPEG files can be selected (INCORRECT)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested on iOS 11.2.2 (15C202)\r\nThe bug has been present at least since iOS 9: https://stackoverflow.com/q/35195983/251760\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7 Plus (MN4M2ZD/A)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe exact same issue also occurs when selecting files from Dropbox:\r\nhttps://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Manage-account/Dropbox-does-not-properly-support-HTML-input-accept-types-on-iOS/td-p/161522\r\nInitially, I though it was a bug in the Dropbox file picker. However, now it also occurs with iCloud Drive, I suspect it is an issue between WebKit and UIDocumentPickerViewController.\r\nA similar issue seems to occur with Google Drive: rdar://24187873"
