    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iPhone SE (the only iPhone I find comfortable to use) in portrait the share sheet shown by UIDocumentBrowserViewController and the Files app does not fit without going into the status bar space. No actual content is clipped but this looks bad.\n\nThis happens regardless of text size. I’ve attached a screen shot showing the largest non-accessibility text size setting.\n\nAs you can see, if the text size is large enough the content scrolls anyway, so there’s no excuse for going under the status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iPhone SE open PDF Viewer (https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-viewer-read-review-annotate/id1120099014?mt=8) or the Files app and find a file somewhere\n2. Long press on the file\n3. Tap Share\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSheet should stay under status bar in the y-direction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSheet goes under status bar in the z-direction.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
