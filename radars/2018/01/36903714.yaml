    description: "Summary:\r\n- Messages.app on macOS does not store and retrieve stored passwords for Jabber/XMPP accounts properly in the Keychain.\r\n- When creating a Jabber/XMPP account in Messages.app, a Keychain entry is incorrectly created for \"a@b.com@b.com\" instead of \"a@b.com\". Manually correcting this to \"a@b.com\" in the Keychain does not fix the issue either.\r\n- When Messages.app connects to the Jabber/XMPP server, the user is prompted for their account password every time, regardless of whether the password was remembered or stored in the keychain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install macOS Server and enable Messages.\r\n- Either log into macOS Server in Internet Accounts, enabling the Messages feature, or manually create a Jabber/XMPP account.\r\n- Set status to Online. The user will be prompted for their password. Check the box to remember password.\r\n- The next time you set status to Online, i.e. after closing Messages.app or restarting the system, the user is incorrectly prompted for the password again and the Keychain entry is ignored.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The user should not be prompted for the saved Jabber/XMPP password when setting their status to Online.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The password is stored in the Keychain against the wrong username.\r\n- The user is incorrectly prompted for their password every time they set their status to Online, even if the password supplied when configuring the account or remembering the password is correct.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Server running Messages on macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, with other macOS Messages.app clients also running macOS High Sierra 10.13.2."
