    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building the project with command line xcodebuild build-for-testing and then running tests separate with xcodebuild test-without-building code coverage profile is not generated. \nBecause we are tracking code coverage in tests it prevents us from splitting building and testing between multiple machines.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build sample project from command line:\nxcodebuild -scheme Codecov -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 8,OS=11.3' -enableCodeCoverage YES build-for-testing\n2. Run tests from produced .xctestrun file:\nxcodebuild -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 8,OS=11.3' -enableCodeCoverage YES -xctestrun /path/to/DerivedData/Codecov-azxfrlmhznktvjavwttdxmosuzdn/Build/Products/Codecov_iphonesimulator11.0-x86_64.xctestrun test-without-building\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. Code coverage profile data is generated inside same place as when running tests from Xcode (/path/to/DerivedData/Codecov-azxfrlmhznktvjavwttdxmosuzdn/Build/ProfileData/<UUID>/Coverage.profdata)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. Code coverage profile is not generated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.3 Beta\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to be broken at least from Xcode 9.0.1 to the latest Xcode 9.3 Beta (9Q98q)"
