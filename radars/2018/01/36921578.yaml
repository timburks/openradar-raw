    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's a typo in some of the help text when editing a record in the CloudKit dashboard. It's very minor, but I suspected that for exactly that reason, no one might have reported it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to the CloudKit dashboard for an iOS app at icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard.\r\n- Go to the development data section.\r\n- Create a record type.\r\n- Make the record type queryable.\r\n- Create a record of that type.\r\n- Query for records of that type in the Records tab.\r\n- Click on the record name to open the \"Editing Record\" sidebar for that record.\r\n- Expand the \"Security Roles\" section of the sidebar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe help text stating that there are no security roles should say 'This environment has no custom security roles.'\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe help text says 'This environmnent has no custom security roles.' Note the spelling of the word 'environmnent'.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
