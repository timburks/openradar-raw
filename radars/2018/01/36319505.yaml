    description: "Area:\r\nCalendar\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSome dates returned by -[NSCalendar nextDateAfterDate:...] methods are incorrectly skipping ahead to leap years in iOS 11.2. The same methods called in iOS 11.1 when using NSCalendarMatchStrictly return the expected values. All results using NSCalendarMatchNextTime seem to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall one of the -[NSCalendar nextDateAfterDate:...] methods with a start date in February 2018 that looks for the next matching date with a day component less than the start date.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA day in March 2018.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA day in February 2020. The enumerated method returns dates in 2020, 2024, 2028, etc.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n*Xcode project file attachment"
