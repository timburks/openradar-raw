    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen getting walking directions in a city like NY (especially over AirPods or Apple Watch), it’s not very helpful to hear how many miles or feet away, whereas knowing that you’re taking a turn in X number of blocks would be SUPER helpful\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart walking guidance in New York City\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen a turn comes up, the guidance would advise “turn left in 2 blocks”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen a turn comes up, the guidance would advises “turn left in 860 feet”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12\r\n\r\nNotes:"
