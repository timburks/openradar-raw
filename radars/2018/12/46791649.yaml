    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a dependent project configures the product name and thus the resulting file name of a dylib to be different for debug and release when linking into a parent project the wrong filename can be chosen.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Switching to the legacy build system works around this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up two Xcode projects, both for MacOS dylibs, I named mine \"Test_Parent\" and \"Test_Child\".\r\n2. Add a single cpp source file to each, default content is fine.\r\n2. Nest them such that the parent depends on the child, i.e. \"target dependency\" and \"link binary with libraries\".\r\n3. Build, you should see both child and parent build successfully and link correctly.\r\n4. Edit the child project such that for debug configuration the Product Name is test_debug, and for release configuration the Product Name is test_release.\r\n5. Build for release, note everything works fine.\r\n6. Switch the scheme to debug, note that while compilation is correct (both compile as debug), when linking test_release is used, which cannot be found.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe correct file name for the child should be determined by evaluating the correct configuration at link time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe linker selects the wrong file name.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61)"
