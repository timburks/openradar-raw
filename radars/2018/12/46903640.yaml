    description: "Summary: \r\nSwitching between App X and Messages App, can result in an incorrect `UIResponder.keyboardIsLocalUserInfoKey` value from the `userInfo` dict of the `UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification`. App X is checking if the keyboard notification is local or not, if it is not local then App X should not do anything.\r\n\r\nPreRequisites:\r\n* Apps X and and Messages are both launched.\r\n* Apps X is checking for local keyboard notifications.\r\n* Messages has a keyboard being displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Switch from App X to Messages.\r\n2. Switch Back to App X from Messages.\r\n3. Repeat steps 1-2 until reproed. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp X's method for handling keyboard notifications should return early as the notification is not local.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp X's method checks the `UIResponder.keyboardIsLocalUserInfoKey` and receives a value of `true` and continues to execute its code.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.2\r\niPhone 8 - 11.4.1 (15G77)\r\niPhone X Simulator - iOS 12.1\r\niPhone 8 Simulator - iOS 12.1"
