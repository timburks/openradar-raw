    description: "Summary: \r\nCreating an AVAsset from an mp4 has an incorrect duration. The attached documents include two screenshots showing the duration difference. An example mp4 is also attached.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAVAsset *customPlayerAsset = [AVURLAsset URLAssetWithURL:target options:@{\r\n    AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey : @(YES)\r\n}];\r\nAVPlayerItem *playerItem = [AVPlayerItem playerItemWithAsset:customPlayerAsset];\r\n/* later, once asset is fully loaded */\r\nCMTimeGetSeconds(playerItem.duration); // typically about double the correct amount\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe duration reflects the length of the audio file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe duration is reported to be about twice the length, and playing the asset results in no audio after the correct mark.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1, macOS 10.14.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIncorrect on any iOS config. macOS' QuickTime, and Safari show incorrect information too. Google Chrome, and part of QuickLook show correct information on macOS.\r\n\r\nAdditional Info: https://gist.github.com/leptos-null/052156a3ea4a2d8191afab9ac0eca22a"
