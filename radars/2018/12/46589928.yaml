    description: "Area:\r\niBook / Author\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niBooks on the Mac does not honor the keys Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End. According to the online docs, they should work on \"expanded interactive media\". But I don't see why they shouldn't work for normal text pages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a normal EPUB ebook. Press Page Up, Page Down, Home, or End keys. Nothing happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I would expect to advance a page, go back a page, go to the beginning of the chapter, and go to the end of the chapter, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: Home and End keys produce a beep. Page Up and Down keys don't do anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: version 1.16 (1636.1)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: default"
