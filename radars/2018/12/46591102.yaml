    description: "Summary:\r\nCrash logs on device that show too many wakeups are not symbolicated. Trying to do it with symbolicatecrash command fails even with correct symbols available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a crashlog from device that shows number of wakeups during some period of time\n2. Try to read it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. It should be symbolicated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. It is not fully symbolicated.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTrying out manual symbolication with symbolicatecrash command does not help:\nDEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/ /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTFoundation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/symbolicatecrash not_symbolicated.crash path/to/dSYMs > symbolicated_crash.crash\n\nSome of the methods in the stacktrace just contains UUID of library:\n2  ??? (<2151A33A-068D-37FE-ACB5-02E0BB7DA9D8> + 264960) [0x103758b00]\n\nIt’s possible to edit the crashlog to make it work with symbolicatecrash:\n1. Find what library each UUID corresponds to (from other crash logs or symbols)\n2. Replace corresponding <UUID> with name of the framwork in the crash log (e.g. <2151A33A-068D-37FE-ACB5-02E0BB7DA9D8> -> avs)\n3. Add framework name and path in “Binary Images” section at the end of the crashlog\n4. Run symbolicatecrash as outlined above\n\nAttaching three crash logs: original, after fixing and after symbolication. Attaching symbols for avs and Wire to allow symbolication."
