    description: "A FinderSync app extension allows users to invoke functionality on items in the Finder from the Finder's contextual menu. Users report that when the app extension is active, screenshot files take upwards of 10 seconds to appear on the Desktop, instead of less than 2 seconds without the app extension. Investigation has confirmed this, and reveals that this happens with any file being created on the Desktop, e.g. via \"touch ~/Desktop/foo\", and not just screenshots. At least one user has reported that this interferes with a previous workflow.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached that will help illustrate the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Build and run the attached \"DeskDelay\" project.\r\n2) Click the \"Create file on Desktop\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA file named \"DeskDelay <timestamp>\" appears almost immediately on the desktop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file does not appear for several (>10) seconds.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.4 (17E202)\r\nFinder version 10.13.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n1) It was discovered by accident that the delay does not occur when a \"Recent Items\" Finder window is open.\r\n2) Modifying the enclosed project as indicated on line 25 of FinderSync.swift to register only the top-level visible folders (e.g. \"/Applications\", \"/Library\", \"/System\", and \"/Users\") also seems to eliminate the delay but introduces other issues; for example, the menu item does not appear when right-clicking on desktop volumes representing mounted disk images."
