    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen drawing an image with semitransparent pixels in a PDF context the color blending is wrong/unexpected, leading to too dark or desaturated colors. Opaque and fully transparent pixels are handled correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen attached playground\r\nRun playground.\r\nScroll to the bottom and compare the images „expectedResult“ to \r\n„pdfResult1“ or „pdfResult2“\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npdfResult1 and pdfResult2 should look like expectedResult\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe blended colors in second and third column of each grid look too dark and grey\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOne theory about this is that premultiplied alpha is somehow not respected in the blending process.\r\n\r\nAlso please play around with the variable backgroundColor in the playground. If you set it to red, the top row of each grid should render completely red, as the grids top row colors are plain red with varying alpha.\r\n\r\nI think the same applies to CoreGraphics of iOS 12 SDK."
