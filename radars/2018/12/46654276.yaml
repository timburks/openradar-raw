    description: "Summary:\r\nThe application crashes with an EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception when calling the following with an non-existing class name:\r\nClass myClass = [[NSBundle mainBundle] classNamed:@\"NonExistingClass\"];\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, it should return nil and should not cause an exception.\r\nThis happens with Swift application calling Objective-C framework.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce it, the Swift application must call an Objective-C method that calls the following code where the given string represents a non-existing class.\r\nSee the configuration section below and see the attached demo application.\r\nClass myClass = [[NSBundle mainBundle] classNamed:@\"NonExistingClass\"];\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application should not crash. The method should return nil because the class does not exist in the Bundle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception is raised\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt happens with the following configuration:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61), the error does not happen with Xcode 10.0.\r\niOS version: The application must be running on an iOS 11 device (tested on iPhone 6S iOS 11.4(15F79)). The problem does not occur on the simulator and it does not happen on iOS 12 devices.\r\nThe application project must be implemented in Swift.\r\nThe code calling the method classNamed on NSBundle must be written in Objective-C."
