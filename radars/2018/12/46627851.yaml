    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading from High Sierra to Mojave, I could suddenly not edit my Photos projects anymore. I understand that ordering print products isn't possible anymore but why don't you let us edit the projects at least?\r\n\r\nI had to setup a new machine using High Sierra and restore a Time Machine backup from Photos just to make some last minute changes before ordering calendars.\r\n\r\nThe new option to \"Convert\" projects to a third party app project is not really useful because there's no third party app supporting German calendars.\r\n\r\nPlease add back the editing functionality for projects. Just because you stopped your printing service it doesn't mean the functionality is no longer needed!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n4.0 (3421.5.230)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
