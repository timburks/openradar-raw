    description: "Summary:\r\nThe alignment rectangle insets should render in the Asset Catalog so that a designer can see visually how the rectangle insets work.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no visual overlay like the slicing overlay.\r\n\r\nPreview doesn't match the position of the iPhone simulator when alignment rectangle insets are used in Storyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an image with visual flair (Tip Callout) uses a 7 point arrow on the bottom to point to a label\r\n2. Open Attribute inspector for image in Asset Catalog\r\n3. Set the Alignment Inset to be 7 on the bottom\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should see a visual rectangle for these insets\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI don't see any live preview and I don't know if it works\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: Don't use alignment rectangles in storyboard, instead shift the content's alignment using offsets added to constraints, which do appear in Storyboard canvas and preview.\r\n\r\nThere should be some kind of rectangle region drawn for the alignment rectangle when changing insets for content, so the designer can verify it matches what they expect.\r\n\r\nAlignment rectangle editing is not useful if you cannot visualize the change on the Asset Catalog, Storyboard Canvas, or Preview.\r\n\r\nFor example with a \"tip callout\" visual element that has an arrow\r\nThe bottom arrow is 7 points tall.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMojave 10.14"
