    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCopying a 4k@60 FPS video to the filesystem (the desktop, for example) causes the file size to be reduced and the codec to change to H.264. If I Airdrop the file from my iPhone X, it seems to stay in its original format, with a resulting file that's 3x as big and says it's still in HEVC when I view the info panel for the file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Record 4k@60 HEVC video on iPhone\r\n2. In Photos settings on iPhone, make sure that \"Transfer to Mac or PC\" is set to \"Keep Originals\"\r\n3. Airdrop the video to a Mac running Mojave\r\n4. On the Mac, download the same video from the Photos app to somewhere on the Mac's filesystem\r\n5. In Finder, view Info for both video files by highlighting them and pressing command+i\r\n\r\nNote that the file downloaded from the photos app is smaller and is in H.264, rather than HEVC.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo downloaded from Photos should be in HEVC with no quality or file size reduction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo downloaded from Photos (copied to desktop) is converted to H.264 and is 1/3 the size of what was AirDropped.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMojave 10.14\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Xs 64 GB\r\nLate 2013 MacBook Pro with Nvidia 750m dedicated GPU"
