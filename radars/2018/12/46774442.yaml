    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Info.plist of the ResultBundle as generated by xcodebuild is missing some data that at least in Xcode 9 (e.g. Xcode 9.4, Build version 9F1027a) where present. More specifically, the \"xcodebuild build\" command for a project that has errors, no longer lists the \"target\" where the error occurred.\r\n\r\nUnzip the attached \"project-with-build-errors.zip\" for a sample project\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* In the terminal, change directory to `project-with-build-errors`\r\n* Run the following command\r\n\r\nxcodebuild -project project-with-build-errors.xcodeproj -scheme project-with-build-errors -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' clean build -derivedDataPath ./DerivedData -resultBundlePath ./ResultBundle\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe `ResultBundle/Info.plist` to include a \"target\" entry for each Item under the \"ErrorSummaries\" Array.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe `ResultBundle/Info.plist` is missing a \"target\" entry\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n* Xcode 10.1, Build version 10B61\r\n* Xcode 10.0, Build version 10A255\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.2"
