    description: Barcode format fallback logic (barcodes key in pass.json file) doesn't work on watchOS 5.x (including latest watchOS 5.1.2) as described in https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html (Barcodes Link Passes to Your Records section). We have two barcode formats in the list, PKBarcodeFormatCode128 (to display in Wallet on iPhone) and PKBarcodeFormatAztec (as fallback for Apple Watch). On watchOS 4.x Wallet displays Aztec barcode as expected, but on watchOS 5.x barcode isn't displayed.
