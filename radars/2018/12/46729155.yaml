It will still be conected and have a valid IP address but no apps/sites will work until unplugging the usb-c adapter. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWiFi continues to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConnection drops out and although it will have a valid IP address it will not pass traffic/load sites until the adapter is disconnected.
