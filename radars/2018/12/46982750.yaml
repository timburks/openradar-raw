    description: "I'm in a messaging group on Apple Messages. The messaging group has multiple emojis in the group title.\r\n\r\nWhen I ask HomePod to read my latest messages, as it's reading messages from the group it announces the name of the group I'm in so that I know the message source. When announcing the group name, HP announces emojis in the group name. There are about five emojis in this particular group name IIRC, and HP describes each one, which is quite annoying.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if maybe the HomePod could skip describing emojis in group names. Or if that's not feasible because it would introduce ambiguities, perhaps there's some other solution?"
