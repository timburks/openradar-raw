    description: "Summary:\r\nDragging and dropping images used to reliably place them into the camera roll. For large quantities of images it would take some time, but they would still appear. Now the drag and drop action fails regularly for even two images and sometimes fails even dragging in one at a time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect 50 images\nDrag and drop them onto the simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n50 images appear in camera roll\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n0 images appear in camera roll\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
