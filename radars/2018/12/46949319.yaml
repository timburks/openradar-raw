    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you attempt to buy an IAP from an app, you get prompted to confirm your IAP (e.g. you get an alert with the title 'Subscription Terms' and two options 'Continue' and 'Cancel'). If you select 'Cancel', your transactions observer will receive a transaction with an error with SKError.paymentCancelled, which is expected. But, if you press remote MENU button (which is essentially the same as selecting 'Cancel'), transactions observer will receive a transaction with an error with SKError.unknown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to purchase an IAP\r\n2. Sign In with a Sandbox iTunes Account, if needed\r\n3. When 'Subscription Terms' alert is prompted, press on remote MENU button\r\n4. Done\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The error returned by StoreKit to the transactions observer should correspond to a 'payment cancelled' error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The error returned by StoreKit to the observer is an 'unknown' error."
