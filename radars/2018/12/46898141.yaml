    description: "Summary:\r\nI tried to add a new Embedded Binary to our project, and failed miserably. See attached video. Xcode 10.1 (10B61) with Mojave 10.14.2 (18C54). This is not a new bug, but it’s increasingly more painful the larger our project grows.\n\nI managed to add the binary after waiting 20 minutes for processing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave a large project, open, try to add a linked framework or embedded binary while it’s indexing/processing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTree shouldn’t close itself all the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s painful and almost hilarious. See the video :)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks for caring!"
