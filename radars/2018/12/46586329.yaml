    description: "Area:\r\nVideoToolbox\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nQuickTime struggles to reproduce the correct red color when using hardware decoding. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFind a video footage with high contrast between the red color and the background. Then you can see there are chroma artifacts near the edges. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBelow is the same video footage opened in mpv with ffmpeg using software decoding. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are chroma artifacts near the edges. The same or even worse result (see mpv with videotoolbox.png) can be seen in mpv using hardware decoding (essentially videotoolbox).\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nQuickTime Player Version 10.5 (928.50)\r\nmpv 0.29.1 with ffmpeg 4.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS Mojave on MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016). The issue seems not existing in older version systems."
