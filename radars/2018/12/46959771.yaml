    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Portuguese translation for \"New Shared Album\" is either wrong or displayed (word wrapping) incorrectly using iOS 12 on iPhone (X) and iPad (Pro 2018) resulting in a wrong interface (duplicate options).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Set the language to Portuguese\r\n2 - Navigate to Photos - Albuns\r\n3 - Touch + (Create)\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots in Portuguese/English.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe strings \"New Album\" and \"New Shared Album\" are different: \"Novo Album\" and \"Novo Album Compartilhado\" (maybe it is an UI/UIKit problem and the string is word wrapping).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe strings are equal (two \"Novo Album\" options) so this specific localization (or UI/UIKit problem) makes the UI confusing/unusable.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.1.2 (16C101)"
