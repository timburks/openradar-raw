    description: "It doesn't make sense that the UITextField.text attribute is a `String?`.\r\n\r\n    let newRange = Range(range, in: textField.text!)\r\n\r\nIt should be non-optional, because even when you set it to `nil` it's reverted back to \"\".\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nIt makes programming with UITextField's confusing to developers.\r\n\r\nA developers first experience with Swift is that there's a ton of optionals ... and there isn't a good best practice to avoiding them ... especially when they're completely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nShould I unwrap it? Can it ever be nil?\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure, but I'm pretty sure it can't, so I force unwrap the value to work with it, which is annoying.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42861115/why-is-uitextfield-text-an-optional"
