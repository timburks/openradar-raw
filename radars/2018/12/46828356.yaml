    description: "Summary:\r\n- (NSCachedURLResponse *)cachedResponseForRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request returns nil for UIWebView in iOS 12. \nIn iOS 11 it returns a valid cached response.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn UIWebView delegate method webViewDidFinishLoad: add the following code:\n\nNSCachedURLResponse *cachedResponse = [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] cachedResponseForRequest:webView.request];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\ncachedResponse contains a non-nil http response object with a status code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ncachedResponse is nil.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A366)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur real use case is that we have an SDK that tracks the network requests/responses in apps.\n\nTo track UIWebView we swizzle webViewDidFinishLoad: and call cachedResponseForRequest: to track the response status code. This approach worked until iOS 12.\n\nWe use a different mechanism (swizzle webView:decidePolicyForNavigationResponse:decisionHandler:) to track response in WKWebView and that still works correctly in iOS 12.\n\nI thought this could be related to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185990 but the WebKit developer says it isnâ€™t and they asked me to file a radar.\n\nThanks"
