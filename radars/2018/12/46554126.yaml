    description: "Summary:\r\nUIGraphicsImageRenderer behaves slightly differently when used on 2x and 3x display size devices even though its UITraitCollection (set via UIGraphicsRendererFormat) is set to a different displayScale.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Initialize a UIGraphicsImageRenderer with UITraitCollection with displayScale of 2\r\n2. Render an image on a 2x Simulator such as “iPhone 7” and save it\r\n3. Render an image on a 3x Simulator such as “iPhone 7 Plus” and save it\r\n4. Compare the images\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe images are identical.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe images are slightly different, especially the fonts.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve attached an Xcode project that shows the issue.\r\n\r\nYou can run the test case on a 2x device (such as iPhone 7), where it will pass.\r\nWhen the test case is run on a 3x device (such as iPhone 7 Plus), the snapshot will look slightly different.\r\n\r\nThere is also an image that shows the differences explicitly."
