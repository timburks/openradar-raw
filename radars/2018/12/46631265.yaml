    description: "Please add a function to App Store Connect to allow developers to look up *anonymous* in-app purchase order details - internal transaction ID, date, products purchased, region, currency - by customer email address.\r\n\r\nOur app has been in the App Store for almost a decade now and we have a lot of people who bought non-consumable IAPs a long time ago, have changed Apple IDs or other details in the interim and can no longer recover their purchases automatically. Right now the only way we can look up their old orders is to triangulate in our order database from the original date / device name / model / region / products, but that's far-from-perfectly-reliable and has sometimes led to customers accidentally getting other customers' purchases, or to our failing to recover their purchases at all.\r\n\r\nGoogle Play already offers this functionality, and they manage to do it without revealing any personal details; we enter an email address we already have (because the customer contacted us to ask for help retrieving a purchase) and they give us only the above information, no addresses or names or any of that; just enough for us to figure out what they bought and give it back to them. You would not compromise your users' privacy at all by letting us enter a known email address to look up orders placed with it.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to do the right thing here - keep supporting people who bought our app a long time ago, and leave them feeling confident that they can spend $1000 on a new iPhone and not lose access to their purchases - but your system is making it difficult for us to do that."
