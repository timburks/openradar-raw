    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the More Info section of Software Update, some updates include URLs in their release notes, but there’s not way to visit them other than typing them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get notified of a software update.\r\n2. Click More Info to see what’s changed.\r\n3. Notice the link that says:\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information about this update, please visit: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209149\r\nFor detailed information about the security content of this update, please visit: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222\r\n\r\n4. Try to click the link.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe link is blue, underlined, and clickable. If that’s too much to ask, it’s at least selectable text so I can copy and paste the link myself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe link is not clickable, and the text is not selectable. Sadness.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.14.1 (18B75)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot also uploaded to https://cl.ly/7944ad2a85d6"
