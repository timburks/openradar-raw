    description: "Summary:\r\nMounting any share via a URL: ignores SSO and shows user a list of volumes at the root of the share.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression, it works fine on 10.14.1 and earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Install macOS 10.14.2 or 10.14.3beta\r\n• Open Terminal and run:\r\n    open smb://192.168.10.10/Sharedfolder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe share should be mounted in the Finder, using the user's saved credentials form their keychain, without an authentication dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is prompted for authentication, just as if they hadn't already saved it. If they enter their password, they get a list of volumes at the root of the server.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.2 18C54\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nViewed on many iMac, Macbook Pro, and Macbook Air, with both SMB and AFP urls\r\n\r\n\r\nsee also https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5036543404146688"
