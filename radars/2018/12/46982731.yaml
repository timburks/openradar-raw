    description: "Summary: I connect an old AirPort Express I have to my electric piano via audio out. The piano is perfectly positioned to be an audio source for my Apple TV.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, when I first select the AE as an audio source, the Apple TV subsequently reverts the audio source back to HDMI after audio starts playing. I almost always have to select the AE as an audio source two or three times before it sticks.\r\n\r\nThe AE is bridged to an AirPort Time Capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Choose a bridged AE as an audio source using Apple TV.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Audio from the Apple TV should stream seamlessly to the AE.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The audio source reverts back to HDMI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nA gen 4 Apple TV w/ tvOS 12.1.1\r\nAirPort Express w/ AE Firmware 7.8\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: N/A"
