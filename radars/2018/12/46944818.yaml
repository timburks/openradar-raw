    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nFor a horizontal scrolling UICollectionView with UICollectionViewFlowLayout, its contentSize is wrong with self-sizing cells if collectionViewLayout.minimumLineSpacing is not the default value(which is 10 currently).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch sample app on iPhone SE simulator.\r\n2. Scroll to the end to see that the last cell is cut off because the contentSize is tool small.\r\n3. Tap Change button on top.\r\n4. Scroll to the end to see that there is a large margin on the right because the contentSize is too large.\r\n5. minimumLineSpacing in code to 10 to see the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!NCJAAIib!ivlcU6gSE1I2yAg2m9txmo0hkoZ23dovRtyC_uHUFF8"
