    description: "Summary:\r\nAlignment rectangles edited in the Asset Catalog do not work in Storyboard Preview using the assistant editor\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an image that has a visual flair.\n2. Add inset to account for bottom flair (-3.5 points for Tip Callout from a 7 point tall bottom arrow)\n3. Add image to the canvas \n4. Try to align content to the image in the Storyboard canvas\n5. Preview the results\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe storyboard preview should shift content using the alignment rectangles set in Asset Catalog\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe preview shows the incorrect placement of the images affected by alignment rectangle adjustments.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample Project\n\nSee the provided example with a \"Tip Callout\" graphic that has an alignment adjustment on the bottom edge for visual flair. \n\nThe arrow on the bottom is 7 points tall, so the bottom inset is 7 for the Alignment, which allows the designer to center the text label, and align a bottom percentage label."
