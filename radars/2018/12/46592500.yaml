    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I have an Objective-C class where I have an `init` method marked as `NS_UNAVAILABLE` and a factory method with no arguments and if I try to call that factory method from Swift, then the init method is invoked instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate the following Objective-C class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@interface SCNObject : NSObject\r\n+ (instancetype)object;\r\n- (instancetype)init NS_UNAVAILABLE;\r\n@end\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom Swift do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_ = SCNObject()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's easy to check with the debugger that the `init` method is called instead of the factory method.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the factory method, then the code won't compile and the proper error message is displayed: \"'init()' is unavailable\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe factory method should be invoked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe init method is invoked.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSwift 4.2, Xcode 10.1"
