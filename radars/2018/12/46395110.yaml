    description: "Summary:\r\nPlease see attached test case. When removeAllActions is called inside an undo handler and a group is open, NSUndoManager throws \"NSInternalInconsistencyException\", \"_endUndoGroupRemovingIfEmpty:: NSUndoManager 0x600001026620 is in invalid state, endUndoGrouping called with no matching begin\n\n_endUndoGroupRemovingIfEmpty checks if a group needs to be closed, but does that before invoking the undoHandler, and then not checking again.\n\nThis is an example where you might quickly say \"API misuse\". In a real-world application with 20 layers and user-facing API, it is MUCH harder to prevent calls from various model change callbacks that don't affect the undo manager or might trigger a call to removeAllActions. It's an extremely hard to reproduce case, we took weeks with a customer to track it down to exactly this trivial case.\n\nNSUndoManager could add an additional check for the groupingCount before trying to close a group after invoking the undo handler to fix this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun test case, observe exception.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo exception. NSUndoManager should be robust enough to deal with the call order we throw at it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSUndoManagerâ€™s redo logic gets confused and subsequently throws.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe currently work around it with a custom NSUndoManager subclass that includes additional checks in endUndoGrouping, however this seems suboptimal."
