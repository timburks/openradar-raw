    description: "I've been having random audio overloads on my new 2018 MacBook Air. After browsing several logs, I noticed that IOAudioEngine::pauseAudioEngine() was called immediately after the 'timed' process attempted to synchronize the local time to a network time server.\r\n\r\nThis issue is 100% reproducible and persists across reboots. While audio was playing, I opened up Date & Time preferences and repeatably toggled the \"Set date and time automatically\" check box. Each time I turned this setting on, I saw a log entry for IOAudioEngine::pauseAudioEngine(). These pauses are often long enough to cause an audio overload.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have a MacBook Air 2018 and an audio device whose \"Clock Source\" isn't \"Default\". I used both an Apogee Groove and a Focusrite iTrack Solo.\r\n2) Turn on \"Set date and time automatically\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo audio overloads, glitchless playback\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhenever \"Set date and time automatically\" is first turned on, or once per hour when 'timed' runs, audio glitches due to something calling IOAudioEngine::pauseAudioEngine() at the kernel layer.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.2 (18C54)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2018 MacBook Air + Apogee Groove \r\n\r\nTest matrix:\r\n2015 MacBook Pro + Built-in Output = ok\r\n2015 MacBook Pro + Audioengine D3  = ok\r\n2015 MacBook Pro + Groove          = ok\r\n2015 MacBook Pro + iTrack Solo     = ok\r\n\r\n2017 iMac Pro + Built-in Output = ok\r\n2017 iMac Pro + Audioengine D3  = ok\r\n2017 iMac Pro + Groove          = ok\r\n2017 iMac Pro + iTrack Solo     = ok\r\n\r\n2018 MacBook Air + Built-in Output = ok\r\n2018 MacBook Air + Audioengine D3  = ok\r\n2018 MacBook Air + Groove          = FAILED\r\n2018 MacBook Air + iTrack Solo     = FAILED"
