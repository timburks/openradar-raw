    description: "I have discovered a repeatable assertion failure in Xcode 10. I am bringing an older project up to compatibility with the C++ compilers in Xcode 10; the project contains references to symbols defined in <unistd.h> (e.g. \"assert\", \"F_OK\", \"gid_t\") that compiled with legacy project settings (references to libstdc++ et al.).\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to add an include directive for unistd.h using autocompletion, the Xcode IDE crashes with an assertion failure that references the source file DVTFilePath.m.  Although I cannot include the project due to its proprietary nature, I hope that the attached information will allow you to find and fix the issue. (In the crash logs, the identifier \"DeviceControlSDK\" is the name of the project in which the edits are being applied.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a C++ source file that has failed to compile due to a reference to a symbol such as \"gid_t\" that is declared in <unistd.h>.\r\n2. Place the insertion point adjacent to a previous #include directive.\r\n3. Type \"#include\" and allow the autocomplete menu to appear.\r\n4. Choose the option \"#include <header>\".\r\n5. Begin to type the header file name \"unistd.h\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe IDE allows the header file <unistd.h> to be entered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter typing between one and three characters, the Xcode IDE crashes with the error:\r\nASSERTION FAILURE in /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/DVTFrameworks/DVTFrameworks-14317.18/DVTFoundation/FilePaths/DVTFilePath.m:908\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 10.0 (10A255)"
