    description: "Summary: I connect an old AirPort Express I have to my electric piano via audio out. The piano is perfectly positioned to be an audio source for my Apple TV.\r\n\r\nOften enough — usually at least once or twice per viewing as I watch a TV show — while using the AE as an audio source, the audio goes out of sync with the video. I believe the audio usually lags behind, but I'm not certain.\r\n\r\nThe AE is bridged to an AirPort Time Capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Watch something on an Apple TV w/ a bridged AirPort Express as the audio source.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The audio and video should play back in sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The audio and video sometimes go out of sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nA gen 4 Apple TV w/ tvOS 12.1.1\r\nAirPort Express w/ AE Firmware 7.8\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: N/A"
