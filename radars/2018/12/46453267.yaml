    description: "Summary:\r\nSome API would be nice if it was updated to support UICoordinateSpace. This is a newer protocol that can be used for more general coordinate space conversions than just between views.\n\nFor example, at PSPDFKit we make a framework with API for working with PDF documents, and we expose a page’s PDF coordinate space on our view that displays a PDF page. The PDF coordinate system has a different origin and scale to the view. UICoordinateSpace is a nice API for us.\n\nCurrently it is necessary to get a touch point in a view coordinate space then convert to PDF coordinate space, like this:\n\nlet viewPoint = touch.location(in: pageView)\nlet pdfPoint = pageView.convert(viewPoint, to: pageView.pdfCoordinateSpace)\n\nIt would be nice to be able to replace that with a single line:\n\nlet pdfPoint = touch.location(in: pageView.pdfCoordinateSpace)\n\nThe following API currently require a view:\n\n-[UITouch locationInView:]\n-[UITouch preciseLocationInView:]\n-[UIGestureRecognizer locationInView:]\n\nThese could have preferred alternatives like this:\n\n-[UITouch locationInCoordinateSpace:]\n-[UITouch preciseLocationInCoordinateSpace:]\n-[UIGestureRecognizer locationInCoordinateSpace:]\n\nAs we saw above in Swift the call looks the same — just location(in: whatever). It’s more lenient in the types of things it accepts which is cool.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook for API to get the location of a touch or gesture recogniser in a coordinate space other than a view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAPI as discussed above to exist.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such API. We must get the touch location in an intermediate coordinate space.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
