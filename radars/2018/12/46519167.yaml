Run attached script that controls iTunes in Script Editor. Keep it open.\r\n2. Build and Run attached project\r\n3. From the menu select Test -> Test (executes the same script)\r\n4. Dialog will show the app tries to control Script Editor instead of iTunes.\r\n5. Click Don't Allow\r\n6. Try again and now it will fail saying the app doesn't have permission to control System Events\r\n7. Check Preferences -> Security -> Privacy -> Automation and see that Script Editor was added instead of iTunes\r\n8. Close Script Editor\r\n9. Close test project and repeat step #2\r\n10.
