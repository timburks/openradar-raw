    description: "Summary: While in Nightstand mode and attached to the charger, Apple Watch will randomly make the charge connection 'ding' sound, followed by the battery charge level animation, and then return to the Nightstand display. It does this repeatedly every few minutes while attached to the charger.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced this with two different Apple Watch Magnetic Charger to USB Cables, and both Apple 12W USB Power Adapters and Apple 5W USB Power Adapters\r\n\r\nThis has been occurring at least since the watchOS 5.0.1 update. Please also see this Apple Community thread discussing the same issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8564693\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Enable watchOS Nightstand mode\r\n2. Attach Apple Watch to Magnetic Charger\r\n3. Charge Apple Watch to 100%\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo charging alerts while in Nightstand mode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultiple charging alerts, every few minutes, while in Nightstand mode\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nStarted with watchOS 5.0.1, and continues to occur as of watchOS 5.1.2 (16S46)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApple Watch Series 3 42mm Smartwatch (GPS Only, Silver Aluminum Case, Fog Sport Band) MQL02LL/A"
