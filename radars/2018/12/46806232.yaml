    description: "Summary:\r\nA UITableView with a large tableHeaderView shortly scrolls to a wrong contentOffset and back when reloading a row in a begin/endUpdates block.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the attached sample project.\nUsing the + button, add that many rows to the table that when scrolled all the way to the bottom, a small part of the tableHeaderView is still visible. (On an iPhone XS, 11 cells is a good number.)\nScroll all the way to the bottom so that only a small part of the tableHeaderView is still visible.\nNow tap on the first cell to select it. This causes a reload of the cell in a begin/endUpdates block.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cell content should be reloaded but there should be no scrolling.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt scrolls from a start contentOffset of {0, 287} to {0, 144} and {0, 105}, then back to {0, 287}. (I obtained the offset values by setting a breakpoint in `-[UITableView setContentOffset:]`.)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.2 (16D5024a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIncluded in the project, I've attached a screen video to show the issue.\n\nWhen removing the tableHeaderView, the issue does not occur anymore."
