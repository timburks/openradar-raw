    description: "Summary:\r\nWith Xcode 10 the creation of dSYM of a project, which contains GStreamer does not finish.\r\nThis eventually lead to rebooting of the OS.\r\n\r\nWe noticed in activity monitor that \"llvm-dsymutil\" uses abnormal amount of memory and CPU.\r\n\r\nWith Xcode 9.4 this problem is not observed!\r\n\r\nAt the moment we know only two workarounds:\r\n1. Use Xcode 9.4\r\n- since we supposed in the near future Apple requires to use Xcode 10, this is just a temporary workaround\r\n\r\n2. Disable dSYM\r\n- this has the disadvantage, that crash-reports can no longer be properly analysed...\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download GStreamer (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/for-ios-development.html)\r\n2. Create project and integrate GStreamer.framework\r\n3. Archive the App for the AppStore or change the building to dwarf with dsym when you build for simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBuild finished normally with output of dSYM\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Build does not finish\r\n- instead in activity monitor one can see that \"llvm-dsymutil\" starts using abnormal amount of memory and CPU\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is similar to https://openradar.appspot.com/45324895 (there VLC was used)"
