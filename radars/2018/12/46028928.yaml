    description: "With the release of iOS 12, Apple has released two new MDM Policies (allowManagedToWriteUnmanagedContacts/allowUnmanagedToReadManagedContacts) that should allow a managed app to write to contacts but it does not and both the CNContacts and ABAddrressBook APIs report no writable sources.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an MDM policy and disable the following 2 policies:\r\nAllow documents from managed sources in unmanaged destinations\r\nAllow documents from unmanaged sources in managed destinations\r\n2. Assign the policy to a user and activate an iOS 12.0.1 device with MDM. iCloud disabled.\r\n3. Using the attached sample app MyContacts check to see if there are any writeable sources for either the CNContacts API or the older ABAddressBook API - note there are none with the policy set.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should find at least one writable source and be able to write contacts to the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo Writable sources found."
