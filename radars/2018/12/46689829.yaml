    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #46687884\n\nWhen calling -[AVAssetImageGenerator generateCGImagesAsynchronouslyForTimes:completionHandler:], the calling thread is blocked for a long time, even though the method is supposed to be asynchronous.\r\nThis is reproducible when the asset is created using a network URL.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe message\r\n\"Time for generate method to return: ...\" is logged with a small value (ideally less than 0.1s).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message \r\n\"Time for generate method to return: 2.083s\" is logged. This is a very long time for a method to be blocking something when its name says it should be asynchronous.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niPhone 7 Plus, iOS 12.1.1.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project: https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/radar.apple.com/tree/master/46687884%20-%20AVAssetImageGenerator%20blocks%20calling%20thread"
