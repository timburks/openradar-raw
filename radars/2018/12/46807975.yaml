    description: "Summary:\r\nMounting an smb share with NSWorkspace's openURL: ignores kerberos SSO and shows user a list of volumes at the root of the share.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression, it works fine on 10.14.1 and earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Install macOS 10.14.2\r\n• Connect to a network with a kerberos domain\r\n• Open Terminal and run:\r\n    kinit user@domain\r\n• Mount a share using NSWorkspace, e.g. by running:\r\n    python -c 'from Cocoa import *; NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace().openURL_(NSURL.URLWithString_(\"smb://server/volume\"))'\r\n    (or just use open smb://server/volume, same thing :)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe smb share should be mounted in the Finder, without an authentication dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user is prompted for authentication, just as if they didn't have a kerberos ticket. If they enter their password, they get a list of volumes at the root of the server.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.2 18C54\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested in VMware, but matches our physical machines. I've included sysdiagnose dumps from both the 10.14.1 and 10.14.2 VMs."
