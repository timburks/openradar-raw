    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the latest Shortcuts app (2.1.1), using any Find and Filter actions (e.g. the Find Health Samples Action) and using a date as one of the filters (e.g. Start Date), one is prompted to select a date (and no time). This is problematic especially for Health samples or for pictures when you want a more granular filtering. What is worse is that when using a date (with date *and* time info) contained in a variable, the time info isn't taken into account. E.g. searching for a Health sample taken at the exact same time as another one (e.g. 02/02/18 06:34 AM) will return all Health sample from that day (02/02/18) and not the one (or those) which are at 06:34 AM. This makes some usecases impossible to code without heavy workarounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExample with Photos (https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d47b72a910f3415eb0221ecd66865c3e)\r\n1. Create shortcut\r\n2. Define a date and time where a known picture exists (e.g. 11/07/18 06:17 PM)\r\n3. Add a Find Photos Action\r\n4. Add \"Date taken\" filter and link to Date from step 2 (e.g. with magic variable)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould return the only photo taken at that specific time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReturns all pictures taken on that day\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nShortcuts 2.1.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X, iOS 12.1 (16B92)"
