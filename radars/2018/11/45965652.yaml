    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile developing/testing watch app localization, I cannot change the language of the simulator watch. While the simulator iPhone & Watch are both running & paired to each other, the phone's Watch app shows \"Could Not Connect to Apple Watch\". This prevents any further action to update the Watch Language in the simulator. Note: this works as expected on actual hardware (phone & watch).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run an Xcode scheme with a paired watch & phone.\r\n2. Open simulator phone's Watch app\r\n3. Select 'General'\r\n4. Select 'Language & Region'\r\n5. Select 'Watch Language'\r\n6. The activity indicator will run for a moment.\r\n7. The error \"Could Not Connect to Apple Watch\" comes up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Watch app proceeds to the next screen & allows the user to select a language for the watch. (This happens & works on actual hardware).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe error \"Could Not Connect to Apple Watch\" comes up.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12.1 (16B91)\r\nWatch OS 5.1 (16R591)\r\nXcode Version 10.1 (10B61)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nSimulator iPhone XS Max - 12.1\r\nSimulator Apple Watch Series 4 - 44mm - 5.1"
