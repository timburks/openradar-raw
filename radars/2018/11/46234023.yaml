    description: "Summary:\r\nIf Siri has to say “Church St” in the context of driving directions, it says “Church St Church St” instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ask Siri to give you driving directions to Church St, Lowell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri says “Getting directions to Church St, Lowell.”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri shows the correct message on the screen, but says out loud “getting directions to Church St Church St Lowell.”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt also happens with other Church Streets, such as in Wilmington, MA. And the person who pointed this out to me said it also happens when Church St shows up as one of the directions during a route.\r\n\r\nAttached file also uploaded at https://cl.ly/def1c8ba40df/Church%252520St.mov"
