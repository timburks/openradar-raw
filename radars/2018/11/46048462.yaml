    description: "Summary:\r\nThe \"512GB\" option for the 2018 Mac mini ships with a device that has 500.3 (base 10) GB. There is no possible way anyone could come up with an explanation for this drive actually being 512GB except that the model name claims it is a `AP0512M` device.\r\n\r\nThis is not simply a misunderstanding of the difference between GB, GiB, marketing terminology, or otherwise. If this were a base 2 vs base 10 confusion, a 500GB (base 10) disk would have ~465GB (base 2) of usable, formatted space under that notation, but macOS hasn't used base 2 storage notation in more than 5 major version releases. If somehow this were a 512GB (base 10) disk it would have ~477GB (base 2) of usable, formatted space.\r\n\r\nI can't think of another way to report this. Maybe the team that builds the iOS store app can get this fixed?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Shop for a 2018 Mac mini\r\n2. Receive it\r\n3. Look at the storage capacity of the device you have received\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Something approximating 512 billion bytes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Something approximating 500 billion bytes\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nAll\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2018 Mac mini with \"512\" GB storage option.\r\n\r\nImages uploaded with Radar: https://imgur.com/a/7dz7IyK"
