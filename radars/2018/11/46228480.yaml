    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I try to lay out different windows of Xcode next to each other (perhaps from different projects), and I try to make the horizontal size smaller, Xcode enforces a minimum width. This is infuriating and I regularly see people frustrated by it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to shrink Xcodeâ€™s horizontal width.\n2. Be disappointed at about half the screen - even on large screens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window should be whatever ridiculous size I want to make it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode refuses to shrink to perfectly reasonable widths.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
