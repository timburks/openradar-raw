    description: "Summary:\r\nThe accessibilityLabel is ignored when set on UIBarButtonItems set as additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItems and additionalTrailingNavigationBarButtonItems of a UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\n\nThis means custom navigation bar buttons added to a UIDocumentBrowserViewController are inaccessible. They just read the text ‘button’ with VoiceOver.\n\nYou can see/hear this in our app, PDF Viewer by PSPDFKit. Our settings button set in additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItems has an accessibility label set on the app side, but this is not used when using VoiceOver. You can also see this in MindNode, although I don’t know if they’re setting the accessibilityLabel but it’s a well made app so it’s likely they are.\n\nI guess the UIBarButtonItems are serialised to pass over XPC, and the accessibilityLabel is not included in the serialisation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project. It’s the document-based app project template with a few lines added to set additionalLeadingNavigationBarButtonItems with an item created with an image that has an accessibilityLabel.\n2. Enable VoiceOver.\n3. Focus the circular button with the VoiceOver cursor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver reads “Do the thing, button”\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver reads “button”\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
