    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nI've been able to reproduce this on iOS 12.1 running on an iPhone XS Max and on iOS 12.0.1 running on an iPhone X.\r\n\r\nWhen a navigation controller is one of the view controllers in a tab bar controller and it pushes a view controller with hidesBottomBarWhenPushed=true, when the view controller that's been pushed is popped, the layout of the tab bar breaks. This only happens on devices with the home indicator. See attached sample project and video."
