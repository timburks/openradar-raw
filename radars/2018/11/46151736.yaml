    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you have a cross-platform Swift PM project, you may want to pass `-Xlinker -fatal_warnings` for release builds (along with `-Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`). To support this on both macOS and Linux, you have to do this conditionally in some script, so that you can pass -fatal_warnings to ld64, and -fatal-warnings to ld.gold. It would be great if ld64 supported a compatible flag to not have to add a platform conditional.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On Linux and macOS in a SwiftPM project run `swift build -Xlinker -fatal-warnings`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt works on both platforms\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt passes on Linux, and fails on macOS\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nld64-409.12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a possible patch (with tests!) to support this based on the Xcode 10.0.0 source dump from opensource.apple.com."
