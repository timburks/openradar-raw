    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we submit a build for the App Store and at the same time (or afterwards) decide that we do want to push a public TestFlight before releasing it manually, the same build is reviewed twice. Even if the build already passed review and is waiting for manual release, we sometimes still have to wait multiple days for the TestFlight review of the same build.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems like a waste of time and money on your and our end, and likely is an oversight. Please discuss if this can be optimised. Thank you!"

    title: Requiring a TestFlight review when the App Store review is already complete seems redundant
