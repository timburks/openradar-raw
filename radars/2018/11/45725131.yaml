    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like to disable both access to and notifications from news applications after 10pm. \n\nRight now, there’s no way to do that: \n- Screen time only allows you to set limits on total accumulated time per day, not “You can’t use this during these times” \n- Do Not Disturb kills notifications for everything except allowed apps, but does not prompt you with the “You sure you want to do that to yourself?” alert that Screen Time does if you try to open an app. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Live in world where many awful things are happening. See: 2018. \n2. Realize when these awful things happen after 10pm, you are getting push notifications from news apps and reading news apps and you are not sleeping.\n3. Realize that if you disable notifications and access to news apps after 10pm, everything horrible will still be there in the morning but you will sleep way better.\n4. Try to set up a Screen Time block on using news apps between 10pm and 6am. Realize you can only block apps after an accumulated period of use per day, not during a specified time frame.\n5. See if Do Not Disturb allows you to only DND certain applications, but realize it’s the other way around: You have to say what apps you DO want to hear from, not specify which ones you don’t. Also, DND does not prompt you for your passcode to access a disabled app. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen Time should allow blocks on applications at specified times of day, which should also disable notifications from these applications. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHave to exercise self-control instead of making technology save you from your worst instincts. What a drag.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
