    description: "Summary:\r\nUIViewPropertyAnimator currently exposes an addCompletion method, which lets users attach arbitrary blocks that are executed when an animation is stopped or paused. This is extremely useful in cleaning up after an animation is completed.\n\nSimilarly, it might be useful to have an addPreparation method exposed, which allows users to attach arbitrary blocks that are run before the animation begins, thus providing an opportunity to perform some setup before the animation begins. This would thus be complementary to the aforementioned addCompletion method\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIâ€™ve implemented this myself in a subclass. https://gist.github.com/HarshilShah/97573cc2962cd15cd2ab2dc1f70f6104"
