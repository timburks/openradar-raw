    description: "Summary:\r\nIn VLC we use a subclass of NSOpenGLView to display the video on screen.\r\nAs soon as we opt-in to 10.14's new dark mode either with NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance in our Info.plist or by building against the 10.14 SDK the video output will not properly preserve aspect ration in the video output.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run a VLC nightly of VLC on 10.14:\r\n\r\nhttp://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/vlc-4.0.0-20181102-0315/vlc-4.0.0-20181102-0315-dev.dmg\r\n\r\n2. Play a video and switch to fullscreen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe aspect ration should be preserved when changing to fullscreen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video ends up being distorted to fit the full screen.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14.2 Beta (18C31g)\r\n\r\nI am unsure if this is some issue in VLCs subclass of the NSOpenGLView or if this is caused by some regression in the NSOpenGLView. I am interested in fixing this, not necessarily requiring a fix in macOS, but some hints what might be the bug in our code, if this is not a macOS issue. The OpenGL video output works fine on other OSes and the macOS specific variant does not seem to do anything much different that could cause this, especially since it only happens when opting in to dark mode (which afaik opts the app into full layer backing).\r\n\r\nAny hint what the issue is would be highly appreciated. Note that this same issue does not happen with our CAOpenGLLayer video output but it's not in good shape to enable that in official releases.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code for the macOS NSOpenGLView based video output can be found here: http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=modules/video_output/macosx.m;h=948e56d400e8c8a0ef8f40635fb3c48ab190048b;hb=HEAD"
