    description: "Summary:\r\nWe would like to customize the outer bubble shape of a MKMarkerAnnotationView, not only the glyph image as of today. \n\nSpecifically, we'd like to achieve an appearance similar to MapKit builtin POIs (MKMapView.showsPointsOfInterest). They are smaller than current MKMarkerAnnotationViews and have a purely circular shape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
