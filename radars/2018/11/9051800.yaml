    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen an NSTabView is set to display with tabs on the left or right, the lower-most tabs don't draw correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an NSTabView and set it to display tabs on the left or right.\r\n2. Look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt should draw the same as it does when tabs are on top, aside from being rotated.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe lower portion (first few tabs if tabs are on left, or last few tabs if they're on the right) don't draw correctly. Specifically, the titles aren't shown and the dividers aren't drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSideways tabs worked fine before Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached Xcode project displays tab views in all orientations. The tab views are identical (ie. copied/pasted) except for the orientation."
