    description: "Hi there, currently there is no way to select music in Shortcuts.app based on its “Is Liked” state.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create a Shortcut where I have the app get the currently playing song, query it’s album title, then play ONLY Liked Songs (and not the whole album) from that album.\r\n\r\nThis is not possible. So I tried to make the app restrict selection to songs that are added to a specific playlist (ie. My Liked Songs playlist) and it turns out that’s not possible either.\r\n\r\nSo the only workaround I found was to add a “Liked” or similar phrase to the comments field of a song in iTunes. This is kinda clunky and not user friendly, since I’d have to do it every time I Liked a song.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Add the following conditions to Music filter in Shortcuts.app — “Find Music Where...”\r\n1. “is Liked” or “is Disliked”\r\n2. “is in Playlist _______”"
