    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA message composed as plain text that contains an image (eg. JPEG) attachment will be sent as formatted text. This is not the case with attachments of other types like PDF.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Compose a message\r\n- In the Format menu make sure the message is in plain text\r\n- Add a image attachment\r\n- Note that the message is still displayed as plain text, formatting disabled\r\n- Send the message\r\n- A recipient using Apple Mail will see the message as formatted text with inline attachment\r\n- A recipient using a different mail client that is preferring plain text will see the message in plain text without attachment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following MIME structure is expected (this is how it works for non-images btw):\r\nmultipart/mixed with \r\n- text/plain\r\n- application/pdf ('inline' but that's another issue)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmultipart/alternative with \r\n- text/plain\r\n- multipart/related with\r\n-- text/html\r\n-- image/jpeg (again 'inline')\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.5 (3445.9.1) (was already the case on 10.12 at least)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G2307) with Swiss-German locale"
