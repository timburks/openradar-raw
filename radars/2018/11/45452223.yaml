    description: "Summary:\r\n21004 returned when purchasing CONSUMABLE purchases. There is a thread with the same problem, but the bug still exists. https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/76301\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe application name is FormaCar. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/formacar/id1180117334?mt=8\r\nWe have consumable purchases with id's like `com.formacar.car1`. It happened, when user buy a one tuning element. After that the app sends the app receipt, fetched from Bundle.main.appStoreReceiptURL of the device. The standart procedure. We're not using `\"password\":\"<YOURSHAREDSECRET>\"` because it need only for auto-renewable subscriptions. After that server send this receipt and validate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nValidation is success.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nValidation gives back 21004 error:  `The shared secret you provided does not match the shared secret on file for your account`. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nFormaCar 2.4.9\r\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n\r\nWe tried a lot and figured out next:\r\n1) If we use SANDBOX, than every check of the receipt by server gives back 21004 error. So users can't buy anything in out app.\r\n2) If we use release version from the app store, than the half devices gives back a success and half - not.\r\n3) For example iPhone 8 Plus with appleID `web_geo@mail.ru` gives 21004 error when checking his receipt."
