    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn the new iPad iPad Pro 12\" 3rd Gen simulator, when using the default master-detail template, the column layout is wrong in this situation. When in portrait, and another app is on the right in multi-tasking, the app should show the secondary controller (detail view) in the full window, with the display mode as overlay for the primary controller. As it does on the 2nd Gen version of the simulator. Currently the 3rd Gen simulator is showing both columns, and the detail is too narrow (see attached screenshot with filename \"iPad Pro 12 3rd Gen with bug.png\"). I have included iPad Pro 12 2nd Gen.png to show the expected behaviour. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like me to look into the reason why further I can, but just now I'd guess the problem is to do with the 3rd Gen having a slightly different screen resolution to the 2nd Gen and perhaps something to do with the layout is hard-coded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run Xcode 10.1\r\n2. Creat master-detail app\r\n3. Launch in iPad Pro 12\" 3rd Gen Simulator\r\n4. Rotate to portrait\r\n5. Swipe up slightly from the bottom drag the Messages icon into the right column.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe detail controller should fill the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe master and detail columns can be viewed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\niPad Pro 12 3rd Gen with bug.png\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qOGj5OF\r\n\r\niPad Pro 12 2nd Gen.png\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jRf6OGP"
