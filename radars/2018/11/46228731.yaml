    description: "Area:\r\nMail\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe message list table cell for the currently viewed email doesn't re-select when navigating back and into the same folder again. But doing a slight drag back gesture makes it re-select hence why I think it is a bug that the cell is not reselected when the message list appears (see actual results section).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On iPad in landscape launch Mail.\r\n2. With Mailboxes on left, tap Inbox.\r\n3. Tap the first table cell in the list, and the email is displayed on the right.\r\n4. Tap the top left Mailboxes back button,\r\n5. Tap Inbox again to go back into the message list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirst cell should be highlighted since the corresponding email is still shown on the right.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first cell isn't highlighted. To make it highlight again, on the left edge of the screen begin a back gesture but don't complete it just let go so the table stays on the messages list, and then the cell re-selects correctly.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Pro 9.7\""
