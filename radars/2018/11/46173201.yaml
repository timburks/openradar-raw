    description: Since many users' Contacts list is populated with people with whom they rarely, if ever, communicate with, it would be helpful to provide an ordering predicate that would, amongst other options, provide a built-in 'popular' ordering that would show a user's most frequently contacted (through Messages, Phone, iCloud Photo Sharing, etc) contacts. This would allow users to very quickly find the contact that they need to access in third party apps.
