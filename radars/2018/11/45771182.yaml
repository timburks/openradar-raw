    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 12.1 the Tab Bar behaves strangely when a pushed view controller with \"Hide Bottom Bar on Push\" enabled gets popped (by user). During animation the Tab Bar is all over the place and afterwards the labels of the tabs are permanently compressed. This is only occurring in iOS 12.1. iOS 12 works fine. (12.0.1 not tested)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create App with Tab Bar\r\n- Add a UINavigationController to one of the tabs\r\n- Push view controller in this UINavigationController with \"Hide Bottom Bar on Push\" enabled\r\n- Pop view controller (by user)\r\n(I've added a sample project which reproduces the issue (TabBar Bug Demo.zip))\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTab Bar looks the same as before (also during animation)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDuring animation the icons of the tabs are translated and the labels are hidden.\r\nWhen animation did finished, everything is normal again except labels are permanently compressed.\r\n(see attached screen recording)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 64 GB"
