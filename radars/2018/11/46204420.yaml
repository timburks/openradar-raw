    description: "Sending a message should habe an option somewhere that it's Restricted While Locked, as I can configure it in my own app for INSendMessageIntent.\r\n\r\nIt otherwise allows anyone to grab my phone and speak to Siri!\r\n\r\nThe person on the other side have no way to tell that it's actually me (also because Siri still doesn't recognize that the voice is my voice)."
