    description: "Area:\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nSometimes, after using my AirPods with one device for a while, then putting them back on their case, they won't connect to any device afterwards when I put them in my ears, unless the device they were previously connected to is shut down.\r\n\r\nIn this particular incident, I used them with my iPhone (XS Max, iOS 12.1) for a while, then put them in the case. After taking them out of the case and wearing them, I heard the connection sound, but my iPhone was not connected to them. Trying to connect to them via my iPhone did not work. Trying to connect with any other device such as my MacBook Pro didn't work either. They only worked again after I shut down the iPhone.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sysdiagnose captured right after the event."
