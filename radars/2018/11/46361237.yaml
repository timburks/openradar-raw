    description: "Area:\r\nEventKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEKEventStore is reporting that EKAlarms have been successfully saved to an event, but they are not present in the event afterwards.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet an existing `EKEvent`. Create an `EKAlarm` and set the `alarms` property of the event. Save \"successfully\" to the `EKEventStore`. Receive the success response, and no error.\r\n\r\nCheck the event immediately afterwards - no alarm.\r\n\r\nI haven't found a pattern regarding types of event or calendar - today, it happened repeatedly on my own device (iPhone X - iOS12.1 16B92) when adding a very standard \"10 minute before\" EKAlarm to a very standard existing EKEvent in my main iCloud calendar.\r\n\r\nThis happened a number of times this morning at approx 9am AWST, so hopefully there's something in the logs provided.\r\n\r\nA work around is to check the events after saving, then if the alarms are not present, we reset the EKEventStore, reattach the same alarms, and save again. This time they'll save.\r\n\r\nThis has apparently been happening at least as far back as 2015. Discussion about this is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32132104/ekevent-does-not-save-ekalarm-but-no-errors-on-some-devices-only\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe alarms property of the event should contain the new alarm.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe alarms property of the event does not contain the new alarm.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61)\r\niPhone X - iOS12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
