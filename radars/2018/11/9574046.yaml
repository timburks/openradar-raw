    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe standard help window (accessed via the Help menu in most applications) never shows a resize cursor when the mouse is positioned at the edge of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the help window.\r\n2. Move the mouse cursor to the edge of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe mouse cursor should change to indicate that the window can be resized.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe mouse cursor remains an arrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of Mac OS X didn't have edge resizing, so this wasn't an issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe attached movie demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be other bugs involving mouse cursors and the help window. Notice how near the end of the movie the resize cursor set by the iChat window fails to revert to the default when moved into the Help window.\r\n\r\nI tried to isolate the problem by experimenting with NSWindows and NSPanels in my own programs, but couldn't find any combination of factors which produced the exact behavior found in the help window. I found that an NSPanel which is set to \"Regular Panel\" style in Xcode exhibits some cursor issues (it will only show resize cursors when it's the Main window). Perhaps this is related (Help Center looks like an NSPanel) but it isn't exactly the same behavior. Note that an NSPanel which has the \"Utility Panel\" style or \"HUD Panel\" style will exhibit correct cursor behavior."
