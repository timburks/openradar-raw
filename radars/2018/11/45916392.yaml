    description: "Closed on Nov 10, 2018, as duplicate of 41073664\r\n\r\n# # #\r\nDocumentation and WWDC talks mention using a VPN for keeping data secure. We would love to do that, but there is no simple way to setup and maintain a VPN without putting pagers on the small number of developers at our company. \r\n\r\nWe are looking into what it will cost to buy a VPN from a company that resells them and maintains them. I expect this will be an involved and expensive search. \r\n\r\nInstead, if Apple provided a VPN we could use in our app - similar to how Apple provides cloud storage with the CloudKit APIs - that would eliminate the search for us. Some kind of reasonable traffic limit would be great - perhaps each user can only have 1GB of data piped through the VPN per app per day? We are not interested in downloading large files through the VPN, but we are interested in having all of our data flow through a single proxy server to the outside world.\r\n\r\nOne essential bit of having a VPN for our use case, though, is a static IP address. Hopefully a solution for developers would include the ability to get that, even if it's for a monthly cost.\r\n\r\nI request this because, with the deprecation of `UIWebView`, our app now has to make a significant change. `UIWebView` allowed using `NSURLProxy` to pipe data to a specific proxy server that we controlled. However, since `WKWebView` does not allow this, we need an alternative approach. There are a couple options, but if Apple simply provided a VPN, that would be the route we'd take.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
