    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe new NSTabView appearance has a slider which slides around to indicate the active tab.  You can drag it between settings.  If the mouse button is released while the slider is between tabs, it can become stuck in an intermediate state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSlowly drag the slider in an NSTabView.  Let go of the mouse button while it's in between two tabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe slider should snap to the closest tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt can sometimes become stuck in an intermediate state between two tabs, as shown in the attached screenshot.  (Not only is its position in an intermediate state, but the label may be stuck in the middle of a fade transition.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of Mac OS X didn't have this sliding behavior, and thus weren't susceptible to the problem\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
