    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the attached project, opening any swift file hangs Xcode for roughly 30 seconds. This happens 100% of the time. I suspect it is related to symlinks, and profiling suggests its happening in the `fileReferenceForPath:` method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the App.xcworkspace in the attachment\nClick on any .swift file in the file navigator in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file opens and is immediately editable\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter a second or two, Xcode beachballs for roughly 30 seconds until the  file is editable\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis happens on opening any swift file in the project, even if that swift file has been opened before"
