    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a script phase includes input/output paths that point to a `.framework` making changes to said framework will not cause the script phase to run again due to the fact that the folder is no longer considered \"dirty\". This is despite the fact that the binary inside the `.framework` has actually changed.\r\n\r\nUpdating the script phase to use the binary path directly works but this means that if Resources (or anything else) changes within the `.framework` folder it will not cause the script phase to be executed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Example/FooBar.xcworkspace build and run and see \"Hello world!\" on the log output.\r\n\r\nChange FooBar.swift to print something else \"Hello World 2!\" build and run again and you will see \"Hello World\" instead.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanges to files that belong to a framework should cause script phases to be re-executed or Apple to provide suggestion on which files to monitor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScript phase does not re-execute and is instead skipped.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNew Build System\r\n\r\nNOTE: Old build system works correctly.\r\nNOTE 2: The project was setup with CocoaPods but does not require any CocoaPods command to run. It is only used to demonstrate the issue faster but this issue occurs without CocoaPods at all."
