    description: "Summary:\r\nShortcuts app appears to behave very strangely when asking it to speak money amounts that starts with $13 or $14. It speaks most money amounts exactly as one would expect. For example, “$42 million” is spoken as “42 million dollars” which is expected. However, it appears to speak incorrectly when the money amount starts with either “$13” or “$14” and ends in either “million”, “billion”, or “trillion”. The number part could be anything from “13.x”, “14.x”, “13x”, “14x”, “13”, “14” where “x” is any digit. Steps below include some examples and how to reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.
