    description: "Summary:\r\nI often use Spotlight to look up definitions of words, which is very quick and the dictionary is often one of the first results to show up. I use the arrow keys to navigate to it and start reading the definition, but in the meantime more results (often backed by web queries) come in.\n\nThis changes the index of the dictionary result in the list and updating the detail view on the right to whatever corresponds to the new index, which is very annoying because I now have to re-navigate to the dictionary word.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a Spotlight search\n2. Type \"puppy\" and quickly navigate to the dictionary definition within Spotlight\n3. Wait for other results to come in (web searches, Wikipedia entries, etc.)\n4. Once the other results come in, the detail view changes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince I already selected a result, it shouldnâ€™t change just because there are more results\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe selected result changes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14.1 (18B75)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
