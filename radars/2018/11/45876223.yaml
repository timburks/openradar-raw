    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen playing a video using the standard video player (i.e. playing a video full screen in safari), when the video player chrome is NOT visible and the user changes the volume on the device with the hardware buttons, the volume component of the chrome appears for a moment to show that the volume changed. This does not happen in the video player for Apple Music.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add a music video to the Apple Music library\n2) Play the music video\n3) Wait for the video player chrome to fade away\n4) change the volume using the hardware volume keys\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) A volume indicator to appear on the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1) Nothing appears\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug is related to rdar://45876170"
