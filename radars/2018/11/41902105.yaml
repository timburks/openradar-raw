    description: "Area:\r\nSiriKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nShortcuts is showing an old, incorrect name for my app in certain places. The app was previously named \"Delivery Status touch\", which is still showing in at least once place, rather than the current name, \"Deliveries\". I assume there's an old database from the Workflow app that's being used to look up the name in this particular spot.\r\n\r\nThe app's bundle ID is com.junecloud.Deliveries\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNote: I have a beta version of Deliveries installed that includes Siri Shortcuts. Step 4 won't be possible without that, but hopefully this is enough information to determine the problem.\r\n\r\n1. Tap \"Create Shortcut\"\r\n2. Tap the search field\r\n3. Tap \"Siri Suggestions\"\r\n4. Tap \"Show my deliveries\", or any Siri Shortcut for the Deliveries app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shortcut should be added to the workflow, with the app name \"Deliveries\" appearing next to its icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe shortcut is added with mostly correct information, however the old app name \"Delivery Status touch\" is shown.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n2.0 (654)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6 Plus with iOS 12 beta 3 (16A5318d)"
