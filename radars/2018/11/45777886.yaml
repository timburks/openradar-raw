    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have functionality that does not attempt to request data for a given asset unless the device is on wifi if that data needs to be fetched from iCloud. We've noticed through user report and internal reproduction that even if that video is not stored in iCloud Photo Library that videos can return `YES` from the info dictionary's `PHImageResultIsInCloudKey` even if the user does not have iCloud photo library enabled. In iOS 11 and below, we have not seen this behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using iOS 12, take video while signed in to iCloud (or not at all) with iCloud photo library.\n2. Call `[PHImageManager defaultManager] requestImageDataForAsset:asset options:options resultHandler:resultHandler]`\n3. Inspect the resultHandler's input parameter dictionary passed by the Photos framework\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. `[info[PHImageResultIsInCloudKey] boolValue]` should be `NO`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. `[info[PHImageResultIsInCloudKey] boolValue]` is always `YES` even we donâ€™t have iCloud turned on\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0.x\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n```\n    BOOL isCancelled = [info[PHImageCancelledKey] boolValue];\n    BOOL isDegraded = [info[PHImageResultIsDegradedKey] boolValue];\n    BOOL isInCloud = [info[PHImageResultIsInCloudKey] boolValue];\n```\n\nCode associated with screenshot"
