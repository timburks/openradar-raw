    description: "I am trying to install Mojave on my MacPro Mid-2010 that's running 10.12.6.\r\n\r\nThe Mojave installer tells me that I need to install High Sierra first (see attached img), and to go here for more information: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208898\r\n\r\nThat in turn tells me again I have to install High Sierra first.\r\n\r\nBut nowhere I'm told how to get High Sierra!\r\n\r\nNeither the above nor the linked ones (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) contain a link to the High Sierra installer, and searching the App Store for \"High Sierra\" does not show it, either.\r\n\r\nSo, I can't upgrade my Mac Pro Mid-2010 to Mojave because there's no way to download HS first.\r\n\r\nNote: This is NOT related to my particular system. So please do not ask for a sysdiagnose, as this is a general documentation error and not a bug in macOS.\r\n\r\nThis bug should be forwarded to those responsible for the documentation such as the linked HT208898 article, and I think the best solution would be to simply add a download link to High Sierra there."
