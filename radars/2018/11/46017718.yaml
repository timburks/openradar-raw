    description: "Summary:\r\nIn some cases, users use their iOS devices to perform an activity that they would prefer to do undisturbed. Apple should enable developers the ability to prompt the user if they’d like to turn on DND for the length of the activity they’re about to perform.\n\nWhile users can enable DND on their own, it’s easy to forget, and especially so when you’re on path to do something else. Note that I am not requesting automated access to DND, nor the ability to disable DND but only the ability to prompt users to enable DND for a fixed time period when DND is disabled. \n\nUse cases below:\n\n1. Meditations\nWhen a user wants to meditate with any app, the last thing they want is is to have their meditation be interrupted by a phone call or a text message or really any form of notification. Given the recent focus on mental health and using technology appropriately, this is an area where iOS has a ways to go still.\n\n2. Journaling\nSimilar to meditations, users journal as a way to reflect on the day and they want to do so with a clear mind. iOS can still be a distraction while they’re doing this going against their intentions.\n\n3. Playing games / watching movies / tv shows\nA lot of us have experienced the following: start watching a movie on an iPad together with another person and all of a sudden iMessage notifications start popping up at the top of the screen distracting you from the movie you’re trying to watch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
