    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS app that runs inside a simulator on macOS Mojave and uses microphone triggers macOS microphone permission dialog every time it runs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run an app that uses microphone on a simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app only asks for microphone permission with iOS system alert inside the simulator when run for the first time. If permission is granted no alert is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmacOS Mojave system permission alert is displayed each time the iOS app is started inside simulator (see attached screenshot).
