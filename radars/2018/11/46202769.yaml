    description: "I'm using NSURLSession via Swift to send POST requests to an endpoint. I noticed some leaks when using the Leak instrument to debug my app. \r\n\r\nThe leak only appears when I have a proxy set on my device, or on the simulator. I'm using Charles Proxy to test my app and see outbound connections.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the leak is coming from deep within the Apple networking APIs. I see the \"TunnelProxy\" API implicated in the leak through Instruments.\r\n\r\nThe amount of leaks varies, but sometimes gets up to hundreds of leaked objects, each up to a few hundred bytes.\r\n\r\nClearly this issue isn't going to affect that many end users (unless they are using proxies), but I've spent a whole day tracking down this bug, and I'm sure other developers using debugging proxies will see the same issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSend POST requests via dataTask using NSURLSession with a proxy active (both on device and on simulator)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo leaks.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n10s to 100s of leaks with proxy active. Deactivate proxy, and the problem goes away."
