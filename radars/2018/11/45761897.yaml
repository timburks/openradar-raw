    description: "See https://twitter.com/StuFFmc/status/1058369511022358528\r\n\r\nXcode should have an option to follow whatever is selected as the current macOS theme, light or dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL ANSWER FROM APPLE:\r\n\r\nThe currently selected theme is context dependent on system light/dark appearance.\r\n\r\nIf you manually change the Xcode theme, Xcode remembers your preferred theme and associates it with the current system appearance.\r\n\r\nIt’s as if you have two “current theme” preferences, one associated with system light appearance and another associated with the system dark appearance.\r\n\r\nSo, with a blank slate, you’ve never configured the theme, and you’re in system light appearance, the Xcode default theme is “Default (Light). And if you’re in system dark appearance, the Xcode default theme is “Default (Dark)”.\r\n\r\nIf you switch the system light/dark appearance, Xcode automatically follows and switches to the corresponding “Default (Light)” or “Default (Dark)” theme.  If you change your preferred theme, your selection is associated with the current system appearance.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments about the resolution, please update your bug report with that information so we can respond."
