    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a TextEdit window has a sheet displayed, then you can't create a new document.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open TextEdit.\r\n2. Cause a sheet to be displayed on a window.  (For example, duplicate a document and then close it, to display the \"Do you want to save...\" sheet.)\r\n3.  Press Command-N or choose File->New\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA new TextEdit window should appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn alert saying \"No document could be created.\" is displayed.  A screenshot of the alert is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Mac OS X it was possible to create a new TextEdit document while another document was displaying a sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAlso, this error message is really awful.  I'm assuming (or at least hoping) it's some default string hardcoded into NSDocument, not an error message carefully written for this situation in TextEdit.  :-)"
