    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding two cards from the same bank to Apple Pay/Wallet, it is virtually impossible to distinguish them, apart from that last 4 digits of the card. These digits have no releationship to the account number, so usually they are not memorised. For the physical cards this problem is easily solved by choosing a custom design (which mosts banks offer) and/or writing the alias on the card with a marker. (For example: Joint account / Business account / ...). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd two cards from the same bank to Wallet.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS could ask to assign a name/alias to a card.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCards show up almost identical.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS up to 12.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
