    description: "Some triggers are executed solely on the Home Hub. Therefore changes have to be synchronised between the iOS device and Home Hub. As long as the synchronisation is not finished, the trigger doesn't work. If a user wants to test a trigger, she can't because the trigger is not available on the Home Hub yet.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to tell the user that the trigger doesn't work yet because the changes were not synchronised with the Home Hub yet.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way to tell the synchronisation progress of HomeKit changes."
