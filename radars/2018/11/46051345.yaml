    description: "Summary:\r\nAnimations in Xcode are distracting and makes me wait some (milli)seconds which means various minutes in my entire day. Specially the refactoring tool animation is so unneeded and slow. Please add an option to disable all animations in Xcode.\r\n\r\nFor many professional developers, Xcode is NOT a toy NOT a casual app we use once every two weeks. Xcode should be considered as a professional tool and as such **unless we are on a demo those animations are really unneeded**. We do our 8hours job in Xcode and **these tiny animations all over the place have just became tiresome**. \r\n\r\nPlease add an option to disable (opt-out) all animations in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect a token and try the \"Refactor\" > \"Rename ...\" menu\r\nor \r\nHide or Show navigator (Cmd + 0)\r\nor \r\nHide or Show inspectors (Cmd + Alt + 0)\r\nmany more...\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect things to happen instantaneously. No animations, no transitions.\r\nI expect to have a check box option in the settings so I can opt-out and skip all the animations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to wait for a second until the animation finishes."
