    description: "Summary:\r\nWe'd like to allow a title to be placed beside (left or right) or even above an MKMarkerAnnotationView as well. \n\nThis would especially be useful in the context of customizable MKMarkerAnnotationView bubble shapes (rdar://46205177).\n\nWe propose a `permittedTitlePlacement` property that is a bitfield similar to `UIPopoverArrowDirection` where we can OR all allowed placement options. The system would then decide which placement is most appropriate.\n\nThe effect would be similar to MapKit's builtin POIs (MKMapView.showsPointsOfInterest) which are also placed beside or above the icon depending on the situation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
