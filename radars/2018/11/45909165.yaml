    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an USB3.0 hub, it sometimes works.\n\nThis also means it sometimes doesn't work, now I'm no stranger to Airdrop and iCloud, I can stand the occasional outage/weirdness/just not working. My tolerance for things that are attached via a cable to sometimes work however is decidedly lower.\n\nIt all happened a few years ago, when I bought a USB3.0 hub, I finally had 7 extra ports that I could use, great! Then 10.11 happened and the hub became unreliable, I thought it was the hub, but when connecting it to a Windows machine It Just WorksÂ®.\n\nSince then, each OS-update I hoped this would get fixed (since the Hackintosch community seems to have fixed it (https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-USB-Inject-All), we're now in Mojave and my hub is still only working intermittently (at best).\n\nWhen it works, it's only identified as a USB2.0 hub (which is weird, since it's a 3.0 hub, connected via a 3.0 cable to a 3.0 port)\n\nI tried fishing for something useful in the Console to at least give you something to start your search on, but it's not giving me anything useful.\n\nSo brave engineer, tell me what you need, and I'll attach hubs, collect logs and more.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect USB3.0 hub\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt always works\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt sometimes works\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\n- Anker USB3.0 7-port hub"
