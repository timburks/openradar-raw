    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSafari 5.1 on the first developer seed of Lion (11A390) shows the old [Look up in Dictionary] contextual menu item when you right-click on text instead of the new [Look up \"foo\"] menu item. Not only is it labelled incorrectly, but it doesn't actually work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Highlight some text in Safari.\r\n2. Right-click on the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe contextual menu should contain [Look up \"foo\"] (where \"foo\" is the word you had highlighted.)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe expected menu item is not there. Instead, the old \"Look up in Dictionary\" menu item is in the menu, and it does not function.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe old menu item worked fine in Safari in Leopard and Snow Leopard. It looks like Safari needs to be updated on Lion to use the new system. (Either that, or make the old menu item work in Lion, but it's probably better to have web views be consistent with other text views.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached screenshot demonstrates the issue."
