    description: "Wasn’t sure where to file this, but UIKit seemed reasonable for system features on iOS. There’s no “Screen Time” category in RadarWeb.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were a way to omit certain apps from Screen Time. This could either be a user feature (“please exclude this app”) or an API/entitlement (“this app is sometimes used passively”). Use case: I track my sleep with Sleep Cycle. It stays open, with the screen blacked out, all night while recording sleep. This wildly skews my Screen Time results, as you can see in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nOther times this exclusion capability could be useful: driving navigation apps, workout guides that are primarily audible.\r\n\r\nScreenshot also uploaded to https://cl.ly/85b7e3a8f908"
