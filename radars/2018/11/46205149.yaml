    description: "Summary:\r\nMarker annotation views are great because the convey more information (title, subtitle) compared to traditional annotation views. However, this comes at the cost that they're sometimes hidden altogether. \n\nWe'd like to see an `alwaysShowMarker` Bool property (or a `markerVisibility` property of type MKFeatureVisibility) that forces the marker view to be always visible. Only the titles and subtitles would be hidden if space is tight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe existing titleVisibility and subtitleVisibility properties don't help because they prevent the bubble itself from being hidden."
