    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the “Document Items” overview (ctrl-6) for a swift file, MARKs, TODOs, and FIXMEs (not sure if there are more, but I bet they’d also be affected) are indented incorrectly when within computed property implementations. I’ve attached an example.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. declare a computed property\n2. add a MARK or something to its implementation\n3. open the “Document Items” overview (ctrl-6)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe marker is indented, as within method implementations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe marker is not indented, as if it were just within the surrounding class.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
