    description: "Summary: When inserting or removing self sizing cells from a UICollectionView, the existing cells adopt an incorrect size and the layout adopts an incorrect state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a UICollectionViewController (or UIViewController with a UICollectionView). Give the it a flow layout with estimated item size.\r\n2. Set up a cell that requires a dynamic size. For example a cell with a multiline label.\r\n3. Use this cell in the collection view and set varying text lengths on the label during the cellForItem data source calls.\r\n4. Insert cells.\r\n5. Observe strange behaviour (see below)\r\n6. Delete cells.\r\n7. Observe strange behaviour (see below)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExisting cells should keep their correct size during animation. After animation the cells should all have the correct size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe existing cells adopt the estimated size and animate to a different larger size. When animation completes they snap to a different size again, which is often incorrect. The cell being inserted has an incorrect size.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.1 (10B61), iOS 12.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee attached example project demonstrating the issue with 100% reproducibility."
