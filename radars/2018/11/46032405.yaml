    description: "Summary:\r\nThe media keys in High Sierra and up try to be \"smart\" and control whatever is playing media. I don’t want this behavior,\n\nCurrently the only way to disable this is by installing a 3rd party app, High Sierra Media Key Enabler, which places an icon in the menu bar. An app like Bartender is then needed to remove that icon that I don’t want.\n\nInstead, macOS should provide an option to preserve the Sierra behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen iTunes, play music\nOpen Tweetbot, pause music, play video from tweet\nPress \"play\" media key\nNothing plays because the system still thinks Tweetbot is playing music\n\nThis is just an example - this smart behavior isn’t what I want even if it ends up working with Tweetbot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a setting that always lets me control iTunes with the media keys\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis \"smart\" behavior that leaves me without music a lot of the time\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nHigh Sierra+\r\n\r\nNotes:"
