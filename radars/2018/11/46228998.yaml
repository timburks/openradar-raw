    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I am on a run, and I want to maintain a pace, I ask Siri “Play music around 170 beats per minute”. Siri replies “I can’t do that on your phone”. I am an Apple Music (family) subscriber.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Be an Apple Music subscriber.\n2. Ask Siri “Play music at 170 beats per minute” or “play some workout songs around 150 beats per minute”.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should be able to play, not just a workout playlist, but a workout playlist with songs around a certain tempo. Or at least upbeat & fast songs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri says it can’t help.  Instead sometimes workout playlists have downbeat, sad, & slow songs in them. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApple Music may need to have BPM entered for songs. This is something Apple Music should vend anyway."
