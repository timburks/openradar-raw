    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen there are build errors, assistant editor can be used to navigate to the file by opening the report navigator, selecting an issue and making sure “Referenced Files” is selected in the assistant editor drop down. However if the project indentation width and the Xcode setting for the indentation width are different, the file adheres to the Xcode setting, not the project setting. Xcode while editing normally adheres to the project setting. This only happens when the assistant editor is open and showing some “Referenced Files” from the main editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1- Change Xcode indentation and tab width to use 2 spaces (http://take.ms/Ipt6Y)\r\n2- Open a project, select the project from the Project Navigator, show the Inspector, select File Inspector, and in the Text Settings block choose to have 4 spaces for both tab and indent. (http://take.ms/Gqasa)\r\n3- Plant an error (or warning) in the project and build it.\r\n4- Open report navigator after build finishes or fails, select the latest build, select an issue and select “Referenced Files” in the assistant editor (http://take.ms/j5ad1)\r\n5- Now edit code in the assistant editor and press ctrl + I (or choose Editor -> Structure -> Re-Indent from the menubar) to reindent the code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe code should indent to 4 spaces as per the project setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe code indents to 2 spaces as per the Xcode preferences setting, even after you choose to manually open another file instead of using “Referenced Files” in the assistant editor. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe code indents properly to the project settings if the file is opened in the main editor and assistant editor is used manually."
