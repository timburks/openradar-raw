    description: "Area:\r\nPreview\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPreview will open images grouped when opening more than 15 images even \"open each file in its own window\" is selected\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Preview.app, go to preferences -> images -> when opening files, choose \"open each file in its own window\"\r\n2. Open a folder with more than 15 jpeg images\r\n3. select all the images and double click\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be multiple preview.app window, one per image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first 15 images will have their separate window, but the rest ones will be grouped into one window.\r\n\r\nAlso if I use `open` in a loop to open files in Preview.app, e.g. the following bash script:\r\ncd some_folder_with_a_lot_image_files\r\nfor file in *.JPG; do\r\nopen \"$file\" &\r\ndone\r\n\r\nThe first few (not a fixed number, around 40 on one of my victim Macs) of images will be opened in a separate window, the rest will still be opened grouped into one window. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookPro11,1"
