    description: "It would be very helpful to have the option to open a MKMapItem directly in Maps.app and automatically start turn-by-turn directions. \r\n\r\nThe user story might look something like this:\r\n\"As a user I would like to preview the directions inside of the application I am in so that I don't have to leave the application to see the proposed route.\"\r\n\r\nProviding a launch option key (for func openInMaps(launchOptions: [String : Any]? = nil) -> Bool) that can be set to start turn-by-turn automatically would allow for the third-party app to show the route preview inside of the app and only send the user to Maps.app if they want to start navigation."
