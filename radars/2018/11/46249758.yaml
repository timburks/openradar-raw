    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen implementing a QLPreviewingController, we only get the Spotlight uniqueIdentifier but not the actual CSSearchableItem. This makes creating a quicklook previewing extension harder than necessary. In many cases, the uniqueIdentifier is just a URL with an ID of some kind. This means we have to fetch the content from the network if it doesn't happen to be locally cached. Since the information is already present in Spotlight, it should be easy to send us a complete CSSearchableItem object instead of just the uniqueIdentifier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe tried to fetch the CSSearchableItem using a CSSearchQuery like this:\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/341078#341078\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to work."
