    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 12 a notification was added to the lock screen that reminds the user that the device is in Do Not Disturb mode. This notification can be dismissed but then it reappears again in only a few hours. Also, this notification lacks the controls of other notifications. It can not be temporarily or permanently disabled\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Turn on do not disturb\n2) Lock the phone\n3) Wake up the screen and see the DND notification\n4) Dismiss the notification\n5) Come back in a few hours to see if it reappeared\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1) Expect the notification to only come back if DND gets disabled and re-enabled\n2) Expect to be able to control the notification like other notifications (i.e. be able to disable it)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1) Notification appears without DND being disabled and re-enabled\n2) Notification cannot be controlled like other notifications (i.e. it canâ€™t be disabled)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
