    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you select the Photos-screensaver and you then select 'Activity', it will never ever refresh the photos you selected then and there. It's an 'Activity' frozen in time, same goes for Favorites and others.\n\nThe way I can refresh it, it is by disabling the screensaver, then selecting 'Activity' again, (do this any number of times, 3 seems to be the golden amount of times you should try it) and then it uses potentially some new photos.\n\nIn the olden days, with photostream technologyÂ®, this just worked. Now with iCloud Photo Library it just seems like an after thought.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Buy ,,appleTV4K\n2. Watch the amazing generated screensavers\n3. Be disappointed there's no Flying Toasters screensaver\n4. Select Photos Screensaver,\n5. Be annoyed that there is no 'Show last photos in screensaver'\n6. Slightly annoyed select 'Activity', although it is never explained what this is\n7. Be amazed that you can view photos in a nice looking screensaver on your tv\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n8. The photo selection constantly updates itself, so you're constantly watching new photos come to life on your tv.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n8. The photos never ever refresh unless you do a manual refresh (or something like it because there is. no. manual. refresh.\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS 12.1, ,,appleTV4K and a fully stocked iCloud Photo Library\n\nWhat also would be fun was just a 'show random pictures from across my whole Library'-screensaver. I get that the new autogenerated screensaver are the current hotness, and they are the sexy, but the photos screensaver is filled with photos of my cats. Kids, I meant kids!\n\n(the Photos.app also sometimes just freezes and needs to be force quit, but I trust that someone else already filed that radar)\n\nGodspeed brave engineer!"
