    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the File Sharing window, the content is designed such that it would nicely resize vertically so as not to require scrolling for the buttons, only for the content, but something is going wrong and it’s scrolling too much.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes.\r\n2. Connect an iOS device.\r\n3. Select the device in iTunes.\r\n4. Go to the File Sharing section in iTunes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe two panes (Apps and [app name] Documents) are just tall enough to fit in the bounds of the iTunes window, and then their content views scroll if they have too many items.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe lists scroll, but the container they’re in also scrolls because it’s too tall for the window. It looks like some resizing math has gone wrong. See attached screen recording. Vertical scroll views inside vertical scroll views is annoying to use.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.9.0.164\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording also uploaded to https://cl.ly/aeae0fd1b3ae"
