    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you use the new dictionary \"Look up\" popover in a web view, and then scroll the web view, the popover doesn't go away or move to follow the scrolled text. This leaves a floating yellow word (and popover) out-of-sync with the web view.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. position the mouse cursor over a word in Safari\r\n2.Press command-control-D\r\n3. Scroll the web view (using your scroll wheel or gestures)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPopover should be dismissed (as it is in TextEdit and non-web text views in other apps) or it should scroll with the web view. (probably best to have it consistent with non-web views)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe web view is scrolled, but the popover (and yellow text) stay still, leaving it out-of-sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe popover is new to Lion. I can't recall whether the Leopard dictionary panel behaved correctly or not, but I suspect it did.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot for a demonstration of the problem. control-command-d was pressed over the underlined word, and then the web view was scrolled. You can see that the yellow word no longer overlays the underlined word."
