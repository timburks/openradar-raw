    description: "macOS offers the possibility to replace the functionality of modifier keys on a system level (see attached screenshot). As iOS gets more and more pro features, I would like to see this as well. I replaced for example the Caps Lock key with the esc key as I'm never typing in SCREAMING CASE and if I do, I'll just use the shift key.\r\nThis is especially useful when ssh-ing into a server and using vim which needs an esc key for its functionality but the iPad keyboard doesn't even have one."
