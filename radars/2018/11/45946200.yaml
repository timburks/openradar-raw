    description: "Area:\r\nContacts\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nContacts Action Plugins (as created via the Xcode Contacs Action Plugin-In project template) no longer work in macOS Mojave.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall any existing commercial Contacts Action Plugin to ~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins (e.g. the one installed by our application \"direct\" - direct.ilink.de), or create such a plugin using the Xcode project template mentioned above and install that.\r\nStart (or restart) Contacts.app.\r\nOpen a contact with properties that are supported by the action plugin (this would be phone numbers for both our plugin (direct.app) and for the example plugin of the Xcode template project.\r\nClick on the title of one of the contact's phone number (e.g. work) to open the action menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu not only contains the default items (Call, Show in Large Type, Message), but also the items defined by the plugin (e.g. \"Dial with direct\" for our plugin or \"Speak ...\" for the Xcode example plugin).\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu only contains the default items (Call, Show in Large Type, Message). The items defined by the plugin are missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.14.1\r\nContacts.app 12.0 (1885)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis does not seem to be configuration related.\r\nNot only can we 100% reproduce this, but also our customers with varying configurations are affected as well."
