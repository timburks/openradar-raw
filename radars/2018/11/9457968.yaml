    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nQuick Look windows normally blur whatever's behind them, just like menus and sheets. But while they're being resized, they don't.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a Quick Look window. (e.g.. highlight an icon in the Finder and press spacebar)\r\n2. Resize the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expected the background of the window to be consistent throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhile the resize operation is occurring, the window does not blur what's behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what pre-Lion behavior was. If it was the same, it wasn't as noticeable. (Probably due to the change in window background color, which was dark grey in Leopard/Snow Leopard, as opposed to the white in Lion.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI suppose this could be an optimization, but is it really necessary? I'd certainly expect my iMac's ATI Radeon HD 4850 to handle it with no problems. Also, sheets have always resized without disabling blurring. (I checked, and sheets in Lion continue to resize without turning off the blurring effect.) So it looks like a bug, as I'd expect sheets to receive the same treatment if it were actually an optimization."
