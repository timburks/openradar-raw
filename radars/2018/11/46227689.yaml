    description: "Area:\r\nCore Bluetooth\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen I open two L2CAP channels with *different* PSM, two channels are opened with *the same* PSM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open both attached Xcode projects (macOS app and iOS app)\r\n2. Run macOS app - it acts as a peripheral that publishes two L2CAP channels. You might need to check in logs what are PSM identifiers for opened channels on your machine (for me it's 193 and 194).\r\n3. In iOS project, if needed, in file `DetailsViewController.swift` change PSM identifiers to match those opened on your machine by the mac app.\r\n4. Run the iOS app\r\n5. Find your Mac on the list of bluetooth devices. Tap it.\r\n6. Tap 'Connect to peripheral' and wait until it's connected\r\n7. Tap 'Open L2Cap channels'\r\n8. In logs, you will see that both channels were opened but they have the same PSM identifier.\r\n9. On the Mac app, click 'Send Event'\r\n10. In logs you will see that Mac app has send data to channel PSM=194. On the iOS app, data is received on channel with PSM=193.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTwo L2Cap channels are opened with different PSM identifiers. When Mac App sends data to channel with PSM=194, same data is received on the iOS app on the channel with the same PSM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS app opens two L2Cap channels with identical PSM. When Mac App sends data to channel with PSM=194, data is received on channel with PSM=193.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niPhone: iOS 12.1\r\nMac: macOS Mojave 10.14.1 (18B75)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 7, 128 GB, Model A1778\r\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2017)"
