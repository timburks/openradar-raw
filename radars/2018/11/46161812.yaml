    description: "Summary:\r\nMacBook Pro screen sometimes goes black, and refuses to wake. The only remedy is to press the power button. Sometimes the fans are very loud, but the computer is unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the computer. Today I have been using Mathematica and Spotify.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nComputer keeps working.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nComputer randomly hangs with a black screen.\r\nSometimes I can go for 6 to 10 days without any issues.\r\nToday (19/11/2018) it hung multiple times in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\r\nMacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nProcessor: 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nGraphics: Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\r\nSerial Number: C02PN1A7G3QN\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:  There are two main theories about the cause of this bug.\r\n\r\n1. There is a bug in /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltNHI.kext Disabling this is supposed to fix the issue. (I have now done this, and will wait to see if the issue manifests again.)\r\nSee here: https://outluch.wixsite.com/rmbp-crash \r\n\r\n2. The CPU is entering an unstable low power state, which triggers the crash.\r\nSee here: https://realmacmods.com/product/macbook-pro-nocrash-utility/"
