    description: "Area:\r\nDisk Utility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen installing Windows via Boot Camp assistant, if the ISO has an install.wim > 4 GB, the installation fails when running Boot Camp assistant.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get yourself a Mac\r\n2. Download a recent Windows ISO from Microsoft that contains multiple editions like \"en_windows_10_business_editions_version_1803_updated_march_2018_x64_dvd_12063333\"\r\n3. Run Boot Camp Assistant, and select that ISO.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBCA will crunch for a while then present the partitioning screen, and after that reboot and start installing Windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is an error about copying files.  There are 2 partitions that are created (one for installing Windows on to, and one that the files are copied on to). The format of the installer partition is FAT32, which only handles files up to 4GB. If I try to manually copy the files from the ISO to the install partition, the copy fails due to the 4.35GB Install.wim file in Sources. If I re-format the install volume as exfat, the files will copy successfully. Also, if I format the BOOTCAMP volume as NTFS and reboot to the install volume, the install succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.14 (389a)"
