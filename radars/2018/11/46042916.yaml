    description: "Desired SDK:\r\nWe would like to see an Apple sanctioned API for accessing device usage data similar to what Screen Time on iOS 12 provides. We envision it being constructed similar to how HealthKit is currently structured with fine-grained permissions that are clearly presented to the user for consent. This API could provide general device usage, such as unlock count, total hours spent using device, as well as fine-grain detail on timestamps of when a user entered and left an app. All of these could be individually granted access to via a permissions prompt similar to HealthKit. We are aware that this is very sensitive data, but we do not believe it is any less important or more of a privacy risk than the data already provided by HealthKit.\r\n\r\nWho We Are:\r\nI am one of the developers behind RescueTime a digital wellness application focused on tracking your digital time and building healthier habits with technology. Over the past 10 years we have been a pioneer in this space and have aided many people in living healthier more aware lives with their digital devices.\r\n\r\nCurrent Scenario:\r\nAt the moment it is possible to gather total device usage and number of lock/unlocks on iOS using a combination of background location tracking and the data protection notifications in UIApplicationDelegate.\r\n\r\nUIApplicationDelegate.applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_ application: UIApplication)\r\nUIApplicationDelegate.applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_ application: UIApplication)\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\nThere are several drawbacks to this approach.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain if this methodology is officially sanctioned by Apple. Shortly after iOS 12 RescueTime, along with a number of other time tracking applications were pulled from the App Store citing violations of section 2.5.4 from the App Store Review Guidelines. (“Your app is misusing background location for purposes other than location-related features and functionality.”). RescueTime, along with most of these other apps were clear in the reason we needed this information and also had a portion of the app dedicated towards displaying how long users used their devices at specific locations, which we believed satisfied the criteria. Since then a number of similar apps have been re-allowed in the App Store which makes this an inconsistent ruling.\r\nIt is unnecessarily invasive and provides unnecessary battery drain. Having a system provided API would make it easier\r\nIt does not provide sufficient detail to those users who would prefer to know how their time is allocated on their device. We would love to be able to provide our users with graphs and charts on how long users spend in each app on their device, not just a total device usage. A HealthKit like API could provide that while remaining secure."
