    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a test that crashes when running on CI but not on local machine. Looking at .xcresult bundle we could not figure out a reason.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at StandardOutputAndStandardError.txt -> It only says “Restarting after unexpected exit or crash”, no reason given.\n2. Looking at the .crash in Attachments -> almost empty apart from the header\n3. Cannot open .logarchive with Console.app (Version 1.0 2.0.52)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. .xcresult bundle should provide logs and crash reports with enough detail to figure out why tests crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. It has not enough information\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that logs do not provide enough information to figure out what was the reason of the crash. Attaching the .xcresult bundle."
