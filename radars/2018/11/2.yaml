    description: "When creating a Siri Shortcut (using NSUserActivity) I supply a suggested invocation phrase with the shortcut. When opening \"Siri and Search\" I can see my shortcuts but the suggested phrase is not visible. However if I press \"See All\" for the shortcuts of my app, I can see \"Suggested Shortcuts\" and \"Recent Shortcuts\". In the \"Recent Shortcuts\" category all the suggested phrases are present, but in \"Suggested Shortcuts\" none of the phrases are present.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Donate shortcut using NSUserActivity and set a suggestedInvocationPhrase\r\n2. Navigate to Settings and \"Siri and Search\" \r\n3. Check shortcut to see if phrase is present \r\n\r\nExpected: \r\nSuggested Phrase should show and user should be given an example of how to name the shortcut\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nIn the suggestions, the phrase is not present"
