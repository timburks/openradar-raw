    description: "Summary:\r\nI migrated an old project (Jan 2017, Swift 3) to Swift 4.2 via Xcodeâ€™s migration helper (launched from a sidebar warning). The migration assistant recommended turning off Swift 3 inference mode for Obj-C, and I agreed. Then I found it was turned on! Had to turn off manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a Swift 3 project, perhaps last edited with Xcode 8.\n2. Click in the Issue Navigator on the recommendation to migrate to Swift 4.2.\n3. Accept the recommendations, including to turn off Swift 3 inference and use explicit Objc annotations instead.\n4. Inspect the project settings: see that Swift 3 inference gets turned on. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwift 3 inference should be off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwift 3 inference is turned on!\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 (10A255)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
