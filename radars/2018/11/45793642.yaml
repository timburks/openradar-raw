Have 2 separate projects open (either in the same workspace or not), for example 2 apps\r\n3. Build both\r\n4. Clean one of the projects\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. The build products project cleaned will be removed, the other one will not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n6. Both build products are removed.
