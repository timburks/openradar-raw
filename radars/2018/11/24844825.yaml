    description: "Summary:\r\nAlways reproducible: go to this URL and watch a PNG unintentionally animated PNG:\r\nhttp://pan.alanhogan.com/ribbon/images/alan-blog-16-flashes-in-safari-saved-by-preview-resized-from-32px-ico.png\r\n\r\nI created a GIF of the buggy result, although the frame rate of the GIF is much too low and the color palette isn't high enough to show an exact recording:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0R092O0z2M3d\r\n\r\nThis may be a hazard to users with epilepsy.\r\n\r\nI created a GIF using Preview. Now Safari and Firefox (but not Chrome) show it as if it were animated!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open favicon.ico (attached!) in Preview\r\n2. Resize it to 16px by 16px (from 32px)\r\n3. File > Export as PNG (with transparency)\r\n4. View your new PNG in the browser (alan-blog-16.png, attached)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe browser should show a small and totally static PNG\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe browser shows a small PNG that throbs/flashes. The medium-brightness parts of the image seem to get a little brighter and then a little dimmer multiple times a second.\r\n\r\nNote that 'crushing' the problematic PNG with software like OptiPNG result in a file that no longer exhibits this bizarre behavior.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.11.3 (15D21)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI haven never seen this before. Is it a bug in a PNG decoder? \r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
