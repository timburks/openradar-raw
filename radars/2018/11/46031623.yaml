    description: "Summary:\r\nAVSpeechSynthesizer appears to behave very strangely when asking it to speak money amounts that starts with $13 or $14. It speaks most money amounts exactly as one would expect. For example, “$42 million” is spoken as “42 million dollars” which is expected. However, it appears to speak incorrectly when the money amount starts with either “$13” or “$14” and ends in either “million”, “billion”, or “trillion”. The number part could be anything from “13.x”, “14.x”, “13x”, “14x”, “13”, “14” where “x” is any digit. This can be reproduced easily using Swift Playgrounds on an iPad. Steps below include some examples and how to reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Playgrounds on iPad\r\n2. Create a new playground and paste in the following code\r\n```\r\nimport AVFoundation\r\n\r\nlet strings = [\r\n    \"$13.3 million\",\r\n    \"$14.3 million\",\r\n    \"$13.3 billion\",\r\n    \"$14.3 billion\",\r\n    \"$134 million\",\r\n    \"$143 million\",\r\n    \"$134 billion\",\r\n    \"$143 billion\",\r\n]\r\n\r\nfor string in strings {\r\n    let utterane = AVSpeechUtterance(string: string)\r\n\r\n    let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()\r\n    synthesizer.speak(utterane)\r\n\r\n    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 3)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Tap on “Run My Code”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following should be spoken:\r\n```\r\n13 point 3 million dollars\r\n14 point 3 million dollars\r\n13 point 3 billion dollars\r\n14 point 3 billion dollars\r\n134 million dollars\r\n143 million dollars\r\n134 billion dollars\r\n143 billion dollars\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe following are actually spoken:\r\n```\r\n13 dollars and 30 cents million\r\n14 dollars and 30 cents million\r\n13 dollars and 30 cents billion\r\n14 dollars and 30 cents billion\r\n134 dollars million\r\n143 dollars million\r\n134 dollars billion\r\n143 dollars billion\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niOS 12.1 (16B92)\r\niPad Pro 11-inch (2018)\r\nLanguage: English (Canada)\r\nRegion: United States"
