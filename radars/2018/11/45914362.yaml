    description: "UIViewController's preferredScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures makes the user swipe twice to pull down the Notifications curtain and the Control Center, rather than have it immediately pull down.\r\n\r\nHowever, the swipe up to exit app gesture is still immediate regardless of the return value. Apps that use multitouch / gestural control (for example, TC-11) easily cause accidental app exiting.\r\n\r\nPlease add a similar 'delay' to the home gesture. It would make sure that exiting the app is always an option for the user, but would really help with games and apps that rely on full screen multitouch experiences."
