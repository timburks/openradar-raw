    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Crackling sound or Distortion in iPhone X Ear Piece Speaker happens when listening to Music or any kind of video where the frequencies of instrument such as the Piano at volume higher than 50% causes the problem to occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Play any music file or music video that contains a keyboard or Piano instrument\r\n2) Put the volume above 50% and listen carefully to the \"EarPiece\" speaker\r\n3) If you do not hear it at first gradually increase the volume\r\n4) At a certain point you can start hearing Buzzing/Crackling/Distortion noise \r\n5) Compare the sound coming from the bottom speaker near the lightning connector OR from a pair of headphones and the latter(bottom speaker/headphones)  plays the sound without the problem stated.\r\n6) If this is a hardware issue then it would have been fixed but from many Apple users who have expressed their problem on Apple Support Communities this doesn't seem to be the case since they have already got their iPhone X's and 8's in some cases replaced and the issue still persists. Also the hardware check has come out fine\r\n7) I too went to my Apple Authorized Service Provider and they did a full check and everything passed. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Speaker volume should not affect the listening sound ! \r\nAnd the occurrence of Crackling/Buzzing/Distortion should not happen !\r\nI can understand at max volume the \"bass\" has a jarring effect but that's not the issue here and the bass of musical pieces has no problem! \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Speaker Crackling is more prominent when you play an Instrumental of a KeyBoard/ Piano Instrument.\r\n\r\nI have Harmon/Kardon headphones and I also listened to the \"bottom speaker\" next to the lightning connector and they don't experience such issues.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X playing music via the Speakers inbuilt\r\nComments"
