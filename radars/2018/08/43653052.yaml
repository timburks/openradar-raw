    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to rename Swift symbols through Xcode's refactoring tools always fails with the message, \"refactoring engine ranges didn't match initial ranges.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe bug seems to only appear in certain projects. â€‹I attached the logs while attempting to refactor after starting Xcode with `SOURCEKIT_SERVICE_LOG=3 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode 2>&1 | tee /tmp/sk-log.txt`.  An Apple engineer at WWDC 2018 suggested logging the issue this way. Restarting Xcode, cleaning the project, nor clearing the derived data folder work to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRenaming a Swift symbol through Xcode should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error alert pops up with the message, \"refactoring engine ranges didn't match initial ranges.\"\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1; Swift 4.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nN/A"
