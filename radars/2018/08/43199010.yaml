    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading an iOS application that uses the new INPlayMediaIntent type, App Store Connect rejects the upload with the following error:  ERROR ITEMS-90625: \"Invalid Intent Extension. The NSExtensionAttributes key in the \"MyAppIntents\" Info.plist file can't contain the intent name \"INPlayMediaIntent\".\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Obtain an Xcode project for an iOS application that has an Intents extension that is fully-configured to support INPlayMediaIntents, including the required Info.plist keys and values, wherein a value of \"INPlayMediaIntent\" **must** be included among the \"IntentsSupported\" values under \"NSExtensionAttributes\" under \"NSExtension\" [see the attached sample project].\r\n2. Using Xcode 10, export an archive and upload it to App Store Connect.\r\n3. BUG: The upload is rejected with the error message listed above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe upload should succeed without this error, as the intents extension cannot handle INPlayMediaIntents without this exact Info.plist configuration.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe upload is rejected with the above error.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10 (latest beta)\r\nApp Store Connect (production)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nXcode 10 (latest beta)\r\nApp Store Connect (production)"
