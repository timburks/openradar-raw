    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using \"command + left arrow\" or \"command + right arrow\" in the URL bar, Safari will respectively go back / forward in the page history instead of moving the cursor at the beginning / end of the URL.\n\nThis is inconsistent with the way command + left / right works in any other text field, and with the way alt + left / right works in this same very field.\nAlso, it depends on whether the page has any history at all. For example, command + right works fine (ie. goes to the end of the text) until the user goes back in the history, making going forward in history possible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a page, and click at least a link to have at least one page in history to go back to\n2. Click in the URL bar\n3. Place the cursor anywhere in the URL\n4. Press command + left arrow\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor moves to the beginning of the URL\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari goes back in the history, reloading the previous page and removing focus from the URL bar.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.1.2 (13605.3.8)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
