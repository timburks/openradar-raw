    description: "The MDM protocol allows for the installing of signed .pkgs to macOS clients via the InstallApplication command as per p54 of here:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/enterprise/documentation/MDM-Protocol-Reference.pdf\r\n\r\nHowever Profile Manager can currently only install .apps via the InstallApplication command, not .pkgs. It'd be really great if Profile Manager enabled .pkgs to be pushed to clients as that would allow for full hands-off setup for the following things that Profile Manager can't currently control on DEP registered Macs:\r\n\r\n- configuration of services that can't be controlled by \"$ defaults write...\" and therefore can't be controlled within the Custom Settings section of Profile Manager. Examples of this would be creating >1 local admin account, enabling Apple Remote Desktop, enabling SSH etc.\r\n\r\n- installing of macOS clients that are used to distribute software eg. munki (which isn't just a .app, but also UNIX executables & launchd daemons)\r\n\r\nAs it is, any institution who need to issue any non-Mac App Store (VPP) apps, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud (not to mention hundreds of others), can't deploy Macs in a hands off style using Profile Manager (whereas the MDM protocol would allow for it). And as such, each Mac needs to be setup manually after the DEP handshake (because no remote method such as ARD / SSH can be enabled in MDM using Profile Manager)."
