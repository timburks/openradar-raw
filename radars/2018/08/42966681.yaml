    description: "Summary:\r\nRegarding the bug report number 42881405, please provide an API for designating an app using AVPlayer/AVQueuePlayer as \"audio-only\" (with the ability to stream audio with good performance).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse an AVPlayer to stream just audio to an Apple TV.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMaybe checking if the `MPMediaItemPropertyMediaType` is of type MPNowPlayingInfoMediaType.audio could be a solution.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI need to set `allowsExternalPlayback` property of an AVPlayer/AVQueuePlayer to `false` to disallow the routing of video playback to AirPlay, and (as a side-effect) allows the pure audio playback.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
