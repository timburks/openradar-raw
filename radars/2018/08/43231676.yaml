    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using large navigation titles together with opaque bars, scrolling & content insets are jumpy and scrolling to top ends up with a huge navigation bar.\r\n\r\nProblem becomes even more apparent with a search controller attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITableViewController with enough cells to scroll\r\n2. Create a UINavigationController, set its navigation bar to prefer large titles and set translucency to false.\r\n3. Scroll up, scroll down, tap on the status bar to scroll to top. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth content inset & offset behavior as with translucent bars.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGlitchy content insets & offsets, especially when tapping scroll to top.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone X and iPhone X simulator."
