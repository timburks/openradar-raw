    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing disappearing NSToolbar buttons in our application. I created a sample test app to help reproduce (included screenshot, executable, and project).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch test app, it opens a window with 2 toolbar buttons.\r\n2. Click on Test1 button, another window opens.\r\n3. Notice on the first window, the Test1 button is now missing it's image.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nReproduced on macOS10.14b6 and b7., and Xcode9.4 (latest production version, no betas).\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n1. Button Test1 is a \"static\" button (which is shared with other windows). Test2 button is local and is not shared. \r\n2. Moving the window that's missing a button to a second monitor \"fixes\" the missing button.\r\n3. This problems happens with existing apps, compiled with a previous Xcode a while ago.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we could move our buttons to not be static, but that duplicate the buttons in memory."
