    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe required scenario for this issue to occur is to have a view controller presented as a popover on top of another view controller, which has a text field that is the first responder, and the software keyboard is on the screen. Under these conditions, if the popover view controller is dismissed in an animated fashion (using `dismiss(animated:completion:)`) then the software keyboard will become unresponsive (stop responding to taps) while the dismissal animation is in progress.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Have a view controller with a `UITextField`.\r\n- Make text field first responder (with active software keyboard).\r\n- Present a view controller as a popover on this first view controller.\r\n- While text field is still first responder, dismiss the popover.\r\n- While the dismiss animation is in progress, attempt to type using the software keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- Keyboard is responsive during dismiss animation and results in text being entered into the text field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Keyboard does not respond to taps during the dismiss animation.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.1.1, built with iOS 11.4 SDK, Xcode 9.4.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 5s"
