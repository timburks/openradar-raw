    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen booting to recovery mode, Terminal application will not provide a usable Terminal window.  System displays the dialog \"Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator was found\".  Clicking OK to this dialog displays an authentication dialog that appears for only a brief moment: I had to use 240FPS recording on iPhone to confirm it.  After this click, nearly all menu options are grayed out, including the one that would be most useful: Shell: New Window.  Terminal.app cannot be quit, system must be restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigured 2018 15\" MBPro via DEP: InstallApplication pkg from MDM installs and configures munki, script to name device by serial. Bootstrapped device then installs many more pkg via munki, including NoMAD, NoLoAD and a local administrator account. Final result: first user to log in is a domain user, NoLoAD configures a local account.  This user receives secureToken as expected, pkg created local administrator doesn't.\r\nReboot device into Recovery or Internet Recovery mode.  Select Terminal from the macOS Utilities app. A dialog appears that says \"Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator was found\".\r\nThis dialog appears twice.  Upon dismissing the first dialog, a macOS authentication dialog briefly appears and disappears. This can be repeated by dismissing the 2nd instance of this dialog.  No Terminal window can be opened, restarting the device is the only option to continue, Terminal cannot be quit.\r\n\r\nA very similar behavior can be induced from Recovery and selecting Startup Security Utility.  A dialog stating \"Authentication Needed. You will need to authenticate as an Administrator to change the boot security settings. [Enter macOS Password...]\" appears.  If I click the only dialog, I reproduce the \"Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator was found.\" dialog and cannot enter SSU.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRecovery mode to macOS Utilities -> Terminal will bring a usable Terminal window (or Startup Security Utility window).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCannot open a Terminal or SSU window.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n2018 15\" MBPro\r\n\r\nA video of this is available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/vohde2zgs1eygt7/T2macrecoverymode.MOV?dl=0"
