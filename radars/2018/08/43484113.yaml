    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the US English keyboard on an iPad on iOS 11, in the keyboard view with numbers and punctuation, the second row has @ with £ above it, then # with € above it. Doing the swipe-down gesture on the @ key produces a €, while doing that gesture on the # key produces a £, rather than vice versa. \r\n\r\nTapping the  #+- key correctly shows (and produces) € on the first key and £ on the second.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect English (US) keyboard layout\r\nTap the .?123 key\r\nSwipe down on the @ key which shows a £ above it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA £ should be typed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA € is typed\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis happens with English (US) but not English (Australia)"
