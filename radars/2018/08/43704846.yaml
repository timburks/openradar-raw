    description: "Area:\r\nSwift\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCreating a subclass of NSTextField in Swift and overriding the string properties (getters and setters) in Swift results in the getters not being called on render.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subclass NSTextField in Swift\r\n2. Override the stringValue or attributedStringValue property with a getter and setter. Store in another property for later return.\r\n3. Create an NSTextField in Interface Builder\r\n4. Set the NSTextField to be an instance of your subclass\r\n5. In code, update the stringValue or attributedStringValue \r\n5. Run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nValue of the text field should change; getters and setters are both called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nValue of the text field does not change. Setter is called but getter is never called.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.4.1, Swift 4.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nYou can also place a breakpoint in the getter and see that it is not called."
