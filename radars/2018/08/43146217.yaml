    description: "Summary:\r\nEnterprise accounts on Box can require passcodes, which is supported in their API, but seems like this is not yet a supported case on UIDocumentBrowserViewController - at least based on Box support:\n\nhttps://community.box.com/t5/Mobile-Troubleshooting/Known-Limitations-with-the-Box-Files-App-Integration/ta-p/44658\n\n>This is because there is currently no way to enforce passcode rules on the Files app.\n\nThis is limiting our users on PDF Viewer, as other apps in this category use their own file handling code and can trivially support passcode entering.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload pdfviewer.io\nUse Box Enterprise account (I can’t help here, but I’m sure Apple has relations to Box…)\nObserve that File extension can’t be used\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBox Enterprise should be supported\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBox Enterprise is not supported\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1 and 12b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://community.box.com/t5/Mobile-Troubleshooting/Known-Limitations-with-the-Box-Files-App-Integration/ta-p/44658"
