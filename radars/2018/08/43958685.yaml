    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a intent extension conforming to INPlayMediaIntentHandling protocol calls handler method's completion block with INPlayMediaIntentResponseCode.handleInApp response code, iOS doesn't wake the app in the background but asks the user to open the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Build and run the attached project on a device or on the simulator. (http://media.digitalia.fm/MediaShortcut.zip)\r\n2 - Press the button to record a voice command for the shortcut. \r\n3 - Exit the app and lock the device\r\n4 - Invoke siri with the recorded voice command\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should be awaken in the background and application(_ application: UIApplication, willContinueUserActivityWithType should be invoked so the app can begin playing the media item in the background with no user interaction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSystem displays the message \"Sorry, there was a problem with the app\" and presents a button to open the app. If the user touches the button, TouchID confirmation is asked and then the app is opened in the foreground and willContinueUserActivityWithType is invoked.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 beta 12 (16A5366a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on iPhone 6s, iPhone X and Simulator\r\n\r\nAttachment: http://media.digitalia.fm/MediaShortcut.zip"
