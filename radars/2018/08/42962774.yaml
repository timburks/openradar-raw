    description: "Summary:\r\nHidden photos appear in the search page in photos. They are both in the count on a result, and the thumbnail of the result (if the photo is the first). This is not correct behaviour. \r\n\r\nUpon selecting the result and drilling into the detail view the hidden photo is obviously not present. This is correct behaviour. \r\n\r\nHidden photos should not appear accidentally in search results as this can have unintended consequences and ultimately defeats the purpose of hidden photos. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave hidden photo. Search for term related to the photo. It appears in the thumbnail for the category/event/location and the count. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHidden photos are not present in the thumbnail or count of photos. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHidden photos are present in the thumbnail and count"
