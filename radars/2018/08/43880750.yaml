    description: "// This is a usability bug but is not related to UI.\r\n\r\n[Summary]\r\nmacOS started supporting HEIF since High Sierra. However, till now (Mojave 18A371a) its built-in automatic image processing tools (like sips and automator.app) still couldn't batch-convert images to HEIF format.\r\n\r\n[Steps to Reproduce]\r\n//Open the system built-in Automator app and use the \"change type of images\" command.\r\n//Use this command in terminal:\r\n\tsips -s format heif input.jpg --out output.heic\r\n\r\n[Expected Results]\r\n//The batch image type conversion function in the macOS (whether in Terminal and Automator) should support the HEIF as target output format.\r\n//The terminal command should works without problem.\r\n\r\n[Actual Results]\r\n//HEIF is not supported by that built-in command in Automator app.\r\n//Terminal says \"Error: Unsupported output format heif.\"\r\n\r\n[Version/Build]\r\n18A371a\r\n\r\n[Configuration]\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\r\n\r\n[Notes]\r\nI know Preview.app now supports this function. However, the preview.app requires opening all files-to-convert at the same time to do this. What if someone has thousands of PNG files (like screenshots) to convert to HEIF? In this case the preview.app couldn't handle that many of files."
