    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently it is only possible to specify a title or an image for UIDocumentBrowserAction. The image property is only supported when the action is shown in the navigation bar.\n\nIt should also be possible to provide a custom view that is used when a UIDocumentBrowserAction is shown in the navigation bar. Since the action most likely uses a UIBarButtonItem under the hood, this could by made possible by taking advantage of UIBarButtonItem.init(customView: UIView).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a UIDocumentBrowserAction with a navigation bar availability.\n- Add the action to customActions of UIDocumentBrowserViewController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is possible to provide a custom view, that is used instead of text or an image when using UIDocumentBrowserAction.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible to provide a custom view. It is only possible to use either a text or an image when using UIDocumentBrowserAction.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1 & 12b5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
