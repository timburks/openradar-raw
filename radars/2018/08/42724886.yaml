    description: "It would be really great if the Alarm app supported triggering a Siri Intent, specifically a INPlayMediaIntent.\r\n\r\nThis would allow audio apps that publish these intents to be used as the alarm sound.\r\n\r\nFor example, I could set the Intent to something in my app that triggers playback of a radio station, then at 8am when the alarm goes off iOS would trigger that intent, which would open the app and playback the station."
