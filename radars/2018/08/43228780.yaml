    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to change the color of the title displayed on a UIViewController that’s embedded in a UINavigationController, it doesn’t work as expected when tapping the back button but it does when dismissing the UIViewController with a swipe.\n\nThe scenario is the following:\n- Every UIViewController is pushed on the same UINavigationController\n- VC 1 has the title in color red\n- VC 2 (pushed on the navigationController) has the title in black\n\nIf the user dismisses the VC 2 by performing a swipe to go back, the title on VC 1 is correclty set to red. On the other hand, if the user taps on the “< Back” button on the UINavigationController on VC2, the title on VC1 is still black.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHaving the following hierarchy: UINavigationController > UIViewController (VC1) > UIViewController (VC2):\n\n- Set the titleTextAttributes on VC 1 to red on viewDidLoad\n- Set the titleTextAttributes on VC 2 to black on viewWillAppear\n- Set the titleTextAttributes on VC2 to red on viewWillDisappear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe title on the VC 1 should always be red\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe VC 1 has the title in black if the user tapped the “< Back” button and in red if the user swiped to dismiss.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.4.1, Xcode 9.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFollowing this patter on viewWillAppear/viewWillDisappear, the tintColor for example behaves as expected."
