    description: "Locale.current is custom and specific to the app's supported localizations. However, the system keyboard ignores the localization of the current app, and respects the global language and region settings to determine things like the decimal separator used in a keyboard type of .decimalPad.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\nUser A, their system region is set to Germany, and system languages are (in order of preference) - German and English.\r\n\r\nAn app that is localized only in English, when asks Locale for currentLocale, is returned a locale with locale identifier \"en_DE\"  - English (Germany).\r\n\r\nIn the same app, if a system keyboard of type .decimalPad is used for entering a currency amount, the user is presented with a keyboard that has a comma (,) as the decimal separator, which is the correct separator for Germany. Let's say the user enters the amount as â‚¬ 27,45\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to parse the text from the same text field, if a number formatter configured with Locale.current is used, it incorrectly parses the currency amount as 2745 (instead of 27,45) because the en_DE locale expects the decimal separator to be a period \".\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no great way for third party apps to deal with this. The only way I've found to deal with this, is to try to guess what locale the system keyboard is using internally, by looking at the user's preferred languages, region, and constructing a custom locale from that."
