    description: "Area:\r\nSiriKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAlways reproducible on iOS hardware. Only sometimes reproducible on iOS simulator if another app was recently deleted that could handle the same intent.\r\n\r\nUse of LocalAuthentication via LAContext is broken when used inside the handle method of an Intents Extension intent handler.\r\nThe LocalAuthentication example from this wwdc video, https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/228/ , will not work in iOS 12 beta 5 or 6 running on the two hardware devices I've tested on (iPhone 5s and iPhone X).\r\n\r\nI've created a sample project that showcases this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEither launch the sample app scheme on a physical device running the latest iOS 12 beta, or launch the intents extension scheme on a physical device running the latest iOS 12 beta.\r\n\r\nIf the app is installed on a device and Siri is setup, you can simply say \"Hey Siri, lock my car\", and then it will prompt you for consent, and then the error occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRunning this same code on a device running iOS 11 works. I'm trying to ship code using Siri shortcuts in time for the iOS 12 release and this is killing us.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLocalAuthentication fails with the error:\r\nError Domain=com.apple.LocalAuthentication Code=-1004 \"User interaction is required.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=User interaction is required.}\r\n\r\nAlso, weird bug occurs on the simulator when LocalAuthentication \"works\" - the entire screen goes black but the status bar still is shown. Pressing Home brings the user back to the Siri user interface.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 beta 6 (16A5345f)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X simulator from Xcode 10 Beta 6: Default simulator setup with FaceID \"enrolled\" checked.\r\niPhone 5s: Siri is enabled and hey siri is configured, touchID is enabled with one fingerprint enrolled.\r\niPhone X: Siri is enabled and hey siri is configured. FaceID is enabled with a face enrolled."
