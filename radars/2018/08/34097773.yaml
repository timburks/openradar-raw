    description: "Area:\r\nMessages Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIdentityLookup API sends a valid non-spam text to \"SMS Junk\" if any SMS from the same sender was previously (correctly) filtered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a filter keyword to \"cashback\" (cashback is just an example) using the sample app used in https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/249/ or using my own http://verosms.com\r\n\r\n2. Send an SMS from an unknown number to your device with a text like: \"This is a test SMS containing cashback\".\r\n\r\n3. Send another SMS from that same number with text like \"This is a normal SMS\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text containing the keyword \"cashback\" should be under \"SMS Junk\" section in Messages app and the text \"This is a normal SMS\" should be visible under \"iMessage & SMS\" section.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nBoth filtered SMS and non-filtered SMS are grouped together under \"SMS Junk\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11 - iOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs seen in the attached screenshot, the 1st sms from the sender \"DZ-bytwoo\" was correctly filtered because it contained the keyword \"cashback\". The 2nd SMS however, was incorrectly filtered even though it didn't match any filter just because it was sent from the same sender.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone X 64Gb"
