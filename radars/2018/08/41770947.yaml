    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis should be considered a \"duplicate\" of Radar 41374087 as per Quinn's recommendation in the Developer Forums here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/news?streamSource=connections&streamID=629560\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have our app integrated with a third party crash reporting system, \"Fabric\" which is reporting this issue crashing our production application for our users nearly 2000 times over the past 90 days, so would very much like to stress the importance of getting this addressed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSadly we have been unable to reproduce this locally, but it seems to be related to iCloud file activity for us.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo crashing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThousands of our production users are suffering from crashes daily due to this issue and we have no workaround.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSeems present in iOS 11 and  iOS 12.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone's and iPads running iOS 11 and iOS 12"
