    description: "With High Sierra, MacOS has stoped using ntpd for time sync and now only uses timed. I noticed that timed does not support any arguments and gains its information either from using the Date & Time pane in System Prefs or by using the terminal command \"systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver\". It looks like it still stores the time server names in /etc/ntp.conf. However it looks like timed will only check the first line in ntp.conf regardless of how many servers are listed in the conf file.\r\n\r\nEg. in my organization by default our office NTP server is the primary server for security purposes. This server is not available to the public, so a secondary server is required (time.apple.com) for computers to use when out of office. Tried setting the secondary server with a comma value in the GUI or by manually editing the ntp.conf file. It appears that timed will only check the first line of ntp.conf -- it never checks the secondary server if the primary server is unavailable."
