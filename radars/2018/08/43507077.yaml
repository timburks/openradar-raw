    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn creation an object of PHAssetChangeRequest class the System asks a user to allow to modify a photo via an alert popup. We've observed that this alert doesn't have ability to be localized through Info.plist (there is no key for that at all) and under some circumstances is wrong localized (has a wrong language, not language that the user has selected in iOS Settings) by the System itself. To fix the issue the device has to be rebooted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change iOS Language in Settings (any language, only one requirement that language differs from language that was when system booted up )\r\n2. Create instance of PHAssetChangeRequest to request the alert message\r\n3. Observe alert localization\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSame language that the iOS System has\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nHas the language that iOS used after booted up.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nAny iOS 11\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices that we tested with."
