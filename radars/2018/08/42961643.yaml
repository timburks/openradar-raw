    description: "Summary:\r\nBundle(for:) on a a generic UIView subclass contained in a framework returns the main app bundle rather than the framework bundle. \r\n\r\nWhen registering cell nibs this causes a crash as it attempts to load them from the wrong place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Compile using Xcode 10 (Version 10.0 beta 5 (10L221o))\r\n2. Run on a device running iOS 10 or 11\r\n3. Crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBundle(for) should return the bundle the class was defined in, and no crash should occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUnder iOS 10 or 11 the bundle returned is always the main app bundle. A test project has been attached which under iOS 10 or 11 will crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10 (Version 10.0 beta 5 (10L221o))\r\nOSX High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
