    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we try changing content of clipboard from UI test code, the UIPasteboard.UIPasteboardChanged notification does not fire.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have an app that observes UIPasteboard.UIPasteboardChanged notification\n2. Launch UI test XCUIApplication().launch()\n3. From UI test change contents of clipboard, e.g. UIPasteboard.general.string = “value”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. UIPasteboard.UIPasteboardChanged is fired inside the app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. No notification is received, but the content of clipboard is updated\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround is to poll the contents of the clipboard and check for changed values manually."
