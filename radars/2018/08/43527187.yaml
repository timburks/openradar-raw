    description: "Summary:\r\nI’m developing on a retina display, but SceneKit still defaults to 4x multisampling, which causes massive performance issues for even the simplest of scenes at anything but the smallest sizes on my 2014 rMBP 13”. Thus, I’d really love an option to disable anti-aliasing or even set other scale factors for the editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Have a not-super-amazing computer\n1. Create a simple scene with a light, a camera, and a sphere\n2. Have the scene editor fill an area of e.g. 2 million pixels\n3. Try moving around\n4. Notice that performance is terrible\n5. Look for options to adjust the rendering quality\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere are options to adjust anti-aliasing (none, 4x, etc.) and render scale (full, half, etc.).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are no such options to be found anywhere. Sadness ensues.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 6 (but happens on non-beta too)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue is not related to the beta, despite me using one right now. It’s been an issue ever since the introduction of SceneKit and its editor."
