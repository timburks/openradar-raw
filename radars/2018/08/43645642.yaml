    description: "Summary:\r\nNSUserNotificationCenter.default is declared as a non-null property but returns null. Furthermore Swift seems happy with it and doesn’t throw any errors.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun this swift script (attached)\n\n——————————\n#!/usr/bin/swift\n\nimport Foundation \n\nlet notification = NSUserNotification()\nnotification.title = \"Wow\"\nlet center = NSUserNotificationCenter.default\ncenter.deliver(notification)\n———————\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect NSUserNotificationCenter.default to throw an exception because I would argue that it is programmer error to be trying to get a UserNotificationCenter for a script/app/whatever that doesn’t have a bundle ID. (It appears that having a bundle ID is a prerequisite to being able to send notifications).\n\nThe fact that it returns null breaks the nullability contract on NSUserNotificationCenter.default.\n\nFurthermore I would expect the swift side of things to error when I attempted to use the returned “center”.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCenter gets returned NULL.\ncenter.deliver does not crash and there is no indication that anything failed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGOOGLER:dmaclach"
