    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Xcode encounters a recursive path like `$(SRCROOT)/some_dir/**` in `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` or `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`, the recursion is translated into relative paths — as can be verified by looking at the actual compiler invocations:\r\n\r\nAssuming `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = \"$(SRCROOT)/some_dir\"/** $(inherited)` and `some_dir` containing the subdirectories `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`, the list of include directives for any compiler invocation would contain `-Isome_dir -Isome_dir/bar -Isome_dir/baz -Isome_dir/foo` engulfed by any other includes.\r\n\r\nThis would not be a problem, if Xcode 10’s autocompletion code wouldn’t assert that include paths be absolute. But since it does, typing `#include <` or `#import <`, and invoking auto-completion to help you type the correct file path crashes Xcode in any source file that belongs to any target with such a search path.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, `#include \"` and `#import \"` seem to be more resilient: here, auto completion does not seem to consider the search paths at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project\r\n2. in `RecursiveInclusion.m`, add an `#import <` or `#include <` directive and invoke auto-completion to fill in the file name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto completion suggests the filename `really.h` as well as the directories `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes with\r\n\r\n```\r\nASSERTION FAILURE in /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/DVTFrameworks/DVTFrameworks-14317.13.3/DVTFoundation/FilePaths/DVTFilePath.m:908\r\nDetails:  Path must be absolute but is not: some_dir\r\nObject:   <DVTFilePath>\r\nMethod:   +filePathForPathString:\r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.0 (14320.12.2)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
