    description: "Summary: The macOS Contacts application seems to get stuck up so that contacts are not synced. They appear on my iPhone and on the iCloud web portal, but changes refuse to happen on my MacBook Pro. I have tried restarting the computer, logging in and out of iCloud, turning off and on the Contacts option in under \"Accounts\" in System Preferences, in different orders. I've even tried booting in Safe Mode, and it doesn't seem to work (everything else is showing up).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: The one time it seemed to clear up is after I went through and deleted most (if not all) of the contact pictures in my address book.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All contacts should properly sync with iCloud (and update \"automatically\").\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: iCloud only demonstrates a one-way sync (at most) from MBP to iCloud, but not vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Version 11.0 (1808.7)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
