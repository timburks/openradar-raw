    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNavigation bar breaks when view controller (configured with large title and also tableView refresh control isRefreshing) is pushed to the navigation stack (using NavigationController).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new view controller (from now on, VC2), give it a title and set `navigationController?.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = true`.\r\nAdd a table view as its main view, add a refresh control to the table view and in viewDidLoad call `refreshControl.beginRefreshing()`.\r\n\r\nPush VC2 into a current navigation (ie: create a NavigationController, set VC1 as root, VC1 can only have 1 button which action is to push VC2).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVC2 shows the spinning activity indicator on top (as it does when pull to refresh).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe activity indicator is not shown and the navigation bar layout (or viewController layout) is broken.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.4"
