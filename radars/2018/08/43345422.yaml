    description: "Area:\r\nIdentityLookup Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nILClassificationResponse currently has a userInfo property which accepts and passes only JSON encoded data. This is fine when it comes to reporting via a web API call, but when reporting spam via SMS message to a number, it simply shows the SMS compose screen with raw JSON string in the body text field. (check attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because regulators such as TRAI in India expect the SMS to be reported using a certain format. The format in this case is: \r\n\r\n“The Unsolicited Commercial Communication, XXXXXXXXXX, dd/mm/yy”\r\n\r\nMore info can be found here: http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/How%20to%20Register%20complaint.pdf\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReport any SMS as junk using the Unwanted Communication Reporting Extension with `ILClassificationExtensionSMSReportDestination` in `Info.plist` set to any phone number.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA way to send the response in plain text to the compose SMS screen so the compose SMS screen is able to show the correct format required by regulator. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompose SMS screen shows the response in the message body in raw JSON format.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 Beta 6\r\n\r\nScreenshot: https://cl.ly/1x2H0E282y2B"
