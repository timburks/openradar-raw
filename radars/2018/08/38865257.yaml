    description: "At Hudl we are working on an application that uses HLS to play video from an Event Playlist. The Event Playlist is created while a sport event is happening. We also need to record the video as it is being downloaded so the user can share it and watch it after the game.\r\n\r\nWe have been researching the option to download the ts segments and play them locally instead of playing the remote feed directly. We have a client on macOS and this is what we do; the ts segments are appended to a large ts file and that file is being played directly from the macOS app.\r\n\r\nHowever, playing ts containers is iOS is not supported. The option we're evaluating is to have a local http server that would serve those ts segments. We think it would be a very interesting feature if iOS could play local ts files as macOS does."
