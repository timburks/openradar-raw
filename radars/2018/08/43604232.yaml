    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMy program Find Any File, with several ten thousands of installations, crashes in Mojave beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen System Preferences, General, and make sure that \"Show scroll bars\" is set to \"Always\".\r\n\r\nGet the program from the MAS or from here: http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/index.php\r\n\r\nLaunch it, then use menu File -> Open Saved Search...\r\nType the Esc key or click cancel in the file selection dialog.\r\nThis leads to a crash of the app.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n10.14 Beta (18A371a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAppears to happen on any system - I had this reported by several users, and everyone I asked could reproduce it.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis program is made with Xojo (Version 2017r2.1). Xojo provides their own framework, and it's not unlikely that they have a bug in their code that leads to this crash, such as an over-release or related issue that occurs only after having closed the file selector dialog.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I cannot simply rebuild the app with a fixed version provided by Xojo because it's a 32 bit app and I am not allowed to post 32 bit apps, even simple bug fixes, to the MAS any more. So this version remains stuck in the MAS until I can make a 64 bit version available, which is still taking a lot of work as I am rewriting it all in Xcode properly.\r\n\r\nIt may be well beyond the release of Mojave before I can submit the new version in the MAS. Which means that with the release of Mojave, Find Any File might be crashing on anyone's Mac, and I cannot provide a quick fix for it myself due to the fact that I am not able to submit 32 bit apps any more.\r\n\r\nSince this kind of crash did never occur in any previous macOS version (pre-10.14) with my program, a recent change in Mojave must have triggered this issue, i.e. it might be seen as a regression.\r\n\r\nOther programs of mine, and probably other Xojo-made programs as well, show the same crash, such as iClip, BTW.\r\n\r\nIf you look into fixing this, I'd care only for a fix for 32 bit apps, because that's where there's the pressure from the App Store.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSurprise! The issue may not be related to Xojo, after all! I was just using BBEdit 10.5.13 on Mojave, and ran into the same kind of crash when using \"Save As...\". Could this be related to using an older API for the file dialogs that both Xojo v2017r2 and BBEdit 10 use? Maybe a Carbon / HI... related function that got again broken in Mojave?"
