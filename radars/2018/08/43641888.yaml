    description: "We often had users (surprisingly, mostly teachers) that will go for long periods without using their iOS device. In this scenario, they usually forget their passcode and we are unable to unlock the device from an MDM command because the device will not connect to wifi after it has powered on in a locked state. This can be very difficult for users in remote locations as we need to send a technician out to connect the device to ethernet or worse, wipe the device.\r\n\r\nIn a similar scenario, often when users forget their passcode on a device that is connected to wifi, they try to hard restart the device—as if somehow that will fix that they've forgotten their passcode. The device will then not connect to wifi in this post-power-on locked state.\r\n\r\nWe need the ability to allow in MDM, via configuration profile to prevent this \"Wifi Restriction Mode\"—similar to the restriction functionality that lets us \"Allow USB restricted mode\" for supervised iOS devices running 11.3 and later.\r\n\r\nAdding this feature would make Wifi restriction controls consistent with what has been allowed for USB.\r\n\r\nThank you."
