    description: "(First, thanks for NSGridView support in Interface Builder - it's excellent!)\r\n\r\nI'm currently building a fairly complex set of panels that can change based upon a user's selection. They share common components and layouts. \r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if Interface Builder let me construct a single `NSGridRow` with child cells, but without being directly associated with a parent `NSGridView`. This would let me load shared rows from storyboards and XIBs, and be super useful.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!"
