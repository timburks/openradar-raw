    description: "Summary:\r\nBehaviors are great! Reports are great! Please combine those two.\n\nWith Reports I mean the Gauges one can see in Xcode in the Debug Navigator when a debug session is running. You know the ones that can show how much CPU and Memory my App is using.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\n2. Select: 'Xcode > Behaviors > Edit Behaviors'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a setting that allows to navigate to the report as soon as the debugging session starts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe setting is missing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.1 (9B55)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
