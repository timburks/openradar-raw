    description: "Summary:\r\nDear Xcoderinos,\n\nThanks for your work on refactoring support in Xcode. Generally, it’s quite nice, but it has a serious bug related to IBActions. If I use the Rename refactoring on an IBAction in a Swift source file, Xcode changes the actions of controls that it shouldn’t change!\n\nFor example, create an NSTextField and an NSButton in a storyboard. Connect the NSTextField to action fieldDidFire. Connect the NSButton to action buttonDidFire. Then use the Rename refactoring to rename fieldDidFire to blergDidFire. In the storyboard, Xcode changes both the NSTextField and the NSButton to send the blergDidFire action, even though the buttonDidFire action shouldn’t have been affected in any way.\n\nI will attach my test project and a video demonstrating the problem in that project.\n\nLove,\nRob\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 10.0 beta 6 (10L232m)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
