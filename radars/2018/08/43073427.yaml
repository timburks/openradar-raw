    description: "Area:\r\nPhotos Framework\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/_patmurray/status/1026639433536233472?s=20\r\n\r\n\"It would be cool if UIKit had some more privacy focused components added similar to SafariVC. For example a QR code reader so that bike share apps don't need to request camera permission\"\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nToday, if an app wants to scan the occasional QR codes (for example, Bike Sharing apps) then the app must request camera permissions. As access to the camera requires user permission to be granted, it is already considered private. For camera apps it makes sense to give them unlimited camera access, but a bike sharing app it doesn't. The system should, therefore, provide UI elements that apps can hand off to in order to perform this (and similar) functions. \r\n\r\nThis could be like on the web, the difference between a webpage that embeds the camera feed in the page and one that asks the system to take a photo and just hand back the results."
