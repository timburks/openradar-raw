    description: "Summary:\r\nThe shortcuts beta is missing the X-Callback parameters that are laid out in the spec (http://x-callback-url.com/specifications/). Without these parameters, apps that are opened with the “Open X-Callback URL” action have no way to give control back to the Shortcuts app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Shortcut in the Shortcuts beta with the following actions:\n\n1. URL\n2. Open X-Callback URL\n\nThe URL should be one of a third party app that supports x-callback-url (http://x-callback-url.com/apps/).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe URL should be opened with `x-success`, `x-error`, and `x-cancel` query items appended to it. The values of those query items should conform to the X-Callback URL specification (http://x-callback-url.com/specifications/).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe URL that is opened is exactly the same URL that is given as input. No X-Callback parameters are appended.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis was correctly done in the Workflow app. The action made it through the transition from Workflow to Shortcuts, but this issue prevents the action from being usable at all."
