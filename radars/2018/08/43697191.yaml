    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the code coverage tool, it is possible to get a false negative on a line of code not being run. Specifically, in a \"do-try\" statement with a \"return\" statement in the \"catch\" part, the closing brace (}) will be marked as not being run.\n\nAttached project demonstrates this (the file ViewController.swift should have 100% coverage)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write code in the form:\n\ndo {\n  return try someFunc()\n} catch {\n    return nil\n} //code coverage will report < 100% and mark this line as untested\n\n2. Write unit tests that exercise the code\n\n3. Turn on test coverage\n\n4. Run the unit tests\n\n5. View the coverage report. Note < 100% coverage for the file containing the code\n\n6. Click the arrow to see which code is missed. See that it's the closing braces in the method that returned nil\n\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe closing brace is reported as covered by the unit tests, coverage of the file is 100%\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe closing brace is reported as not covered by the unit tests, coverage of the file is <100%\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.0 beta 6 (10L232m)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 6 (10L232m)\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)"
