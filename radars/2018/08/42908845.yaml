    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to create a NetRestore Image in System Image Utility fails as the installation begins, with the error \"Domain=com.apple.osinstall Code=-34 \"An error occurred while loading the installer resources.\"\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a fresh installation of Mojave b5 (18A347e), copy the b5 Mojave installer app to /Applications.\n2. In System Image Utility, choose this installer app as the source, and NetRestore as the image type.\n3. Define the administrator account login and password in the next window (I used 'test' and '12345' as the password), leaving the rest of the options as default.\n4. Click Next through all the subsequent steps, leaving the defaults. (see attached zip bundle for screenshots of each step as I took them)\n5. When the image build begins, input the administrator password for the user when prompted, and also accept the license when it is displayed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nImage build would begin and complete successfully, leaving an .nbi file containing an asr-scanned restorable disk image within.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn \"Image Creation Failed\" error is shown in the SIU UI, and in the /var/log/install.log file, these lines are shown around the time of the failure:\n\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: Installer Info install requested but we're not dmg booted\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: mountDiskImageWithURLString: (null)\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: mountDiskImageWithPath is NOT valid, not attempting to mount\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: Couldn't mount the payload dmg ((null)): Error Domain=com.apple.osinstall Code=-34 \"An error occurred while loading the installer resources.\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=An error occurred while loading the installer resources.}\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: client 0x7f96fdc21220: phaseName = OS Installer 2\n2018-08-03 11:33:40-07 tests-Mac installer[909]: Releasing Connection\n\n(full install.log is also attached with the zip file.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14 (18A347e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttaching the relevant portion of install.log and screenshots of the steps I took in the GUI are attached.\n\nThe OS I am using is running inside a VMware Fusion VM with 2 CPUs and 4GB of RAM, using the current (as of today) VMware Fusion Technology Preview. I have seen others' reports of seeing the same error on physical Mac hardware."
