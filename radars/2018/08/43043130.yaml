    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen searching in safari a Siri suggestion for a website often appears. If a user elects to use the suggestion they are taken to the page. When they press the back button they are not returned to the previous state (the search page) but rather the previous website.\n\nThe mental model I personally have comes from using something like google search where you load a results page and then when returning from a website are shown the same results page. Being returned to the previous website loses the context of the search and is jarring as I expect to go back to the search. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: tap the search bar in safari \n2: start typing\n3: tap on Siri suggested website\n4: press back button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPressing the back button ought to take me back to the search UI \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see the previous website\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12 Beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/a"
