    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UI of the Health app should indicate when it is doing the initial import of HealthKit data from iCloud to avoid looking like health data is missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up a new iPhone (or restore from backup).\n2. Sign in to an iCloud account that has Health data.\n3. Open Health app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Health UI would show data that has been downloaded, but it would also indicate that more data is currently being downloaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI shows data that has been imported, but it does not indicate that there is more data still coming in.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12b5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA couple of hours after resting my iPhone from a backup, I opened the Health App and saw that a bunch of data was “missing”. It took me a little while to figure out that new data was still coming in. So for awhile, I thought that the restore had somehow lost many weeks of health data."
