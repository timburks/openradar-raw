    description: "I understand that PHPhotoLibrary really only exist in the context of an extension for Photos.app on the Mac.\r\n\r\nI also have understood, only because I spoke about that with an Engineer (nowhere documented) that there's no .shared() because there's no single Photo library on the Mac — although Photos.app knows which one to start, so there's a default one.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is why a Mac App would give this status instead of another one, since I'm obviously not authorized, since the Mac App don't ask.\r\n\r\nI'd gladly provide a sample app to explain my problem."
