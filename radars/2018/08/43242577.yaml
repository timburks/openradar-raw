    description: "Area:\r\nAirplay\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen choosing a speaker in iTunes, if that speaker is Airplay 2 (Sonos One, Apple TV) then Ethernet briefly disconnect, leading to a new DHCP request and most of the time a failure in negotiation with the speaker.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have a mac (AVB/EAV compatible) connected with ethernet on a network with Airplay 2 device (do not use Wifi, or make sure wifi is after Ethernet in interfaces order)\r\n- Open network preferences and iTunes, have them side by side\r\n- Open iTunes, then change the destination to that Airplay 2 speaker\r\n- Observe the Ethernet going down then up.\r\n\r\nSame thing happens when you disconnect the Airplay 2 speaker, going back to the sound on the computer for example.\r\n\r\nIf you disable AVB/EAV in Network preferences / Advancedâ€¦ / Hardware the problem goes away (might have to relaunch iTunes) but now sound doesn't reliably play on the devices.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGoing from a speaker to another should be seamless and not lead to disconnection\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEthernet briefly disconnects and reconnects\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (27-inch, Late 2013), Sonos One, Apple TV and Apple TV 4k."
