    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 10 the Breakpoint indicators on the source editor received new colors: bright blue for \"enabled\" and a darker blue for \"disabled\".\r\n\r\nThe tone difference between the two state colors is not enough and I've often found myself wondering why a breakpoint wasn't triggering â€” if you don't look closely, specially when in Dark Mode in Mojave, you can easily mistake the \"disabled\" state for the \"enabled\" state.\r\n\r\nXcode 9 used colors different enough between the two states that made it really obvious and easy to distinguish between the two states.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet a breakpoint using the IDE on Xcode 10.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe differences between the enabled and disabled state for Breakpoint indicators in the Xcode 10's source editor and navigator is greater, making it really easy to identify when a breakpoint is enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's really difficult to tell the state of a breakpoint from its tint color, as there's not enough difference between the enabled and the disabled state.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
