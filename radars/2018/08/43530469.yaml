    description: "Summary:\r\nUpon updating to iOS 12 beta 6 or 7, started noticing that the red badge indicating “1” notification was pending on the Settings app. Upon opening the Settings app, there is no notification: nothing for iCloud, nothing pending in system update, etc. I assumed this was a bug and would be resolved in the subsequent betas, but we’re now on beta 9 and it remains.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install beta 7\n2. See a red notification badge on Settings that has no obvious reason to exist, and no way to clear\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo badge should appear on Settings when there are no pending notifications within.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA badge appears and cannot be cleared.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0 (16A5362a)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
