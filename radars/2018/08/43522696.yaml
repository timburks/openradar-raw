    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary: In my app I use navigationItem.prompt to display certain errors when attempting to save. This used to work well, and even animate nicely into view, but it has become progressively more broken over time. At some point it stopped animating, errors about constraints started appearing, and now I've noticed that it completely disables the buttons in the navigation bar when it happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample app.\r\n2. Tap the Form button.\r\n3. Tap the Prompt button.\r\n4. Attempt to tap Done.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe modal view should dismiss. (Additionally, the prompt should animate into view, and I would not expect to see constraint errors in the console.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe buttons in the navigation bar cannot be tapped. If the device is rotated they become active again. (Oddly, I accidentally discovered that tapping the button many times very fast sometimes works.)\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 beta 9 (16A5362a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've verified this bug on a physical iPhone 6s Plus as well as the iPhone 8 simulator.\r\n\r\nNote: in the attached sysdiagnose, the bug was triggered at 3:26PM."
