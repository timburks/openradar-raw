    description: "Area:\r\nQuickLook Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a DocumentViewController that extends QLPreViewController from QuickLook framework. After loading the pdf, that downloaded with URLSession, I press the back button to return previous page. The pdf VC removes from navigationController stack. But it doesn't die. When I check the \"Debug Memory Graph\" it is alive. if I'll do same scenario again, the new VC dies but first one is still in there. You can see with running sample project that in the attachment. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- run project\r\n- press \"Show Pdf\" button to see pdf file(QLPreviewController) \r\n- wait until load the pdf file (an Apple document)\r\n- press back button\r\n- Check \"Debug Memory Graph\". You will see the instance of VC is still alive.\r\n- press \"Show Pdf\" button again\r\n- wait until loading the pdf file (an Apple document)\r\n- press back button\r\n- When you check the \"Debug Memory Graph\" again, you will see the first object still alive but last one is dead.\r\n- After trying multiple times, you will see only first instance stays in memory other instances deallocating \r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- if there is no strong reference, all instance of QLPreviewController should be deallocated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first instance of QLPreviewController always in memory, it doesn't die.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n- iOS 11 only first object stays in memory.\r\n- I've checked iOS 10 version all objects stay in memory in this version.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-"
