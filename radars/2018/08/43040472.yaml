    description: "Summary:\r\nThe area on the bottom of the «Listen now» tab in the Podcasts app is not displaying episodes correctly:\n\n* Most episodes listened to never show up\n* Episodes never listened to are listed\n* The sort order of the few episodes listed are also displaying in incorrect order (not based on the date last listened to)\n\nI have tried to delete all data associated with the app, but it’s still displaying it wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen app, play episode(s) to the end, and check if they appear in the «Recently played» section. I have the language set to Norwegian, so that might be a reason for the bug, since the date format is different. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMost recent podcast episode finished listening to should be displayed first, the second most recent second, etc …\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMostly episodes from three really old podcasts are shown, in completely wrong order. New episodes are never added. Some episodes I never listened to, but deleted are showing up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 12\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the screenshot you can see an episode from 17th of may this year, showing up after an episode from 2014 (which I never listened to). \n\nThis issue has been here since at least iOS 11 (this is when I started using the Apple Podcast app)"
