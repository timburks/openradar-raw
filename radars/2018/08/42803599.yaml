    description: "Summary:\r\nI wake up, go to my Mac and it’s running hot as spindump and tailspind both consume at least one core, running constantly. Not sure if it’s the same process or spawned constantly. Killing it via Activity Monitor gives me a short break.\n\nPlease allow to disable these. I found hacks that involve disabling SIP to delete the plists that manage these, but I’d prefer to just mark a checkbox.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.14 Beta (18A347e)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
