    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's like a Podcast app. AirPlay devices are loading fine and I can connect to a device successfully. I'm testing in an Apple TV and the audio plays well but it's using always the max volume and I can't change it in the iPhone. The volume slider from AVRoutePickerView is disabled and I can't understand why that's happening because it works well in other apps like Podcasts.app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd an AVRoutePickerView to the view of an UIViewController. Setup AVAudioSession with AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, AVAudioSessionModeDefault and LongForm Route Sharing Policy, add an AVPlayer with a remote file (AVPlayerItem(url: url)), start playback, update MPNowPlayingInfoCenter with MPNowPlayingInfoMediaType.audio and other info. Don't forget to setup MPRemoteCommandCenter as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVolume control to be enabled and volume hardware buttons functional. Be able to control the volume of the external device from the iPhone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVolume control in `MPAudioRoutingPicker` is disabled. Itâ€™s not possible to change the volume from the hardware buttons too. The app always outputs at full volume, which requires that I adjust the volume at the destination speaker\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttachment a focused Xcode project operates differently from all other apps (like Podcasts.app) in this regard. When broadcasting to an AirPlay device like an Apple TV, I'm unable to control the volume from the iPhone. The app always outputs at full volume, which requires that I adjust the volume at the destination speaker (which users don't want to, they don't want to walk to the destination speaker to lower (or in some cases raise) the output volume)."
