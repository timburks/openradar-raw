    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #42856531\n\nCurrently all customAction added to UIDocumentBrowserViewController show up in all locations. There is no way to restrict some or all actions to only show up in specific locations, or not show up in specific locations.\n\nThere might be some actions that donâ€™t add any value when showing them in e.g. the Recently Deleted location.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a UIDocumentBrowserAction.\n- Add the action to UIDocumentBrowserViewController.customActions.\n- Navigate to different locations/folders in the document browser.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is API to disable and not show an action for certain parts/locations/folders of the document browser.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no API to disable and not show an action for certain parts/locations/folders of the document browser.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1 & 12b5\r\n\r\nNotes:"
