    description: "Summary:\r\nNSPortNameServer has been deprecated in favor of NSXPCConnection. However, NSXPCConnection does not provide any way for two sandboxed executables from *different bundles* to connect to each other. The only initializers for NSXPCConnection are \"initWithListenerEndpoint:\", which requires a listener endpoint received from an existing connection; \"initWithMachServiceName:options:\", which is not an option for MAS apps which cannot have launch agents; and \"initWithServiceName:\", which requires (as far as is documented) an XPC service in the same bundle. Therefore, it is impossible for two executables from different bundles to establish an NSXPCConnection. This used to be possible by registering a mach port and using that to communicate, but now that method is deprecated with no replacement.\r\n\r\nResolution:\r\nThe best solution to this issue is creating some kind of NSPortNameServer for XPC connections (maybe NSXPCNameServer). This adds additional support for establishing XPC connections to allow migration from mach ports and NSConnection.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 10.0 beta 6 (10L232m); macOS SDK 10.14"
