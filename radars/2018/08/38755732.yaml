    description: "Summary:\r\nThere isn't any way to debug Authorization Plug-ins. This makes developing them very difficult.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Get a great idea for an Authorization Plug-In.\r\n2. Read TN2108 about how to debug the plug-ins.\r\n3. Get pumped up! :-O\r\n4. Spend a bunch of time nearly getting the steps in the TN to work.\r\n5. Fail. :-/\r\n6. Be sad. :-(\r\n7. File a radar.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nI expected to be able to debug my authorization plug-ins as documented.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nTN2108 is very outdated and none of that debugging works.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nWe are developing a variety of login window plugins for macOS and are looking for greater control of the debugging process. I've followed the steps in Technical Note TN2108: Debugging An Authorization Plug-In With Xcode, but they don't work on modern macOS, even with SIP disabled, because Security Agent also calls PT_DENY_ATTACH.\r\n\r\nAll of this is made even more difficult because Xcode no longer really has support for remote debugging. I can enable an ugly version of it with REDACTED, but then the system protections stop you from connecting.\r\n\r\nEven when running locally with the authorization plugins for use with system locks and such you can't actually debug them because of the system protections.\r\n \r\nAs a work around we've resorted to caveman debugging with lots of log statements, but that's more than a bit of a pain to do as our products become more complex. As a result, we now have amazing debug logging in our current projects, but we are essentially required to annotate every single line of code with os_log. If only we could use the debugger it would make our development much much easier.\r\n\r\nA way to defang the protections, without the need for exotic hacking, would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a regression as older versions of Xcode and macOS allowed you to debug Authorization Plugins locally and remotely. It was a festival of debugging and everyone ate their fill."
