    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have Finder opened as a Fullscreen window and double click an archive to unpack using Archive Utility, upon finishing and closing of Archive Utility you will be thrown back to your previous Desktop, even though the extracted file(s) are in the Fullscreen Finder window.\r\n\r\nThis is annoying and severely limits my workflow by having to swipe back to return to my Fullscreen Finder window.\r\n\r\nSee screencast of issue here: https://twitter.com/philmcole/status/1028264250060496896\r\nFind my settings of Archive Utility attached below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLocate a zip file in Finder, make the Finder window Fullscreen, double click the zip file to unzip with Archive Utility, wait till Archive Utility finishes and closes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStay in the Fullscreen Finder window.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are thrown back to the first Desktop.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
