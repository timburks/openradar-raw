    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS Simulator has different runtime behaviour than devices, specifically iOS devices seem to have a lower limit on how many files can be opened vs the Simulator/macOS.\n\nThis causes bugs that do not show up on tests, as tests run on the Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite a sample app that opens files both on Simulator and Device.\nObserve that the limits are different.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe limits for open files should be the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe limits for open files is not the same.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
