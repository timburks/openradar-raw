    description: "Area:\r\nFinder\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFile Previews/Thumbnails are unreliable/not shown on macOS Mojave. It happens on the Dock and on Finder. I think something is crashing iconservices or another process like that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nNone, just use the Mac as usual.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFinder/Dock show the previews reliably on file types that support it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFinder shows the previews rarely and Dock fails at it most of the time.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n10.14 Beta (18A371a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nMacbook Pro Retina 15-inch w/ Touch Bar, 2017 model\r\n\r\nAttached a sysdiagnose of the system while the bug was occurring."
