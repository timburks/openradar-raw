    description: "Summary:\r\nCan't close that screen or the Safari window. Cancel and Unlock are clickable but don't do anything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to accounts.google.com.\r\nIn the password field, click \"Other Passwords...\"\r\nWhen or while the \"unlock Safari passwords\" screen is opening, click Esc. That would close something in the html page, I think maybe the field's auto-fill options menu/popup, and would cause the Passwords screen to hide the field for entering the Mac password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"unlock Safari passwords\" screen is closed or close-able.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"unlock Safari passwords\" screen stays there and I can't close anything in this Safari window.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.1.2 (13605.3.8)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6 (17G65)\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)"
