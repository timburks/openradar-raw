    description: "Summary:\r\nI can understand not having it as a default feature, as I can see where it might be confusing when triggered accidentally, but this feature was one of my favorites! The ability to lift my watch, scroll up, and see the day’s events AND weather in one swoop… AMAZING.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhile at the watch face default screen, scroll up with the crown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTime Travel engages and you can see the complications provide the day’s information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
