    description: "Summary:\r\nBookmarked URLs to security scoped resources created with URL.bookmarkData() cannot be resolved in app extensions, e.g. an action extension or an intents extension. \n\nFor a document-based app that has one or more app extensions, this poses an unfortunate limitation on the features the app can provide its users.\nImagine a document-based app that allows users to pick a directory to store the documents in using UIDocumentPickerViewController. When the user chooses a directory, e.g. a directory provided by a third-party file provider, the app creates a bookmark and stores it. The bookmark is used when creating new documents. If the app wants to access these documents in an app extension, it cannot do so, since the app extension cannot resolve the bookmark.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a bookmark to a security scoped resource in an app. Store the bookmark data, e.g. in user defaults.\n2. In an app extension, fetch the stored bookmark data and try to resolve it to a URL.\n3. Step two fails because URL(resolvingBookmarkData:bookmarkDataIsStale:) throws an error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nURL(resolvingBookmarkData:bookmarkDataIsStale:) should be able to resolve URLs to security scoped resources.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nURL(resolvingBookmarkData:bookmarkDataIsStale:) throws an error when attempting to resolve URLs to security scoped resources.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n12.0\r\n\r\nNotes:"
