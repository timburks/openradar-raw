    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI am trying to center the cells of a collection view. My strategy to do this was to provide a delegate to the `UICollectionView` that conformed to `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` and implement the `collectionView:layout:insetForSectionAtIndex` method to return an inset to center the content. **See `ProductsCollectionViewDelegate` in the sample project.**\r\n\r\nI believe this strategy should work. It seems to work on every device in every orientation except for **portrait orientation** on the 10.5” iPad Pro. For some reason the inset seems to be calculated correctly but the collection view is rendered with 1 cell too few in each row.\r\n\r\nI added logging statements to see the calculations. It appears as if the calculations are correct.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*-------------------- begin calculating inset -------------------------*\r\n*Screen width: 834.0*\r\n*View width: 834.0*\r\n*Number of cells that will fit in a row: 4.0*\r\n*Final number of cells in row: 4.0*\r\n*Total cell width: 800.0*\r\n*Total space width: 24.0*\r\n*Inset: 5.0*\r\n*total cell width + total space width + 2(inset) = total view width*\r\n*800.0 + 24.0 + 10.0 = 834.0*\r\n*834.0 = 834.0*\r\n*-------------------- end calculating inset -------------------------*\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo see attached sample project.\r\n\r\nRun the project on the iPad 10.5” simulator. Verify the content is not evenly spaced or centered in portrait. Flip to landscape to see an example of what the correct layout should look like. \r\n\r\nYou can also run the sample project on any other device simulator and the collection view should render correctly in each orientation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn portrait orientation, there should be 4 items in a row. The items in rows should be separated by 8 points and centered.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly 3 items are in a row and they are unevenly spaced and not centered.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 11+\r\niPad Pro 10.5”\r\nComments\r\n\r\n** See sample here:\r\nhttps://github.com/addisonwebb/BrickAndMortar"
