    description: "Please add a way create a localized formatted string for a number using a short style (presumably with NSNumberFormatter).\r\n\r\nFor example, with the en_US locale, formatting the number 1_013_000_000_000 would result in \"1.013T\". Ideally formatting the number 1_013_123_456_789 this way would also result in \"1.013T\".\r\n\r\nFor Chinese, formatting 1_000 would probably result in \"ÂçÉ\".\r\n\r\nThis request was inspired by how the Stocks app formats the market cap number (at least for en_US -- I'm not very familiar with how other locales work, which is exactly why I would like a method to do this for me)."
