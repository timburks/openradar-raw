    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe text of the new automation authorization prompts in macOS Mojave is too long to be glanceable. Labelling the \"Allow\" button with \"OK\" doesn't sufficiently signal that a right is granted by clicking it.\r\n\r\nPlease see this image for a commented version of the prompt as of Mojave beta 9 - and suggested improvements:\r\nhttps://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/images/authorizationAlertImproved@2x.jpg\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPerform action that triggers an automation authorization prompt.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA glanceable prompt that's well-formatted and clearly transports what my options are.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA prompt filled with a wall of text that may tempt users to just click \"OK\" in order to close it and not have to deal with it - not knowing they've also just provided an app with permission to send AppleEvents to another app and \"access its documents and data\".\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS Mojave beta 9"
