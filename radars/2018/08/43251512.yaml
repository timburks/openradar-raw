    description: "Xcode has really great git integration these days. For a long, long time I was the weirdo that bumbled along without using the git CLI tool, but just what Xcode gave me. Now that support is getting even better (VINDICATION!) but there are still a few things that it could do better. (SADNESS!)\r\n\r\nAfter I grew to love it at Apple, I've continued to use GitLab on the outside after I left. Once of the things I love is how easy, nay SIMPLE, it is to branch from issues and then merge and delete those branches later when the feature is done. This makes the OCD in me very soothed as every issue has a branch, and every issue branch is removed when it is merged. Xcode though bravely stands against this workflow tidiness...\r\n\r\nNothing I can do will make Xcode decide to prune the deleted branches from the remotes in the UI. Now I have a long list of phantasmic branches that Xcode scratches at like a missing limb. Maybe it's just reminiscing! \"Oh, how I love to remember good ol' branch 72-login-defects! That guy was the best!\".\r\n\r\nI suspect that these echos of branches past remain in Xcode for some sort of historical value, but that's what Gitlab is for! Xcode is a lean, mean, coding machine and I can't seem to make it forget the past without opening up the Terminal app, LIKE A CAVEMAN, and then running \"git remote prune origin\" like I'm working on a btrfs driver in my mom's basement somewhere. The savagery is palpable.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems like a nice feature for Xcode to have would be to prune the remotes when selecting \"Source Control > Fetch and Refresh Status\". There are already some fairly esoteric git features in the Preferences like \"Show merge commits in per-file log\" I think that \"Prune remotes on status refresh\" would be just dandy to have.\r\n\r\nAlso a pony would be great (They are delicious!), but mostly I just want Xcode to prune deleted branches from the remote."
