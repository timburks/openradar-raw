    description: "Area:\r\nCore Graphics\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPushing a CGContext with UIGraphicsPushContext takes significantly longer on an  iPhone 7 than on an iPhone 6 with iOS 12 beta 9 and beta 10 compared to iOS 11.x. This leads to a heavy performance drop when capturing the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Scenario\r\n- Create a CGContext with data\r\n- Measure the time needed to push the context with UIGraphicsPushContext\r\n\r\n2. Scenario\r\n- Use UIGraphicsImageRenderer to create the context\r\n- Measure the time needed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe time measured on the iPhone 6 is the same than on the iPhone 7 (or even slower).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time measured on the iPhone 6 is significantly shorter than on the iPhone 7.\r\niPhone 6: Execution time: 0.02751600742340088\r\niPhone 7: Execution time: 0.10976803302764893\r\n\r\nAlso when creating the context with UIGraphicsImageRenderer, the following output appears since iOS 12:\r\n2018-08-24 10:33:05.502383+0200 RenderTest[337:10426] [Unknown process name] CGImageCreate: invalid image alphaInfo: kCGImageAlphaNone. It should be kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12.0 (16A5364a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6, iPhone 7, iOS 12 beta 9 and beta 10"
