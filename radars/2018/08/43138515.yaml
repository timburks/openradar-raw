    description: "Currently, Profile Manager offers no facility to enable or disable Remote Management (Apple Remote Desktop) or Remote Login (SSH) on DEP-enrolled Macs. It also can't be achieved using the Custom Settings payload, as the services in question aren't controlled by \"$ defaults\" but instead by custom executables (kickstart / systemsetup, respectively).\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if this functionality could be offered via a future version of Profile Manager."
