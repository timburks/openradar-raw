    description: "Area:\r\nSoftware Update\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSince installing iOS 12 developer beta 11, I have been periodically getting an alert with this text:\r\n\r\n\"A new iOS update is now available. Please update from the iOS 12 beta.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Downloads page at https://developer.apple.com/download/ I have the most recent beta, and I'm certain that the final version has not been released yet. The Software Update screen in Settings says I have the current version.\r\n\r\nI've been seeing this off and on for the past few days, but it has been happening very frequently within the past half hour or so (8:30 PM Boston time on August 30). I am in a Slack with other developers who are complaining about the same issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install iOS 12 Developer Beta 11.\r\n2. Use device.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect not to be prompted to update from the developer beta until there is a newer beta or a release version.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI am prompted to update from the developer beta, even though there is nothing available to which I can update.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 12 Developer Beta 11 (16A5365b)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone X"
