    description: "Summary:\r\nThis JSFiddle shows the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/tagliala/f1Ljqk5b/3/\n\nIf `font-size: inherit` is used on an SVG to establish the initial sizing of the element, it will not scale in Safari (neither 11.0 or 12.0). This same behavior is not experienced in other popular browsers. Whether or not the font size is inherited from ancestors should have no impact on the scaling of the font at the userâ€™s direction.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Refer to this JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tagliala/f1Ljqk5b/3/\n2. While on that page, use CTRL+ or CTRL- to zoom in and out, and notice one of the two SVG icons is not scaling.\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth SVGs should scale. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe one with `font-size: inherit` does not scale.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS High Sierra Safari 11.1.2 (13605.3.8) and macOS Mojave Safari 12.0 (14606.1.36.1.3)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis notably impacts the popular library, Font Awesome, which recently introduced support for SVGs instead of the traditional font icon technique. The issue is discussed here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/13032#issuecomment-413831826"
