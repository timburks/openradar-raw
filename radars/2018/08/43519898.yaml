    description: "I'm not sure when, but recently Apple chose to archive most of their articles and programming guides, focusing on the docs found in (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/). Removing archived documentation would be acceptable if replaced, but there is still a lot of crucial information in the archives, which are much more difficult to find; as far as I can tell, search engines no longer index them. \r\n\r\nFor instance, other than the book App Development with Swift, I can't find any official Apple documentation that explains how to set up an unwind segue. It would make it seem that Apple no longer recommends using segues this way, but the book shows they're the recommended method to pop a view controller.\r\n\r\nUntil Apple fills the gaps missing, I suggest at least allowing search engines to index the archived documentation again, so they're still â€‹discoverable."
