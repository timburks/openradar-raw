    description: "Area:\r\nSceneKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPassing a Swift array of indices will be infered as 64 bit ints, but internally SceneKit will treat the buffer as ushort3.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\nlet triangle = SCNGeometryElement(indices: [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], primitiveType: .triangles) will only output a single line as the buffer will be read as [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0] (thanks to Dean for debugging this). I've attached a screenshot which shows the incorrect buffer\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've attached a simple playground that shows the issue. The expected result is as in the Expected.png\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSceneKit should either do a proper conversion to ushort's or assert that the input is a valid bit width.\r\n\r\nIn the attached playground the output view should look like Expected.png\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn this case the red triangle won't be draw as it uses the inferred Swift array of ints\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode-beta 5, but I think earlier OS versions are affected to\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
