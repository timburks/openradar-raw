    description: "Currently, if the watchOS app embedded in an iOS app requires a newer version of watchOS than the user has installed on their Apple Watch, the watch app is completely invisible to the user.\r\n\r\nThis leads to many support requests from users who may even have downloaded the app specifically to use on their Watch, but can not find it.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest these apps be displayed in the \"Available apps\" list in the Watch app on iPhone, and if the user attempt to install them, they be offered a prompt to update watchOS to a newer, compatible version.\r\n\r\nThis would assist with support for third party app providers, and also help encourage users to keep their watchOS version up to date."
