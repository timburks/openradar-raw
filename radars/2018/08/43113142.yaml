    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Chrome 68, Google started to reject SSL certificates that lack Certificate Transparency, if they were issued after April 30, 2018. The SSL certificate for api.apple-cloudkit.com was issued May 18 (after April 30), and apparently lacks Certificate Transparency, so Chrome 68 blocks access to any Cloudkit API requests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Chrome 68, browse to the URL `https://api.apple-cloudkit.com`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA page that says the server sent an empty response, like the one seen at `http://api.apple-cloudkit.com`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error page with the text:\r\nAttackers might be trying to steal your information from api.apple-cloudkit.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). Learn more\r\nNET::ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all Javascript requests to CloudKit APIs are blocked by Chrome as a result of this error.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nChrome 68\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.6, MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)"
