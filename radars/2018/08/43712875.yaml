    description: "Summary:\r\nBoarding pass in Wallet on iOS truncates “PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE (T2D)” to “PARIS CHARLES DE GA…”, truncating airport name and not showing terminal number at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy tickets from any airport to airport with long name, like Paris Charles de Gaulle, checkin to flight and upload boarding pass to Wallet.\r\nCompare how boarding pass is shown in Wallet on iOS and watchOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect airport name to be shown in full, expect terminal to be shown as well. Terminal number is the most important missing information. From “PARIS CHARLES DE GA…” it’s easy to guess Paris Charles de Gaulle. But approaching airport you understand that terminal number is missing in boarding pass.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn boarding pass in Wallet on iOS airport name “PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE” is truncated to “PARIS CHARLES DE GA…”, terminal number is missing. But same boarding pass in Wallet on watchOS shows all information, information is presented in a little different way, but airport name shown in full and terminal number is shown: “Paris Charles de Gaulle (T2D) to Berlin Tegel (C)”.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.4.1\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\nhttp://w7software.com/downloads/ScreenshotsCombined-rdar-43712875.png"
