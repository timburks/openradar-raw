    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has lost the ability to do even rudimentary remote debugging on macOS without internal hacks. Remote debugging is very useful when debugging network tools, daemons, launchd jobs, demons, pre-login agents, deacons, and authorization plugins.\r\n\r\nBecause I was at Apple until last November, I know about REDACTED but that, as the devtools team will tell you is an ugly lump of hackery. It's also not a public setting which means it might go away at any time.\r\n\r\nThis is confused more by the fact that there are ADC documents that show how to use remote debugging for a wide array of tasks.\r\n\r\nI know I can use combinations of lldb, ssh, and all sorts of pipefitting to get a CLI debugger going but really? This isn't Linux and I would like to use Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to debug a remote process.\r\n2. Enact the REDACTED incantation.\r\n3. Squint at the REDACTED it added to Xcode.\r\n4. Remember your NDA.\r\n5. File a Radar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that Xcode, which allows you to debug iOS apps running on a remote device, would allow the same courtesy to macOS developers.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode has no remote debugging for macOS.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a regression as older versions of Xcode and Mac OS X allowed you to debug remotely. That was before iOS showed up and stole all the toys from the Mac though. The Mac then got angry, changed its name again to macOS, and slammed the door to its room."
