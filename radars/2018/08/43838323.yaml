    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need to access device logs after or while app is running automated tests on real device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect device to a Mac\n2. Run an app on the device\n3. Log something using os_log\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Run a command-line tool to extract logs from device and see what was logged\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. There is no way to access logs from iOS device with a command line tool\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 10 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe functionality is provided by Console.app, but command line tools are lacking functionality:\n* Command line tool “log” shows logs only from the Mac. \n* There is a way to access logs from Simulator using “xcrun simctl spawn booted log”.\n* Apple Configurator 2 provides a way to access device logs with command line helper “cfgutil syslog”, but it doesn’t include any information printed by the app, only system frameworks."
