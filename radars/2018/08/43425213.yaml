    description: "When building, archiving, and exporting our project, an issue occurs with Bitcode failing to verify with libraries imported with Carthage. This did not exist in Xcode 9 or previous versions of Xcode, and seems limited only to Xcode 10 beta.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have an Xcode project that contains dependencies from Github. As an example, use Alamofire in the Carthage dependency manager. These frameworks may include Bitcode enabled in their project settings.\r\n2) Attempt to archive and export the binary for use in either the App Store, Ad-Hoc, or Enterprise. You can use either Xcode or the xcodebuild CLI.\r\n3) The build fails to be exported due to bitcode invalidation."
