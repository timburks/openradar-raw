    description: "Summary:\r\nIn-app purchases are increasingly replacing paid downloads as the way to pay for apps, but the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) has been left behind since it only works with paid downloads. \n\nIn many ways non-consumable in-app purchases share properties with paid downloads and it should be possible to buy these in bulk and to assign, revoke and reassign them among employees.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into Volume Purchase Program (VPP)\n2. Find app with non-consumable in-app purchases\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should be possible to buy non-consumable in-app purchases\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnon-consumable in-app purchases are not supported\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:"
