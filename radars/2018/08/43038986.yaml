    description: "Area:\r\nWebKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen loading an HTML page with embedded javascript code, that creates an 'XMLHttpRequest' and uses it to load another resource ,for example a CSV file, the 'onreadystatechange' method of the 'XMLHttpRequest' silently fails on iOS12 when the WKWebview is not attached to the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI'm including a test project with just the WKWebview, I Also host the relevant HTML page on my server, and also included it and a sample CSV file in the project directory included.\r\n\r\nWhen the project is run, only a few messages will be printed in Xcode terminal, however, if you uncomment line 31 in ViewController.m '[self.view addSubview:self.logicWebView];' you can then see that more logs are being printed, this is because once the WKWebview is added to the view hierarchy 'onreadystatechange' is actually called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a WKWebview, do not attach it to the view hierarchy.\r\n2. Load a test page that uses an 'XMLHttpRequest' to load a resource.\r\n3. implement 'onreadystatechange' in the test page.\r\n4. try to use 'window.webkit.messageHandlers' to send a message to the client on state change, the message will not be received.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n'onreadystatechange' should work regardless of whether the WKWebview is attached to the view hierarchy or not, as in previous iOS builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n'onreadystatechange' is never called on iOS12 when the WKWebview is not attached to the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 12 beta 3,4,5."
