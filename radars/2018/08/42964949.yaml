    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen custom Cocoa Touch Framework target is named the same as some of the Private Frameworks the app crashes during the launch on iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe runtime seems to look for private framework APIs in the custom framework, which results in `dyld: Symbol not found:` runtime crash. In fact, when setting `DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES = 1` environment variable we can clearly see that only the custom framework is loaded by `dyld`, not both (the private and custom one).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create empty project with \"iOS > Single View App\" template;\r\n2. Add \"Cocoa Touch Framework\" target named \"Network\" (use default settings of embedding it in the main application);\r\n3. Launch the app on iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApplication should run on the Simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt crashes with:\r\n```\r\ndyld: Symbol not found: _OBJC_CLASS_$_NWPathEvaluator\r\n  Referenced from: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Frameworks/DocumentManager.framework/DocumentManager\r\n  Expected in: /Users/<user>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/PrivateFrameworkConflict-flugbttcnxtcfzbndpivtokdztlc/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Network.framework/Network\r\n in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Frameworks/DocumentManager.framework/DocumentManager\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nXcode: Version 9.4 (9F1027a)\r\niOS Simulator: iPhone 8 Plus (11.4)\r\nmacOS: 10.13.4 (17E199)"
