    description: "Area:\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nAfter putting AirPods on and pressing play on my iPhone, the right channel started playing noise (it sounded like uninitialized memory) at an extremely high volume instead of playing the content I was listening to before (left channel was fine). Changing the volume on my iPhone did not make any difference, the noise only stopped once I put both AirPods back in the case.\r\n\r\nThe sysdiagnose attached was taken right after the issue occurred, at around 8:26 pm local time."
