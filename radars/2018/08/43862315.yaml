    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a project where I have certain global default colors defined in an Asset Catalog. I use these colors in the storyboard files for various screens in the app. Some views keep those colors permanently. Some of the views have their background colors changed dynamically after loading, based on user settings. In these cases, if I call layoutIfNeeded on the main view, these subviews revert their background colors to the original setting from the storyboard. This only happens if I’m using a named color from the catalog. Using a manually picked color for the background does not produce this side effect, which is my current workaround. However, it defeats the purpose of having colors defined to begin with.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a storyboard with a view controller, a main view, and at least one subview\n- Connect outlets so the subview can be addressed directly in the controller’s viewDidLoad\n- Create a named color in the project’s asset catalog\n- Assign this color to the background of the subview\n- In viewDidLoad, assign the subview any other background color\n- In viewWillAppear, or some other method in the lifecycle after viewDidLoad, call view.layoutIfNeeded()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe subview should retain the new color it was assigned in code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe subview has its original background color defined in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’m using Xcode 9.4.1. It’s possible this is in some way related to Xcode, but I filed it under iOS because it’s a runtime bug, not build-time."
