    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen typing in Georgian macOS (and iOS) smart quotation conversion algorithms is using English (US) quotation marks instead of Georgian. Georgian language, as almost any other language, has its style of quotation marks, but macOS and iOS seem to ignore those and use English specific marks. \n\nSee the demonstration below:\n“Hello” ← English, correct.\n“სალამი” ← Georgian with English quotation marks, incorrect.\n„სალამი“ ← Georgian with Georgian quotation marks, correct.\n\nThis bug has also started a trend among Georgian speakers to use double-comma instead of leading quote mark as in ,,სალამი\" which is semantically incorrect and also trips most autocorrect algorithms, spellcheckers, and grammar liters. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType a any word with “” (quotation marks) around. For example “Hello”.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen typing in Georgian, Georgian quotation marks should be used. Example: „სალამი“\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEnglish quotation marks are used incorrectly: “სალამი” \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.6 (17G2208)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDetails on which quotation marks are used in Georgian can be found here under \"Summary table\" section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark"
