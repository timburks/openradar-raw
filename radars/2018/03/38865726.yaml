    description: "Xcode playgrounds pass a short list of compiler flags to build a playground's auxiliary sources; `-O`, a bunch of `-F` statements the SDK and target triple, etc. Please pass a unique `-D` such as `-DXCODE_PLAYGROUND` to allow frameworks that ship multiple forms (playground demo, Xcode framework, SPM framework, CocoaPod, etc.) to reliably detect the playground environment.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have a framework that uses some C headers on Apple's platforms. In a regular framework target, I may choose to discover and link those using a custom module map. In a playground, I may use runtime linkage to load those C symbols, or use alternate implementations entirely.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to accomplish this already by organizing the code such that the playground is the default/fallback code and defining, i.e., `-DXCODE`. This is suboptimal in environments where our Xcode's configs aren't respected, such as when the source files are copied and pasted.\r\n\r\nRisks: There may be concerns about using this detection to do nefarious things. However, the playground environment can already be detected at runtime.\r\n\r\nAlternatives Considered:\r\n- Allow module maps/submodules in auxiliary sources. This wouldn't help my case much without providing my own headers. Those combined seem like an awful lot of work.\r\n- Allow binary frameworks in playgrounds. Feasible with a stable ABI, but that's not really up to me. And it certainly increases the risk of nefarious playgrounds."
