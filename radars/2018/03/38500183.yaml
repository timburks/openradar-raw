    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter presenting view controller from UIDocumentBrowserViewController the presented view controller’s isBeingPresented property is still set to false.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached playground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nisBeingPresented should be set to true, which is the case when presenting form UIViewController.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nisBeingPresented is set to false.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is an unexpected inconsistency. There’s no way to detect that the controller is already being presented by inspecting it’s state. If you need to prevent from presenting the controller twice you need to track the state."
