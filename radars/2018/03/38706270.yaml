    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Prerequisite: Split Keyboard is enabled in device settings)\r\n(Reproducible in a simple application built in either Xcode or Xamarin having a single text field, and has also been reproduced using existing third-party apps)\r\n\r\n1. Focus on any text field to cause the on-screen keyboard to be displayed\r\n2. Attempt to split the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nKeyboard can be split via gestures or use of the button that displays Merge/Split/Dock options.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nKeyboard cannot be split by any means. Only the standard keyboard is displayed. \r\n\r\nAdditional Observations: \r\n\r\nAdding the following key/string pair to info.plist (with either a string referring to a valid resource, or an empty string) allows the keyboard to be split and all Merge/Split/Dock button options to become available on the 10.5-inch device:\r\n\r\n\t<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>\r\n\t<string></string>\r\n\r\nBehavior has not been reproducible on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro or on other iPad devices (in regard to displaying the split keyboard, they are agnostic to the presence of a UILaunchStoryboardName key/string pair in info.plist).\r\n\r\nVersion: 11.2 (15C107)"
