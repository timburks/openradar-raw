    description: "DUPLICATE OF 24056646\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nHere is the use case : Working with a foreign friend, it may be needed to change the language on the fly, each time one or the other has to do something with the app. \r\nThere is no easy or safe way to do this directly from the app without being forced to go through the phone setting, which forces to interrupt use of app and takes a long time (up to 15s).\r\nI have found ways on how to do it, by changing the mainBundle class. \r\nSee: http://blog.xebia.fr/2016/08/03/internationaliser-vos-applications-ios/\r\nIt seems to work well, but I was advised not to do so, because of possible bad side effects.\r\nSee discussion in forum : https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/97110\r\n\r\nSuggestion: provide built in mechanisms in SDK to allow such a change"
