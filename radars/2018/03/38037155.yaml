    description: "Summary:\r\nI don’t know what causes this, but every once in a while (maybe once a week), I’ll notice the fans running on my MacBook Pro, and Activity Monitor shows that Xcode is hovering right around 600% CPU (almost like it’s trying to use as much CPU as possible, but something is limiting it to use no more than 3/4 of the virtual cores on my 4-core, Hyperthreaded machine).\n\nRestarting Xcode or the computer sometimes works, maybe. Clearing derived data and/or module cache sometimes works, maybe.\n\nAttached sysdiagnose captured while this behavior was happening.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use Xcode a lot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFans run during heavy load, like repeatedly building a project.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFans also run when Xcode is just sitting there.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b) on macOS 10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSorry I can’t provide more detail! Also, I don’t know whether I’ve seen this in Xcode 9.3, since I haven’t been using it full time yet. If I do happen to see this behavior, I’ll attach a new sysdiagnose."
