    description: "Summary:\r\nCustom input method app is added to Input selector hundreds of times.\r\n\r\nI've downloaded and run the NumberInput sample code for Input Method Kit.\r\n\r\nI've tried moving the built NumberInput.app to both `/System/Input Methods/` and `~/System/Input Methods/`.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling the NumberInput method in System Prefs > Keyboards, everything appears to work fine. One menu item is added to my Input picker in the menubar, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, I soon return to the Input menubar item and am overwhelmed by tens or hundreds of menu items for \"NumberInput\". See pics.\r\n\r\nThese are also visible in the System Prefs > Keyboards menu.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what is triggering this duplication.\r\n\r\nI am sometimes able to delete them, sometimes not. They come back. \r\n\r\nThis makes it extremely hard to work with Input Method Kit. I'm never sure which is the actual app I'm developing, which is an old copy, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease see pictures. Let me know if you need any additional information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input method should only appear once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInput method appears hundreds of times. Unable to know which is the \"real\" one under development, etc.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\nUsing the sample code \"NumberInput\" in the \"step 0\" do-nothing version.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
