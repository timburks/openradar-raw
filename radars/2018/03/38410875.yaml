    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter upgrading to macOS 10.13, my MBP TB kernel panics every night, and sometimes during the day too. It seems to be doing it less if I don't leave it on power, and crash report mentions \"thunderbolt power\", so I assume the fault is somewhere around there.\r\n\r\nMy system has two encryption-separated partitions. My work partition started exhibiting the error when upgrading from 10.12 to 10.13. My home partition on 10.12 stayed fine for months. To test the theory that it's a software issue in 10.13, I upgraded my home partition to 10.13 as well, at which point it immediately started kernel panicking.\r\n\r\nWhat with all the other problems I'm having with this laptop, this issue is driving me insane. Here's a whole thread of people with the same issue: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kernel-panic-after-high-sierra-upgrade.2073815\r\n\r\nApologies for any spelling errors in this bug report; my \"n\" key is also brokenn.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect charger\r\n2. Close laptop\r\n3. Wait several hours\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Laptop is charged and ready for work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Laptop is waiting on boot screen, with all your work lost, and after bootig, it reports kernnel panic.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nEvery versio of 10.13, includig 10.13.3 (17D102).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAttaching sysdiagnose of my personnal partition. If you want, I can boot into my work partition nand sample it as well."
