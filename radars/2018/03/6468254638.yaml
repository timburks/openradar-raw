    description: "When adding the same instance of UIBarButtonItem initialized with an image several times to a UIToolbar along with some flexibleSpace between them, it doesn't seem to distribute the items properly. However if you add different instances of UIBarButtonItem or the same instance but initialized with a title, it works perfectly. \r\nThe results for both iOS 8.0 and iOS9/iOS10/iOS11 are different since on iOS9 and newer the UIToolbar uses a UIStackView internally to distribute the items.\r\n\r\nIt is quiet unlikely that a developer want to add the same instance of UIBarButtonItem to a UIToolbar, but It could be the case. In case that it won't be fixed, It would be necessary to update the documentation to clarify it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create UIToolbar.\r\n- Create UIBarButtonItem and name it as \"item\" for instance, with the init(image:style:target:action) initializer \r\n- Create UIBarButtonItem (flexibleSpace system type) and name it as \"flexibleSpace\" for instance. \r\n- Set the items to the UIToolbar like so: setItems([item, flexibleSpace, item, flexibleSpace, item], animated: true)"
