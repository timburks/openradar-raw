    description: "macOS 10.13.3 (17D102) will sometimes reset a user's home directory to /var/empty. No idea when exactly or why, but it just happened to me again mid-use. I noticed this problem when applications started behaving strangely (like Calendar starting up to the \"Welcome\" screen). Looking into /var/empty, it seems this has happened before (the Desktop-folder included screenshots that I had taken, which weren't on my \"real\" desktop). Rebooting the machine has so far worked as a work-around.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust use macOS\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe home directory should stay where it is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe home directory gets reset to /var/empty.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102). The system is also bound to an Active Directory controller."
