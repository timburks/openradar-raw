    description: "Summary:\r\nPeople love iBooks because they can just re-arrange the sort order on the shelves.\n\nWe have some customer reports that would like the same feature in `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`/Files app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdd new sort order “custom” that is user-sortable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo custom sorting possible. This is also not something we can add for PDF Viewer directly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
