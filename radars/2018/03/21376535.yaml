    description: "I was very excited to find Input Method Kit. I was planning on creating software implementations of various specialized (and expensive!) hardware keyboards.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have found that Input Method Kit does not catch NSEvents of type NSKeyUp.\r\n\r\nThis immediately disqualifies all \"chorded\" input methods. One cannot calculate chording without knowing when keys are pressed down and (importantly) go back up.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboard\r\n\r\nFor example, Braille hardware keyboards have 6 keys. Letters are input via simultaneous presses of the 6 keys in different combinations.\r\n\r\nBecause Input Method Kit does not catch NSKeyUp events, I cannot calculate if keys are being pressed at the same time. Chording keyboard input methods will thus not work.\r\n\r\nOther OS X technologies such as CGEventTap or [NSEvent addLocalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:] allow for monitoring key events of NSKeyUp, in addition to NSKeyDown. Input Method Kit only allows monitoring of NSKeyDown. This will force people to use the (much more dangerous) CGEventTap method to implement their keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Implement an Input Method Kit app (similar to the NumberInput Apple sample code)\r\n2. Implement the IMKit method `handleEvent:client:`\r\n3. Activate your Input Method\r\n4. As you press keys, notice that the `NSKeyDown` events are seen and handled by your input method.\r\n5. As the keys spring back up, notice that `NSKeyUp` events are NOT seen or handled by your input method.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe input method should see both NSKeyDown and NSKeyUp events.\r\n\r\nThe NSKeyUp events are *vital* for many input methods, such as chorded keyboards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNSKeyUp events are not observed by your input method. Only NSKeyDown events are seen.\r\n\r\nImpossible to handle NSKeyUp events.\r\n\r\nImpossible to implement a software chorded keyboard input method.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis will force people to use the (much more dangerous / insecure) CGEventTap method to implement their keyboard layout."
