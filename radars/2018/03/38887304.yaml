    description: "Summary: I have clients, bosses, and designers all over me for action sheets that look like that used in Apple Music. Obviously the custom message/image at the top of the action sheet along with the buttons containing icons are not supported by the UIAlertController public API. However, that does not stop everyone from simply blaming me for not being able to reproduce it (without completely creating a new set of classes that mimic UIAlertController).\r\n\r\nThis has been an issue in the past, where Apple apps do not appear to be limited to the public API of UIKit; leaving us developers in the field beseeched by complaints from the bosses/designers - \"Apple does it, how come you can't\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Just compare the attached screenshot of Apple Music with that of any UIAlertController that can be created using the public API.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The bosses/designers expect us developers to deliver what they see in other Apple apps for components that would otherwise appear to be part of the standard SDK."
