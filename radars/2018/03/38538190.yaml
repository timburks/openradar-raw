    description: "Apple Response: \"Engineering has determined that your bug report (38538190) is a duplicate of 35989241 and will be closed.\"\r\n\r\nOriginal report:\r\nMany developers enjoy using a programming font with ligatures (FiraCode examples attached) for writing code. It would be great to see a variation of SF Mono – optimised for Swift – that includes these.\r\n\r\nExamples attached:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/showcases/all_ligatures.png\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/raw/master/showcases/swift.png"
