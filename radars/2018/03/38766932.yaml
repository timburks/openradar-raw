    description: "Summary: \r\nIf a custom `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` performs its animations using `CAAnimation` (even when wrapped on `CATransaction`), `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` does not control the animation interactively.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nImplement a `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` relying on a custom `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` that implements animation using `CAAnimation` (such as a `CABasicAnimation`). And, for example, run the an interactive transition in a `UINavigationController` triggered by a `UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer`.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nAn `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` that actually works by pausing, resuming or canceling the animations defined as `CAAnimation` as it does with those created on **view-based animations** (`UIView.animateWith...`).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animations execute normally disregarding interactive percent-driven control.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2 (15C114)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDeployment target: iOS 10. \r\nHappens on both physical device and simulator."
