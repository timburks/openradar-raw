    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nWhen I receive a text message, while listening to audio (e.g., music, audiobook, podcast), the volume of the audio is severely decreased, for approximately 5 seconds, after the text message notification sound is played.\r\n\r\nI find this extremely annoying. It makes audiobooks and podcasts virtually impossible to hear, for approximately 5 seconds, unless I quickly press a button on my phone, which I can't always do quickly enough (e.g., when I'm driving).\r\n\r\nThis means that I frequently have to rewind audiobooks and podcasts, to hear the material I missed, for the 5 seconds after the text message notification was played.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, other notification sounds don't seem to cause the volume to be restricted (or at least not for so long) after they are played.\r\n\r\nCould you please fix this?"

    title: The volume of audiobooks and podcasts is unnecessarily decreased for ~5 seconds after text message notification sounds are played. This makes audiobooks and podcasts very difficult to hear.
