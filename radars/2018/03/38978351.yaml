    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode 9 release notes included this in the General > New Features section:\r\n\r\n> Added Test and Tests as suffixes for determining file counterparts used in navigation and in the Assistant Editor. (28981734)\r\n\r\nThis is a great new feature that makes it much easier to navigate to and edit code and test counterparts at the same time. Unfortunately I'm unable to get this to work. It's not clear if I'm misunderstanding how it should work or if there is a bug.\r\n\r\nThis may be related to rdar://38938839\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode with the iOS Single View template\r\n  - include Unit Tests\r\n  - Swift language\r\n2. Add an instance method to the generated ViewController class\r\n3. Rename the generated test class and file to ViewControllerTests, following the guidance of the Xcode 9 release notes\r\n3. Add a test method to ViewControllerTests which invokes the ViewController instance method that you added in step 2\r\n4. Navigate back to ViewController.swift\r\n5. With the cursor inside the new instance method, note that there are no items in the Test Classes or Test Callers menu item in the Related Items menu (shown by clicking the 4-squares icon in the top left of every editor view)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt's possible to navigate to a source file's counterpart test class or a method's test callers with the Related Items menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThese menu items never contain any other source file menu items.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
