    description: "While music is playing, it can be difficult to hear the sound component of haptics. I would propose an enhancement to support audio ducking for watchOS haptics.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would be supported in WatchKit, without requiring the AVFoundation API, so that apps can duck audio from other apps (e.g. watchOS Music).\r\n\r\nSome watchOS haptics are already capable of this (e.g. notification sounds), but this isn't available to developers."
