    description: "Area:\r\nAVFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWe develops iAP2 compatible accessory and iOS app for Automotive company.\r\nThe iOS app has a feature for audio playback. Audio playback can be controlled by commands sent from head unit via iAP2.\r\n\r\nThere is a case that the app is requested to start audio playback when the app is in background (The app can work in background by using iAP2). \r\nAlthough we understand that making a nonmixable audio session active while the app was in the background is not allowed, \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosessionerrorcode/avaudiosessionerrorcodecannotinterruptothers\r\n\r\nthe workaround described in the following url works until iOS10.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29036294/avaudiorecorder-not-recording-in-background-after-audio-session-interruption-end/29124425\r\n----\r\nI added the following\r\n\r\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents];\r\nbefore configuring AVAudioSession and it worked. Still don't know what bugs may appear.\r\n----\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, that workaround does not work from iOS11. Is this the expected change of iOS11? If yes, is there another workaround to setActive of AudioSession from background app?\r\n\r\nThis app (and accessory) has been already sold as default service and head unit of the car sold in US market, a lot of users may be affected. Please kindly help of advice for our products. Thanks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect iPhone to the iAP2 accessory (headunit)\r\n2. Startup the app on iPhone\r\n3. Move the app to background\r\n4. Headunit send therequest command for starting audio playback on the iPhone app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should success to make setActive of AudioSession, then audio playback should be started\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nThe app fails to make setActive of AudioSession\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS11 beta8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis app (and accessory) has been already sold as default service and head unit of the car sold in US market, a lot of users may be affected. Please kindly help of advice for our products. Thanks."
