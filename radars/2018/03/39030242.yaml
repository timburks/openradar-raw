    description: "Swift Playgrounds represents a fantastic idea, but can be improved in many ways to pave the way of advanced Swift usage from iPad (or even iPhone).\r\n\r\nSome of the features that can be added are:\r\n- Find and Replace.\r\n- Support for multiple editable source files for the same playground.\r\n- Option to completely hide the editor to launch playgrounds full screen.\r\n- Open Url protocol (and x-callback-url) to launch playgrounds from other apps.\r\n- Packaging: install playgrounds as standalone apps on Springboards.\r\n- UI interface design (Interface Builder).\r\n- Storyboards support.\r\n\r\nAsking Apple to support all those features seems stretched out as they are already available on Xcode for macOS.\r\nHowever if Swift Playgrounds is released as open source software, like most of the Swift components, it can leverage the very large developer community to be improved at a faster pace with new and refreshing ideas.\r\n\r\nI hope this can be considered as it will benefit most users: from students to developers to advanced users looking to use swift as scripting language.\r\n\r\nThe ability to build iOS apps from iOS itself is a required milestone for the platform."
