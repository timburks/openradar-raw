    description: "Allowing apps to show third party web content in an in-app web view (WKWebView) introduces a major security and privacy risk for iOS users, as it allows app developers to\r\n- Track the user: which links to they tap, what do they read, what gestures do they use\r\n- Show or replace ads with their own\r\n- Steal user's credentials when they login on third party websites using simple JavaScript queries\r\nand many more issues.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to first warn, and then reject apps that show third party content using their own browser for no good reason. There should be exceptions, but it shouldn't be the case that every social media app just has their own browser so you can't share content with your friends using the platform of your choice.\r\n\r\nMore information on https://krausefx.com/blog/follow-user"
