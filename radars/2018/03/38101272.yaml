    description: "I often enable do not disturb mode on my iPhone so I can focus on another task or to prevent notification sounds from disturbing podcast recordings. Here's the story of what happened this morning:\r\n\r\n- I asked Siri on HomePod to play music\r\n- After a few minutes, I asked Siri on HomePod to stop\r\n- I was chatting with someone on my iPhone using iMessage\r\n- I enabled DnD mode on iPhone to focus on work\r\n- HomePod started playing the iMessage \"ding\" notification sound every time I received a message\r\n- There was no way to make it stop since there is no do not disturb mode for HomePod (that I could find)\r\n\r\nI really don't think this is the expected behavior. I don't want HomePod to play notification sounds at all, but if that's a thing, I think it'd be best to offer the user a way to disable it.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I was NOT using airplay from iPhone to HomePod and my iPhone's ring/silent switch was set to silent.\r\n\r\nHomePod is running iOS 11.2.5\r\niPhone is an iPhone X running iOS 11.3 beta 3"
