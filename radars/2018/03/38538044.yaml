    description: "Area:\r\nXcode\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently the Xcode .playground file doesn't contain any information about the version of Swift used within it, and thus can't migrate source files to a newer version of the Swift language that have source-breaking changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a playground using an older version of Swift that contains source-breaking changes compared with the current version of Swift\r\n2. Open the playground in the latest version of Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should offer to migrate the source files to the latest version of the Swift language.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode doesn't offer to migrate the Swift files.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102)"
