    description: "It would be very useful to be able to use the Markdown syntax for composing emails.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, I would be particularly interested to have a way to quickly enter a code block using the single backquote (`) or triple backquote (```) syntax.\r\n\r\nNote that this functionality is already available into third-party email clients like Airmail."
