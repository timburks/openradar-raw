    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you change your Wi-Fi at home (for example when changing ISP's), HomePod becomes unusable. There is no way to change the Wi-Fi settings on HomePod. HomePod is stuck in that state indefinitely. There is only one way out, which is to totally reset HomePod and set it up again from the beginning.\r\n\r\niPhone can wirelessly send the Wi-Fi password to Mac or iPad when held close by, but doesn't do this with HomePod.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Change your Wi-Fi SSID and password.\r\n2. Connect iPhone to the new Wi-Fi network.\r\n2. Try to interact with HomePod.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen HomePod is unable to find its Wi-Fi network, but is held next to the iPhone it's paired to, that state should be accounted for. When in that state, iPhone should have an option to send the Wi-Fi password to HomePod when held close to it - just the way it can send the Wi-Fi password to iPad and Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. HomePod will tell you to check the Home app on iPhone.\r\n2. Check the Home app on iPhone, as told.\r\n3. Home app cannot interact with HomePod in any way, even when held close to it. HomePod is stuck in that state indefinitely.\r\n4. The only way out is to physically reset HomePod by unplugging it, plugging it back in, then tapping and holding down on HomePod for 10 seconds to reset, and then going through the whole setup process all over again.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.5 (15D61)"
