    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen drawing roundedRect, I get a strange behavior. If I draw northEast (from lower left to top right), drawing goes OK.\r\nBut drawing in any other direction (such as SouthWest, from top right to bottom left or southEast or NorthWest) leads to no drawing at all.\r\nDrawing works OK with plain rect or with ovals.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. OSX App (called Lesson 27)\r\n2. Draw a rect in the red view, going NorthEast\r\n3. Toggle to roundedRect by typing \"r\" or ovals by typing \"o\" ; drawing OK\r\n4. Draw a rect going any other direction (southWest, NorthWest, SouthEast)\r\n5. Toggle to roundedRect by typing \"r\" or ovals by typing \"o\" ; no drawing\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSame behavior expected for rect, oval and roundedRect\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo drawing for roundedRect alone if one of endPoint coordinate is smaller than startPoint ; but drawing occurs normally with rect and oval.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.1 (15B42)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27\", end 2015)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nTurn around is straightforward, but it's not clean to have a special case for rounded rect \r\nvar newStart = NSPoint() \r\nvar newEnd = NSPoint() \r\nnewStart.x = (startPoint.x <= endPoint.x) ? startPoint.x : endPoint.x \r\nnewStart.y = (startPoint.y <= endPoint.y) ? startPoint.y : endPoint.y \r\nnewEnd.x = (startPoint.x <= endPoint.x) ? endPoint.x : startPoint.x \r\nnewEnd.y = (startPoint.y <= endPoint.y) ? endPoint.y : startPoint.y \r\nNSBezierPath(roundedRect: NSMakeRect(newStart.x, newStart.y, (newEnd.x - newStart.x), (newEnd.y - newStart.y)), xRadius: 30.0, yRadius: 30.0).fill()"
