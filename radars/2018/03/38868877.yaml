    description: "Summary:\r\nI would like the ability to split my editor any way I want. Currently it's only possible to split the assistant editor, and the options for splitting are limited (right, bottom, stacked horizontally, or stacked vertically). It would be great to be able to split any editor (primary and assistant) stack some horizontally, some vertically, split into smaller subsets, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode, attempt to split primary editor, observe that it is impossible. Attempt to split assistant editor horizontally, and then vertically, observe that it is impossible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to split any editor in any way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot able to split any editor in any way.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
