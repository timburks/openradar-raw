    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nEnterprise signed apps that include Swift launch slowly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild an Objective-C application, sign with an enterprise profile, and run on a device.\r\nModify the app from above, adding Swift to the project and run on a device.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nLaunch times between the Objective-C and Objective-C/Swift enterprise apps should be similar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Objective-C/Swift app launches much slower than the Objective-C version of the app.\r\n\r\nIf the apps are not signed by an enterprise profile, the launch time differences between the two versions is negligible. \r\n\r\nLaunch times from a fresh installation (iPad Pro Version 2): \r\n\r\nObjective-C: ~1.5 seconds\r\nObjective-C/Swift:  ~6.5 seconds\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nXcode: 9.2\r\niOS 11.2.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nN/A"
