    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSystem Generated Proxy Authentication Alert keeps popping when authentication changed on proxy server\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Proxy server(Squid in my case) is configured with Basic Authentication with auth enabled.\r\n2. Enter proxy details in OS Settings - Proxy Server IP and Port . Authentication is OFF.\r\n3. User will be presented with system generated popup for Proxy Authentication.\r\n4. Enter the proxy username and password.\r\n5. These are cached by OS and will be used for further http request from here on.\r\n6. Now change the authentication type from Basic to Digest on Squid Proxy server.\r\n7. Proxy Authentication Alert appears on iOS device, now even when user enters the correct username and password for Digest Authentication type, iOS still keeps on popping this alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS should not pop up this Proxy Authentication Alert again and again when auth type is changed on proxy server.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS keeps on alerting this Proxy Authentication pop up and doesn't stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.1(15C153)\r\nModel - MGAA2HN/A\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWifi Settings are configured with proxy information in Manual area.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Now even after changing the auth type from Digest back to Basic, i have to restart my device. Now the alert won't come anymore. It's reproducible very easily."
