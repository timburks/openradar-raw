    description: "Summary:\r\nMy root view in IB is perfectly constrained by its content views with intrinsicContentSizes. It works fine during runtime. However, IB insists that it is not correctly constrained.\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the Apple engineers following this dev forum thread(https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/99223), I'm afraid we cannot continue our discussion there because dev forum sucks(https://twitter.com/an0/status/979536429415129089).\r\n\r\n\r\nCode: https://mega.nz/#!4Whm3RaB!ndDlyuGIe7zPRCaHRuBx_9wNdJ8L4Gr0ppP-LALIcfU"
