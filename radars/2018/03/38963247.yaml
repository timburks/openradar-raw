    description: "### Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen importing symlinked header files, clang sometimes seems to compare the imported path to the symlink target, rather than to the path of the symlink itself. It may then issue a spurious warning about a mismatch between the cases of the two paths, like this one:\r\n\r\n`Non-portable path to file '<protobuf/Any.pbobjc.h>'; specified path differs in case from file name on disk`\r\n\r\nThere is additional discussion in https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/3218. We have not been able to reproduce the issue with a simpler project than the attached, and suspect there is something in addition to the case mismatch necessary to trigger the warning.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download and unzip the attached TestApp project\r\n2. Run `pod install` from the unzipped directory and open TestApp.xcworkspace \r\n3. Build the app for the iPhone X simulator\r\n\r\n### Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app builds without any warnings.\r\n\r\n### Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app builds with thirteen warnings similar to the one described above.\r\n\r\n### Version/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102)\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nCocoaPods 1.4.0\r\n\r\n### Attachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/protobuf/files/1854645/TestApp.Swift.with.Firestore.zip"
