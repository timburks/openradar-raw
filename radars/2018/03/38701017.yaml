    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating or editing events in Calendar on iPad, most hardware keyboard shortcuts for the calendar view underneath are still handled and this can lead to force dismissing the popover and losing entered data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Calendar on iPad in a regular width (full screen on iPad)\n2. Go into Month view\n3. Tap the + button to add a new event\n4. Spend some time entering text for the event.\n5. While editing a text field, try pressing cmd-left or cmd-right on a hardware keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTrying these keys should to go to the beginning or end of a line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe calendar view scrolls to the previous or next month. The popover is dismissed and entered data is lost.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see the currently possible hardware keyboard shortcuts by holding command. While creating or editing an event, most of these should not be possible. The way the responder chain works the text views in the event editing popover should get first access to key commands.\n\nWhen in views other than Month, cmd-left/right go to the calendar view but donâ€™t dismiss the popover. This is also not expected. The text field should handle these key commands.\n\nOther key commands are listed when holding the command key and do nothing, such as Search. These should not show when holding the command key because they should not currently be handled when the popover is shown."
