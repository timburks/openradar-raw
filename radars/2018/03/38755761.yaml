    description: "Summary:\r\nfonts identify as  FooBarBaz.dfont with strange names\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI had installed the IBM Plex opentype fonts from https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFonts install OK\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFonts show as duplicates of each other. When resolving duplicates, the font name showed up as FooBarBaz.dfont with the name  \"Foo Bar Baz Spam Ham Eggs Regular Bold Italic Foo Bar Baz Spam Ham Eggs Regular Bold Italic\"\r\n\r\nI found that string in /Applications/Font Book.app/Contents//Resources/es_419.lproj/FBDuplicateResolutionPanel.strings (which is my locale). Perhaps a translation problem?\r\n\r\nCompare to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7989497\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
