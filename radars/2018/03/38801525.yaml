    description: "Area:\r\nNetwork Extensions Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation for NEHotspotConfigurationManager.getConfiguredSSIDs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReturn Value\r\n\r\nA string array containing a list of the SSIDs or Hotspot 2.0 domain names of the networks your app has configured.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis static method is really useful because it allows app developers using the Hotspot Configuration APIs to rely on the framework to be the source of truth for the state of applied configurations.\r\n\r\nNEHotspotConfigurationManager.getConfiguredSSIDs(completionHandler:) returns an empty string instead of the domain name for HS2.0 configurations. This behaviour was consistent during my testing regardless of how soon it was invoked after the configuration was applied. This doesn't happen with SSID configurations during my debugging, although I first started investigating this issue because a UI bug pointed in the direction of it happening with an SSID configuration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached project. In short: apply an HS2.0 configuration and invoke getConfiguredSSIDs after the apply completion handler is invoked. Alternatively, invoke getConfiguredSSID later in the same app lifecycle or after another app launch. The array of SSIDs provided in the completion handler contains a singl, empty string.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe configured SSIDs also includes the domain names of HS2.0 networks configured by the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe configured SSIDs includes an empty string instead of the domain name of a configured HS2.0 network.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\niPhone 6\r\nThe HS2.0 network configured with the sample project was not also configured with another app or configuration profile at the time of testing."
