    description: "Summary:\r\nInheriting from UIViewController appears to come with an unexpected redeclaration of `self` before initialization of the superclass. In the example attached, a UIBarButtonItem can be initialized with a target of `self` before `self` should be valid/available. If you use it in this way, the selector will never receive a message because whatever `self` it refers to is definitely not the instance we are creating.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen playground, notice that self can be used before super initialization. Note that whatever self it is is not this instance as if you try to use that UIBarButtonItem it will not work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompiler error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCompiles fine and silently fails because of apparent declaration of self prior to initialization.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nPlayground / Simulator / etc\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nSince the attached playground isn't on openradar, here's a screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/YVd6dP3.png"
