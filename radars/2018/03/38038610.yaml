    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using QLPreviewController to open a .doc or .docx file, previewController:shouldOpenURL:forPreviewItem: is called as expected when the user taps text with an embedded URL using iOS 9.3 and iOS 10.3.1, but it is not called on iOS 11.2 (emulator) or iOS 11.2.6 (device).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse iOS 9.3 or iOS 10.3.1 to see the success case. Use the iOS 11.2 emulator or an iOS 11.2.6 device to see the failure.\r\n\r\n1: Create a QLPreviewController and assign the dataSource and delegate. Be sure to implement previewController:shouldOpenURL:forPreviewItem: perhaps with just a breakpoint or an NSLog statement.\r\n\r\n2: Load a .doc or .docx file that has text with an embedded URL in the QLPreviewController. \r\n\r\n3: Tap on the link.\r\n\r\n4: The link loads correctly, but previewController:shouldOpenURL:forPreviewItem: is never called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe delegate method previewController:shouldOpenURL:forPreviewItem: should be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe delegate method previewController:shouldOpenURL:forPreviewItem: is not called.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2 emulator or an iOS 11.2.6 device. I'm running Xcode 9.2 (9C40b) if that helps, too.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI attached a test Word document if that helps.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a problem with a PDF of the same document -- the PDF version works correctly on all iOS version I tested."
