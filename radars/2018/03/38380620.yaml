    description: "Area:\r\nMedia Player Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen implementing a player based on MPMusicPlayerController, rapid repeated calls to the play() and pause() methods results in permanent UI Freezes on iPhoneX devices.  On other iPhone devices, UI can hang for several seconds before coming back.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install iTunes on an iPhoneX or other iPhone device, login into or create an Apple Music Account, and select a track for playback.\r\n\r\n2.  Build and run the attached project on an iPhoneX or other iPhone device.\r\n\r\n3.  Tap on the Play/Pause toggle button in rapid succession for several seconds.  You begin to hear an audible lag in playback that increases over time, and the title in Play/Pause button will begin to intermittently freeze.  On iPhoneX devices, the title will eventually fail to update, and the \"Go to next view\" button will become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRepeated, rapid calls to play or playlist methods on MPMusicPlayerController should not block the main thread and respond to state changes immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMain thread blocks and UI can completely freeze on iPhoneX devices.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhoneX with iTunes/Apple Music installed."
