    description: "Summary:\r\nAdd documentation that `.inputmethod.` is required(?) in the bundle identifier of an Input Method Kit input method.\r\n\r\nThe `NumberInput` sample code uses the bundle identifier:\r\n\r\n    com.yourcompany.inputmethod.NumberInput\r\n\r\nThis turns out to be VERY important. I created my input method with the bundle ID:\r\n\r\n    com.myCompany.MyInputMethodName\r\n\r\nAfter building this, adding it to `/system/Input Methods`, logging out, etc. I could NOT get my input method app to show up in the System Prefs > Keyboards > Input Methods list.\r\n\r\nI had no idea what was going wrong. I *finally* found this Stack Overflow question that says:  \r\n\r\n > This worked for me. Try this: make sure your bundle identifier contains \"inputmethod\" somewhere in the path.\r\n\r\n http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8960016/input-method-imkit-setup-trouble\r\n\r\nAmazingly this worked! After adding `.inputmethod.` to my bundle ID, the input method app shows up in the list.\r\n\r\nI'll note that I first tried putting it at the end: `com.yourcompany.MyInputMethodName.inputmethod`. This did NOT show up in the list. Is there a requirement that \"inputmethod\" needs to be in the first 3 tokens?\r\n\r\nPlease add this \"inputmethod\" bundle identifier requirement to the documentation!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny bundle ID works, or documentation is added re: the requirements for Input Method bundle IDs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n I created my input method with the bundle ID:\r\n\r\n    com.myCompany.MyInputMethodName\r\n\r\nAfter building this, adding it to `/system/Input Methods`, logging out, etc. I could NOT get my input method app to show up in the System Prefs > Keyboards > Input Methods list.\r\n\r\nIt works after changing the bundle ID to:\r\n\r\n    com.myCompany.inputmethod.MyInputMethodName\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
