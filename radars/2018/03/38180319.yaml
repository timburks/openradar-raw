    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode is crashing whenever I try to build my iPad app in the iPad simulator. It has persisted across a computer restart. I donâ€™t know what I might have done to get into this state. It was working fine when I put my computer to sleep last night, but the first build of the morning crashed Xcode. Same crash every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode.\r\n2. Try to run it on the iPad Air simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSimulator launches, but Xcode crashes due to an assertion failure because we are inserting a nil object into a dictionary.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b) on macOS 10.13.3 (17D102)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCrash also uploaded to https://cl.ly/pxmS"
