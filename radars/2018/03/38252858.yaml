    description: "Area:\r\nSafari Services\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI'm viewing an HTML page I created with anchor tags throughout the page. When I open the page with a URL with an anchor tag at the end of it, it does not properly show the page at the proper location. If you press the button to view the URL in Safari, it will show the correct part of the page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a long page with an anchor with a name like \"myTestAnchor\" near the bottom of the page.\r\n2. Open the Page using SFSafariViewController with a URL like: http://www.xxx.com/xxx/xxx.html#myTestAnchor\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should render the page with the anchor location at the top of the view. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn my page it was rendering the page much higher up on the page. I had to scroll down several screen lengths to get to correct location.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIn Simulator (iPhone 8 11.2) and on my iPhone 6s (11.2.6)"
