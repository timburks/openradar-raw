    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has two different dialogs that can be displayed when an opened project is being changed by another app. Also, these dialogs have different action names and (here comes the worst part) different default actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode\n2. Change the project by some external tool (CocoaPods is a good example of such tool)\n3. Activate Xcode app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne and the same dialog is always displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo different dialogs are displayed, please see the attachment. I couldn’t find any logic behind this. From my experience the “Failed to save XYZ.xcodeproj” appears more frequently then the 2nd one.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
