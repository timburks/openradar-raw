    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you override the derived data path in Xcode to be relative to the current directory, and then also set a custom build location for the Products and Intermediates directory. When you run `xcodebuild -scheme Foo -derivedDataPath bar` the custom products and intermediates directories are relative to the custom derived data directory, instead of the one passed on the command line\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project in Xcode\n2. In Xcode's Locations preferences set \"Derived Data\" to relative, and set the directory to localdata\n3. Open the advanced settings. Choose \"Custom\" and \"Relative to Derived Data\" make sure Products and Intermediates are set\n4. From the command line run `xcodebuild build -scheme YOUR_PROJECT -derivedDataPath fromcommandline\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe localdata directory isn't created, and nothing exists there. The fromcommandline directory contains all build artifacts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe localdata directory contains the Intermediates and the Products directories and artifacts. The fromcommandline directory only contains the logs and ModuleCache\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are screenshots of my settings that cause this."
