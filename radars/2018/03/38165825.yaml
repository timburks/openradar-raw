    description: "While an HKWorkoutSession is in progress haptic behaviour is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps for reproduction:\r\n\r\n1. Check HealthKit entitlement is enabled correctly. Then build and run on a device (Simulator only plays the sound component of haptics and can be tricky to test AirPlay). Suspend once background-haptics app launches.\r\n2. Ensure that no watchOS settings are enabled (e.g. Theater Mode, Do Not Disturb). Haptic Strength should be in either position 2 or 3 in Sounds & Haptics.\r\n3. Connect to a Bluetooth headset.\r\n4. Launch background-haptics app (pink icon).\r\n5. Tap 'Start Workout’ to begin a HKWorkoutSession.\r\n6. Use 'Play Haptic’ buttons to observe the following:\r\n\r\n- When the screen is on, there is no sound component to the haptics.\r\n- When the screen is off, the sound component plays, but there is no vibration.\r\n- This is true regardless of if the app is in frontmost app state, or suspended.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: both sound and vibration components should play in both situations. \r\n\r\n7. Tap ‘End Workout’ when finished.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.2; watchOS 4.2"
