    description: "Summary:\r\nYesterday (Tuesday March 6th) at 8AM GMT, I released a new version of an app manually, having been fully reviewed & approved by your app review team.  After hitting the release button on iTunes Connect, I was presented with a spinner - 10 minutes later it was still there.  I ended up opening a separate app and saw the new version was down as released, and so I didn’t think any activity was going on.  I’ve encountered this issue once before on November 15th 2017 with an app update also released at 8AM. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Upload your build, create a new app version.\r\n2.  Fill in all the usual details about your app on iTunes Connect.  Ensure the app is not released automatically or on a specified date & time (in other words, manual).\r\n2.  Get your app review team to review said app.\r\n3.  Upon approval, select “Release this version”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI get a usual confirmation prompt that the version has been successfully released.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn this occasion, I got a spinner.  Out of the 10 minutes I kept the tab in question open, it wouldn’t go away.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe new version of this app almost took eight hours to actually appear on the app store, which is far longer than I’d expect!  I didn’t click the “Remember me” button on iTunes Connect’s login as I have another Apple developer account."
