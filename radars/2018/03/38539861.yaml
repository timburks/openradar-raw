    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSystem Generated Proxy Authentication Alert keeps popping when killed and relaunched the application\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enter the Proxy server address and port no in WIFI setting and Save it.\r\n2. iOS will pop for Proxy Authentication as soon as any http request is going from the device to Proxy upon receiving a 407(Proxy Authentication Required) from proxy.\r\n3. Enter the correct Proxy credentials.\r\n5. I kill my app and relaunch it again.\r\n6. iOS prompts me with Proxy Authentication Alert again, it shouldn't have asked me since i already supplied the credentials and iOS caches them\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\niOS should not have asked me and used the credentials from cache upon sending any http request when i relaunch the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS prompts me with system generated Proxy Authentication Required alert again and again upon killing and relaunching the app.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.6(15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration: \r\nProxy with Basic authentication ON. but issue also happens with Digest.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nAs i see in Wireshark traces, when i relaunch the app after killing i see CONNECT is send with no credentials, i receive a 407 from proxy, i send a CONNECT with credentials, i receive a 200 and connection establishes. \r\nNow when the CONNECT is send to same host again in a fraction of second on different socket as a result of some http request it gets stuck at 407, it should have send another CONNECT with credentials.\r\nTo my surprise i am seeing that when i press \"Not Now\" iOS sends the CONNECT with credentials which means it has the cached credentials but somehow it's not sending and hence i see this proxy authentication alert.\r\nIt's really frustrating."
