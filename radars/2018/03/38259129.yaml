    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n— UITextView scrolls down on iPhone X on every rotation from landscape to portrait, even though it was scrolled to top initially.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project.\r\n2. Build and run on a portrait iPhone X simulator or device.\r\n3. **Observe**: full-screen text view (yellow background) is scrolled to top.\r\n4. Rotate to landscape.\r\n5. **Observe**: text view is still scrolled to top as expected.\r\n6. Rotate back to portrait.\r\n7. **Observe**: text view is slightly scrolled down. **Expected**: text view should still be scrolled to top.\r\n\r\nRotating back and forth scrolls the text view further and further down until it reaches the bottom of the content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n— If the text view was scrolled to top it should stay scrolled to top after rotations.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n— Text view gets scrolled down on every rotation from landscape to portrait.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n—  Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n—  iOS Simulator 11.2 (15C107), iOS 11.1.2 (15B202)\r\n\r\nSample project: https://github.com/garkhipov/TextViewRotationBug"
