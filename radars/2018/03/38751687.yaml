    description: "Summary: When I wake up in the morning, and check my phone, I do not see notifications of new text messages on my lock screen, even though I see new text messages in the messages app, and a count thereof in the badge app icon.\r\n\r\nNotes: This problem was first described on 10/7/17 — on iOS 11.0.2 — at https://discussions.apple.com/message/32416467 A comment in that thread suggests a workaround that I've confirmed works, which entails opening settings -> notifications -> messages, and turning off \"show in history.\" I will collect a sysdiagnose, logs, and/or profiles upon request.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Receive a text message. Wait (I'm not sure how long). Pick up my phone and turn on the lock screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I will see a notification of a new text message on my lock screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: I do not see a notification of a new text message on my lock screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOs 11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: iPhone 6S"
