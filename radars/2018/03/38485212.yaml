    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing 10.13.4 b4 (17E170c) I attempted to log in as an AD based user and have it's mobile account created on first login. I was presented with a dialog stating \"Enter a SecureToken administrator's name and password to allow this mobile account to log in at startup time...\"\n\nThis is going to be a mess. All of our users are AD based mobile accounts. 100%. We cannot have every single user that ever logs into our computers have an admin account authorize the account to gain a SecureToken. This is not scalable in the least.\n\nI assume this is to enable a SecureToken on the mobile account that is being created for FileVault use. There has to be a better way to allow AD based mobile accounts to be automatically given SecureTokens. Possibly thru a trust mechanism specifically at bind time, or by an authorized AD forest delivered by UAMDM...something. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Bind 10.13.4b4+ to Active Directory\n2) Configure the AD settings in Directory Access.app to create a mobile account on login and uncheck the box to prompt for verification\n3) Log into the computer as an AD based account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe account would log in & a SecureToken would be granted since it's authenticated against a trusted directory service.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA prompt appears asking for admin credentials to give the logged in account a SecureToken.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.4b4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nComputer bound to AD\nConfigured to create a mobile account on login and not prompt for confirmation. \n\n\nTroubleshooting Steps and Workarounds : Logged in as an AD user and was presented with the prompt. \n\nActions Requested and Additional Comments : There has to be a better way to allow AD based mobile accounts to be automatically given SecureTokens without an admin laying hands on the machine. Possibly thru a trust mechanism specifically at AD bind time or by whitelisting an authorized AD forest delivered by UAMDM...something.\n\nAlso submitted to AppleCare Enterprise Support as issue #100466781281"
