    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a bluetooth headset is connected to the Mac, playing sounds in the iOS simulator will activate the microphone of the headset. The keyboard clicks are enough to trigger the activation of the microphone. If the headset changes the audio mode or deactivates noise cancelling when the microphone is activated, this can be very annoying. Especially because the only way to deactivate the microphone again is to quit the simulator (and sometimes even Xcode).\r\n\r\nTo test the bug without connecting a bluetooth headset you can install Oversight (https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) which will show a notification as soon as the microphone will be activated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a bluetooth headset (I used my Bose QC35) to the Mac\r\n2. Play some music\r\n3. Open the simulator and type text into any UITextField (e.g. open Safari and start to type)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* The microphone of the connected headset do not get activated\r\n* The audio mode of the connected headset does not change\r\n* I continue to hear my music in addition to the keyboard clicks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* The microphone of the connected headset gets activated\r\n* The audio mode of the connected headset changes\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested with:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\nVersion 10.0 (SimulatorApp-835.5 CoreSimulator-518.16)\r\nand\r\nVersion 9.3 beta 3 (9Q117m)\r\nSimulator Version 10.0 (SimulatorApp-850 CoreSimulator-518.16)"
