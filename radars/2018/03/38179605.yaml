    description: "Summary:\r\nUpon receiving an email for an app rejection, I clicked the link to visit the Resolution Center in the following sentence: \"To view or reply to the message, go to __Resolution Center__ on iTunes Connect.\" \r\n\r\nIf signed out, I'm taken to a page that simply says \"Unauthenticated Request ID: 563LTDBUHPBPFQH2OJIBD7QK.0.0\" and literally nothing else, rather than a sign in page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSubmit an app that gets rejected by app review. Click the \"Resolution Center\" link in the received rejection email.\r\n\r\nObserve that you are taken to a page that only says \"Unauthenticated Request ID: 563LTDBUHPBPFQH2OJIBD7QK.0.0\", and nothing else.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would be taken to the iTunes Connect Resolution Center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am taken to a page that says \"Unauthenticated Request ID: 563LTDBUHPBPFQH2OJIBD7QK.0.0\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I open iTunes Connect via the root URL, https://itunesconnect.apple.com, first, and _then_ click the link, it works as expected."
