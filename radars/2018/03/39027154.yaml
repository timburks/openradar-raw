    description: "Suddenly the iOS simulator is showing the time in UTC even though my Macbook is running and has always been running on ET. Can't see any way to fix it. Have tried several different simulators (SE and 7+) different iOS versions (11 vs 10) but it's doing it across them. Have tried quitting and even restarting (using simulated power button) the simulators, but the UTC time issue persists. Seems to only be happening on simulators I haven't used in a while.\r\n\r\nRegion is set to US as per defaults. No place to change the time on simulator anyway.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D102), MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7,"
