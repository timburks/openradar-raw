    description: "If test failure occurs and _XCTestCaseInterruptionException is raised while execution is inside -[XCTWaiter waitForExpectations:timeout:enforceOrder:], then exception is caught and not re-thrown, preventing test interruption.\r\n\r\nAlso, _XCTestCaseImplementation.shouldIgnoreSubsequentFailures is set to YES, preventing future failures from interrupting test case.\r\n\r\nThe common problematic scenario here is when running UI test and SUT crashes.\r\nThis generates a failure, but the test is not interrupted. Test keeps executing reaching all the possible timeouts and executing all the possible re-tries. Test may continue its useless execution for hours after that.\r\n\r\nAttached test does not include any UI testing, but reproduces the problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/sScdZp2d"
