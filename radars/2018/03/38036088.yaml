    description: "Area:\r\nNetwork Extensions Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nehotspotconfigurationmanager/2866695-getconfiguredssids\r\n\r\n\"The user can see name of your app in Settings > Wi-Fi when the networks it has configured are listed.\"\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that this means that the list of SSIDs in Settings > WiFi will be annotated (like a subtitle of the cell) in the same way that it would be when using the NEHotspotHelper API. If that's the case, I'm not observing that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project, but the relevant bit of code is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        let configuration = NEHotspotConfiguration(ssid: \"a nearby SSID\", passphrase: \"the correct passphrase\", isWEP: false)\r\n        NEHotspotConfigurationManager.shared.apply(configuration) { possibleError in\r\n            if let error = possibleError { print(error) }\r\n            else { print(\"Added configuration\") }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the Hotspot Configuration capability enabled, the configuration will be applied shortly after app launch and user approval. The SSID in Settings > WiFi is not annotated, though.\r\n\r\nThe project I'm working on is actually using an SSID and EAP configuration to configure the network, but the differences in code contain a bunch of secrets specific to the network we're using that I can't share. That project's network configuration is correctly being applied and otherwise works, other than this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp display name is a subtitle of the configured SSID in the list of available WiFi networks\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo subtitle is shown\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\n11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"

    title: NEHotspotConfigurations are supposed to annotate configured SSIDs with the app name in Settings, but don't
