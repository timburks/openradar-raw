    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #38274395\n\nWhen using simctl to record a video of an open iOS simulator, the “path” parameter is only validated at the end of the recording, not at the beginning, so in case the path is invalid or is a directory, the user is wasting time recording something that won’t be saved.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a terminal emulator and open iOS Simulator.\n2. Inside the terminal emulator, run “xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo ~/Desktop/“ (without the quotes).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe recording does not start and a “path is a directory” error is output. Better yet, a default file could be created automatically.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get output like this:\n\nGVA encoder info: recomputed for fps: 8.514949, gop size in pics: 255, gop size in sec: 30.000000\nRecording... (Press CTRL+C to stop)\n\nAfter using iOS simulator and pressing Ctrl+C in Terminal, the following error is shown:\n\nError: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=21 \"Is a directory\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
