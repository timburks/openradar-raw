    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is currently no way to unconfigure Mouse-Reporting as the default for new windows or tabs. Sure, sometimes mouse-reporting is a nice feature, but sometimes it bothers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Uncheck „enable Mouse Reporting“ (⌘ R)\n- open new terminal window (or tab)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\na default setting (enabled or disabled) for every new tab or window, maybe based on profile/theme\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nfor the new window mouse reporting is enabled\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n2.8.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
