    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen programming in Xcode while the VoiceOver is on, the autocomplete dialog makes VoiceOver to pronounce the word \"image\" for every item in the autocomplete dialog.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Xcode source editor, start typing something that should display a autocomplete dialog (e.g. print function)\r\n2. When the autocomplete dialog appears, start navigating up or down with arrow keys\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver should read the item name in the autocomplete dialog first and than it's attributes such as: function, local variable, class etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver for every item reads \"image\" and than name of a item  which makes it very frustrating for us who really depend on VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDefault settings"
