    description: "When attempting to @encode simd types such as simd_float3, Clang reports, \"Encoding of 'simd_float3' (vector of 3 'float' values) type is incomplete because 'simd_float3' component has unknown encoding\", and @encode returns the empty string. This makes it impossible to use the expression \"@encode(simd_float3)\" to box a simd_float3 into an NSValue, which is useful for implementing KVC for types that have properties with simd value type.\r\n\r\nOne possible workaround is to treat simd vectors as if they were C arrays of the element type (i.e., @encode(float[4]), but this relies on the implementation detail that simd_float3 is comprised of packed floats (and, pedantically, that it has 4 elements instead of 3)."
