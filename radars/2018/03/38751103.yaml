    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen audio is routed over AirPlay, audio-related API's related to using AVPlayer in an iOS app do not work at all. The attached project demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Music.app on iPhone\r\n- Turn on your AppleTV\r\n- Play a song\r\n- Tap on the control bar at the bottom of the Music app to enlarge the controls. \r\n- Tap on the AirPlay control at the bottom center of the song card.\r\n- Select Apple TV from the list of devices\r\n- Confirm music is playing through AppleTV. AppleTV shows Song title and graphic.\r\n- Open the Play One Video app (see attached project).\r\n- Tap the play button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Video plays silently over music\r\n- tapping mute button unmutes the video, mixing with the music\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Music stops\r\n- Audio from player plays through AppleTV without respecting mute/unmute\r\n- Notice that the app sets the AVAudioSessionMode to AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, .mixWithOthers, though the behavior is the same and incorrect without it when playing over AirPlay.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6S Plus\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen audio is routed over AirPlay, audio-related API's related to using AVPlayer in an iOS app do not work at all.
