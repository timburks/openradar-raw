    description: "Area:\r\nFileProvider Extensions Framework\r\n\r\n3rd-party app which implements FileProviderExtension, it can sync files with iFile. when user want to edit a file in the 3rd-party app, he has the file context where it is, but the 3rd-party app has no ability to edit, he must open it in iFile, if the file path level is deep, he must find it from root folder step by step, it is too hard ! we need a url scheme, to support directly locate the file from 3rd-party app to iFile, maybe, like this ifile://otherAppBundleId/appGroupId/itemIdentifier\r\n\r\nThank you!"
