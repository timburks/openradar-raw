    description: "I want to be able to save NSUserActivity/NSURL objects to the home screen. \r\n\r\nThere are a myriad of useful cases for this, mostly stemming from the idea of being able to have a persistent deep link to a part of an app. For example:\r\n\r\n- Save a deeplink to a particular conversation in a messaging app → tap on it to launch the app straight into that conversation\r\n- Save a deeplink to a document in an app (like Numbers) → tap on it to launch the app straight into that document\r\n- Save a deeplink that represents a particular process (like from Workflow) → tap on it to execute the workflow\r\n- Save a \"call my spouse\" deeplink → tap on it to immediately begin calling that person\r\n- Save a deeplink to the \"create an event\" Calendar screen → tap on it to immediately begin creating an event\r\n- Save a deeplink to the \"compose an email\" screen → Tap on it to immediately begin composing an email\r\n\r\nWhen I bring up a Share Sheet, I should have the option to \"Add to Homescreen\" (like I do in Safari). As an app developer, I should be able to suggest an icon (a profile picture; a thumbnail of a document; etc), and the user should be able to pick a name. I should NOT be able to do this programmatically w/o user consent, so initiating this from the share sheet seems like the logical choice."
