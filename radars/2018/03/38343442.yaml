    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis must be done on a laptop. I tested it on a MacBook Pro. When you configure the command key to act as option, the left and right event modifier flags are wrong when pressing the command key (but right when pressing an option key).\r\n\r\nI have received two reports from users of my app complaining about this.\r\n\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/6549\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/6368\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGo to system prefs > Keyboard > Keyboard. Click Modifier Keys…. Change Command (⌘) Key's setting to \"⌥ Option\".\r\n\r\nRun the attached program in xcode, which logs the key event's modifier flags using NSLog.\r\n\r\nEnsure the ModifierBug window has focus. Press left option, left command, right option, and right command and observe what is logged.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth left-side keys that act as option should log 80120; both right-side keys that act as option should log 80140.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all modifiers on the left side acting as option should send modifiers with NX_DEVICELCMDKEYMASK set and all modifiers on the right acting as option should send modifiers with NX_DEVICERCMDKEYMASK set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeft option: 80120\r\nLeft command: 80140\r\nRight option: 80140\r\nRight command: 80120\r\n\r\nIn other words, left- and rightness is swapped when pressing the command key when it is configured to act as option.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys > Command acts as Option. All other settings as defaults"
