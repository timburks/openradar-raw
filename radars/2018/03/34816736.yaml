    description: "Cookies are not being reliably shared between SFAuthenticationSession instances on different applications, and/or with Safari on iOS 11 devices.  Changes made to cookies inside one instance (create/delete) are not reflected inside other applications.  \r\n\r\nThis breaks Single Sign-on (SSO) and Sign Log-out (SLO) for apps using a common web session for primary authentication in OAuth flows.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears to be working on iOS 11 (15A372) device simulators.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cookie should be shared between the two applications as conveyed through the cookie name label, or by viewing the /get-cookie/user path in Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplications/Safari will display unique cookie token values.  Deleting cookie from one application will not delete token from other applications scope. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nSimulator:\r\niOS 11.0 (15A372) - Working most of the time\r\n\r\nDevices:\r\niPhone 6s - iOS 11.0.2 (15A421) - Not working\r\niPhone 7 - iOS 11.1 (15B5066f) - Not working\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Still broken in iOS11, but fixed in iOS12"
