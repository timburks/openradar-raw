    description: "(Note, they asked me to file another bug report on this for some reason.. file a duplicate?)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter fighting with Xcode to make a workspace with editing windows arranged just so across my 3 monitors, re-opening the project will cause Xcode to lose all of my window placements and even worse, put the windows into tabs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a project and open separate windows for various files to edit them. Put them in specific areas, size them specifically. Close the project. Reopen the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWindows show EXACTLY what was placed in them prior to closing the project in EXACTLY the same location at EXACTLY the same size.\r\n\r\nObserved Results:\r\nAll windows are jammed into a single window as tabs. All window location is lost. All window sizing is lost. Developer is completely disoriented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\n\r\nXcode Version 9.0 beta 2 (9M137d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nREALLY need a way to turn the Safari browser like feature of Xcode **OFF**. Want document windows, don't want browser windows. Don't want tabs.  It would be such a trivial check box... \"Document Mode\".\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro Retina Early 2013, 16G/512G"
