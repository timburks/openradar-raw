    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dragging a location pin or the location title in the details overlay to another app, the sent geo coordinate doesn't correspond to the pin location in some cases.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSpecifically, when placing a pin in an area that resolves to street name accuracy but not street number accuracy, the sent coordinate roughly corresponds to the street bounding box but not the coordinate of the placed pin.\n\nI've attached two screenshots that show the drop source in Maps.app on the right and the received coordinate (drop target) in our app. Our app sets the pin to the exact coordinate received from Maps.app (specifically, we use mapItem.placemark.coordinate).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe received coordinates should be the same as for the pin in the Maps.app:\nScreenshot 1: 48.042385, 11.210606 (lat, lon)\nScreenshot 2: 48.136006, 11.408249\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe received coordinates are way off:\nScreenshot 1: 48.0440357, 11.2088111 (roughly 230 m off)\nScreenshot 2: 48.135553, 11.4052705 (roughly 220 m off)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
