    description: "Summary:\r\nMaking a calendar appointment from month view in BC (Before Christ) time places appointment in AD time. When you do this, it shows in the month view after you add it, then the dot disappears. If you go back to AD time, it shows up there on the same calendar day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Calendar.app, go to year view, scroll back in time until you pass year 1. Now you're in BC time. Keep scrolling. Now make an appointment. Once you do this, a dot appears on the day, and then disappears. You can now scroll forward in time back to AD and note that it shows up on the same day in the future mindBlown.gif\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMy BC calendar appointments remain in BC time\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can't make calendar appointments in BC time.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.6 (15D100)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone Ex"
