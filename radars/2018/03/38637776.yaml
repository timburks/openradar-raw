    description: "Summary:\r\nItem 2.4.1 states that “iPhone apps should run on iPad whenever possible” and I’ve seen rejections stating that “Even if your app was developed specifically for iPhone, users should still be able to use your app on iPad.”\n\nI think this should be reviewed at this point. This was important when iPad was released, but nowadays doing an Universal app with Auto Layout and size classes is so easy that most people will want to support iPads.\n\nBut there’re cases where doing that doesn’t make sense. In that scenario, developers should be able to opt-out from iPad support on iPhone apps. iPhone apps running on iPads run on a 3.5” screen size form factor, which no recent iPhone has. Supporting that form size just because of iPad is a lot of work that doesn’t make sense nowadays.\n\nAdding “sms” to UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities would be a workaround, but you can’t change that value after the app is live on the App Store. Even with that flag, I’ve seen App Store reviewers testing the app on iPads (probably with some internal magic).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to prevent your iPhone app to being run on iPads\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. You can do that with a key on Info.plist or on the iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou’re sad and you have to support a small form factor that no recent phone uses\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11.2.6\r\n\r\nNotes:"
