    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen allowing users to add calendar events from our apps using the EKEventEditViewController, we are forced to add the contacts usage entry, even though we have no need to actually access the contacts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a way to present the EKEventEditViewController\r\n2. Add Calendars Usage Description into plist to avoid crash.\r\n3. Attempt to add location to the event\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeing able to add the location, without more privacy prompts.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes because we are missing the Contacts Usage Description from plist.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a developer I want to access as little user’s data as possible. With Calendars Usage Description, we already have access to create calendar events. Adding location to them shouldn’t be tied to users contacts and feels very wrong to ask user for a permission to access their contacts, when they are just trying to add location to a calendar event."
