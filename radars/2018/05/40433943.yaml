    description: "Currently a playground can be set to execute manually instead of automatically. Unfortunately this setting can only be applied on a per-playground-basis and has to be toggled for every new playground, assuming one wants manual execution. It would be fantastic if this could somehow be set as a default for newly created playgrounds. \r\n\r\nThanks for considering! \U0001F60A"
