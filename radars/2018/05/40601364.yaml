    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn almost all situations, when I make use of a named color asset in a storyboard and that color has been used in the storyboard before, Xcode will add a duplicate definition of that color asset to the storyboard file. The next time that storyboard is opened, Xcode will report that there are inconsistencies in the file and remove the duplicate definition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new single-view project in Xcode\r\n2. Add a color asset to Assets.xcassets\r\n3. Open Main.storyboard and set the existing VC background color to the named color asset you created\r\n4. Add a new VC\r\n5. Save the storyboard\r\n6. Close Xcode\r\n7. Open the project in Xcode again\r\n8. Change the background color of the second VC to the named color\r\n9. Save the storyboard\r\n10. Close Xcode\r\n11. Open the project in Xcode again\r\n12. Open Main.storyboard\r\n13. Note that Xcode has found inconsistencies in the storyboard\r\n\r\nFollowing these steps I was able to create the three commits in the attached sample project. Note the last commit, which was made after steps 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf a named color asset is already defined in a storyboard file, Xcode should not add duplicate definitions upon further use of that color\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode adds duplicate definitions to the storyboard file upon further uses\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\nVersion 9.3 (9E145)"
