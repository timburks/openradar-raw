    description: "For medical apps and other apps in which privacy is a concern. We would like to be able to programmatically disable Siri Suggestions so that the app would not show up on the locked screen based on location, or so that the app would not show up in Siri search suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe user could still choose to enable these settings, but due to privacy concerns, we would like them to be off by default."
