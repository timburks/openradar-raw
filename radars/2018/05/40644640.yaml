    description: "Apps that make use of associated domains/shared web credentials get the benefit of auto-fill/auto-suggestions in text fields, either by explicitly setting a content type, or because iOS detects a email/passwort mask.\r\n\r\nThis is nice, but may provide unhelpful suggestions if an app connects to multiple services (using multiple domains) with different credentials.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to restrict a text field's suggested credentials to a subset of all associated domains. As of now, we can only disable auto-fill/auto-suggestions in for a given text field in these cases."
