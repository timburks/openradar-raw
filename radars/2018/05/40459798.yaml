    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen profiling an app in the simulator with Instruments using the Allocations or Time Profiler templates, generally profiling will work the first time, but on subsequent runs, the app will crash on launch.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Profile an app in Instruments by choosing Product->Profile in Xcode, then selecting the Allocations or Time Profile instrument.\n2. Hit record.\n3. Hit stop.\n4. Make some code changes, then choose Product->Profile again.\n5. Hit record again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app launches again for a second run and profiling proceeds normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app begins to launch (the launch screen is shown), but immediately terminates.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.4 (9Q1019a)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only workaround I’ve found is to quit Instruments and the simulator. Sometimes this isn’t enough and a reboot is required."
