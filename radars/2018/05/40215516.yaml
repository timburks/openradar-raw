    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I run the app on a simulator, it correctly applies the simulated location when I choose it in Xcode. However, when I run my UI tests, the simulated location I chose in scheme is not applied. I can apply the desired simulated location with the dropdown in Xcode. However, in order to set up automated tests, the scheme needs to properly apply the target simulated location since there is no way to set the simulated location from the test scripts. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn a project go to Scheme list > Edit scheme... > Test and then choose needed location in Test Location section. Then launch any UI test that requires location.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA UI test will receive simulated location.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA UI test doesn't receive simulated location."
