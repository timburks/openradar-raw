    description: "Today, with iOS11, Apple offers the NEHotspotConfigurationManager API that allows you to connect directly to a known SSID.\r\nThis feature is very convenient for setting up a wifi accessory but there is no way of knowing if the wifi is in range.\r\nI proposed a new method ::check in the NEHotspotConfiguration class. This class already has a ::init method that allows configuring wifi settings.\r\nThis new method would allow the application to know if the Wifi network is available before calling NEHotspotConfigurationManager::apply in order to propose to the user to connect ONLY if the wifi of the accessory is present.\r\n\r\nCould this evolution be of interest to other developers ?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nSmall precision : it is not a question of scanning the existing wifi networks but to test if a known wifi network is present for a better user experience."
