    description: "Area:\r\nVision.framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a memory leak when Vision framework is used with CoreML to process images coming from ARKit (YUV encoded CVPixelBuffers).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download sample Apple's app that uses Vision, CoreML and ARKit from https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/using_vision_in_real_time_with_arkit?language=objc\r\n\r\n2. Change classificationRequest's imageCropAndScaleOption property from .centerCrop to .scaleFit.\r\n\r\n3. Run the app and observer memory usage. It grows by 1 MB every 1-2 seconds.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMemory usage does not grow over time. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMemory usage grows over time."
