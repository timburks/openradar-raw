    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #39939601\n\nDevelopers (and probably other groups of macOS users) would like to be able to set the default application for opening files without extensions.\n\nWith the prevalence of files without extensions in certain developer workflows, there are quite some files that are expected to have no extension. Developers often use specialised text editors to deal with these files.\n\nFor example, macOS/iOS app development using CocoaPods and Fastlane often use files like 'Podfile', 'Fastfile', 'Matchfile', and so on, which are essentially Ruby files. Text Editors used to edit these files often aid the developer by using syntax highlighting.\n\nIt would be great if we could designate a custom default application to open these files with, so they don't open with TextEdit automatically, but with an application of the developer's choosing.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select file without extension in Finder.\n2. Select 'Get info' for that file.\n3. Set 'Open with:' option to application other than TextEdit.app.\n4. Select 'Change All…'\n5. Select 'Continue' in confirmation dialog.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* File opens with chosen application. \n* Afterwards, all files without extension open with chosen application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to change the default application to open files without extensions. Instead, an error appears;\n\n> An error occurred while changing the application that opens “Dangerfile” because not enough information is available. \n> \n> Do you want to open “XYZ” with “FancyTextEditor.app”?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.13.4 (17E199)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA reason I would really prefer not to use TextEdit by default for these things not mentioned in the radar I’m duping is that TextEdit often inserts “smart quotes”, which breaks continuous integration."
