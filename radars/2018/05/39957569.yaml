    description: "The CallKit documentation ( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit ) reads:\r\n\r\n> This is useful for apps that [...] allow the user to block any numbers that match a set of criteria.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the case. As further described in the documentation:\r\n\r\n> To block incoming calls for a particular phone number, you use the addBlockingEntry(withNextSequentialPhoneNumber:) \r\n\r\nThe idea being, just call that method over and over with every number in the block list. The problem is discussed in more detail in this developer forum post: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/80454\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to block based on some kind of pattern? Like what if I always want to block numbers from a specific area code, or 1-800 numbers? The API doesn't allow that use case, contradicting the documentation's description of the API.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding numbers to a block list, I would like to see a kind of pattern-matching capability added, maybe a Regex even. But ideally I'd just have a callback function and could return a true/false. Thanks!"
