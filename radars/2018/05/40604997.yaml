    description: "Currently, the maxOS app, iOS simulator in Xcode, /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app does not have the key value pair: <key>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app</key><true/>  in its Info.plist - (and ditto for the Watch simulator.)\r\n\r\nPlease add it.\r\n\r\nIf were present, we could use AppleScript to get the names of the simulator windows, and move and resize the simulator windows using Cocoa's inherent applescript support. I've tested this in current Xcode's simulator and it works.\r\n\r\nAdded in Xcode 10 beta 3"
