    description: "Area:\r\nTime Machine\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe \"no backups for x days\" notification does not show the correct number of days since previous successful backup. See attached screenshot where previous successful backup was yesterday, e.g. 1 day ago, but the notification states there have been no backups for 250 days!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHard to reproduce but it involves a network share time machine, a Macbook Pro (alert is shown after lid is opened and a backup perhaps during power nap was interrupted), and a Mac that has been upgraded through the various OS."
