    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs per their documentation (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/shared_web_credentials/preparing_your_app_and_website_to_share), each supported subdomain for shared web credentials (and associated domains in general) needs a separate entry in the entitlements file (or a wildcard), and a matching app site association file under the respective domain.\r\n\r\nWhile this seems to be the case for credentials that you retrieve in code (using SecRequestSharedWebCredential), autofill suggestions in text fields ignore subdomain boundaries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Set up an app with shared web credentials enabled, using sub.myexample.com (use a domain that you are in control of so you can actually place the app site association file there)\r\n* Using SecAddSharedWebCredential or the system settings UI, add credentials for sub.myexample.com, sub2.myexample.com, and myexample.com.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActivating a pair of text fields with content types username/password should (only) auto-suggest the sub.myexample.com credentials.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll three credentials are suggested (maybe not all at once, but if tested individually), including those for other subdomains (sub2. â€¦) and the \"normal\", non-sub-domain.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because various services may operate under the same domain, but different subdomains. The documentation suggests that these will not be mixed up, but they are, and there's nothing you can do about it, except setting the text fields content types to something else, disabling auto-suggestions entirely.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nTested on various phones, including iPhone 7 and X."
