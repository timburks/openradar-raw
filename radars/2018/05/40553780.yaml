    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA table with a refresh control provides no visual feedback (spinner is not visible) if it's being re-used to display search results from a search controller that's embedded in the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the project on a device.\r\n2. On the Root View Controller view, tap the search bar to make it the first responder.\r\n3. Swipe down on the table view until haptic feedback is felt.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnsure. I'd expect either:\r\n- The refresh control's spinner becomes visible somewhere, or\r\n- The table view snaps back and the refresh control does not invoke its valueChanged target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe table view snaps back and the refresh control's valueChanged target is invoked, but the refresh control's spinner never becomes visible.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.3.1 (9E501)\r\niOS 11.3.1 (15E302)"
