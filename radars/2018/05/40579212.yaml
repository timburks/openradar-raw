    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a network, configured via DHCP, sets option interface-mtu to tell a client, that it must lower its MTU to being able to use the network, this option is ignored by macOS, resulting in inability to use the network at usable performance or at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse ISC DHCPd\nset this option required by your network. (For example certain wireless or tunnels uplinks require a lower MTU)\n\"option interface-mtu 1340;\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe network stack must honour this option and lower its MTU for the respective link.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmacOS ignores the option and uses the default MTU of 1500 bytes resulting in a failure to use the network.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.12.6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGiven that macOS and iOS share a lot of networking code it is very likely that iOS is affected by the same bug."
