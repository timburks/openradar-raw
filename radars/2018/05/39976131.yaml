    description: "Summary:\r\nLoading remote content in email impinges on privacy. When and how often we look at our emails (if at all) should be private, yet loading remote content compromises this, allowing our email usage to be tracked.\n\niOS Mail shows a banner at the top of emails when remote content is not being loaded. A single tap of this banner loads remote content with no confirmation. The banner is right next to the navigation bar which is often tapped.\n\nIt’s too easy to accidentally load remote content and be tracked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Settings, disable loading remote content in emails.\n2. Open an email message with remote content.\n3. Tap things around the banner for loading remote content (such as the back button in compact widths or the delete button in regular widths) but maybe you’re in a hurry or distracted or shaking a little.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf loading remote content is disabled, it shouldn’t be easy to accidentally bypass this setting. I would suggest either a confirmation, or burying the option in a menu, or removing the option entirely from Mail and requiring going to Settings to enable loading remote content. I don’t think I have ever tapped this button on purpose since the feature was introduced.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s really easy to bypass this setting.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
