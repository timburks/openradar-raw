    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen available, Handoff appears in the iPad dock just after it appears. When the Handoff icon appears in the dock, other items in the dock shift to the left. In many cases, this is exactly the time when my finger is in flight to tap an icon in the dock. This can result in me tapping the wrong app in the worst case.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have a Mac turned on nearby with a Handoff compatible app frontmost.\n2. Bring up the dock on iPad: by swiping up or going to the home screen\n3. In one action with (2) try to tap an icon in the dock using your muscle memory which learned where things are.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser interfaces should be stable. With reliable tools, we can be productive.\n\nThe icons in the dock should not shift at a time when I’m likely to be in the process of tapping one of them. Maybe you could make the handoff icon there immediately, or don’t make its presence move the other items in the dock, by not perfectly centering the dock.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps in the the dock shift slightly to the left because the Handoff icon appears. This is frustrating.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
