    description: "Please see bug http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4983936539164672 which was closed citing that the issue behaves as intended.\r\n\r\nIâ€™d like to propose that when a today extension target lacks linked files that Xcode should provide a more helpful error message on Simulator install than \"This app could not be installed at this time.\"\r\n\r\nResolving this error was very difficult and the message could be helpful stating that the today extension target has no linked files and cannot be installed. \r\n\r\nPlease see http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4983936539164672 for the full setup instructions to reproduce the issue. This came up in a real world situation in which a framework was used to provide all of the today extension functionality (shared amongst a few apps), resulting in us adding an empty Swift file to the today extension target in order to get past the error message.\r\n\r\nSuggested text: \"{TargetName} could not be installed because no source files are linked to this target.\""
