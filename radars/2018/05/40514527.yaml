    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOur companies email/calendering is run through Google Apps and we all share everyone elses under \"Other calendars\" within the web interface of Google Cal. So my calendar syncs fine and has no issues with iCal, but invitations/alerts/reminders from the shared calendars show pending actions for each one. I can click on all the normal options \"Maybe\" \"Decline\" \"Accept\" but they just come back as I have read only access to them.\r\n\r\nThings I have checked: 1.) In Google Calendar - they are all set to not receive notifications for anything. 2.) In iCal I have checked each calendars settings and \"Ignore alerts\" is checked for each calendar. 3.) In iCal I have checked the Alerts settings for my account and everything is set to None.\r\n\r\nSo even though i've checked those I have currently got 40+ pending Notifications pending action.\r\n\r\nHas anyone had this before and found a solution?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and my apologies if this has been asked before.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Set up Calendar with a google apps account\r\n- In Google Calendar, add the calendar of one of your teammate\r\n- Back to Calendar, your teammate calendar appear (which is already an unexpected result\r\n- Ask another teammate to send an invitation for an event to the first teammate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo invitation notification should display in the notification center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn invitation notification display in the notification with the ability to accept or decline."
