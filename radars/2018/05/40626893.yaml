    description: "Summary:\r\nThe call hierarchy tree that shows the tree of calls to a particular function or method is not filterable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode and any project.\n2. Select a method call.\n3. Find, Find Call Hierarchy.\n4. Type something in the Filter box (at the bottom of the Find navigator).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tree is filtered by what you put in the Filter text box.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Filter text box contents are automatically reset after you type a character and wait for a second.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf the filter functionality is not supported for call hierarchy trees, the Filter text box should be disabled. However, other trees like the Project tree can be filtered successfully, so I think filtering could also be supported for call hierarchies."
