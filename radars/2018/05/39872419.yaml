    description: "Summary:\r\nHere: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/Displays/Displays.html (accessed 1 May /2018 @ 6:24pm UTC)\n\niPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus displays are listed as having a UIKit point size of 375 x 667, but those are incorrect. They are the dimensions of a 4.7 inch screen. They should match the  other 5.5-inch screens, the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus, which are correctly listed as 414 x 736.\n\nI submitted docs feedback, but figured this might be a more direct avenue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
