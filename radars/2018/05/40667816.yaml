    description: "Summary: When XCUITests are run as part of an Xcode Bot test suite, UI Tests fail. When run directly, they do not. These tests seem to involve entering text into UITextViews that are off-screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Set up sample UI Tests that involve entering content into a UITableView. Include a step where text needs to entered into a UITextView that is below the starting screen area.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The test runner should scroll down to enter text into the screen\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: No scrolling occurs, after the wait time the test fails with \"Failed to receive event delivery confirmation within 20.0s of the original dispatch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Xcode 9.4, OS X 10.13.4, iOS 11.4"
