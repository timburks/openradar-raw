    description: "Summary:\r\nAVPlayer, using a FairPlay-encrypted video or stream, cannot handle a video file that is wrapped on a texture around (or inside) a 3D object (whether that'd be using SceneKit, OpenGL, or any game engine to create the 3D object over which one wraps around the video texture asset)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Build a simple 360 video player that accepts video streams.\r\n- Make sure you build it to support Fairplay-encrypted video\r\n- Use a FairPlay encrypted stream as your input\r\n- Watch as the video player you made fails to render that video on screen. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Video would play, projected onto (or inside) the surface of the 3D object in question. Audio should play as well. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Blank screen. \r\n- However, expected results occur when using an unencrypted video stream"
