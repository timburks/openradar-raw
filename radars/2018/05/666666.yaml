    description: We have a VoIP APP that uses AudioUnit. However, we have found that when starting AudioUnit, we often report an error of OSStatus=-66635 or -66637. This error directly leads to AU recording or playback failure. This error did not find a corresponding definition or explanation. We hope to provide the definition or explanation of these codes, or the reasons for these errors.
