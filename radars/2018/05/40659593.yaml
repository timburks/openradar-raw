    description: "Please add a setting to the WWDC app to force it to show all events on the schedule in Pacific time.\r\n\r\nMy rationale:\r\n\r\nWWDC is next week, so I've been looking at schedule in the WWDC app to plan out my week, including making appointments with people I will see while out in San Jose. Since I live in New York and am currently in Eastern time, the app displays all events on the schedule in my local time zone. However, since I know everything will be taking place in Pacific time, I have to perform the time zone conversion in my head, which is becoming difficult and is prone to my own human error. It would be easier if I could just have the app show everything in Pacific time.\r\n\r\nI have currently resorted to switching the time zone on my device and then going back to the WWDC app. In addition, there does appear to have some time zone caching bug since when I switch time zones on my device, the session category headers update the time zone, but the times listed for the specific sessions in the master and detail views still show Eastern time -- I have just resorted to force quitting the app after changing the time zone on my device. See attached screenshot showing inconsistent time zones.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAttachment image URL: https://i.imgur.com/J3p9Q26.jpg"
