    description: "Summary: The SourceKit service SKAgent crashes when trying to index code that relies on a clang feature flag. (Xcode as a whole, and the code in question, both otherwise function and compile without issue.)\r\n \r\nSome testing appears to show that SKAgent is not using flags in the \"Other C Flags\" or \"Other C++ Flags\" settings when trying to parse the code via libclang, resulting in the crash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a clang feature flag to Xcode Build Settings' \"Other C Flags\" or \"Other C++ Flags\", e.g. -fcoroutines-ts\r\n2. Write some code that relies on this feature flag (sample attached)\r\n3. SKAgent repeatedly crashes as it/Xcode tries to parse the code that relies on the feature flag.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nSKAgent should use the Other C Flags && Other C++ Flags settings when parsing code. \r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nSKAgent does not use those flags, and crashes repeatedly trying to parse code that depends on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Reproducible up through the latest as of writing, Xcode 9.4 beta 9Q1019a.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAttached sample is a project-wizard-created macOS command line app using C++. It sets the Build Settings \"C++ Language Dialect\" to \"C++17\" and \"Other C++ Flags\" to \"-fcoroutines-ts\". As a result, SKAgent crashes repeatedly any time you view \"ThisFileCrashes.cpp\" in Xcode. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunching Xcode from Terminal with the -DVTSDKLogLevel 3 switch results in this text:\r\n2018-05-13 19:09:07.615 Xcode[78054:7406314] SourceKit-client: [1:connection-event-handler:111111:-0.0000] Connection interrupt\r\n2018-05-13 19:09:07.615 Xcode[78054:7406520]  DVTAssertions: Warning in /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/IDEFrameworks/IDEFrameworks-14159/IDEFoundation/SourceKit/IDESourceKitConnection.m:295\r\nDetails:  SourceKit service crash notification\r\nObject:   <IDESourceKitConnection: 0x7f9f68930640>\r\nMethod:   -_handleNotification:\r\nThread:   <NSThread: 0x7f9f6b14e160>{number = 26, name = (null)}\r\nPlease file a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com with this warning message and any useful information you can provide."
