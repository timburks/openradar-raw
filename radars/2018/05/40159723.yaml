    description: One of the most useful features of Siri is arguably setting alarms from bed by yelling "HEY SIRI PLEASE SET MY ALARM FOR 8:30 ALRIGHT THANKS!". This either turns on an existing alarm at this time or silently creates a new one as need be. This is what people expect from Siri. But later when you realize "oh shitzu, I need to get him groomed before work and yell "HEY SIRI PLEASE CHANGE MY ALARM TO 7:30", Siri will reply, "There are 30 of them. Tap the one you'd like to change.", at which point I need to take off my eye-mask, sigh deeply, and get out of bed to tap the alarm I want changed even though there is clearly only one active alarm which in an earlier context, I just set. Changing an unspecified alarm should be special cased to only ask "which" alarm when there is more than one alarm currently set. Thank you and goodnight.

    title: Changing an alarm via Siri requires unnecessary extra step when only one alarm is active
