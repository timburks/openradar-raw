    description: "Area:\r\nCFNetwork Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI want to use cellular data when WI-FI is On. For that, I need access to socket before it is connected so that it can be bound to cellular network IP and port.  Thought of using CFStreamCreatePairWithSocket() instead of CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToHost() but stream callbacks are not received.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.\tCreate TCP socket with CFSocketCreate() function \r\n2.\tGet a native socket using CFSocketGetNative() and bind it to cellular IP.\r\n3.\tMake a connection using CFSocketConnectToAddress() with timeout \r\n        parameter as -1 (Need a non-blocking connect).\r\n4.\tScheduled it over run loop. \r\n5.\tUpon kCFSocketConnectCallBack call back event create streams using \r\n         CFStreamCreatePairWithSocket(). \r\n6.\tAssigns a clients to a streams for stream events.\r\n7.\tScheduled streams over run loop and opened the stream.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Receive socket call back events.\r\n2. Receive stream call backs events.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Received kCFSocketConnectCallBack once and kCFSocketWriteCallBack twice. Rest events are not received.\r\n2. Received only kCFStreamEventOpenCompleted.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.3.2"
