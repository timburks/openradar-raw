    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe at Mercari spent a total of 24 hours attempting to set the contentType of a bog-standard UITextField to accept a credit card number, previously saved in the device's Keychain. This included modifying an existing UITextField on our existing Storyboard, and setting up a brand new project with nothing else on the screen.\r\n\r\nWhile the UIKeyboard keyboardType became a Number Pad (as expected), no expected inputAccessoryView provided by the system appeared. We have saved cards in our device Keychain, and are unable to access them for autofill in our service. We removed all custom implementation of any delegates, and any custom inputAccessoryView in hope of tempting the desired system accessory to appear.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was experienced on physical devices, as well as the iOS Simulator. It also occurred on all development schemes, from Release to Development.\r\n\r\nThe documentation states this property as being available as of iOS 10.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Set the .contentType property of a UITextField to .creditCardNumber\r\n- Run the app\r\n- Select the UITextField\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- See Keychain button/autofill suggestions for stored cards.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Experience utter lack of expected Keychain button/autofill suggestions for stored cards.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.3 (15E216), Xcode 9.3 (9E145), macOS High Sierra 10.13.4"
