    description: "In our application we support placing calls and are providing different types of haptic feedback during a call (e.g. when a participant joins or starts / stops sending video). However, the haptic feedback only is executed when the call has been accepted using CallKit. If it is accepted with our native UI no haptics are executed. General information on the internet suggests that no haptics will be executed while audio is recorded, but this seems to be inconsistent with what happens when using CallKit.\r\n\r\nWe are using a `UISelectionFeedbackGenerator` as well as a `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator` which get created once we display our native call UI.\r\n\r\nThe relevant classes that perform the haptic feedback can be found here: https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/tree/develop/Wire-iOS/Sources/UserInterface/Calling/Haptic%20Feedback, but this does seem to be more an issue of how the audio session is setup or something in that direction."
