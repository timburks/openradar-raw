    description: "Summary:\r\nWe would like to have a property for querying if a XCUIElement is visible on screen. The combination of exists and hittable properties does not always work properly, since an element can be not hittable, but still visible, like an image covered by a gesture recognizer or some other transparent view, which steals touches.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a screen with two views A and B. View A is completely covered by view B and view B is transparent but still captures touches.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen writing a UI test we should be able to verify that view A is visible on screen by querying the proposed visible property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently we can only verify that view A exists in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3\r\n\r\nNotes:"
