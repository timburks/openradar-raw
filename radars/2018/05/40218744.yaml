    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is primary a documentation issue, but right now there doesn’t appear to be anything in the class/method documentation for UICollectionViewLayout to indicate that `.invalidateLayout` and `invalidateLayout(with:)` are called in the same path\n\nWithout this info, it can lead developers of custom layouts to implement both `invalidateLayout()` and `invalidateLayout(with:)`, thinking that the former can be called when a full invalidation is required and that the latter can be used for targeted invalidation.\n\nSince it’s actually that the former calls the latter, this can lead to inadvertently clearing layout attributes at unnecessary times and lead to performance issues\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UICollectionViewLayout subclass\n2. Implement invalidateLayout() such that it clears all attributes\n3. Implement invalidateLayout(with:) such that it clears some of the attributes as appropriate\n4. Implement shouldInvalidateLayout(forBoundsChange:) to return true\n4. Display a collection view with the custom layout and change the bounds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrom the documentation, it’s not entirely clear if both invalidateLayout() and invalidateLayout(with:) will be called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth invalidateLayout() and invalidateLayout(with:) are called, losing the performance gains of doing the targeted invalidation.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe “Optimizing Layout Performance Using Invalidation Contexts” section of the documentation _almost_ makes this clear.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewlayout"
