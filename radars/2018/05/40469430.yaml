    description: "Attachments: https://imgur.com/a/7imNmF0\r\n\r\nSummary: When trying to notify your friends in Find My Friends of your location now or when you arrive/leave a location, upon completion, a alert box appears with the title \"Cannot Create Notification: This phone number does not appear to be associated with an iPhone\" (see attachment 1). No location is sent. I checked both iMessage and FaceTime settings, and my Apple ID (ridha.hassoun@me.com) is associated with my phone number. This is on an iPhone 8S Plus, running iOS 11.3.1. However, you *can* send notifications to each friend individually from the main screen. That is not affected. It is only from the Me screen (attachment 2).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Find My Friends. Touch \"Me.\" Then \"Notify Friends.\" Then either add notification if you have one set up already or create a new one. Add friends to share location with. You can chose whether to send my location now or when you leave/arrive. Then hit done.  An alert should appear like Attachment 1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should send location to friends without a problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The alert box in attachment 1 appears and no location notification is sent to the friends selected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: Could not find version number, however it is iOS 11.3.1 running on an iPhone 8 Plus."
