    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an iPhone to the DNS64/NAT64 wifi hotspot a mac has enabled. \r\n2. View traffic on the iPhone with rvictl / wireshark\r\n3. Run any app that uses DNS; but in particular apps that use their own DNS resolver\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee in wireshark that DNS responses from the mac are returned from the same IP address to which they were sent to. We do not want to accept DNS results from other IP addresses, to avoid DNS spoofing. See RFC 5452 section 3:\r\n\r\n\"  DNS data is to be accepted by a resolver if and only if:  \"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"   3.  The response comes from the same network address to which the\r\n       question was sent. \"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee in wireshark that DNS responses from the mac are returned from a different IP address than which they were sent to. Refer to the attached packet capture."
