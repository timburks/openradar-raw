    description: "Summary:\r\nThe sidebar in Photos (the app) has a tree hierarchy of sections. Similarly, the OS-wide Open dialog also includes Photos as a data source, which in turn uses an outline view to present a hierarchy. However, the two differ in some significant and confusing ways.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake a typical Photos library with Memories, People, Places, etc.\r\n\r\nIt will have, in the Photos app, a hierarchy roughly like so:\r\n\r\n# Library\r\n## Photos\r\n## Memories\r\n## People\r\n## Places\r\n## Imports\r\n## Recently Deleted\r\n\r\n# Shared\r\n## Activity\r\n## Shared Albums\r\n### Some album\r\n### Another\r\n\r\n# Albums\r\n## Media Types\r\n### Videos\r\n### Selfies\r\n### Live Photos\r\n### Panoramas\r\n### Bursts\r\n### Screenshots\r\n## My Albums\r\n### Some album\r\n### Another\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n## My Projects\r\n\r\nNotice in particular the presence and placement of these:\r\n\r\n# Library\r\n## People\r\n## Places\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\n# Albums\r\n## Media Types\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Open dialog should show a similar hierarchy. That is to say, I should be able to expand Library, then Places.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSuperficially, the hierarchy does look similar, which actually adds to the confusion, as it leads to the presumption that the entire hierarchy either matches, or that nodes that cannot be found here simply aren't offered.\r\n\r\nIn detail, there are strange differences:\r\n\r\n* The Library node does not exist at all.\r\n* The Places node is now in the first level, leading you to believe that the People node should be as well.\r\n* There is a top-level Albums node. However, it does not have the subnodes Media Types and My Albums. Instead, those now appear directly underneath Albums.\r\n* Most importantly, People appears here — even though it appears in Library in the Photos app.\r\n\r\nThis led me to believe incorrectly that People didn't exist / wasn't supported from Open dialogs at all.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.5 Beta (17F59b)\r\n3.0 (3271.13.150)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)"
