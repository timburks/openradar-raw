    description: "Summary:\r\nWith Xcode 9.4, exported xliff file shows absolute path of the string files. On importing translated xliff into Xcode, it treats  contained string files  as new separate files and xcode doesn't show translation for english string files. Some time xcode crashes too if I try to import translated xliff file from lower xcode version with Xcode9.4   \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open some workspace in xcode9.2\r\n2. click workspace, click on \"Editor\">\"Export for Localization...\"> save the file.\r\n3. Repeat step 1,2 with xcode 9.4 and save the xliff file with different name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXliff file generated with xcode9.4 shall not show absolute path for string files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nxliff file generated with xcode9.4 contains absolute path of some string files.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode9.4\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
