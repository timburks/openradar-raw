    description: "Every iOS team goes through a migration period when upgrading Xcode and/or Swift. This requires the team to use different versions of Xcode, depending on which branch they're working on. \r\n\r\nWeb developers already found great solutions for this problem, by locking the exact version of the used toolings in lock files (e.g. Gemfile.lock), however there hasn't been any movement from Apple's side.\r\n\r\nWe need a way to specifcy an exact version of Xcode for each project & branch, in a human-readable file. I propose an official [.xcode-version file](https://github.com/fastlane/ci/blob/master/docs/xcode-version.md) that should be included in every iOS project. This will allow **any** CI system to automatically install and use the right version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nWhat we need from Apple to make this easier:\r\n- A way to install a specific version of Xcode using the command line\r\n- A way to install Xcode without requiring `sudo` permission\r\n\r\nCurrently we have to build & maintain our own third party tooling to reach our goals (e.g. https://github.com/krausefx/xcode-install)\r\n\r\nMore information about all of this is available on [ios-factor.com](https://ios-factor.com)."
