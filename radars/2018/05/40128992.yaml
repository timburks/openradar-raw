    description: "Summary: When submitting a binary that has an Intent-based extension and an AppIntentVocobulary.plist, the following styles of warnings are emitted:\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"I want to run with {AppName}\" was not classified as a INStartWorkoutIntent intent\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"Finish my run with {AppName}\" was not classified as a INEndWorkoutIntent intent\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"Resume my workout with {AppName}\" was not classified as a INResumeWorkoutIntent intent\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"Pause my run with {AppName}\" was not classified as a INPauseWorkoutIntent intent\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - Sample phrase \"Stop my run with {AppName}\" was not classified as a INEndWorkoutIntent intent\r\n\r\nInvalid Siri Support - No example phrase was provided for INCancelWorkoutIntent in the \"zh-hans\" language. Please refer to \"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/registering_custom_vocabulary_with_sirikit/global_vocabulary_reference/intent_phrases\"\r\n\r\nWe started receiving these warnings about maybe half a year ago, with no changes to the vocabulary plist. We added all of our localized versions in order to stop the language warnings, but these still get emitted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Upload an app that contains Intent/Siri support, with a valid AppIntentVocabulary.plist\r\n2. Wait for iTunes Connect to process the binary.\r\n3. Receive an email saying the phrases are invalid.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo email should be sent warning about incorrect classification of example phrases.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn email is sent warning about incorrect classification of example phrases."
