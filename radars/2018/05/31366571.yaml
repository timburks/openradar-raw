    description: "We'd like to add unit tests for our Health integration, but this is infeasable in any automated environment because the simulator may require user interaction to grant (or deny) permission.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to allow an automated permission overwrite for test targets (probably simulator-only?).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: There was back and forth discussion with engineering, who pointed out there's addUIInterruptionMonitorWithDescription:handler:, but it's only for UI tests. The initial issue remains unresolved.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 15364046 (Open)."
