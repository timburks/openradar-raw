    description: "Summary:\r\nPresenting a modal on a split view when multitasking will cause the incorrect sizes to be reported by `viewWillTransition(to size: with coordinator:)`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTo make this easier I have put together a sample project that logs a views history of sizes as reported by `viewWillTransition(to size: with coordinator:)`\r\n\r\n1. Run this sample app on a 12.9 inch iPad (or simulator) in portrait.\r\n2. Open up a second app (eg. Files) side by side with the sample app.\r\n3. Select \"Present\" from the navigation bar to show a full screen modal.\r\n4. Rotate the device right.\r\n5. Rotate the device back left.\r\n6. Dismiss the modal\r\n7. Note the reported size\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe last reported size of the right hand view controller matches the size of the view controller. Rotating the view controller back and forth form the current orientation should make it return to the same size. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe last reported size of the right hand view controller claims it has a width of 320. This is false as confirmed by the view debugger.  You can also see that it is false as it claims to be the same size as the notably smaller view controller to it's left.  Rotating the view controller back and forth from this screen will cause the screen to update and display the correct size. \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 but also prior versions\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iPad modern enough to support side by side multitasking"
