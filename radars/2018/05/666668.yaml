    description: 'When we use AudioUnit to make a VoIP call, there is an accidental sonic boom. At this time, the audio packets of the renderCallBack are all 0 value. Immediately after the second pass of VoIP is constructing AudioUnit, an error code of OSStatus=-50 will appear in AudioOutputUnitStart, causing the AU construction to fail. We would like to know: 1. Under what circumstances will sonic boom occur. 2, when encountered in question 1, we have AudioUnitUninitialize and AudioComponentInstanceDispose to clear AudioUnit, but the second pass will still encounter -50 code in AudioOutputUnitStart.'
