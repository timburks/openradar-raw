    description: During the VoIP call, if a routechange occurs, AudioUnitAddPropertyListener in AudioUnit will call back 23, 19, 23 events. this is normal. (kAudioUnitProperty_SetRenderCallback(23), kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout(19)). However, we have found that if the kAudioUnitProperty_SetRenderCallback(23) does not immediately follow kAudioUnitProperty_AudioChannelLayout(19), the audio packet recorded by the AU is in question, all 0 value. In other words, the order of 23, 19, and 23 is normal, 23 and 19 are abnormal, the 23 events were lost after 19.
