    description: "Area:\r\nUIKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen reordering auto-sized cell, the cells size changes to the estimatedItemSize when the cells are being rearranged (moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath, etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a collection view with a flow layout, including an auto-sized cell using auto-layout. Call 'moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath' on the collection view. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cells animate to the new position and maintain their size during the animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cells animate to the new position, but during the animation the cell size is reset to the estimatedItemSize. The cell dimension is restored to the expected dimension after the animation ends.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nTested on iOS 11.3"
