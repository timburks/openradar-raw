    description: "DEP enrolled devices updated to 11.3.1 can successfully execute the ScheduleOSUpdate MDM command using the 11.3.1 update key, however, the device returns no results whatsoever (No command status, no UpdateResults, nothing) rendering the results of the execution of the command impossible to interpret by an MDM server.\r\n\r\nThe device does seem to acknowledge the command, but it just does not return any response to the caller. Device logs excerpt:\r\n\r\niPad mdmd[226] <Notice>: Polling MDM server https://servername/mdm for next command.\r\n...\r\niPad mdmd[226] <Notice>: Attempting to perform Supervised request: ScheduleOSUpdate\r\niPad mdmd(FindMyDevice)[226] <Notice>: -[FMDFMIPManager isManagedLostModeActive]\r\niPad mdmd(MDM)[226] <Notice>: Handling request type: ScheduleOSUpdate\r\niPad mdmd[226] <Notice>: Command Status: Acknowledged\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Update an iPad device from 11.2.1 or 11.3 to iOS 11.3.1.\r\n2. Execute a ScheduleOSUpdate command using an update key for iOS 11.3.1.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA response should be generated by the device and returned back to the MDM server. The response should perhaps contain an UpdateResults Status like 'InstallFailed' or similar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo response is returned by the device to the MDM server at all."
