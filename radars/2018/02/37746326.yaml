    description: "Could you please make iBooks sync last read location for PDFs between iOS and MacOS?\r\n\r\niBooks already syncs last read location for (a) PDFs between multiple iOS devices, and (b) ePubs between iOS and MacOS â€” so it seems reasonable for users to expect iBooks to sync last read location for PDFs between iOS and MacOS, as well."
