    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #37150880\n\nAs discussed in the Restoring State section of the Mac Human Interface Guidelines (https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/app-architecture/restoring-state/), apps should come back to the state you left them in.\n\nHowever Xcode does not maintain the back-forward history when a project is closed.\n\nI find the back-forward history extremely useful when working with Xcode because I often want to make multiple edits in a small set of files.\n\nUnfortunately this problem is compounded by the fact that Xcode often has troubles (such as autocompletion not working) that can be fixed by quitting and relaunching it.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a project in Xcode\nNavigate between a few files\nClose the project or quit Xcode\nOpen the project or relaunch Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould maintain back-forward history in each editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBack-forwards history is lost.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDuping because I work extensively with this back/forward stack as well, and that would make my work faster."
