    description: "Summary:\r\nIt was easier to see before, but now I can’t see it at all.\n\nI attached a screenshot.\n\n(Otherwise the view works a lot better than it used to! Thanks for that!!!)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the background color of the text editor to pure black\n2. Go in the Comparison View of the Version Editor. Move to an earlier commit where things changed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to easily see the changed lines and the cool graphic thing (of the same color) that links the two versions\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt’s very hard to discern the black background color with the color of the changed lines\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.3 Beta 2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
