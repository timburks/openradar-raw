    description: "Area:\r\nApp Store\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUsers who have purchased an In-App-Purchase before are not able to restore it on a new Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload an app from the Mac App Store on a new computer, chose 'Restore Purchase' (default procedure), and nothing happens. No response from the App Store server.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould return 'SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored' in '- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions'. -- It did that before, but now it doesn't respond to '- (void) restoreCompletedTransactions' anymore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWaiting for a response forever. No answer.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nDoes not apply -- happens on Sierra and High Sierra, and for other developers, too: https://forums.tumult.com/t/hype-3-mac-app-store-version-restore-purchases-issue/12092\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nStarted to happen two weeks ago. As this worked perfectly before, the problem seems to be with the App Store server."
