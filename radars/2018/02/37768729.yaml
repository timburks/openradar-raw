    description: "Area:\r\nSimulator\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUse the pinch to zoom gesture in the Maps app on any iOS simulator and drag offscreen.  After this the simulator does not respond properly to touches, as if pinch to zoom gesture has not completed.  This defect is not specific to the Maps app, I found it first in a totally different app. Have not been able to reproduce on an actual device.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Maps app\r\n2. Use pinch-to-zoom gesture to drag map about for a bit\r\n3. Without releasing the gesture, drag the two gray dots as far as you can so the mouse cursor moves off screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTouch events would be handled as usual\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTouch system seems totally borked - even after force-quitting the app\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nOS X 10.13.3\r\nXCode 9.2 (9C40b)"
