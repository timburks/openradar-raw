    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the Apple TV name changes, remote access to the HomeKit features is broken. Fortunately the local access is still fine (within it LAN).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n#1 setup an Apple TV with a custom name\n#2 attach some HomeKit devices to its LAN (tested with Fibaro, Hue, Ikea Tjadfri, Elgato devices)\n#3 local (LAN/WiFi) and remote (cellular/LTE) access (via iPhone iOS 11.2.5) is running fine\n#4 change the name of the Apple TV\n#5 local access (via iPhone) is working\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n#6 remote access should work like it was at #3\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n#6 remote access (e.g. switch off WiFi/BT or from \"outside\") is broken, the Home App serves errors for each HomeKit accessory\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I switch back to the name given in #1, remote access is working fine.\n\nSometimes (but not always) the \"House edit screen\" showed me the previous name when editing its values and there the previous \"Hub name\" was shown. That was the only way I could re-enable remote access.\n\nNow that the Apple TV name was reset to its previous value, I do not see the \"Hub name\" anymore."
