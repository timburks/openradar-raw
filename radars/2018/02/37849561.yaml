    description: "Summary:\r\nSelecting a window whose collectionBehavior includes NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces from Exposé causes the window to briefly be front, main, and key and then another app is activated immediately after the Exposé animation finishes.\r\n\r\nUse the attached app to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch any app, e.g. Xcode\r\n2. Launch another app that creates a window with collectionBehavior including NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces. Position that window over Xcode's window.\r\n3. Ensure the window with NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces is main & key and that its app is active\r\n4. Four-finger swipe up to enter Exposé\r\n5. Select the window with NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window you selected in Exposé is key & main and its app is active\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExpose animates out to reveal the selected window in front, but then another app (Xcode in my steps above) gets activated.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.12 and 10.13.3\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nSee sysdiagnose\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDupe of 34725722"
