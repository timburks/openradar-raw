    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #37149814. I am duping this because it would be SO SO USEFUL. Thank you.\n\nDevelopers could watch more WWDC videos in the same amount of time if the WWDC app allowed faster playback speeds, such as 1.5× or 2× real-time. This mean developers could be more informed and up-to-date with the latest Apple technologies and best practices.\n\nPlayback controls are commonplace in podcast apps and other video players. This is because in many cases humans are capable of processing information faster than speaking it. The information processed per unit time is likely to be greater with faster playback.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the WWDC app on iPhone or iPad and watch a video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayback speed controls for faster or maybe even slower playback.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan only play at 1× speed. There is a button to skip 15 second forwards but that’s not what is wanted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0.3 (653)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: download the videos on a Mac and use QuickTime Player which support up to 1.9× speed. However iPad is where it’s at so it’s a bit disappointing having to use a clunky old computer for a task as simple as watching a video and taking notes. Also you need to option-click the fast forward button nine times to get here since QTP stopped playing audio at 2× a few versions ago. And you have to click it all those time again after pausing and resuming. \U0001F614\n\nWorkaround 2: Use VLC on iOS. I haven’t tried this for a while but I remember it was a pain. The app wasn’t very nice to use, and you have to use a Workflow or something to extract the download URL from a WWDC session page link."
