    description: "Summary:\r\nforceDelayedSoftwareUpdates key documentation is confusing.\nUpdate from February 2018 says forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates is part of com.apple.applicationaccess (as Profile Manager generates), but January update indicates that the key is part of com.apple.SoftwareUpdate payload.\nWhat is correct, and if both are set, which one wins ?\n\nProfile Manager (still the case with 5.6 beta 1) shows “delay for 90 days” when forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates is checked, but the new documentation says that when forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates is true, enforcedSoftwareUpdateDelay is used to define the time the updates are delay, and that the default is 30 days. \n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nProfile Manager, create a configuration profile for macOS, go to restrictions - compare with doc\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClarification in the documentation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDocumentation is unclear about the key location and the default value.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
