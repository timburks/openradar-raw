    description: "data sources : parts of running data from codoon of Beijing Olympic Park in January\r\ncollection method: codoon recorded the precision of each GPS point, analyzed the precision of original information, calculated relevant indicators\r\nterm definition:\r\n1)average value of GPS precision: sum of GPS precision of each equipment / number of GPS points of each equipment\r\n2)low-precision GPS point : precision of GPS which collected  from codoon is  greater than 20 means low-precision GPS\r\n3)proportion of low-precision GPS point: sum of number of  low-precision GPS points of each equipment /  number of GPS  points  of each equipment * 100%\r\n\r\nConclusion: iPhoneX has lowest-precision GPS in 16 days according to the motion data collected in the same place in January, which ranks first in our sampling equipments\r\n\r\nAttachmentï¼šhttp://img3.codoon.com/common/backend_95a71ca0-f48b-4a79-b821-cbbcbca49483_1519816565202.numbers"
