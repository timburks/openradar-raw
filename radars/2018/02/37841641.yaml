    description: "Summary:\r\nIBDesignables don't work at all in a project that has a Watch app because the automatic step that build the project for interfacebuilder is broken in this case.\r\n\r\nI really hope a fix can be included for this in Xcode 7.3 as this has been broken since 7.2.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new \"iOS App with WatchKit App\" project in Xcode\r\n2. Add a custom view and make it designable\r\n3. Use the custom view in a storyboard\r\n\r\nAttached is a project prepared in this way and a screenshot that shows the error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode builds the project and displays the designable in interface builder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode fails to build the project with the following message:\r\ntarget specifies product type 'com.apple.product-type.watchkit2-extension', but there's no such product type for the 'iphonesimulator' platform\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n7.2 GM and 7.3 beta 3"
