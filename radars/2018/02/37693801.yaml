    description: "Area:\r\nMapKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA MKMapView added to an iOS app project with showPointsOfInterest set to false will hide some, but not all of the points of interest on the map. This results in not being able to have a map displayed without points of interest.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd an MKMapView to an iOS project, and set showPointsOfInterest to false.\r\nGo to a city such as Sydney (-33.8688, 151.2093 ), zoom in and notice that there will still be points of interest shown, such as businesses, schools and parks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe map is shown without any points of interests. Only suburb names, street names, labels etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe map is shown with icons and labels representing points of interests. See attached screenshot for an implementation of MKMapView with pointsOfInterest set to false. You can see that there are still points of interest on the map.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 10.0 - 10.3.3 and iOS 11.0 - 11.2.5.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS Simulator & iPhone X Model A1865 (256GB)."
