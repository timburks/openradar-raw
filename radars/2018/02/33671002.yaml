    description: "Area:\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSemantically speaking, `Calendar.current.date(bySetting: .day, value:5, of: .now)` reads much more clearly than `Calendar.current.date(bySetting: .day, value:5, of: Date())`. This would be a very simple change that would improve readability in many circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere is precedence for this -- `Date.distantPast` and `Date.distantFuture` currently exist as static constants."
