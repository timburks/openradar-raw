    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen two methods have similar signatures, auto completion does not provide enough information to distinguish those two methods. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached project.\r\n2. Open `ViewController.m` in Xcode\r\n3. In `viewDidLoad` type in `[self am` and wait for the auto completion.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto completion lets distinguish between the two methods. (Xcode 6 or so did insert a preview into the editor. That was perferct!)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not possible to distinguish the two methods in the popup. Only solution is to select one of the suggestions and see if it is the correct one.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 2015, macOS 10.12.6"
