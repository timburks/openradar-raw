    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a table view has a negative top content inset and uses fixed row heights and you do a reloadData, the scroll view gets in a weird state where it rubberbands to an incorrect position. If you pull it “long enough”, it resets to the correct state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Download included sample project, also available at https://github.com/skagedal/radars\n- Run in an iOS 11.2 simulator or on device with Xcode 9.2\n- Press “Toggle Preview”\n- Press “Cause Problem”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Nothing visible happens, table view reloads.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Content disappears up above the visible area. If you drag it down, strange stuff happens with cell separators.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround is to implement estimatedRowHeight and return the same values as rowHeight. This fix is included in the code repo as commented-out code."
