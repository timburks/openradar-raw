    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen recording a UI test on a connected device, interactions made while VoiceOver is enabled on the device do not get recorded in the UI test.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS app with some buttons.\n2. Create a UI unit test target.\n3. Place your cursor in the default testExample() method’s body.\n4. Set the target device of the app to a connected iOS device (in my case, an iPhone X running 11.2.5).\n5. Enable VoiceOver on the iOS device.\n6. Click the Record Test button to begin recording a UI test.\n7. Use VoiceOver to tap some buttons or interact with the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGenerated UI test code appears in the test method.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo code appears. Even if you turn off VoiceOver while recording, additional interactions with the app don’t work. You have to have not been running VoiceOver when the app was launched in order for interactions to be recorded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe first time I interacted with the device after the recording has started, this message would appear in the console. It seems relevant:\n\n2018-02-15 09:17:14.406646-0500 Voicerer[12675:2980486] [AXRun] the pid{0} for this context id{0} is not the same for the hit testing app{12675}, so we shouldn't use it here. this hit test needs to forward through to the remote view"
