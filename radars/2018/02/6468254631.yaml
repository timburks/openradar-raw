    description: "Using Xcode 9.2 and two operating system High Sierra and Sierra , the first with APFS and the second with HFS+ filesystem, sharing this project for example through GIT or copied with an USB pen and trying to archive and sending to apple store for testing the project in High Sierra with APFS I always receive this error email from Apple team:\r\n\r\nInvalid Signature - A sealed resource is missing or invalid. The file at path <path of my project> is not properly signed. Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate..\r\n\r\nThis issue stopped if I move this project from another HFS+ partition instead of APFS."
