    description: "Area:\r\nNetwork Extensions Framework\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNEFilterControlProvider and NEFilterDataProvider only available for supervised devices and local development builds. This API is genuinely useful for mobile developers, and they shouldn't be limited to just supervised devices. \r\n\r\nFor example: there have been lots of iOS apps that promise to show more detailed data usage graphs. After installing the app, they'd install a VPN service on your phone, without really communicating that to the user, causing all network traffic to be routed through a (potentially dangerous) third party VPN provider.\r\n\r\nBy removing the supervised device limitation for the NEFilterControlProvider and NEFilterDataProvider classes, developers would be able to build those kinds of apps, without putting the end-user at risk for potential data theft and general hijacking of web requests.\r\n\r\nSome example use cases:\r\n- Show detailed data usage per host of your whole phone\r\n- Block certain web hosts for your whole iPhone, to protect the user's privacy by blocking certain analytics services\r\n- Build an app that shows what hosts have been contacted, and offer a way to block some of them, to avoid \"data leaks\" to certain companies\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nXcode 9.2\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
