    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening up the editor for a field, I expect it to have the same value as it displays. And when I hit enter to commit the value, I expect it to now show what I have edited. I am here describing a situation where the two are different, and you therefore get unsure what the real setting is. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project. \n2. In the Project settings, under Other Swift Flags, the Debug configuration, write `-D DEBUG`. \n3. Add a sub level to Debug for “Any iOS Simulator SDK”. Change its value to `-D SIMUALTOR`.\n4. Now go into the targets settings, Other Swift Flags.\n5. The “Debug” will now have the inherited value `-D DEBUG` and the “Any iOS Simulator SDK” will have the inherited value `-D SIMULATOR`.\n6. Now change line `-D DEBUG` in Debug to `-D FOO`. \n7. It will appear as if the “Any iOS Simulator SDK” inherited this, as it now also has `-D FOO` written in non-bold font.\n8. *But if you press enter on that line to edit, it will still say `-D SIMULATOR`. *\n9. Pressing enter again makes it say `-D FOO` again. \n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 8, I expect the contents of the editor to be `-D FOO`. \n\nMaybe it says `-D SIMULATOR` because of the other inheritance at work, and that it does this to provide a way for me to change to that. I think that’s weird, but in that case, I expect pressing enter to “commit” that, making the text in step 9 be `-D SIMULATOR` (in bold).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText field contents say `-D SIMULATOR`.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2  (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
