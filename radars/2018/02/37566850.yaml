    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 9.3 beta (9Q98q) has an issue where it hangs when selecting ‘Build and run…’ after the build is finished. It seems to be waiting for the simulator to start even though the simulator is already running.\n\nThis happens a lot. It seems that making sure no debug session is running right now (by selecting the stop button in Xcode) makes it less likely to happen but even when always doing that it will happen at some point (after ~3 or 4 build & runs).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Open any Xcode iOS project\n1. Select an iOS Simulator (i.e. iPhone X)\n2. Click the ‘play’ button to build and run\n3. Wait for the app to launch in the simulator\n4. Repeat from step 2 on multiple times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen clicking the play button any currently running debug session is stopped, the app is recompiled, copied over to the simulator and the simulator launches the app again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen clicking the play button any currently running debug session is stopped, the app is recompiled, copied over to the simulator and then Xcode shows ‘Waiting for <device name> to start…’, where <device name> is the name of the selected simulator. Xcode hangs there and does not continue. Waiting for several minutes did nothing. Quitting the simulator and re-running does not help. Clicking on the ‘stop’ button in Xcode does nothing. The button stays active but nothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.3 beta (9Q98q)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
