    description: "Phased release are a great feature and we started using it for our releases. \r\nWe've recognized an error in our app on the last release. So we stopped the phased release and submitted a new app version. In that case it would be great to return to the previous app version until the bugfix is released. It's clear to me that the already updated version can't be downgraded but the search shouldn't return the stopped phased app version in the App Store ."
