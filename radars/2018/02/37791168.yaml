    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently if you set an invalid image name in Interface Builder, at runtime you end up with this message in the console:\n\n> Could not load the \"foobar\" image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier \"...\"\n\nIt would be useful to be able to set a breakpoint here in order to catch and debug these missing images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project\n2. Open Main.storyboard\n3. Drag out an image view\n4. Set a random string as the image name\n5. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere's some breakpoint you can set in order to catch these\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's a log in the console telling you the image couldn't be loaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
