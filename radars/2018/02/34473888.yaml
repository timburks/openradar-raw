    description: "Area:\r\nMDM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDuring MDM registration, the device makes 2 http requests to Entrust-managed SCEP endpoints at bluecoatasweb.managed.entrust.com - the first one succeeds on both iOS 9/10 and iOS 11.  The second one (the PKIOperation one) fails on iOS 11.\r\n\r\nThese requests are generated by the device itself - within the operating system - and not by anything that we are doing.\r\n\r\nIn doing a quick scan, it appears that the “+” and “/“ characters are no longer being %-encoded in iOS 11.  Entrust’s SCEP server is expecting them to be percent-encode. \r\n\r\nThis actually appears to be a bug in iOS 11…according to the draft specification for SCEP (https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-gutmann-scep-06.txt), the last paragraph of section 4.1 reads:\r\n\r\n   When using GET messages to communicate binary data, base64 encoding\r\n   as specified in [2] MUST be used.  The base64 encoded data is\r\n   distinct from \"base64url\" and may contain URI reserved characters,\r\n   thus it MUST be escaped as specified in [8] in addition to being\r\n   base64 encoded.  Finally, the encoded data is inserted into the\r\n   MESSAGE portion of the HTTP GET request.\r\n\r\nThe reference \"[8]” is RFC 2396 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2396) - and in section 3.4, it reads:\r\n\r\n   Within a query component, the characters \";\", \"/\", \"?\", \":\", \"@\",\r\n   \"&\", \"=\", \"+\", \",\", and \"$\" are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis seems to indicate to me that Apple has actually broken something in iOS 11.  I validated this by setting up a proxy that will replace all “+” and “/“ characters in the message parameter with the appropriately-encoded values.  Doing this *did* work, and I was able to register the profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to install and OTA MDM profile using Entrust's SCEP server.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDoes not work - Error \r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nStandard (clean installation)"
