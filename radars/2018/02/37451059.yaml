    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #37450480\n\nThis is a regression from Xcode 8.2.1, where it linked warning-free.\nIt does work with the new build system, however we’re blocked on rdar://35488529 and thus still use the old build system for all builds across platforms.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnsure what to deliver to reproduce. This cannot be reproduced in a sample app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCompile same as Xcode 9.2.1 or new build system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInvalid bitcode signature linker error\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.3b2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI also added -v as per Ankit Aggarwal’s comment on Twitter, but it did not yield any more useful data.
