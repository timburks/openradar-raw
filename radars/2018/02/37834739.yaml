    description: "Summary:\r\nPressing Cmd + F focuses iTunes' search field and searches the iTunes Store/Apple Music instead of searching the playlist that is currently being viewed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClick on a playlist in your iTunes music library to view it (or create one, if none exist).\r\nPress the keyboard combination of the Cmd key and the 'F' key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA search box appears above the playlist, and any typed text searches the songs within that playlist (fuzzy, based on song name, artist name and album name, highlighting any matched text, as Spotify does).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search field in the top right of the iTunes field is focused. Any typed text shows a popover/dropdown with search suggestions, and pressing enter searches the iTunes Store/Apple Music.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niTunes 12.7.3.46"
