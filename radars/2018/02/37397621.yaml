    description: "Summary:\r\nA sample project in Xcode require a .xcodesamplecode.plist in the .xcodeproj folder to enable Markdown rendering. To disable rendering and allowing editing the Xcode project must be closed and the .xcodesamplecode.plist file removed. I would like to be able to view the rendered and unrendered Markdown files side by side. Be able to edit a Markdown file. And be able to choose how I want it render by right clicking on a file and using the open dialog. Similar to right clicking on a plist or storyboard file and clicking “Open As” -> “Source Code” or “Rendered Markdown”.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a project in Xcode\n2) Add .xcodesamplecode.plist to the .xcodeproj folder to enable Markdown rendering (http://danielinoa.com/xcode/2017/09/19/markdown-in-xcode9.html).\n3) Create a test.md Markdown file inside the project with the contents:\n[README](README.md)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test.md file is editable and I can right click on it to “Open As” -> “Source Code” to view the unrendered Markdown file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test.md file is not editable and when I right click on it to “Open As” -> “Source Code” the file is still rendered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
