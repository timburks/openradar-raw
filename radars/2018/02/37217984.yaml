    description: "Summary: When a master and detail view controller both contain navigation bars, contained in a split view controller which is contained in a UITabBarController, the navigation bar and tab bar display a shadow that resides under the master view controller.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1a. Set up a split view controller with a master and detail view controller. \r\n1b. Embed both master and detail view controllers within a navigation controller, such that both controllers have a navigation bar.\r\n1c.  Embed split view controller within tab bar controller.\r\n(Above storyboard configuration is included in a screenshot, and exists within the included test Xcode project).\r\n2. Set split view controller configuration to .allVisible (not sure if this triggers the bug, but this setup does demonstrate the bug. I have not tested for other configurations).\r\n3. Run application on device or simulator that supports showing both master and detail controller side-by-side.\r\n\r\n(An Xcode project I used to test this with this configuration has been included, under DidYouFixIt.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNavigation and tab bar appearance is correct, with the standard blurred white color that is expected across iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation and tab bar contain a darkened portion under the master view controller, which appears like a shadow, or what might be expected from a dark gray color in the content below the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.5 (15D60)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad 2017, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus Simulator (iOS 11.2 (15C107), iPad Pro 9.7 Simulator (iOS 11.2 (15C107))"
