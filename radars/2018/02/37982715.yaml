    description: "Summary:\r\nOpen Link from another application chooses minimized windows\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create several Safari windows with multiple tabs in use.\r\n2. Minimize all but one window.\r\n3. Click on a link in another application with a web view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Link should open a tab in the non-minimized window, preferably the window which last had activity. Links should *never* open in a minimized window unless there are no non-minimized windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Link opens in a different window, often a minimized window. Once it starts doing this, it will always choose that window. I have to bookmark all tabs and close that window, and then it'll choose another window.\r\n\r\nHi, Radar, it's been a long time since we talked, and it wasn't great last time, but I'm giving you another chance. Does anyone at Apple actually use Safari like real people use Safari, with multiple windows full of tabs? Maybe there's nobody left on the Mac/Safari teams, and I'm talking to the ether here.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 11.0.3 (12604.5.6.1.1)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
