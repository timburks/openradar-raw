    description: "Goal is to create a Network Extension. Data Provider checks for rules, if the rule doesn't exist, it passes that URL to be handled by Control Provider. Issues :\r\n\r\n1. URL in Control Provider only contains domain and not the full URL.\r\n2. For the 1st issue, I am using App Groups where I set the URL in Data Provider which will be fetched eventually by Control Provider. This was working fine in iOS 10. But since iOS 11, this is breaking. If I set something in Data Provider, it is not being fetched in Control Provider. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a network extension with NEFilterDataProvider and NEFilterControlProvider\r\n- Set proper entitlements for App Groups\r\n- Set some value in Data Provider in handleNewFlow function, Eg. \r\n[defaults setObject:@\"MyText\" forKey:@\"MyKey\"]\r\n- Try to access this value in Control Provider in handleNewFlow functions, Eg.\r\nNSString* myText = [defaults objectForKey:@\"MyKey\"]\r\n- myText is nil\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nmyText var should have the value set in Data Provider\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nmyText is nil\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.2.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 6"
