    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCalling `selectAll(nil)` on a UITextField within its delegates textFieldDidBeginEditing provides erratic behavior. It seems to work pretty consistently the 1st time, but not subsequently.\r\n\r\nI've provided a sample project which reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a UITextField\r\n2. Create a delegate for it which calls textField.selectAll(nil) in its textFieldDidBeginEditing method\r\n3. Add a way to resign first responder\r\n4. Click the text field to make it the first responder, and select all text\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt works the first time the textfield is selected, but not subsequent times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe textfield should be in focus and all text should be selected.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\niOS 11.2.5\r\nXcode Version 9.2 (9C40b)"
