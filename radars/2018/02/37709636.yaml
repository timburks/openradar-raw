    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:Updating an approved kext by developer ID via MDM does not approve outstanding User Kext approvals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a product with an un approved kext.\r\n2. Update kext whitelisting MDM profile.\r\n3. Kext is whitelisted, but still not approved.\r\n\r\nUninstalling and re-installing the product at this time approves the kext, but still leaves the outstanding user request.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKext would be approved once new profile is installed, and user request would be cleared.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nkext is not approved, requiring manual approval, except if the application is re-installed.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n10.13.4 Beta (17E150g)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nJamf Pro 9.101 is the MDM, with a DEP installed / approved MDM profile.\r\nComments"
