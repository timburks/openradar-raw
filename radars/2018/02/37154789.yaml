    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari Mobile sometimes speak screen stops before whole article is read. The black box control disappears before the article is finished.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI went to this article: https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/trump-corruption-republic.html .
