    description: "The very good band Alvvays is pronounced \"Always\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvvays Siri doesn't understand this, and before we got a HomePod it was difficult to even figure out how to get Siri to understand the band name. (Turns out Siri pronounces it \"Al Vays\".) Their first album is self-titled, so you can't even ask Siri to play that by album title unless you know its secret pronunciation.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAsk Siri to \"Play the band Always\" (Or \"Play the album Always\")\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nSiri should play music by *some* band whose name is pronounced Always, preferably the one I listen to regularly.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nSiri will play a song named Always by some other artist."
