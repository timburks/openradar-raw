    description: "Summary: The UIBarButtonItem item inside the UINavigtionBar remains in the \"pressed\" state after opening a new view controller via a segue or programmatically. This is a known issue for only 11.2+ and has been discussed in public forums already: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47754472/ios-uinavigationbar-button-remains-faded-after-segue-back\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an instance of a UINavigationController and present it\r\n2. Add a UIBarButtonItem to the UINavigationBar of it and add a touchUpInside handler to it that triggers a new view controller to be pushed to the navigation controller (can be done multiple ways, doing it that way for simplicity)\r\n3. Tap the button: A new view controller will be pushed\r\n4. Close / Dismiss the view controller again\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The UIBarButtonItem of the UINavigationController goes back to it's default state, not being selected or \"pressed\".\r\n\r\nActual Results: The UIBarButtonItem of the UINavigationController remains in the selected or \"pressed\" state, causing a UI-glitch.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: 11.2+ only\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Xcode 9.2 (9C40b)"
