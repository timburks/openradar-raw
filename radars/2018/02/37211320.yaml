    description: "Summary:\r\nI have created a Folder Action in Automator to move system screenshots from the Desktop to a folder called Screenshots in my Pictures folder. Until recently, this worked flawlessly. However, Automator now moves all newly created files (including folders) to the Screenshots folder instead of just images with the words Screen and Shot in their filenames.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Create a folder in Pictures called Screenshots\r\n1. create a folder action in Automator by using the Find Finder Items action\r\n2. set Search to Desktop\r\n3. Set dropdown to All .. of the following are true\r\n4. Set Kind Is Image\r\n5. Set Name Contains Screen Shot\r\n6. Add the Move Finder Items action to the newly created folder action\r\n7. Set To: Screenshots \r\n8. Save\r\n9. Make a screenshot by pressing Command-Shift-3\r\n10. Screenshot will appear on the desktop and after a short period will disappear\r\n11. Go to the Screenshots folder in Pictures and see that the screenshot is now in this folder.\r\n12. Now create a folder on the Desktop\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder will remain on the Desktop\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folder is moved to the Screenshots folder\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nVersion 2.8 (444.4)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMac OS High Sierra 10.13.3\r\niMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)"
