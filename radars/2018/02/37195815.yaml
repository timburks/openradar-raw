    description: "Area:\r\nSomething not on this list\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a couple of extra partitions (some on internal boot disk, some on external firewire disk) that I use infrequently for troubleshooting and recovery.  During everyday use, I don't want to see these on my desktop, I don't want the computer's other users to see them, I don't want them mounted (to decrease the chances of anything going wrong with them), and I don't want spotlight indexing them.\r\nThis was handled easily in the past by adding a line to /etc/fstab per the fstab man page to prevent them from mounting.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n# Prevent 10.12 Sierra Crisis \r\nUUID=F1964B8C-66C7-30E6-9408-0F0BA95EEA35 none hfs rw,noauto\r\n\r\nToday, I updated one of my crisis disks to 10.13.3 High Sierra.  Since the crisis disk was on my internal SSD, the mac osX installer also quietly converted the crisis disk from HFS to APFS.  After rebooting, the crisis disk is now auto mounting on my desktop.  I got the new UUID and added a line to my fstab to prevent it from auto mounting.  Rebooted and it auto mounted again!  That's not supposed to happen!  \r\nI noticed that it was now APFS instead of HFS, so I tried changing the fstab entry to reflect APFS instead of HFS.  This worked.  \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n# prevent new APFS Crisis disk\r\n# UUID=E34C2499-2461-39D0-B462-E18514490EEC none apfs rw,noauto\r\n\r\nThe only problem was I first wasted a lot of time in trial-and-error, because there is no mention in the man page for fstab what to do with APFS volumes.\r\nReading the man page for fstab, I see that the man page does not acknowledge the existence of the APFS file system at all.  That seems like an oversight. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nMac OS 10.13.3.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
