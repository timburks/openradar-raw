    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice to have a “dark theme” for the interface in Xcode.\r\nMany apps now offer dark theme, less straining the eyes in dark environments.\r\nWe can currently select a dark theme for the code editor, but it would be nice if the whole interface was available in a dark theme.\r\nSomething like the JetBrains IDEs “Darcula” theme.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers should be able to choose between light (same as actual) and dark themes for Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUses can select a theme for the code editor but not for the whole interface.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDUPLICATE OF 17779149\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nClosed for new dark mode on macOS Mojave"
