    description: "# Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen expanding a ZIP archive that contains entries marked as made under MS-DOS (e.g. any ZIP archive generated by the git-archive utility), the execute bit is added to the expanded files.\r\n\r\nThis is very frustrating when the expanded file is a text file without a filename extension (e.g. LICENSE, README):\r\n- The file is treated by macOS as an executable. Double-clicking it will open the Terminal instead of a text editor.\r\n- If the archive was downloaded from the Internet (e.g. github.com), the file is also marked as quarantined.\r\n\r\nThis is also inconsistent with the behavior of the unzip command.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Terminal.\r\n2. Execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    echo Hello World > README && zip -k Archive.zip README && rm README && open Archive.zip\r\n\r\n# Expected Results:\r\n\r\nArchive Utility should expand the archive and create a file named \"README\" in the current directory with permissions -rw-r--r--.\r\n\r\n# Actual Results:\r\n\r\nArchive Utility expands the archive and creates a file named \"README\" in the current directory with permissions -rwxr-xr-x.\r\n\r\n# Version/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13 (17A405)\r\nArchive Utility 10.10 (81)"
