    description: "# Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter downloading a ZIP archive, the fastest and simplest way to expand it is to just double-click the file, which opens the Archive Utility application.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the archive contains entries marked as made under MS-DOS (e.g. any ZIP archive generated by the git-archive utility), the execute bit is added to the expanded files.\r\n\r\nThis is very frustrating when the expanded file is a text file without a filename extension (e.g. LICENSE, README):\r\n- The file is treated by macOS as an executable. Double-clicking it will open the Terminal instead of a text editor.\r\n- If the archive was downloaded from the Internet (e.g. github.com), the file is also marked as quarantined.\r\n\r\nThis is also inconsistent with the behavior of the unzip command.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Terminal.\r\n2. Execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    echo Hello World > README && zip -k Archive.zip README && rm README && open -a Finder .\r\n\r\n3. A Finder window opens. Double-click the ZIP file in that window.\r\n4. Archive Utility expands a \"README\" file in the current folder. Double-click that \"README\" file.\r\n\r\n# Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"README\" file should open in the TextEdit application.\r\n\r\n# Actual Results:\r\n\r\nA new Terminal window opens and tries to execute the \"README\" file.\r\n\r\n# Version/Build:\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.3 (17D47)\r\nArchive Utility 10.10 (81)"
