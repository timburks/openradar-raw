    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a horizontally compact trait environment, UISearchBar should respect the showsCancelButton setting, even on iPad. When an app runs in an iPad slide over window (having a .compact horizontalSizeClass), chances are high that the app uses iPhone-like UI paradigms. That includes search bars with a Cancel button.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior that the Cancel button is never shown on iPad, seems arbitrary. This should rather be determined by the trait collection (or entirely by the developer!).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
