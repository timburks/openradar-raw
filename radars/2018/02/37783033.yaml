    description: "In order to understand reviews in a language which isn't my own, I constantly copy paste text into *cough* Google translate *cough*. Then I write a response and translate it back into the native language before replying to it.\r\n\r\nIt would help smaller companies, who can't afford native support for all supported languages in their App, to reply all customers. \r\nI doubt that everyone is even putting in the effort to translate text they don't understand in the first place."
