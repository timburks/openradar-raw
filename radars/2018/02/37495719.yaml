    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a particular view of my storyboard, the layout often collapses all subviews to the leading margin, though there are no design- or runtime issues reported by Xcode or Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nChanging any property of a view will toggle it back and forth between taking the full width of the view, like it should, and collapsing to the margin. I’ve attached the affected storyboard, and can attach the whole project if necessary\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load storyboard\r\n2. Navigate to the Movie Details View Controller Scene\r\n3. Expand Container View -> Scroll View -> Scroll Content View -> Stack View\r\n4. Select Viewing Notes Table View\r\n5. Show the Size Inspector, and scroll down to the Intrinsic Size section\r\n6. Toggle the Width “None” checkbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is no change to the layout, since the table view is inside a stack view set to Fill alignment\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs you toggle it back and forth, all views collapse to zero width\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterface Builder acts like it’s exercising an ambiguous layout, but reports no such ambiguous layout. As mentioned before, I can send a zip of my whole project if it’ll help."
