    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a UITextField has an active selection (e.g. select all) and then is resignFirstResponder'd, it doesn't seem to respond to taps again on places where the selection was: the textfield is not made first responder when tapped.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a UITextField\n2. Enter some text\n3. Select all text\n4. Make another field firstResponder \n5. Try to make the UITextField firstResponder again by tapping on a place that previously was in the selection\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n - The UITextField accepts taps and becomes first responder\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The tap is ignored\n- UITextField did not become first responder\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDouble tapping does work, since that triggers a \"select word\" operation"
