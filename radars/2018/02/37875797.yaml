    description: "Expected Results: no alert should appear on the CarPlay display\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: an alert appears on the CarPlay display\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion/Build: iOS 11.2.5\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: reproduced 100% on an iPhone X and iPhone 7, with two different CarPlay devices.\r\n\r\nThis is a security issue because it allows anyone in the car to see contact names even if the alert is not responded to. It also allows a spirited conversation to become a serious driving nuisance. Anyone, especially teenagers, will be more likely to respond to conversations they otherwise should ignore while driving."
