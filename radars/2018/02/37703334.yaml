    description: "# Summary\r\nHMEventTrigger should restore characteristic states previous to the executed scene. Currently only some characteristic values are restored â€“ for example the power state of a light bulb.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create an HMEventTrigger and add an event\r\n2. Add a scene to the trigger which sets the power state of a light bulb to On and the brightness to 100%.\r\n3. Set an HMDurationEvent as end event.\r\n4. Trigger the trigger and wait until the end event restores the characteristic values before the trigger was executed.\r\n\r\n# Expected Results\r\nThe power state and brightness value should be restored to the previous value.\r\n\r\n# Actual Result\r\nOnly the power state is restored.\r\n\r\n# Comment\r\nIf this is expected behaviour, please update the documentation of `HMEventTrigger.endEvents` accordingly.\r\n\r\nTested on iOS 11.3 (15E5178f)"
