    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening a Bluebeam Revu PDF eats memory, in range 10+ GB. I killed it at 30+GB. Behaviour happens both with quicklook (QuicklookUIService) and with Preview.app\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Activity viewer, select memory tab and sort on used memory\r\n- Open attached PDF with Preview.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- With preview one can inspect the multi-page PDF file\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- File opens, but takes a lot of time\r\n- In Activity viewer you see it uses a lot of memory and it is hardly responsive\r\n\r\nConfiguration: The used PDF file is produced with Bluebeam Revu (https://www.bluebeam.com/solutions/revu-mac)"
