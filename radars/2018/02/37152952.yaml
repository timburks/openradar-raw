    description: "Summary:\r\nThe NSDateFormatter documentation under ‘Working With Fixed Format Date Representations’ sets a dateFormat specifying a time zone, and also sets the timeZone property. This is redundant. The timeZone property is not used in this case.\n\nYou can see this by running that code and commenting out the line setting the timeZone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at the code sample at https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsdateformatter#2528261\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis code sample should not set the timeZone property.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis example sets the timeZone property even though doing so does nothing. This makes the example confusing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated: rdar://37152907 Documentation for NSDateFormatter timeZone is misleading"
