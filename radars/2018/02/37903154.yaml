    description: "Area:\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nMessages for Mac should not auto replace \"O(n)\" with emoji \"O\U0001F44E\".\r\n\r\nSoftware engineers often discuss runtime efficiency with the Big-O notation. This auto replacement is unexpected to users and often lead to confusion in conversations.\r\n\r\nUsers can already pick emojis with the Control + Command + Space key combination or through the Touch Bar. There's no good reason for this text replacement to be built into macOS."
