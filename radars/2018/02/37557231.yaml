    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nTo view notifications, one may swipe downward from the top left corner of the screen at any time when the phone is unlocked.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the phone is locked, swiping downward from the top left corner of the screen does nothing. Instead, one must swipe upward in order to view notifications.\r\n\r\nThis interaction is needlessly inconsistent, and impairs learnability and muscle-memory use. (In other words, I find it frustrating as hell when I want to look at notifications with the phone locked.)\r\n\r\niPhone X, all versions of iOS 11 to date (11.2.5 as of this writing)."
