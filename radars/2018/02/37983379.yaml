    description: "The installer app bundle for macOS High Sierra, when downloaded from the AppStore does have a localized name. However in some languages, this name does contain non-breaking spaces. When a user in that language renames the file in Finder (e.g. by appending the version number), that localized name gets the new actual name of the bundle. Having filenames containing non-breaking spaces may cause issues with third party tools which are not prepared for such a thing. For example VMware Fusion, which cannot build a working installation disk from installers containing these characters. Please avoid non-breaking spaces in filenames.\r\nIn macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 the following localisations are affected: ar, de, es, fr, pl, ru\r\nWith macOS Sierra 10.12.6 the list did only contain: es, fr, pl, ru"
