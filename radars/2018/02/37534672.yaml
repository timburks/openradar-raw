    description: "Summary:\r\nRunning a SKReceiptRefreshRequest in our Released App recently caused the Mac App Store to claim that the app is damaged and needs to be re-downloaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a Mac App from Mac App Store\r\n2. Restore Purchases\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe receipt file should be updated without issues.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is an Alert that the App is damaged and needs to be redownloaded.\r\nThe receipt file is not updated.\r\nThe SKReceiptRefreshRequest completes an Error: Domain=ISErrorDomain Code=500328 \"500328\" UserInfo={NSLocalizedFailureReason=500328}\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nmacOS 10.13.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhat we found out didnâ€™t help: \r\n- exit(173) the application (still claims broken)\r\n- redownload, then try again (same issue)\r\n\r\nWhat did help:\r\n- sign out of Mac App Store\r\n- sign back in to Mac App Store\r\n- redownload the App and try again, this time the SKReceiptRefreshRequest works without issues.\r\n\r\nSame observations were made on macOS 10.13.2.\r\n\r\nThe SKReceiptRefreshRequest is called from a framework target (not the main bundle), not sure this is a factor."
