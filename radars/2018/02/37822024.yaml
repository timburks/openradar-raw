    description: "WARNING — Leaving this \"as is\", just in case someone makes the same mistake but basically I was using \"#idfef\" instead of \"#if\". It's interesting though that I somehow saw a problem with #ifdef (I mean different case for IPHONE and OS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI mistakenly used `TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR`, which is deprecated. I discovered my error when I was in the #ifdef although running on iPhone X!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the deprecated `TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR`\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould work as `TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR` or at least if not, be more than not deprecated, but rather not exist. By any means Xcode could say something.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR works on the device as well! This is really wrong.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2\r\n\r\nNotes:"
