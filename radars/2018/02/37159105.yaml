    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes there are multiple paths through Xcode workspaces and projects to show a path to a file in the Jump Bar. In such cases Xcode usually uses the first path, but the user experience would be better if it used the shortest path.\n\nThe situation occurs when using nested Xcode projects matching the dependency tree, but then having a workspace containing the flattened set of projects for easy access.\n\nYou can see an example in the screen shot in the attached folder. At the top is what Xcode does when using Quick Open or command clicking to reach a file. At the bottom is the shortest path, which is much easier to read. In this example itâ€™s not too bad, but we have deeper projects where the jump bar becomes very awkward to use because everything is collapsed. The higher up relationship between the projects is not very interesting to show in the jump bar where space is limited.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open MyWorkspace in the attached folder.\n2. Use Quick Open to open MyFramework.h\n3. Look in the Jump Bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe path in the Jump Bar should be\n\nMy Framework (project) > My Framework > My Framework.h\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe path is\n\nMy App (project) > My App > My Framework (project) > My Framework > My Framework.h\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n9.2 (9C40b)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen you use the Reveal in Project Navigator command, Xcode shows the shortest path to the file in the project navigator, so the path finding code is already in there."
