    description: "Area:\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOn iOS 11.2.5, if you set accessibility labels on tab bar items with no titles (just images), if you don't have Voice Over turned on before the tabs load, the accessibility labels/hints do not get read.  If you have Voice Over turned on before the tabs load, accessibility is read correctly.  This issue does not exist with iOS 11.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UITabBarController with tabs that don't have titles, but have images.  Set accessibility labels for each tab bar item.  Run the app.  After the tabs are visible, turn on voice over via the accessibility shortcut (home 3 times).  \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoice over should read the set accessibility labels.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoice over does not read the set accessibility labels.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n11.2.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
