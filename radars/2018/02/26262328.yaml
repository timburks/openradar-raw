    description: "Summary:\r\nJavaScripts invoked from applications (e.g. via Script menu in iTunes) report \"Error: AppleEvent timed out\" (After a few minutes of hanging with no UI interaction possible) when trying to access application object methods/members via \"Application(\"iTunes\")\". The equivalent function in AppleScript works without issue (\"tell application iTunes...\") when invoked from the script menu. The same JXA script invoked from ScriptEditor works without issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create JavaScript .scpt file in ScriptEditor with lines:\r\niTunes = Application(\"iTunes\");\r\nvar selTracks = iTunes.selection();\r\n2. Save in ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts as TestHang.scpt\r\n3. Open iTunes.\r\n4. Select at least one track in a playlist.\r\n5. Select the TestHang.scpt from the Scripts menu in iTunes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing. The iTunes UI should remain interactive and if playback in progress, should continue with new tracks as previous track finishes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes UI becomes unresponsive. If track playback ends, further tracks are not played. After a few minutes, an error message appears (with iTunes icon): \"Error on line 2: Error: AppleEvent timed out (playback then resumes if track ended).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA work around is possible by using a shim script to asynchronously invoke \"osascript -l JavaScript\" on the JXA script using \"nohup\". This allows control to return immediately to the calling application and avoids the deadlock. This suggests the issue is that applications with script menu options for triggering scripts can respond to apple events whilst running Applescripts, but not JavaScripts.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on a 2011 Mac Mini. Not expected to be hardware dependent issue."
