    description: "When entering text in the MacOS Safari search bar, API requests made to Google Search for displaying autocomplete suggestions do not include cookies, thus not honoring user settings for displaying search results suggestions.\r\n\r\nFor example, one user can have English as the default Google Search language preference, but the autocomplete suggestions are displayed in another language (it looks like the Google API is using IP geolocation for determining search results language when cookies are not set).\r\n\r\nSafari requests to the Google API currently looks like this:\r\n\r\ncurl -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_3) AppleWebKit/604.5.6 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/11.0.3 Safari/604.5.6' -H 'accept: */*' -H 'accept-language: en-us'  'https://clients1.google.com/complete/search?client=safari&q=argentina'\r\n\r\nI suggest to include the cookies in the request, this way the user can expect the exact same autocomplete results as when browsing the Google Search website."
