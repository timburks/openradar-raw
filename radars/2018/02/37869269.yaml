    description: "Summary:\r\nPreview shows incorrect image width and height for the visual representation of a PAdES signature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the attached PDF in Preview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee the screenshot of Adobe Reader DC compared to Preview. Also all other readers we've tried show the image correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bounding box of the signature seems to be correct (when you select the signature). However the image inside of the bounding box is squashed. See screenshots.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nPreview Version 10.0 (944.4) but also happens in older versions.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nBoth settings of 'Define 100% scale as:' give the same results.\r\n\r\nsimple_pdf.pdf is the original unsigned file for reference. simple_pdf.pdf_python_appended_after_signature_1.pdf is the file that shows the wrong image.\r\nsignature_stamp.png is the image that is used in the visual representation of the signature."
