    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working with MKMapItems and the corresponding MKPlacemark/CLPlacemark, we need access to the placemark's map region. We've been using CLPlacemark.region in the past.\r\n\r\nWith CLRegion.center and CLRegion.radius being deprecated, we've no more access to the geographical representation of the placemark's region.\r\n\r\nNote that CLPlacemark.region is declared to return a CLRegion, not a CLCircularRegion.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nsee radar://15120733\nThis issue is not solved at all. To the contrary, it was introduced with the deprecation in iOS 11."
