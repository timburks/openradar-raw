    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #37435276\n\nTo support adaptive width strings for localization, the NSString class has an instance method since iOS 9, variantFittingPresentationWidth(_:), but it is currently not documented (see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1413104-variantfittingpresentationwidth). I think that to help with the adoption of this feature, it should at least show the header documentation that is in NSBundle.h, part of the Foundation framework.\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Go to https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1413104-variantfittingpresentationwidth\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe instance method is documented.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe instance method is not documented.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 11\r\n\r\nNotes:"
