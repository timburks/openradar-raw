    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you copy a link from from the iTunes application to a episode of a podcast it yields a direct link, however if you go Apple's 'iTunes Preview' web version of the podcast and then click the 'View in iTunes' link to an episode it's not a direct link as it appears, it opens iTunes to the show's general page instead of the episode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis can be reproduced with any podcast episode. However for this example I used the episode 'Episode 78: The Botanist' of the show 'Criminal' If you go into iTunes and look up this show you can find a direct link and choose the 'Copy Link' option.\r\nIt will provide you with this URL which goes directly to the episode:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-78-the-botanist/id809264944?i=1000394367287&mt=2\r\n\r\nHowever if you go to the 'iTunes Preview' web version of this show: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/criminal/id809264944?mt=2\r\n\r\nClick or copy the 'View in iTunes' link for the 'Episode 78: The Botanist' episode you'll receive this link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/criminal/id809264944?mt=2# which is the same as the iTunes Preview link, it just opens to the show's general page iTunes instead of a linking to the specific episode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClicking or copying the 'View in iTunes' link next to an episode should provide the direct episode link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-78-the-botanist/id809264944?i=1000394367287&mt=2 \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nClicking or copying the 'View in iTunes' link next to an episode provides a general feed link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/criminal/id809264944?mt=2#\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nn/a"
