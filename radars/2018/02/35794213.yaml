    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #35794202\r\n\r\nWe are developing an application similar to 1Password where we provide login credentials via an Action Extension. This app will be installed on managed iOS devices (via MDM).\r\n\r\nBefore you actually can use this action, you need to activate it by pressing the „More“ button in the „Share Sheet“ and toggling the switch.\r\nWe experienced that this steps can confuse certain users, and since the devices settings are anyway managed by the MDM system, we would like to activate the Share extension by default in the MDM settings and spare the users the extra steps (for activating a trusted Action in the „Share Sheet“)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA user presses on the „Share Button“ on a newly installed managed device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOur trusted „Action Extension“ pops up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe users sees an empty „Share Screen“ and needs to press on the „More“ button were he manually needs to activate the needed „Action Extension“.\r\nThe empty screen can confuse users and not everyone knows, that he can activate the needed actions by pressing the „More“ button (our current workaround is by providing a short tutorial that provides this information)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince the „Action Extension“ will be needed by every user and the application that provides the extension will be installed on every device. Activating this trusted extension will save a lot of time and possible confusion."
