    description: "Area:\r\nLock Screen\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: enroll Face ID on iPhone X.\r\n\r\n1. sleep the phone, and set it on a desk.\r\n2. induce or wait for some notifications to arrive.\r\n3. while off-axis from the IR matrix, tap the phone to wake it.\r\n4. observe that notifications appear, but their details are hidden, due to Face ID failure. (This is expected.)\r\n\r\nAt this point, I recognize that my face was not captured by the IR system, so I want to try again.\r\n\r\n5. reposition face in good axis with the IR matrix.\r\n6. observe that nothing happens.\r\n7. tap the display; observe that still nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI am stonewalled. There is no way to make Face ID try again. I have to either wait for the phone to go to sleep, or manually hit the side switch to lock it, and then start again at step 3.\r\n\r\nProposal: allow re-attempt of Face ID by tapping the display while it's still on.\r\n\r\n(Even better, run the IR repeatedly and make recurrent attempts at Face ID automatically.)\r\n\r\niPhone X, iOS 11 including 11.2.5."
