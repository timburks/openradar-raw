    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be useful to display an MKPolyline for driving directions which is colored according to the traffic at that line. Otherwise, the polyline covers the traffic information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'd like to display a driving directions route polyline which is colored according to the traffic.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to display a driving route line exactly as in Maps.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere's no way to access the underlying traffic information of the map (if `showsTraffic` is enabled) in order to use them for a polyline.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would be desirable that the polyline renderer can still configure a base color for the line which is used in case there's no or green traffic. Only for orange or red traffic, the traffic color should override."
