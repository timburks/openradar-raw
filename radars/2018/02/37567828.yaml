    description: "Summary:\r\nLet's say you have two view controllers, one of which you want to have a different color navigation bar and/or navigation bar title color than the other.\n\nTheoretically, you'd want the barTintColor and titleTextAttributes changes to change along with the view controller transition instead of popping in to place.\n\nIn practice:\n\n- Pushing the second view controller works as expected\n- Performing a swipe back from the second to the first works as expected\n- Tapping the back button causes the barTintColor to pop in, and the titleTextAttributes to fail to change entirely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open sample project. \n2. Tap “Tap me” cell\n3. Tap back button. Observe the barTintColor and tintColor pops in rather than fading in, and the titleTextAttributes do not adjust at all. \n4. Tap “Tap me” cell again\n5. Perform a swipe-to-go-back gesture. Observe that all changes fade nicely as the transition goes on, regardless of the transition’s length. \n6. Locate beer [optional].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNon-interactive and interactive transitions should have equally good look transitioning the nav bar and its different states. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReally goofy looking transition on barTintColor and incorrect transition with title text attributes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11.2 (15C107)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see attached demo project and video. \n\nWorkarounds the community has found include: \nhttps://github.com/josshad/TestNavBarTransition\nhttps://gist.github.com/Sorix/1d8543b18cfd76c12c36525bc280a35d"
