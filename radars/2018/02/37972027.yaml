    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen playing audios on an Apple TV (e.g. via AirPlay or using the Music app), playback cannot be correctly controlled correctly with the dedicated play / pause remote button.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects both the physical remote, as well as devices running the Apple TV remote application and paired with the Apple TV receiver.\r\n\r\nVideo playback is not affected by this issue (e.g. videos played over AirPlay can be paused and resumed correctly using the corresponding remote button).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the Music app on the Apple TV.\r\n2. Play some content.\r\n3. Press the remote menu button several times to return to the Apple TV home screen.\r\n4. Press the play / pause remote button once. Playback correctly pauses.\r\n5. Press the play / pause button again. Playback incorrectly does not resume.\r\n\r\nA remark about step 3: If you stay within the Music app player, the play / pause button works. This is why you have to move away from this screen to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen some audio is played, the play / pause remote button correctly pause or resume playback depending on whether I am playing an audio or not. This behavior is consistent throughout Apple TV menus.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen audio is played, the play / pause button remote only makes it possible to pause playback. There is then no way to resume playback using the same button.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\n\r\ntvOS 11.2.6\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nNothing in particular."
