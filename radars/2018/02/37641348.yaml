    description: "Summary:\r\nHealth records (now called Clinical Documents) are not accessible from the “Health Data” tab > “Health Records”, which now seems to only show the searchable list of partner hospitals. Previously imported Clinical documents are now only accessible from the “Sources” tab > app name > Data > Clinical Documents, limiting accessibility. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to “Health Data” tab > “Health Records”\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee all Clinical Records written to the Health App by third party apps as well as partner hospital health records.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly list of partner hospital that can provide health records.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 11.3 beta 2 (and presumably beta 1) has this problem. iOS 10.0-11.2 are ok."
