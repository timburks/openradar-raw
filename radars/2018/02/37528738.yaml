    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a duplicate of radar #37528661\n\nUIToolbar confirms to UIBarPositioning which so far only has one property: barPosition. This position property can be any, bottom, top and top attached. So far this has been enough for all cases. Now with the iPhone X and its software home indicator on the bottom there should be a UIBarPositionBottomAttached mode to tell a UIToolbar to extend its background to the bottom, behind the home indicator.\n\nIt would be great if you could consider this. Thanks in advance!\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n11\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
