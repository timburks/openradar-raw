    description: "Area:\r\nNetwork Extensions Framework\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nehotspotconfigurationerror\r\n\r\nThe current documentation for each of the cases is only a rewording of the case identifier into a sentence. joinOnceNotSupported is missing documentation altogether.\r\n\r\nMy app is currently receiving the systemConfiguration error code, but as far as I can tell this code worked on this device before, and continues to work on other devices. An example of things I would like to know about each of these error codes:\r\n\r\n- Is this a programmer error, user error, OS or framework error?\r\n- Is this recoverable? How?\r\n- What additional information would the programmer or user need in order to recover from the error if it's possible?\r\n- What situations might lead to this error occurring?\r\n\r\nSome of the error cases, like invalidSSID, are pretty clear if you have some knowledge of the domain the framework is in, but others are not clear at all. Particularly the systemConfiguration one I'm hitting right now :)"
