    description: "Area:\r\nAppKit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nEditing a large amount of Arabic text (>10kb) in TextEdit (or any app that utilizes NSLayoutManager) will exhibit notable lag (between keystroke and change of text on screen) and higher CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached \"slowtext.txt\" file in TextEdit.\r\n2. Type continuously somewhere in the middle of the text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. No lag.\r\n2. Normal CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotable lag between keystroke and change of text on screen, and really high CPU utilization as typing continues.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\nmacOS 10.12.6 \r\nTextEdit 1.12 (329)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAttachment\r\nslowtext.txt https://pastebin.com/2Kfu1bgN"
