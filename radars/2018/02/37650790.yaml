    description: "Currently it's not possible to give away app bundles for free.\r\nThere are multiple occasions where gathering apps of the same kind would be beneficial: think of free similar games, or educational apps on the same topic.\r\n\r\nHaving free bundles would allow users to download all these apps in one click instead of forcing the user to download one by one.\r\n\r\nAlso, this way the user might discover apps that otherwise he/she wouldn't have found."
