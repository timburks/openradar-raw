    description: "In the iOS Calendar app, the calendar days do not get focus when using \"Item mode\" forcing users to use gliding cursor to manually pinpoint the day. In some case this works fine, especially after trying repeatedly. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n1. Connect ablenet blue2 bluetooth switch. \r\n2. Turn on Switch Control with two switches: \"Move to Next item\" and \"Select item\" \r\n3. Using item mode to navigate, open the Calendar app. \r\n4. Choose a month and attempt to choose a day with item mode."
