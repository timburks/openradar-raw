    description: "When building an app with an App Intents extension with Xcode 14.1 RC 2 (21534.1), iOS 16.0 and 16.1 fail to load the intents extension. \r\n\r\nThe same is observed when the App Intents are directly used as part for the main iOS app target.  \r\n\r\nThe debugger prints the following message: \r\n> Unable to fetch suggested focus intents for intent “Intent Name” \r\n\r\nWhen building the targets using Xcode 14.0.1, this works as expected and the intents target is run by the device."
