    description: "When an app display name contains special characters and is shown against a white wallpaper, the text is rendered incorrectly, such that there is little to no contrast against the background, and it is very hard to read.\r\nThe special characters that trigger this issue include “®” (registered trademark symbol), “™” (trademark symbol), and emojis.\r\nThe attached screenshot shows two examples, including one involving the Post-it® app downloaded from the App Store.\r\nI can reproduce this on multiple devices, including an iPhone14,3 running iOS 16.1; older iOS versions present this bug as well.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Set a white wallpaper (#FFFFFF)\r\n- Place an app with special characters (ex. emojis or the registered trademark symbol) in its display name on the Home Screen\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- The app display name is clearly readable against the white background, as the labels under other apps\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n- The display name of the app with special characters is rendered differently compared to others, has a different shadow, and has almost no contrast against the white background, making it really hard to read"
