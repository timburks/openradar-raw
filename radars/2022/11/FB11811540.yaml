    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nXCTApplicationLaunchMetric is not reported when measuring tvOS app launch\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nXCTest\r\n\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nWe wanted to set baseline for application launch test. It is possible on iOS, but we were not able to set baselines and STDDEV on tvOS.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create new project using latest Xcode (we used Xcode 14.1).\r\n2. Use the default settings to set it up. (I also attached the project.)\r\n3. Run all tests in the simulator (Apple TV Simulator 16.1).\r\n4. Check if the baseline and STDDEV were reported for the measure block for testLaunchPerformance test.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nThe measure block to report average times and standard deviation for the app launch test on Apple TV.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nNo measurements results were reported. No average, std deviation so we can set baselines for future test runs."
