    description: 'I want to animate a Slider whenever its value changes with a custom animation (and a custom duration), but it doesn''t work. No matter what animation I specify, it always uses the same (very short) animation that is almost not noticeable. Steps to reproduce: 1. Open the attached playground file and open the live view. 2. Press the Toggle button a few times an observe the behavior. (3. Replace the `linear(duration: 5)` animation with any other animation and repeat step 2.) Expected: The slider is animated and moves according to the specified animation. (So the animation should take 5 seconds at first.) Observed: The slider is animated but always uses the same default animation with a very short duration. The specified animation does not seem to have any impact on the animation.
