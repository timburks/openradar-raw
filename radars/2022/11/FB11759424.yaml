    description: "SIGABRT error happens upon execution of a function that takes a collection of Objective C blocks. Problematic function needs to be called from Objective C. Doesn't matter what the function body is, error happens when arguments are passed to the function. \r\n\r\nFunction needs to be declared in Swift, and take collection of Objective C blocks like this: \r\nfunc someFunctionTaking(blockVariants: [String: @convention(block) () -> Void]) \r\n\r\nThen it's enough to call this in Objective C, with at least one block in the collection. An error is thrown: \r\nCould not cast value of type '__NSGlobalBlock__' (0x...) to '@convention(block) () -> ()' (0x...). \r\n\r\nAfter consulting this issue with other developers I don't see a problem with code itself, and it appears to be a Swift compiler bug."
