    description: "https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2283/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40011217\r\n\r\nThis technical note states that the Sampler is looking into following locations:\r\n\r\nBundle Directory\r\nNSLibraryDirectory (NOTE: Only on OS X)\r\nNSDocumentDirectory\r\nNSDownloadsDirectory\r\n\r\nThis is true on iOS, but not on macOS when using Sandbox. It seems that Sampler is looking into those locations but they have to have \"/Audio\" suffix.\r\n\r\nPlease update the tech note according to this. Sample project attached shows that it crashes when putting sample into Documents, but not when looking into Documents/Audio\r\n\r\nSample code: https://github.com/jcavar/examples/tree/master/MacSamplerSandboxPath"
