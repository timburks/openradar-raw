    description: "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/collection_views/layouts/customizing_collection_view_layouts\r\n\r\nThe code featured on that page, as well as the sample code available to be downloaded has issues that prevent it from behaving as expected when used in other projects. \r\n\r\n1. `MosaicLayout.swift:73` When calculating the content bounds, it uses the `lastFrame` before it's reassigned. This means we're not using the last frame but the penultimate frame instead. This becomes an issue when the last cell is `fullWidth`. This can be fixed by changing that line to `contentBounds = contentBounds.union(rect)` \r\n\r\n2. `MosaicLayout.swift:149` When deciding where to split the binary search, the current logic is wrong when `attr.frame.maxY` has the same value as `rect.minY`. By changing that line to `if attr.frame.maxY <= rect.minY {` the binary search will continue in the upper half of the range. \r\n\r\nThe second issue was particularly hard to debug as it only manifested in a specific combination of number of pictures, device screen size and build type (maybe related with optimisation level)."
