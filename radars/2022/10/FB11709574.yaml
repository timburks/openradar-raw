    description: "This problem is occuring with Xcode 14.0, 14.0.1, 14.1 betas and 14.1 RC\r\n\r\nIt makes development severely degraded.\r\nSee developer forum thread about it here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/715103\r\n\r\n\r\nI can stop this from happening by disabling the indexing service (defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEIndexDisable -bool true), but it degrades Xcode's other functionality severely (e.g. cannot run tests selectively, autocomplete won't work, etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe problem (apparently) occurs with large projects.\r\n\r\nAfter each rebuild (Cmd+B), the errors (or warnings) first appear in the Issue Navigator pane, but then they are gone after a few seconds.\r\nThe same happens with red error overlays in the source code pane - after 2-3 seconds they disappear!"
