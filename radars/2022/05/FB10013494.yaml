    description: "The following view configuration in SwiftUI provides an unwanted size animation of the view while rotation. See the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nstruct RotationTest: View {\r\n  var body: some View {\r\n    Rectangle()\r\n      .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)\r\n      .foregroundColor(.red)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn UIKit, a view constrained to it's superview anchors will rotate without animating in this manner.\r\nI'd expect that the view seamlessly remains the size of the container without \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/siBKYR1"
