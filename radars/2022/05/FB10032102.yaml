    description: "After running my Mac for several hours, search in Mail suddenly fails with the following symptoms:\r\n- when selecting color tags, no results are shown\r\n- when entering any search string, no matches are found\r\n- after a while the numbers by the tags disappear as if no message had a tag\r\n- I see lots of corespotlightd errors in the console log (excerpt attached)\r\n\r\nMails becomes almost useless because I cannot find any emails using the search function. Other search tools like HoudahSpot also fail to find any emails.\r\n\r\nAfter a restart, everything works again. I also tried deleting the Spotlight index and letting it recreate, but the symptom reoccurs after a few hours.\r\n\r\nToday I found that killing corespotlightd (it restarts immediately) cures the problem instantly. \r\n\r\nThis issue has probably existed earlier, but it it has become more frequent and extremely annoying after the upgrade to Monterey 12.4."
