    description: Hello, I will inform you about the iPhone restarting itself. I'm already multiple users. How can you do it? I saw that they said it was since the 15th update, now it's 15.6 and it hasn't disappeared yet. This problem can be solved too, or take it to the Apple Store to check the symptoms.
