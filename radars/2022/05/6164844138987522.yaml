    description: "In the new ScreenCaptureKit API, capturing a single desktop window using SCContentFilter(desktopIndependentWindow: window) returns buffers that are black when the window falls outside of the display.\r\nThe expected behavior would be like the CGWindowListCreateImage API which returns the full window contents in the CGImage even in areas of the window that are outside of the display bounds."
