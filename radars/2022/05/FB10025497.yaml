    description: "This bug occurred since I had upgraded from macOS 11.6.5 to 11.6.6.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION:\r\n1. Open an .ICS file in Finder or Mail (as attachment) by double clicking.\r\n2. Calendar.app is the default handler and hence opens.\r\n3. Instead of the normal \"Add event\" dialog, Calendar fails with an error message. (Did not take note or make a screenshot).\r\nThis WAS reproducible, and failed ca 5 time in total with events from 2-3 different sources (Calendly.com, YouCanBook.me, RFC-2445 compliant sample file) over the last week or so since I have upgraded macOS, until I first applied the workaround. It had also failed with a RFC-2445 compliant sample file at https://gist.github.com/DeMarko/6142417 so I rule out a malformed ICS file.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND\r\n1. Save the ICS file (if it is an email attachment) somewhere in your filesystem.\r\n2. Calendar.app > Menu > File > Import > Choose the ICS file.\r\n3. The normal \"Add event\" dialog opens.\r\n\r\nFrom then on both normal opening and the menu file import worked again."
