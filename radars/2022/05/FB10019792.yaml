    description: "I am starting to use CLLocationButton in my apps, but can see an issue with its behavior. When the user taps on a UIButton it is visually noticeable that it's being tapped. Color/Alpha change, image adjusts, etc... When the user taps on a CLLocationButton there is no queues as to it being pressed. \r\n\r\nI've had several test users complain already that they think the button is not working given that the action might not result in an immediately change to the UI.\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. unzip and build the attached project\r\n2. run the app\r\n3. press any of the buttons\r\n\r\nThe larger buttons make the issue more obvious since the user's finger does not cover the entire button. There is no visual indication that the location button is being pressed.\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nI would expect the CLLocationButton to visually behave like a normal button.\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nThere is no visual feedback while the user has the button pressed. This has led to user complaints already and is a bad user experience."
