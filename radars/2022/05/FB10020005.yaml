    description: "When using a `UIModalPresentationFullScreen` style to present a view controller that supports multiple orientations, navigating back to the presenting view controller will preserve the presenting view controller’s supported orientations.\r\n\r\nWhen using custom `UIModalPresentationCustom` there is no way outside of private APIs to ensure that the presenting view controller doesn’t rotate to unsupported interface orientations.\r\n\r\nThis is a common use case which needs an API in order to delivery a high quality user experience."
