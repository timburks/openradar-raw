    description: NSLocalizedString has a comment parameter that's meant to provide context to translators for the string being localized. This ends up included in the strings files generated by genstrings, and developers can edit strings files manually to tweak the comments (perhaps for localized strings that don't come from one of the standard macros/functions/methods). However, the stringsdict format, consistent for many years, has no way to encode these comments, and thus a translator working directly on a stringsdict (or importing data from stringsdict, through a service such as transifex.com) has lost that additional context.
