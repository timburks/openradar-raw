    description: "For customers whose preferred email app is Apple Mail, MFMailComposeViewController is a great way to provide email-based sharing functionality and an ability to contact customer support. For customers who take advantage of the ability to use a third-party email app, this does not work the way they want. They might not have Apple Mail installed on their device, they might not have it configured with an account, or they might not have it configured with their preferred email accounts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mailto: URLs do not provide a way for an app to specify HTML in a message body.\r\n\r\nI think iOS/iPadOS would benefit greatly from the ability for third-party email clients to be invoked via MFMailComposeViewController.\r\n\r\nI just added a setting to my app allowing the user to choose whether to use the default email app or MFMailComposeViewController for sending email. I had been using mailto: URLs when MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail() returned false, but that proved insufficient for my customers."
