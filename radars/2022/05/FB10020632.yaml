    description: "We want to deploy `com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy` payload to our fleet of Macs running macOS 12 Monterey. We would like to enforce minimum password length (8 characters). The problem is that when we deploy password policy containing `minLength` key, macOS does not force the user with a password not meeting the policy to change it.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enroll Mac into MDM using ADE (or Device Enrollment)\r\n2. Create a computer account with super simple 4 character password during SetupAssistant.\r\n3. Deploy the configuration profile with `com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy` payload to the device AFTER SetupAssistant is complete\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\n\r\nDuring next login attempt at LoginWindow current password is compared to the new password policy. If it does not meet it, user is forced to change it.\r\n\r\n## Actual result\r\n\r\nUser can continue using the old password which does not meet the policy. Only way to resolved this situation is to tell the user to go to System Preferences -> User & Groups and change the password there.\r\n\r\nAffected systems: All versions of macOS Monterey including the latest 12.4 (21F79)\r\n\r\n# Workaround\r\n\r\nWe can use the `changeAtNextAuth` in the `com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy` payload but it does work in a different fashion than we would like:\r\n- User has to change the password even if the old one is in the line with the policy\r\n- When deploying to system level, authentication will stop working until user changes the password"
