    description: "Basic Information\r\nMac Catalyst macOS App uses Apple Events independently of the code.\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nMac Catalyst\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nThe app which is build by Mac Catalyst uses Apple Event on the background.\r\nThe app does not use any APIs that are related to Apple Event.\r\nEven though I am not using Apple Event, I was unable to submit to the Mac App Store due to incorrect Hardened Runtime settings.\r\nThis is very serious problem for Mac Catalyst programmers.\r\nI would like you to take action as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n# Reproducing\r\n1. Create new iOS App project on Xcode 13.3, macOS 12.3.1. You must not add any codes to the project.\r\n2. Enable Mac Catalyst.\r\n3. Launch Console.app in order to check the app's behavior.\r\n4. Filter out the logs with keywords as \"Prompting policy for hardened runtime\".\r\n5. Push \"start\" button on Console.app.\r\n6. Back to Xcode.app, Build and run.\r\n7. Switch to Console.app.\r\n8. You check the error log, such as \"tccd\tPrompting policy for hardened runtime; service: kTCCServiceAppleEvents requires entitlement com.apple.security.automation.apple-events but it is missing for accessing={<TCCDProcess: identifier=com.sonson.HomeConMenu.macOS, pid=632, auid=501, euid=501, binary_path=/Applications/HomeConMenu.app/Contents/MacOS/HomeConMenu>}, requesting={<TCCDProcess: identifier=com.apple.appleeventsd, pid=331, auid=55, euid=55, binary_path=/System/Library/CoreServices/appleeventsd>},\"\r\n\r\n# Expected\r\nConsole.app does not detect such as errors.\r\n\r\n# Result\r\nI've already show above."
