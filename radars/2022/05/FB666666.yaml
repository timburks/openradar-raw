    description: "In UserNotifications.framework, we use the new method `ringtoneSoundNamed:`(iOS 15.2), to remind users of notifications in video conference App.\r\n\r\nAfter the user clicks on the notification and launch the App, the Apple Watch continues to vibrate until the end of 30 seconds or the Watch needs to be clicked twice to end (the iPhone needs to lock the screen before the notification goes to the Apple Watch)"
