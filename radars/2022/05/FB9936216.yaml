    description: "Running Xcode Version 13.2.1 (13C100) with an iPhone 13 mini simulator, the simulator will sometimes restart when pasting (using ⌘V) into the running app.\r\n\r\nStart an app with a text field in the simulator. Press ⌘V to paste from the pasteboard into the simulator.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the pasteboard should be pasted into the app’s text field.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the simulator will abruptly restart.\r\nSometimes, nothing will happen and the mouse must be used to paste via iOS’s own interface."
