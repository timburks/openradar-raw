    description: "Basic Information\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nHomePod alarms not sounding\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nSiri\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDetails\r\nWhat does the Siri issue you are experiencing involve?\r\nCorrect Response but Incorrect Action from Siri\r\nWhat did you say to Siri? Please be as exact as possible.\r\nHey Siri, set my alarm for 8:30.\r\nWhat was Siri’s response?\r\nOK, I've turned on your 8:30 alarm.\r\nWhat did Siri do wrong?\r\nAlarm did not sound\r\nWhat kind of device are you trying to Handoff?\r\nHomePod mini\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nAlarm was set on HomePod for 08:30 the following morning. The alarm did not sound at the requested time, despite Siri confirming that the alarm had been switched on. The alarm is a normal alarm that plays a tone and does not repeat. The alarm had previously been created by voice and was being switched on in this instance.\r\n\r\nWe have observed inconsistent behaviour with HomePod alarms — sometimes they will sound on time, and sometimes they will not sound at all despite being set.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Ask Siri to set an alarm\r\n2. Await alarm time\r\n3. Alarm does not sound\r\nPlease note the date and time when the issue occurred (e.g. April 12,2012 10:20am PST)\r\nCommand spoken at approx 23:00 on Sat 8 May 2022; alarm expected at 08:30 on Mon 9 May 2022 but not heard.\r\n\r\n[Sysdiagnose from affected HomePod minis submitted with original Feedback, not shown here]"
