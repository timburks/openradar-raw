    description: "Updating Chrome in place on disk has been part of the root cause for many recent bugs. See the umbrella bug here: https://crbug.com/1297588.\r\n\r\nWe identified at least two distinct scenarios that each cause multiple issues.\r\n\r\nThe first is triggered when Chrome is updated on disk and the main executableâ€™s Mach header moves from where it was when Chrome was launched. In a typical manifestation, the bug occurs when a certain action is attempted after Chrome is updated on disk but is not relaunched, and the bug remains until Chrome is relaunched. See this doc for details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ8m3DmGnSNsuUmn-ZwRmFbSUwBy8zTaR3yX_XCWv8IV9qk-QuI6bl5xQznS9nS_J0VRaCaEM_9R9S-/pub\r\n\r\nThe second is when Chrome is updated on disk and there are no issues with Mach header alignment. Depending on a number of factors it's now possible for the running instance of Chrome to fail code sign checks with: errSecCSStaticCodeChanged. This can cause issues with system level TCC permissions. See this doc for details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQqPaAqY_3m5Vn19nFj2q1wB1M_TQSn4kUDLLtcEHUK7deXVOVO9eOmgit9yq-cxphoaiLCs_YgA08L/pub\r\n\r\nWe have implemented successful workarounds in both of these cases but are not sitting comfortably with them.\r\n\r\nUpdating Chrome in place on disk keeps Chrome's update velocity high which is great for security and feature rollouts. We would like to keep this velocity.\r\n\r\nAre there other problem areas we should be aware of when updating Chrome in place on disk? Do you have any recommendations for how to better handle these scenarios?"
