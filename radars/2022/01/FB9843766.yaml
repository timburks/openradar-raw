    description: "The hierarchy:\r\n\r\nUINavigationController > UIViewController [modalPresentationStyle=.pageSheet] with large title > UIScrollView > Very large label to make scrollview scrollable.\r\n\r\nWhen I scroll down a little and then tap into status bar to scroll to top it create extra empty space below the large title.\r\n\r\nThat problem seems to be fixed when viewController.edgesForExtendedLayout = [] is used, but it leads to another weird problem.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, when I scroll to the top and scroll down, it makes the title larger and then scroll the entire view to down to dismiss it, now when I scroll down the title doesn't get bigger, please see attached images & videos.\r\n\r\nNormal space\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/amgFN.png\r\n\r\nUnwanted space\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/ohOAT.png\r\n\r\nVideo: https://imgur.com/a/ESuFr8B\r\n\r\nGithub Code: https://github.com/soujohnreis/statusbar-scrolltop-largetitle-problem\r\n\r\nVideo with viewController.edgesForExtendedLayout: https://imgur.com/a/Xz3Bueu\r\n\r\nImage with viewController.edgesForExtendedLayout: https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8E67.png"
