    description: "There is no public API in SwiftUI for rendering Text with a precise negative line spacing, which is a very common design requirement.\r\n\r\nWhen a negative line spacing is provided to the `.lineSpacing(…)` view modifier, the `Text` does not respect it, and instead renders with a zero line spacing.\r\n\r\nThere is a view modifier that enables \"tight\" line spacing, `.leading(.tight)`, but it does not allow fine-grained control of the line spacing in `Text`, preventing you from achieving pixel-perfect designs.\r\n\r\nFinally there is a private/underscore-prefixed API that enables this behavior on `View`, `_lineHeightMultiple(…)`, but it is only visible in the SwiftUI `swiftinterface` and is furthermore marked as deprecated, so it doesn't seem advisable to rely on it."
