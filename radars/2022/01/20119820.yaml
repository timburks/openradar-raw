    description: "This bug is new in Monterey (didn't exist in earlier versions) and has already received some social media attention in the Leica M group on Facebook, and others have written about it, see here:\r\n\r\nhttps://diglloyd.com/blog/2022/20220122_0952-LeicaM11-DNG-files-displaying-improperly.html\r\n\r\nIf you own a Leica M240 camera, you can easily reproduce it on macOS Monterey. Just open a DNG file from the camera in Apple Preview (or even Apple Photo). The colors will be smeared and off. It may not be immediately visible, but if you run the file through Adobe DNG converter (without modifying the file, just do a plain DNG to DNG conversation), the resulting file will behave properly on macOS Monterey."
