    description: "This has affected every version of Xcode I have used for about the last ten years. I experience it several times a week on both macOS and iOS projects. It has happened to me and my co-workers on different projects at different companies, as well as on my personal side project.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Debug a program that uses dispatch_async from multiple queues at the same time\r\n2. Single step a bit and hit continue\r\n3. Do this for a few minutes and it will reproduce\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nDebugger doesnâ€™t hang\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nDebugger hangs. Looks like deadlock."
