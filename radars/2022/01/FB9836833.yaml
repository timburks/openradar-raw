    description: "When passing Swift nil into MIDIThruConnectionCreate(inPersistentOwnerID:inConnectionParams:outConnection:) as the first parameter, Core MIDI does not interpret it as a NULL. Core MIDI creates a persistent thru connection instead, which is only supposed to happen if this parameter is a non-null string.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for this method states: “inPersistentOwnerID: A unique identifier of the owning object, such as com.mycompany.MyApp. If you pass NULL, the client owns the connection and it’s automatically disposed with the client.”\r\n\r\nMy workaround is having to create an Objective-C wrapper function that can achieve it:\r\n\r\nOSStatus CMIDIThruConnectionCreateNonPersistent(CFDataRef inConnectionParams, MIDIThruConnectionRef *outConnection)\r\n{\r\n    return MIDIThruConnectionCreate(NULL, inConnectionParams, outConnection);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis has been a very long-standing issue for many years, across multiple macOS versions (and possibly iOS as well)."
