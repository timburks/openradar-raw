    description: "Due to FB9833896 (https://openradar.appspot.com/FB9833896), the only way to disable UICollectionView's one-finger band selection gesture is to manually remove UIMultiSelectInteraction from the list of enabled interactions of the collection view.\r\n\r\nWhen the collection view delegate implements `contextMenuConfigurationForItemAt`, an UIContextMenuInteraction is added automatically to the collection view. When long pressing on any of its items, UIContextMenuInteraction often calls `UICollectionView.indexPathForItem(at:)` with a CGPoint that has `CGFLOAT_MAX` set as its coordinates. This causes the main thread to freeze/hang as the collection view is trying to find elements available in such a huge rectangle.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by -[_UIClickPresentationInteraction locationInView:] erratically returning `(x: CGFLOAT_MAX, y: CGFLOAT_MAX)` as the touch point location. This seems to be caused by the fact that _UIClickPresentationInteraction has an `initialLocation` set to that point and the lack of an `activeDriver` in `_UIClickPresentationHandler` at the time of tapping."
