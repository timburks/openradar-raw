    description: "Implementing `collectionView(_:shouldBeginMultipleSelectionInteractionAt:)` irreversibly turns on single-finger band/multi selection which works on phones as well. This seems to be handled by `UIMultiSelectInteraction` (not `UIBandSelectionInteraction`, which doesn't work on phones).\r\n\r\nNote that this is different than the two-finger band selection gesture discussed in your documentation (which should be able to be disabled by returning `false` in `shouldBeginMultipleSelectionInteractionAt`) -- this works by just dragging a single finger across a collection view with multiple selection enabled. Removing the implementation of the delegate method removes this behavior.\r\n\r\nPlease either make this follow the value returned by `shouldBeginMultipleSelectionInteractionAt` or add a separate flag to disable it. Thanks."
