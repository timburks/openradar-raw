    description: "If you remove the MDM enrollment profile (which removes the sys ext profile) and then re-enroll in the MDM system extensions appear to be running. But doing a reboot immediately after none of our system extensions load again. \r\nReproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Confirm that system extensions are loaded (Santa, Crowdstrike) with `sudo systemextensionsctl list` \r\n2. Remove the MDM profile. \r\n3. Reinstall MDM profile. Confirm that the extensions are still running\r\n4. Reboot the Mac. systemextensionsctl list now reports 0 extensions and the extensions are indeed not responding."
