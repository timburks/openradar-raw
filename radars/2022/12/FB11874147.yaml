    description: "Text views contained in VStacks wrap their strings unnecessarily early. The behavior is also unpredictable as some combinations of words will produce the normal, expected behavior, and some others won't.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n- Create an empty project\r\n- Paste the following in a new file (file attached as well):\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct TestView: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack(alignment: .leading) {\r\n            Text(\"Hello this is a long message about something important\")\r\n            Text(\"What's more, here's a second paragraph that might cause this content to wrap. Who knows?\")\r\n        }\r\n        .padding()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct TestView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\r\n    static var previews: some View {\r\n        TestView()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n- Observe how the first `Text` wraps the word \"something\" when it actually still would have room for it on the first line.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Text views don't wrap their contents unnecessarily early\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Text views wrap their contents too early, not making use of the full parent view's width\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nThis issue on StackOverflow -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72685881/swiftui-text-doesnt-fit-full-width-while-having-multiple-lines"
