    description: "## Reproduction\r\n\r\n1) I finished writing my comment in the textarea of a blog.\r\n- I have some leftover text in the paragraphs after the cursor position.\r\n\r\n2) Now I pressed ⌘ ⇧ ↓\r\n- The general macOS text editing shortcut to select from cursor until the end of the document / text area.\r\n\r\n**Expected**: Selection from cursor until the end of the textarea.\r\n\r\n**Actual**: I'm somewhere totally else! I hope my drafted comment is not lost!\r\n- What happened is that ⌘⇧↑ and ⌘⇧↓ in Safari are assigned to the commands \"Go to Previous Tab Group\" and \"Go to Next Tab Group\".\r\n- When I realized that, and went back to the general tab group, all my tabs, and also the most recent tab with the open comment input was still there and luckily not lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n- As long as Safari is in text editing mode (e.g. in web forms, address bar, bookmark manager, etc) the shortcuts  ⌘⇧↑    ⌘⇧↓   shall be intercepted by text editing alone and not pass through to the \"Prev/next tab group\" command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Safari 16.2\r\n- On any website (general issue)\r\n- macOS 11.7.2 (but issue applies to contemporary macOS too)"
