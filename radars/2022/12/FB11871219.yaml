    description: "## clear description of the problem\r\nOn iOS 16.0, and iOS 16.1, Manually setting HTTP Proxy on Wi-Fi doesn't work anymore. The traffic doesn't go through the Proxy. It works on iOS 15.\r\n\r\n## A step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem (if possible)\r\nYou can simply test it by following the step:\r\n\r\n1. Close all apps\r\n2. Get your iPhone (iOS 16 or later) -> Setting app -> Wifi -> Your Wifi -> Configure Proxy -> Manual Proxy\r\n3. Set any random IP, e.g. 192.168.3.111\r\n4. Set any random Port, e.g 9999\r\n5. Save\r\n6. Open Safari app -> Visit https://google.com\r\n7. Confirm that you can access the Internet.\r\n\r\nSince the IP & Port is invalid, but you can access the Internet, it indicates that it's Apple's bug \U0001F41B\r\n\r\n## What results you expected\r\n- Since the HTTP Proxy is invalid, iPhone could not access to the Internet.\r\n- If using the correct HTTP Proxy Server, the traffic should go through the Proxy Server.\r\n\r\n## What results you actually saw\r\n- iPhone is still able to connect to the Internet even thought the invalid HTTP Proxy."
