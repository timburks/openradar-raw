    description: "I’ve been adding some accessory widgets to my app and noticed some strange behaviour regarding how assets are handled very specifically by the accessoryInline widget\r\n\r\nFirst, it doesn’t show any custom SF Symbols in previews. I’m not sure if this extends out to other asset types, but this was true for all SF Symbols I tested. For the same code other widget sizes will render assets correctly, however accessoryInline will not.\r\n\r\nNext, it won’t process any custom SF Symbols from outside the extension. I have a resources SPM package that contains all my assets across the app, and while it works just fine in other packages and other widget types, the custom SF symbols it contains are rendered as blank app icon templates in the accessoyInline widget.\r\n\r\nNote that custom SF symbols that are present within the extension will render fine once build and run, however they too render incorrectly in widgets.\r\n\r\nI have attached a project that demonstrates both these bugs in action. There’s a “sharrow” symbol included in both the resources package and the widget’s assets file. I’m displaying them in that order in my widget. As you can see in the previews for the WidgetTest2Widget and the image I have attached here, both render as blank in previews. When I run them on device, however, the former still renders as blank, while the latter renders correctly"
