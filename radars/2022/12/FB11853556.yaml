    description: "Hi!\r\n\r\nWhen you switch input language in your Mac, and Simulator is running – your Simulator locale becomes that input language. It happens once, further switching of input language does not affect Simulator.\r\nIt happens to iOS, WatchOS simulators (probably the others too) since Xcode13\r\n\r\nSee video attached.\r\n\r\n1. run Simulator\r\n2. switch system input language in MacOS\r\n\r\nER: Simulator runs with preselected Locale & Language.\r\nAR: Simulator’s Locale & Language are changing to input language of your Mac. It happens once, further switching of input language does not affect Simulator."
