    description: "A Safari tab on one device can be closed from another device using iCloud Tabs on the \"new tab\" page.  When a macOS tab is closed from an iOS or iPadOS device, the closure does not take effect until Safari is restarted on the macOS device.  \r\n\r\nThe issue does not occur between iOS devices, between iOS and iPadOS devices, or when closing an iOS or iPadOS tab from macOS Safari.  It only occurs when closing a macOS tab from iOS or iPadOS.\r\n\r\nThis issue did not happen before the major version updates (macOS 12.3, iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4) were released in March 2022.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this:\r\n\r\n1) On a macOS device, open https://www.apple.com in Safari\r\n2) On an iOS or iPadOS device registered to the same iCloud account, open Safari and open a new tab\r\n3) Scroll down to the iCloud Tabs section; the label will be \"From {the macOS device's name}\"\r\n4) Observe that an entry exists with the name \"Apple\"\r\n5) Long press on the entry for \"Apple\", then press \"Close\"\r\n6) Wait for any amount of time (for example, five minutes)\r\n7) Observe that the tab has not been closed on the macOS device\r\n8) On the macOS device, quit Safari, then reopen it\r\n9) Observe that the tab has now been closed"
