    description: "QuickLook used to work with the .EXP file type/UTI. \r\n\r\nAs of the release of Catalina, it has stopped calling QL generators. The generator gets called for other types. There is no image generated by Apple for this type, nor should there be.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: Create an app extension and have the .exp type in the plist.\r\n\r\nThis type has been used long before Apple used it, and is currently in use by over a million people in the embroidery industry. It works in Mac prior to Catalina.\r\n\r\nThis bug has been confirmed by more than one software company. This may be a duplicate bug report, but search is not showing it.\r\n\r\nWe have over 200k users, and a 12 year history selling QL generators. We have had many complaints about this. All other file types are still working within our arena, which includes about 20 types/UTIs."
