    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nUsing a TabView with PageTabViewStyle causes layout issues (wrong page is displayed) when changing orientation to landscape. It seems that the page is changed to a different one once the orientation changes to landscape. \r\n\r\ntested on iOS 15.2 iPhone 11 \r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n- Render the attached view \r\n- slide a few pages\r\n- rotate device to landscape mode\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    @State private var page = 0\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        TabView(selection: $page) {\r\n            Color.blue.tag(0)\r\n            Color.red.tag(1)\r\n            Color.yellow.tag(2)\r\n            Color.green.tag(3)\r\n            Color.gray.tag(4)\r\n        }\r\n        .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\nSame page that was rendered in Portrait mode to be rendered in landscape mode after rotation\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nAnother page was rendered"
