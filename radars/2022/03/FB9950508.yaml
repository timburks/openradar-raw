    description: "The `Foundation` framework and its class `NumberFormatter` provide various styles (e.g. decimal, percent, scientific, spellOut or currency) but no compact style. A compact decimal number formatting would convert 1000 into 1K or 1100000 into 1.1M which is a common requirement for app developers.\r\n\r\nA pull request containing a draft implementation: https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/2710\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Foundation.NumberFormatter can provide handling for such compact styles out-of-the-box."
