    description: "When animating a NSTableView fed by a diffable data source, animations seem glitchy. More specifically, moving a single row in the data results in a strange effect: the row does animate properly, and so do any other moving rows; but any row that moves leaves behind a copy of itself, that slowly fades away as the animation progresses.\r\n\r\nAttached are a minimal repro case, and a recording of the issue.\r\nIn the recording, as the “0” and “100” rows start moving, they both leave a ghostly copy of themselves behind. \r\n\r\nTried on this Mac (M1 MBP running the latest Monterey), and on beta 3 of macOS Ventura (targeting the 13.0 SDK) in an UTM VM.\r\n\r\nThis issue was originally submitted as a TSI, which was dismissed as non-resolvable."
