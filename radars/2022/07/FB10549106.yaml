    description: "We would like an API which allows an app to:\r\n\r\n- Register to appear in passkey authentication prompts alongside existing options\r\n- Handle requests to save new passkeys\r\n- Handle requests to authenticate with a saved passkey\r\n\r\nPasskeys are a wonderful new security feature in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura. Our users are really excited about them, but they don’t want to jump in until they can use our app (1Password) to manage them, as millions have already been doing for their passwords for many years.\r\n\r\nOur users expect that Apple will support a choice of passkey authenticator app based on prior history. The existing Password Autofill API allows users to select a password manager of their choice to use alongside iCloud Keychain in apps and in Safari. It follows that this choice would extend to passkeys, which are intended to replace and supersede passwords.\r\n\r\nThe design of passkeys as well as Apple’s publicly stated intentions also reinforce the belief that users will be able to choose an authenticator app:\r\n\r\n1. The passkey authentication prompt already presents a list of authentication options, including third-party security keys and external devices such as Android phones. It would be natural to allow apps on the same device to show up in the list.\r\n2. Passkeys are based on the WebAuthn open standard and supported by the FIDO alliance, of which Apple and 1Password are both members.\r\n3. Apple has open and proudly promoted interoperability as part of its passkey messaging.\r\n\r\nIt seems counterproductive that the passkey prompt would recommend the use of an insecure Android phone, but not allow the user to choose a secure, native app on their own device within the Apple ecosystem. I’ve attached a mockup of what this feature might look like to users, so you can see how naturally it fits into the existing design.\r\n\r\nAllowing apps to act as passkey authenticators would promote the speedy adoption of this new technology and support Apple’s message of interoperability. We are excited to work with Apple and other app developers to make this a reality for all our users."
