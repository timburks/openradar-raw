    description: "Given that:\r\n- If you create an iMessage group with the same Contacts, but use a different contact method for one of them, then you will end up with _two_ message groups of the same people\r\n- Currently, if creating a new message group, existing message groups are correctly surfaced in the recipient search results\r\n   - Search results can be dense, and existing discussions can be easy to miss, especially if the groups are named (and so the fact that it represents the same Contacts is less obvious)\r\n- This can _sometimes_ be intentional (eg, separating work and personal discussions), but is often accidental and is very frustrating when accidental, as deduplication of message groups is not currently possible.\r\n\r\nPlease:\r\n- Require confirmation with the user that this is intentional.\r\n- Example prompt: “You are about to create a new discussion, but already have a discussion named ‘Foo Bar’ with the same recipients. Create the new discussion anyway? The existing discussion will not be deleted. [Create New | Send to ‘Foo Bar’]"
