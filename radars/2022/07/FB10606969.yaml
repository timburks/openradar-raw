    description: I like being able to click the Apple TV remote to wake up my TV, but I often want to turn off the Apple TV to switch over to another media device without turning off the TV. Right now, there's only the toggle to control TVs and receivers or not. My suggestion is replacing the big Sleep button in Control Center with separate "Sleep Apple TV" and "Sleep all connected devices" buttons.
