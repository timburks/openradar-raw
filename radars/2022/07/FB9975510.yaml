    description: "Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nProvisional Notifications not converting to Prominent\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nâ€ŒSomething else not on this list\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDescription\r\nPlease describe the issue:\r\nI am trying to move over to using UNAuthorizationOptions.provisional to be a better iOS citizen. However, when I set that option and notifications show up on the NC as expected tapping \"Keep\" does not behave as expected. \r\n\r\n1. The documentation states the user should be presented with the option to have future notifications delivered Prominent or Quietly. \r\n\r\n2. If I do select the option shown as \"Deliver Immediately\" they are then delivered quietly. \r\n\r\n3. If I do select \"Summary\" nothing happens as I the use has not enabled the use of Summaries for any \r\napps. How does the use choose Prominent so they can see future notifications as defined by our other authorization options specified we we originally request authorization? Why is the summary choice showing up when summaries are not enabled?"
