    description: "Normally in SwiftUI the modifiers that are like preferences are passed through a reduce so that the closest one takes effect. I found it strange that when declaring 2 navigationDestination modifiers using the same type the below warning is shown in the console:\r\n\r\n    A navigationDestination for “Swift.ObjectIdentifier” was declared earlier on the stack. Only the destination declared closest to the root view of the stack will be used.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that you run this modifier/preference through a reduce function so that the closest to where the NavigationLink that was activated can be used. Then there is no need for a warning and the behavior will match other similar modifiers where the closest takes effect.\r\n\r\nI tried to find where in the Apple documentation it states that PreferenceKeys should use reduce and was unable to, but please see this link that explains it:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vadimbulavin.com/passing-data-between-swiftui-views/\r\n\r\nThanks"
