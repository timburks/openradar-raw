    description: "There’s no replacement for traditional bundles that are loaded into the Xcode process. As insecure as they are, they allow developers to improve their IDE as they wish. The public APIs available for Xcode extensions is arguably terrible and does not allow third-party developers to truly improve Xcode. There’s tons of changes I’d love to make through plugins that I currently cannot:\r\n- I’d love to write an Xcode plugin for something like xcodegen so Xcode doesn’t literally shit itself when I xcodegen an opened project\r\n- I’d love to write an Xcode plugin that lets you have more control over the ordering of schemes in the dropdown menu\r\n- I’d love to write an Xcode plugin that adds more integration with Xcode Server\r\n- I’d love to write an Xcode plugin that makes it easier to customize code signing behaviors\r\n- I’d love to write an Xcode plugin that makes it easier to cancel a task that is refusing to cancel\r\nThe list goes on and on and on, and I can’t do any of these without brutally mutilating Xcode so that it loads my plugins, and even then, no normal person would install my plugin because of the amount of work required just to run plugins."
