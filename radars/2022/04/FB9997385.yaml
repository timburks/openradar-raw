    description: "When a text field has keyboard type set to UIKeyboardType.emailAddress, there is no way to enter a comma. \r\n\r\nNormally, the user can access more symbols by long-pressing some keys. This also works here: one can enter all kinds of special symbols (currency, mathematical, advanced punctuation). But not a standard comma.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a format enforcement issue, because the user still can enter other characters not allowed in email addresses.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Open device settings\r\n- Tap Mail→ Accounts→ Add Account→ Other→ Add Mail Account\r\n- Tap the Email field\r\n- Try to enter a comma\r\n\r\nChecked on iOS 15.4.1, both US English and German layouts."
