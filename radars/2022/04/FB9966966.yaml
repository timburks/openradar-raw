    description: "AMFITrustedKeys is an nvram variable that can be set to load additional code signing identities that are recognized with the same respect as Apple Root CA. This variable is only respected on IUOUs or IUOSs. This variable is a far more secure way of working with AMFI, especially when compared to the publicly documented solution which is to disable AMFI in its entirety via amfi_get_out_of_my_way.\r\n\r\nThis variable should only be configurable from 1TR to further ensure that the owner is physically present and carrying out this change. It would make it much easier for enthusiasts to tinker with their computers without fully disabling one of the larger security mechanisms in the OS."
