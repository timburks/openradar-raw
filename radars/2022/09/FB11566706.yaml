    description: "Live activity fails to update if app is in background even if the app supports background audio and is the now playing app. It fails even if updated after background task api is used. \r\n\r\nEnvironment: iPhone 12 running iOS 16 Beta 2, Xcode 14.1 Beta 2. \r\n\r\nThe sample project attached requires an active Apple Music subscription. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n\r\n0. Download the attached sample project and run it on a real device with active Apple Music sub. \r\n1. Start playback of a queue using the play button. \r\n2. Press start live activity \r\n3. Put app in background, the live activity should show the current song. \r\n4. Now change the song using the player control in lock screen.\r\n5. The live activity fails to get updated from background even though the app has background audio permission.\r\n6. Live activity also fails to update if run using a background task in an app with bg audio permission. \r\n\r\nExpected result: The live activity should get updated from background if the app has background audio permission and is the now playing app. The live activity should also get updated using the background task api. \r\n\r\nResult seen: Live activity fails to update when called from background by app with background audio and now playing app status. It also fails to update if background audio is playing and the background tasks API is used."
