    description: When you view a web article in Safari Reader view, it has the name of the article and the date it was published on top. It's important to note that this is the *name* of the article, *not* the HTML Title, which is often different. However, there is no way to capture this article name in Shortcuts. It's not included by default in Get Article using Safari Reader (which I would expect), and it can't be accessed by Get Details of Article. The "Name" property returns the page Title on every page I've tried it on, and that's usually different from the article name displayed in Safari Reader view, usually containing the website or author name in addition to the article name. Please introduce some way to capture the article name shown in Safari Reader using Shortcuts.
