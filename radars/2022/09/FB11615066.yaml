    description: "On iPadOS 15.5 and above, building with the iOS 16 SDK, the app does not immediately show the key commands setup by the app from `func buildMenu(with builder: UIMenuBuilder)` from its `AppDelegate`. \r\n\r\nAfter interacting with any view in the app that can become a first responder, the app immediately begins to display key commands setup by it. \r\n\r\nThe app instead presents key commands from Springboard (Homescreen). \r\n\r\nApps built with prior versions of the SDK (15.5) exhibit the correct behaviour. \r\n\r\nSample code and screenshot attached (https://github.com/dezinezync/FB11615066)\r\n\r\nXcode Version: 14.0.1 (14A400)"
