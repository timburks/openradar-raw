    description: "SwiftUI animations do not render at 120fps when run on iPhones with a ProMotion display. They run at 120fps when run on iPads with ProMotion displays, so this bug affects just iPhones. \r\n\r\nThis is a dupe of feedback #FB11592844 \r\n\r\nMore info along with examples in this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/christianselig/status/1574207311140327426?s=21\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nRun the sample from this gist on an iPhone with ProMotion display: https://gist.github.com/christianselig/c14e7801b21c0215329060f2734e81fb\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nSwiftUI animations should run at 120fps (or the max the display is capable of)\r\n\r\nObserved result:\r\nSwiftUI animations are limited to 60fps only even on an iPhone with ProMotion display."
