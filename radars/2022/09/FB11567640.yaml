    description: "1. Create 2 AVAudioPlayerNode's\r\n2. On first player, schedule a file to play in sequence by using multiple calls to scheduleFile(file, at: nil)\r\n3. On second player, schedule a file to play in sequence by using multiple calls to scheduleFile(file, at: time). Time needs to be calculated so that file plays right after previous schedule.\r\n4. Play them both at the same sample time, using play(at: time)\r\n5. Players are now in perfect sync\r\n6. Stop both players\r\n5. Repeat the schedule steps 2 and 3\r\n7. Play again using play(at: time)\r\n8. Player are not in sync anymore\r\n\r\n\r\nProject reproducing the issue (also attached):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jcavar/examples/tree/master/AudioPlayerSampleTimeOutOfSync\r\n\r\nRun the app and audition the sound initially, and after Toggling play.\r\n\r\nNote that the issue is only reproducible when players are scheduled in a different way - one using `at: nil` and another `at: time`. But these should really be equivalent as time is calculated to be scheduled exactly after the previous"
