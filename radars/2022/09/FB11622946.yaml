    description: "When a user taps on PIP button and goes out of the app and then uses the PIP button to get back in the app and does some sort of navigation inside the app after PIP, the application goes into a “Severe Hang” and ultimately stop responding after a while and the user has to kill the application and relaunch. This was test on multiple ios15 devices and seems to be working fine on that. Some links for reference including source code from another developer who has faced this exact same issue with attached video:\r\n\r\nCodebase:\r\nhttps://github.com/wqhiOS/PictureInPicture-iOS16-BUG\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\nhttps://github.com/wqhiOS/PictureInPicture-iOS16-BUG/blob/main/bug.MOV?raw=true\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour should be same on iOS 15 & 16 devices, but iOS 16 devices seem to be crashing by running into a app hang state.\r\nAn Xcode stack trace using “bt” command is attached for the app that was in “Severe Hang” state in time profiler.\r\n\r\nThis is not my github repo."
