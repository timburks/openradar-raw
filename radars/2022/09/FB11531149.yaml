    description: "Daily Scrums Sample Project included. The foreground color set on CardView(), .foregroundColor(scrum.color.accessibleFontColor), makes the text color black on lighter colored backgrounds and vice versa. As you will see when you open the project.\r\n\r\nHowever, using this custom color extension in a SwipeAction does not work and the color is always white making it hard to read the button label in the SwipeAction. You will see that I have specifically set the SwipeActions Button label to .foregroundColor(.black), but the modifier is not respected in the SwipeAction.\r\n\r\nThe expected result would be that Buttons in SwipeActions can have custom foreground colors so I could set a modifier like this, .foregroundColor(scrum.color.accessibleFontColor), which would allow the color of the text to be more readable on lighter color backgrounds."
