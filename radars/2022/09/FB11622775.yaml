    description: "When using a 3rd party Trackpad or Mouse, smooth/inertia based scrolling is not available on iOS. This badly affects user experience especially on iPadOS where multi-touch gestures and momentum play an important role in the entire UX chain. \r\n \r\nAt the very least, 3rd party multi-touch trackpads should get support for momentum based scroll. The velocity and other parameters required to calculate the scroll view momentum can be easily computed by how quickly the OS receives scroll inputs values. \r\n \r\nSteps the re-produce issue. \r\n1. Use a 3rd party multi-touch trackpad or mouse. I'm using the Typecase Magic Keyboard with trackpad for iPad (https://a.co/d/3Tpzm94) \r\n2. Scroll on any website by flicking \r\n\r\nExpected result: \r\nThe scroll view should continue scrolling based on momentum and come to a smooth halt similar to when using Apple's Magic Mouse or Trackpad. \r\n\r\nObserved result: At end of the flick, the scroll view stops abruptly."
