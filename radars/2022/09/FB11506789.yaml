    description: We have received a number of reports from consumers that are unhappy with the HDR viewing experience due to extreme levels of brightness. In an app in which the primary action is to scroll through a feed of short arbitrarily-ordered videos, the sudden change in brightness can be quite startling, especially in a dark room. Is it possible to disable this brightening behavior and allow the video player to more closely match the consumer's preferred screen brightness level? We are using AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer with kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr10BiPlanarVideoRange. Related to FB9875960 (SDR content is darker than HDR content)
