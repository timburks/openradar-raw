    description: "MPMediaLibrary related methods to fetch info about users library playlists and other media directly from a widget extension fail due to a permission bug. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\nEnvironment: Xcode 14.1 beta 2, device running iOS 16 beta 2 Open and run the attached sample project. \r\n\r\n1. Run on an actual device, MediaPlayer is not available on simulator\r\n2. Allow Library permission in the main app\r\n3. Add widget from homescreen\r\n 4. MPMediaLibrary.authorizationStatus() status will be .denied in the widget extension\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: MPMediaLibrary should be accessible from the widget extension if main app already has access. This used to work on iOS 15 and below."
