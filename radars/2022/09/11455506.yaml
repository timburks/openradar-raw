    description: I think there’s a trend in design to put a microphone button into all text fields. I am sure there’s rationality behind this but whatever it is I find it it damaging. It can train users to use the button and they won’t realise that dictation is accessible in any app through the iOS keyboard. Please remove extra button on UI element which is already so small. The keyboard is needed anyway so it’s not like we saving an extra tap.
