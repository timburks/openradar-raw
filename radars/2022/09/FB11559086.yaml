The shortcut crashes frequently when trying to view data in a quick look.\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nShortcuts\r\nWhat type of feedback are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\nDETAILS\r\nIs this a shortcut issue with Siri or the Shortcuts app?\r\nShortcuts app\r\nWhat type of shortcut issue are you seeing?\r\nRunning a shortcut\r\nWhat is the iCloud link to your shortcut?\r\nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ 6047Â£454a604499657b7871340c9946\r\nAre you able to collect a screenshot or screen recording that shows the issue? If so, please attach it to this report. Without these files, you may receive an additional request for more information before we can investigate the issue.\r\nYes\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nWhen using the \"find health samples\" action to retrieve sleep data sometimes the shortcut crashes and no data is presented.\r\nWhen data is presented in the quicklook and trying to view it as a list, the shortcut will also crash. This behavior is quite inconsistent, and as you can see in the attached recording run to run is not very consistent either.\r\nThere is sleep data from last night that should be showing up when using this action and this is also shown in the screenshot I have attached."
