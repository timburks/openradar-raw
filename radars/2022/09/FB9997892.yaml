    description: "There is no sound in video playback implemented by AVFoundation elements, in iPad 9 (maybe other as well, but not all models) in iPadOS 16.1 (beta 1 + 2).\r\nThe issue is solve-able by explicitly setting AVAudioSession mode (ambient, mix, exclusive, etc.).\r\nBut there is no such behaviour in iphone's, so it's bug, or if it's intended change, then it's undocumented for the moment."
