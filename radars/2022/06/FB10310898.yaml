    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nIn code involving nested view types and preprocessor directives, SwiftUI previews sometimes fail for obscure reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe project involves types `Level1View` and `Level2View` nested in a top-level `ContentView`, with `Level2View` conditionally compiled with the help of preprocessor directives:\r\n1. Open the attached sample project. \r\n2. Open `ContentView.swift` and the SwiftUI preview editor in Xcode. \r\n3. Attempt to render the `ContentView` preview. Preview fails with the following error: Cannot find `Level2View` in scope\r\n\r\nNote that I used a simple `#if true` directive to prove this issue is related to the use of the preprocessor (and nested types of course), though I encountered this issue in multi-platform iOS / tvOS code using `#if os(iOS)`. \r\n\r\nWorkaround: Wrapping `Level2View` into `Level1View` directly instead of `ContentView` fixes the preview issue. I attached a project with this workaround as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nSwiftUI previews always work.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nSwiftUI previews sometimes fail for obscure reasons."
