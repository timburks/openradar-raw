    description: "Summary:\r\nIn macOS Ventura, the new Login Items UX/UI does not seem to have MDM interface. Enterprise security tools that we are required by law to use for compliance use Launch Agents and Launch Daemons - administrators should have a method on supervised machines to prevent users from disabling a specific Login Item.\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\nIn many cases, enterprise security and management apps such as EDR tools, network monitors, proxying software, and device management require the use of Launch Daemons or Launch Agents to function. In my brief testing, it is simple for a malicious user to bypass these tools by disabling them in the new System Preferences interface and thus bring their device out of compliance and potentially endanger the organization’s data. Users may also be suspicious or simply unaware of what a Launch Agent or Launch Daemon is, and disable all of them because of that. Enterprise administrators need a method to retain control of specific tools that absolutely must run. In the past, many organizations have gone the route of removing administrator privileges entirely, but in modern macOS this causes a whole lot of headaches!\r\n\r\nThe SMAppService documentation mentions requiring “user approval” (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice?changes=latest_minor&language=objc). However, the Device Management documentation does not mention a way for enterprise administrators to control this feature. The need for this feature can be met by implementing a system that is similar to other “user approval” controls such as for Documents or Desktop folder access would work well here and follow understandable existing patterns for administrators to mark single specific launchd jobs as managed, preventing end users from using the System Preferences pane to force unloading. A welcome extension of the implementation would be if the launchd binary would prevent a command line load/unload process, similar to how an MDM profile forcing firewall settings disables the ability of command line alterations."
