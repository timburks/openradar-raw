    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Rapid Security Response updates have an MDM control to enable them, but not to force install or require them by a specific date or time. Please add a method for enterprise administrators to either force install (similar to the InstallNow command), or a GUI system for users to know they have a specific period of time or number of deferrals before the update will install itself.\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\nOur current software update workflow is a bit ragged as MDM software update controls have not proven reliable and were buggy on macOS 12. We use a system of deferrals by a day or two to give us time to test, and then use an open source app called Nudge which provides a GUI to remind our users that they are required to patch by a certain date for security compliance. This system is suboptimal, and a first party solution from Apple is greatly preferred.\r\n\r\nThe system we would like to see would provide two different paths that administrators could take to manage and enforce the installation of Rapid Security Response updates:\r\n1. An MDM-based command that works to immediately install the RSR content and apply a reboot if necessary, similar to the existing InstallNow command for OS minor updates. This would be extremely useful for kiosk or appliance style deployments, e.g. in labs or for video conferencing room software.\r\n\r\n2. A user-facing system that alerts users more aggressively to the security content (i.e., more than just Notification Center where the string subs are broken in most updates) and allows enterprise administrators to manage a number of deferrals, a “due date” expressed in local time of the machine (e.g. “5pm on Thursday”), or a combination of both. After the deferral or deadline has passed, the machine should automatically apply the update and schedule a restart that the user cannot easily cancel."
