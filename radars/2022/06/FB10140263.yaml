    description: "It would be great to be able to change number of columns dynamically in the UISplitViewController. Some main screen of the app the benefit double column layout while other work great in the triple column. \r\n\r\nWe are currently swapping two SVC instances dynamically to support this behaviour which can be very error prone. It would be great to have this be available for the app developers natively."
