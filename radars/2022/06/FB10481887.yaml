    description: "- Please describe the issue:\r\n\r\nWhen I put a price for introductory offer with \"Pay as you go\" type, Xcode automatically inserts comma \",\" to the price for displayed value on UI. However, that results in saving presented value to `.storekit` file too. This will then cause StoreKit to fake \"SKProduct.introductoryPrice\" and that returns 'nil\". Looking at the `.storekit` file's JSON, '.[\"subscriptionGroups\"][0][\"subscriptions\"][0][\"introductoryOffer\"][\"displayPrice\"]' has the number with a comma inserted. If I remove the comma manually and then launch iOS simulator again, I can receive \"SKProduct.introductoryPrice\" correctly. This behaviour is actually different from the one for original subscription's price. The original price doesn't have comma inserted in \"displayPrice\". This behaviour has been happening on Xcode 13.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n0. Prepare an App that has auto-renew subscription in place and setup StoreKit configuration file for testing with the subscription\r\n1. Open the StoreKit configuration file, and choose \"Pay as you go\" at \"Offer Type\".\r\n2. Put a price more than 1000 that is supposed to have a comma for displayed value; ie \"1,000\"\r\n3. Save the change\r\n4. Check raw `.storekit` file with some text editor and there's a formatted number including a comma at '.[\"subscriptionGroups\"][0][\"subscriptions\"][0][\"introductoryOffer\"][\"displayPrice\"]'\r\n\r\n- What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nEither Xcode saves \"displayPrice\" without a comma and have \"SKProduct.introductoryPrice\" return some value or Xcode saves the formatted value as same as current but \"SKProduct.introductoryPrice\" just works as expected.\r\n\r\n- What actually happened?\r\n\r\nI can't get a value from \"SKProduct.introductoryPrice\" defined by a StoreKit configuration file."
