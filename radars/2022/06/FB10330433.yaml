    description: "My team is building a video game for iPadOS that features an in-game mouse cursor with custom artwork. In order to map the position of the iPadOS system cursor to the in-game mouse, we’re using UIPointerInteraction’s delegate for an interaction object applied to the full-screen game window.\r\n\r\nWhen using a trackpad with iPadOS, we’ve noticed a small visual glitch. When the user pans the cursor around with their finger on the trackpad, everything performs fine. However, if the user touches up from the track pad with enough velocity to trigger the cursor slowing down with its own inertia, a small glitch appears. For 1 frame, the cursor skips ahead to the projected resting place after the inertia ends, and then skips back to where  it originally was, where it will continue decelerating until it reaches that projected position.\r\n\r\nI’ve attached a sample app that reproduces the issue, and a slow-motion video of my iPad’s screen demonstrating the single-frame skipping.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run the sample app on an iPad that is paired to a trackpad, or is attached to a Magic Keyboard.\r\n2. Pan around with your finger remaining on the trackpad at all times. Observe the red circle matching your movements.\r\n3. Try “flicking” the cursor by very quickly swiping the trackpad and touching up from it while your finger is still moving.\r\n4. Observe that the red circle will briefly flash at the destination point before it snaps back to its original position and then animates to that destination.\r\n\r\nIf there is a way to detect this single frame as separate from the other updates so we can discard it, that would solve the problem perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"
