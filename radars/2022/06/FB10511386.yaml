    description: "## ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n- macOS 11.6.6 Big Sur\r\n- MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (Mid 2014)\r\n- NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2 GB\r\n- GraphicConverter 11.6.1 and newer\r\n\r\n\r\n## BUG\r\n\r\n- GraphicConverter: Pixels on canvas are misaligned https://www.lemkesoft.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6756\r\n  - Was detected in GraphicConverter 11.6.1 in 2022-04-07, an continues until the latest releases now in 2022-06\r\n  - According to the developer Thorsten Lemke: Zooming & panning on canvas uses standard Apple Quartz/Cocoa calls.\r\n\r\n- The bug reporter (me), the developer and volunteering community members tried all possible configurations:\r\n  - It always works fine on newer Macs.\r\n  - And it just never works on the affected Mac (see stated specs).\r\n\r\n- The developer has high certainty that this is a bug in the graphic drivers on macOS Big Sur for the given NVIDIA GPU series.\r\n  - I feel that not to hard to believe as I also reported FB9001334, which is very different in nature but also a severe GPU/compositing glitch for sure.\r\n  - Interestingly in Preview.app on the same machine zoom&pan has perfect alignment.\r\n\r\nI know my rMBP (Mid 2014) is a legacy machine meanwhile.\r\n- Please tell me upfront whether you have incentive to look into this at all.\r\n- or whether it is a known problem.\r\n- I appreciate every small reply that I get."
