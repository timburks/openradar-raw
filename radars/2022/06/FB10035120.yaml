    description: "Please describe the issue:\r\nI noticed that in Xcode, the SwiftUI preview canvas does not update when I change an Int range supplied to a ForEach. \r\n\r\nPlease list the steps you took to reproduce the issue:\r\nI previewed the code below in the SwiftUI canvas, then I changed the ForEach from 1..<12 to 1..<13\r\n\r\nimport SwiftUI\r\n\r\nstruct StackTestView: View {\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack(\r\n            alignment: .leading,\r\n            spacing: 10\r\n        ) {\r\n            ForEach(\r\n                1..<12\r\n            ) {\r\n                Text(\"Item \\($0)\")\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct StackTestView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\r\n    static var previews: some View {\r\n        StackTestView()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to happen?\r\n I've attached a screenshot in this state. I expected the preview to update, i.e. a 12th row should appear. The resume button when the preview can't be dynamically updated didn't appear either.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happened?\r\nNothing"
