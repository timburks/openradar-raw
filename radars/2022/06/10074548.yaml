    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a device running iOS 16, users directly view the PSK for an MDM provided network. Please provide a key for the com.apple.wifi.managed profile domain to optionally disable PSK viewing for the network.\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\nIn some enterprise environments (especially in Education), Wi-Fi is provisioned for end users with a PSK instead of 802.1x workflows. While there historically are ways to export the passkey from macOS devices that can be limited through process monitoring, iOS devices have never had this issue until now. Allowing users to view the PSK allows them to share the PSK or place unauthorized devices onto the corporate or educational networks, which decreases network security. For environments where disclosing a PSK would be damaging AND moving to 802.1x authentication is unfeasible, it would be great to have a key that allows administrators to disable PSK viewing for a network that is installed/provided via MDM profile."
