    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Rapid Security Response is a welcome addition and should help us keep our fleets secure. Adding support for a method to enforce a short delay would allow enterprise administrators to perform minimal testing before patching the fleet, or to patch the fleet in chunks to measure impact.\r\n\r\nDetail:\r\nThe way we configure our software update deferral profiles is so that early adopters (“power users”) install immediately, followed by a second tier, and then out to the whole fleet. This staged approach allows us to identify bugs, incompatibilities, or other workflow issues before we have thousands of broken Macs. We accomplish this by setting different deferral times in days in our MDM and using a third-party app (“Nudge”) to prompt users with a GUI to go to system preferences and update.\r\n\r\nA solution for this could be implemented using the same way as the existing major and minor deferral systems, but with a key. In my mind, it would be useful to have the deferral measured in hours rather than in days, as we would not want to delay an urgent fix for nearly as long as a minor or major version."
