    description: "During process of archiving & exporting app using Xcode 13, new Xcode 13 feature \"Manage Version and Build Number\" causes that CFBundleShortVersionString value in frameworks that the app uses in Info.plist files is changed to the value of app's version. This makes some frameworks not usable as having correct value of CFBundleShortVersionString and other Info.plist values are often critical. \r\nDisabling \"Manage Version and Build Number\" feature solves this issue but framework creators cant force all their clients to do this in order to use their framework."
