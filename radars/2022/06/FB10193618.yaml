    description: "Issue: \r\n\r\nChanging the First day of week setting under Settings > General > Language & Region does not apply with an app restart. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Launch Calendar.app (or any other app using NSCalendar/Calendar in some way)\r\n- Open Settings.app and then navigate to General > Language & Region and change the First Day of Week setting (eg. from Sunday to Monday in the Indian region) \r\n- Open Calendar.app again\r\n- The UI isn’t updated to reflect the new setting \r\n\r\nAdditionally, `Calendar.current` and `Calendar.autoupdatingCurrent` don’t have the latest value on `.firstWeekday` either. The correct/latest values are only available after the app is quit and launched again. \r\n\r\nExpected: \r\n\r\n- The value on `Calendar.current.firstWeekday` should update as soon as possible to reflect the user selected value. \r\n- Provided a new notification to observe this change (or optionally post the `UIApplication.significantTimeChangeNotification` notification)"
