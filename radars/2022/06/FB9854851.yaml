    description: "Description\r\nRepeatedly checking if an `AnyClass` type is a certain type using the `is` operand or casting the type using `as?` causes an unexpected crash the Swift core. I've experienced the crash on Swift 5 and up but haven't tested on anything lower.\r\n\r\nReproducing crash\r\nYou can reproduce the crash by running the app within the attached xcode project provided.  The issue can also be reproduced in projects with a large number of registered classes. If you enumerate through all registered classes and check if those types are a certain type using `is` then the crash should happen.\r\n```\r\n#0\t0x000000018046afdc in ___forwarding___.cold.3 ()\r\n#1\t0x00000001803e5368 in ___forwarding___ ()\r\n#2\t0x00000001803e738c in _CF_forwarding_prep_0 ()\r\n#3\t0x000000018f5b2f98 in swift_dynamicCastObjCClassMetatype ()\r\n#4\t0x000000018f572408 in swift_dynamicCastMetatypeImpl(swift::TargetMetadata<swift::InProcess> const*, swift::TargetMetadata<swift::InProcess> const*) ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther reports of crash:\r\n- https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/72e9afa98f00c719b16c359d67d95366bad0a460/Sources/Quick/Configuration/QuickConfiguration.swift#L22-L48"
