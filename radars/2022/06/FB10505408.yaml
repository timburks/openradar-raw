    description: "When rendering a AVRoutePickerView, if the AirPlay target device requires a OTP code, the view below the routing modal gets incorrectly updated to make space for the keyboard. The view that gets incorrectly updated was written in SwiftUI and is being presented on a UIViewController inside a UITabBarController.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us the view shouldn't be updated, since the keyboard is not relevant to that view. \r\n\r\nPlease note the observed behavior on the attached video at around the 15 second mark. When the prompt with the text field is presented, iOS shows the keyboard to the user (not visible in the video), and the view below, with the lake and grass image, gets moved around to make space for the keyboard."
