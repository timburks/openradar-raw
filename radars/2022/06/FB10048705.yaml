    description: "Since early versions of iOS, the default behaviour for links inside a list view including UITableView, UICollectionView with the new list style APIs and a SwiftUI List, tapping a row would highlight the row before navigating and only unhighlight the row when navigating back - this provides a visual hint as to where you have just navigated back from. \r\n\r\nIn iOS 14b1, using tapping a NavigationLink inside the new NavigationStack does not exhibit this behaviour - the list row highlight is removed immediately on taping the row before the navigation transition begins. In fact, unless you tap and hold on the row momentarily you might not even see the row highlight at all, breaking a longstanding UI convention on iOS.\r\n\r\nNavigation links inside a NavigationView continue to exhibit the correct behaviour."
