    description: "What type of issue are you reporting?\r\nSuggestion\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nSystem Preferences\r\n\r\nWhich preference pane are you seeing issues with?\r\nPrivacy & Security\r\n\r\nDescription of issue and how to reproduce:\r\nPrivacy & Security settings in PPPC profiles do not appear in GUI, while user-enabled items do. This causes confusion to users and is difficult to verify expected settings are applied on Macs. Savvy admins could either view results of `defaults read /Library/Managed\\ Preferences/com.apple.TCC.configuration-profile-policy.plist` (shows a subset of TCC policy, requiring `sudo mcxrefresh -n SomeUser` to see other TCC policy) OR... admins could dump via `sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db .dump`. But TCC.db is now restricted from listing or viewing, so this makes it VERY difficult to verify PPPC policy settings are applied.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPrivacy & Security settings applied via PPPC config profile appear in System Preferences GUIâ€”either grayed-out or grouped in a way that shows being applied via MDM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPrivacy & Security settings applied via PPPC config profile do NOT appear at all in System Preferences GUI and instead require highly manual, inconsistent means of verifying settings in place. Even worse, if users see privacy prompt to allow an item, it appears in GUI and adds confusion and complexity in determining result of applied, duplicate settings."
