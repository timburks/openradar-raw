    description: "NSWindows lose focus/key on cross-screen fullscreen requests\r\nhttps://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/10797142\r\n\r\nhttps://crbug.com/1210548 uncovered unexpected NSWindow behavior when calling toggleFullscreen after animating a cross-screen setFrame; the NSWindow loses key if another application window is open that can become key. A variety of workarounds have been attempted with very limited success. See the Chromium issues <https://crbug.com/1210548> and <https://crbug.com/1338659>, and the attached minimal repro <fullscreen_swap.m> for additional details. See also this related feedback report: <https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/10796934>. Thanks! Mike <msw@google.com>"
