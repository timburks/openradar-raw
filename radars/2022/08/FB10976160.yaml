    description: "## The problem\r\nWhen an iPhone app asks for push notifications by system prompt, I believe it should be translated based on the device language. However, when it comes to an iOS simulator, it is always in English. \r\n\r\n## Procedures \r\n1. Run `xcrun simctl create 'iPhone 12' 'com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-12' 'com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-15-5'` \r\n2. Manually launch the simulator. \r\n3. Change the simulatorâ€™s language and locale to Japanese and Japan, respectively (manually by Settings.app) \r\n4. Install an arbitrary iPhone app which shows push notification system prompt (manually by dragging and dropping an AUT) \r\n5. Show a push notification system prompt \r\n\r\nThen I expected a Japanese system prompt, but an English one appeared \r\n\r\n## My environment\r\n- macOS: 12.4 \r\n- Xcode: 13.4.1 \r\n- xcrun: 61 \r\n- simctl: PROJECT:CoreSimulator-802.6.1 \r\n- iOS: 15.5 \r\n- device: iPhone 12 simulator"
