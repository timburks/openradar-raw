    description: "Summary: iTunes is unresponsive while playing or importing a dirty or damaged music CD. This can hang iTunes for several minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n  1. Attempt to play or import a scratched or dirty music CD in iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I expected a progress bar while the read was attempted, such as when an iPod is being synced. The user should still have access to other iTunes threads(at least menus) while the media read attempts are in progress. \r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes was unresponsive and displayed no status regarding trouble reading the CD. No access to iTunes functions, including menu items, was present. The read process could only be interrupted by forcibly quitting the iTunes process. \r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A."
