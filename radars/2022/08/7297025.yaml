    description: "* SUMMARY Spotlight sometimes does not register the first character or two of a query. The resulting query string(thus missing the first character) does not deliver any results. \r\n\r\n* STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n 1. Press <Apple>-Space to invoke spotlight query window.\r\n 2. Type a query for a known file, omitting the first letter(e.g. \"erminal\" for the Terminal app).\r\n 2. Browse to certain podcasts, such as WNYC's Radio Lab podcast, 3/25/08 episode \"War of the Worlds\"\r\n\r\n* EXPECTED RESULTS Spotlight would likely search for words beginning with the typed string, but after exhausting those options, it would look for partial matches. A query for \"erminal\" would first find \"erminal.pdf\" and then \"Terminal.app\"\r\n\r\n* ACTUAL RESULTS Spotlight reports \"No Results Found\"\r\n\r\n* REGRESSION N/A\r\n\r\n* NOTES See bug #7297055 for information about how spotlight is dropping inputted characters."
