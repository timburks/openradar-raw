    description: "# Summary\r\nWhen using a custom font and appearance proxy for UIBarButtonItems, Navigation Back Button Items (in both UIKit and SwiftUI) will only work if tapped near the front portion of the Back Button. Longer names have a more prominent issue target area. The issue exists at least on iOS 14 through iOS 16 Beta.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction Steps \r\n1. Have a UIKit or SwiftUI application that pushes views onto a Navigation stack. (Must show back button items for previous screens)\r\n2. In code, set `UIBarButtonItem.appearance().setTitleTextAttributes([.font: UIFont.custom], for: .normal)` where `UIFont.custom` is a custom loaded font. (In my attached example projects, this is loaded from a .tff file at app launch)\r\n3. Run the app and push a view onto the navigation stack. (Favor longer Navigation titles for the back button to show to observe the issue)\r\n4. Tap towards the end (right-side in left-to-right languages) of the navigation back button.\r\n5. Observe the text disappears, and the user isn’t brought back. The back arrow remains and can be used to navigate back.\r\n\r\n# Expectations\r\nEven with a custom font, I would expect the entire touch target to behave the same way and bring the user back.\r\n\r\n# Results Observed\r\nNavigation back button text disappears and doesn’t bring the user back when using a custom font for the back button."
