    description: "When multiple modals are presented, and then dismissed right before changing the root view controller, the new root view controller is shown in the wrong orientation.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (see attached project which reproduces the bug)\r\n1. Hold the phone in landscape for the following steps:\r\n2. Show a portrait root view controller (FirstViewController)\r\n3. Present a `fullScreen` modal portrait view controller (FirstModalViewController)\r\n4. Present a `overFullScreen` modal portrait view controller\r\n5. Dismiss the `overFullScreen` modal view controller and set portrait SecondViewController as root view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- SecondViewController is shown in portrait. (This is the case on iOS 15)\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n- SecondViewController is shown in landscape.\r\n\r\nRepro: https://github.com/russellporter/repro-ios-16-incorrect-orientation"
