    description: "Noticed this after the update to iOS 15.6.\r\nFirst I thought that the app or website at hand was implemented with bad usability.\r\nOnly to then realize that various apps and websites are affected, increasing the likelihood that this is maybe an iOS / Safari WebView bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Please investigate this\r\n\r\n- Where the bug manifests this is a serious usability issue.\r\n- When affected one doesn't realize that a field already has focus and is ready to receive input.\r\n- Feels disorienting. As if the app is in a broken/halted state.\r\n- Some users may give up.\r\n- Other users may try to tap the field and then type and then realize it receives input.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Noted the bug at these locations\r\n\r\n1) Austrian Railway app \"ÖBB\" when I proceeded to pay my train tickets via EPS (a payment system of Austrian banks, see www.psa.at/en/payment-services#epspayment) this opens a WebView: Subscriber-number on login screen plus later secTAN input lack the text input cursor.\r\n\r\n- Annotated screenshot series: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jhizwzxueq8u48i/AADOEWSoim41-UN1drbuSEAfa#EPS-input-fields-lack-cursor\r\n\r\n2) Austrian eGovernment app \"Digitales Amt\": The current authentication system handy-signatur.at will be replaced by oesterreich.gv.at/id-austria which is currently in its testing phase. During the first login in \"Digitales Amt\" you are guided through the conversion process from the current into the upcoming authentification system. This happens in a WebView. One step involves entering your passport number. This field also lacks an input cursor.\r\n\r\n - Annotated screenshot series: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n2jpfweoyhtwako/AACcyj2TAfcIHTQWzNkZZPtwa#Digitales-Amt-input-fields-lack-cursor\r\n\r\n\r\n## What do these two apps have in common?\r\n- Maybe the apps use a common framework (within or outside of iOS scope) and therefore show a similar defect?\r\n- I notice that both \"Digitales Amt\" and \"ÖBB\" are produced by government or government-close companies.\r\n- But on the other side EPS (electronic payment system) is produced by the Austrian banks, so no public sector involved there.\r\n- All of them are Austrian products. Maybe similar developing companies involved.\r\n- You should be able to inspect the commonalities of the involved products as they submitted their source code to you for AppStore publication.\r\n- And find out whether it is a bug in iOS / Safari WebView or in the products themselves."
