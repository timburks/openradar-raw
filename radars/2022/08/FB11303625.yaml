    description: "After waking my new MacBook Air from sleep it sometimes wrongfully shows the power button UI. The emphasis is on this not being always the case and thus not seeming to be intended behavior, the user experience is negatively impact by this popup UI being shown after waking.\r\n\r\nThis only happens during a specific timeframe after the display went to sleep and waking / unlocking the Mac by placing my finger on the TouchID sensor and clicking it. I was unable to trigger the same shutdown UI from the Menu bar. The shutdown UI shown shows options to restart, sleep, shutdown and to cancel. \r\n\r\nThis does not seem like intentional behaviour because:\r\n\r\n* It does not happen consistently, it seems to be related to the current sleep / wake state of the machine when being awoken / unlocked\r\n* It has never happened to me on my work M1 MacBook Pro \r\n* The same UI is also not shown when simply pressing the TouchID / power button (then the current user is logged out, no shutdown UI is being shown).\r\n\r\nI captured a sysdiagnose right after the UI was shown for further investigation. In the logs I can see a log entry `power button not handled yet, calling engagePowerButtonShutdownUIIfNeeded` which seems related. Please advise if further information is needed.\r\n\r\nPlease also see this MacRumors forum thread with others reporting the same issue starting with post #35 on page 2: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-m1-touch-id-wake-up-issue.2276820/page-2?post=29555181#post-29555181 \r\n\r\nOne of the posters recorded a video of the issue here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXwN3Wc6Z74"
