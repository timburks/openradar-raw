Start the engine\r\n\r\n5. Create reverb audio unit and attach to the engine\r\n\r\n6. Connect sampler to reverb\r\n\r\n7. Expected: Sampler is connected to reverb and existing chain remains the same\r\n\r\n8. Application crashes with \"required condition is false: mixingDest\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Matrix mixer is here as an example, but this crashes with custom audio unit too. Interestingly, it doesn't crash with multi channel mixer, which seems to have some extra knowledge about internal engine's splitter that causes problems for other audio units.\r\n\r\nExample code (attached here too): https://github.com/jcavar/examples/tree/master/CrashWhenConnectingToRawAudioUnit"
