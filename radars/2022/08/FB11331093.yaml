    description: 'Matrix mixer is a great audio unit. Unfortunately it is very difficult to set it up and quite undocumented. It would be great if it was exposed as AVAudioNode so that it can be used directly in AVAAudioEngine. Here is an example of how tricky is to set it up: https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit/blob/main/Sources/AudioKit/Nodes/Mixing/MatrixMixer.swift'
