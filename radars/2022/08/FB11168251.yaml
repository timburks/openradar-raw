    description: It would be great to be able to override the `Locale` object on the `SWAttributionView` with custom Locale objects with changed Language. It is very common for apps to provide and (additional/separate) layer of Language settings logic. Apps often allow to change language directly from the app. We should be able to set a custom locale object on the `SWAttributionView` (just like they are able to override the Locale on the formatters) in the same fashion as overriding the user interface style of this view with `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` property. Having this available for the developers will definitely improve the Shared with You experience for users.
