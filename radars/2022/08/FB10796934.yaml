    description: "NSWindow cross-screen setFrame + toggleFullScreen causes lingering window resizes\r\nhttps://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/10796934\r\n\r\nhttps://crbug.com/1338664 uncovered unexpected NSWindow behavior when calling toggleFullscreen after animating a cross-screen setFrame with a different size. After exiting fullscreen, the window exhibits persistent errant resizes on subsequent interactive drag and drops (or \"Move to <Display>\") to move the window between screens. See the Chromium issue <https://crbug.com/1338664> and the attached minimal repro <fullscreen_swap.m> for additional details. Thanks! Mike <msw@google.com>"
