    description: According to a WWDC22 video (Add Shared with You to your app @ 17:12), `supplementaryMenu` on `SWAttributionView` should be used to supply our own context menus on views that enclose the content with attribution view, to feed the menu with the "reply" and "remove" actions supplied by the system. This is not a correct way to do it. To achieve the desired result that the Video tries to achieve, you need to use the `highlightMenu` instead of `supplementaryMenu`. The sample code from the session should be updated, and maybe the Video as well.
