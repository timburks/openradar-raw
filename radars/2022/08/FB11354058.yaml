    description: "When a newly instantiated UIHostingController is animated as part of a UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning within a UINavigationController that has a call to view.layoutIfNeeded() on the UIHostingController's view, SwiftUI gestures strop being processed, resulting in an unresponsive application. \r\n\r\nNotably, gestures for embedded UIKit UIViews are still processed correctly; the only gestures that break are those implemented in SwiftUI, e.g. the tap gesture of a Button. There is an attached project that minimally reproduces this issue. \r\n\r\nThis issue reproduces on iOS 15 and iOS 16 Beta 6.\r\n\r\nFrom poking around under the hood, it appears that when this occurs the `SwiftUI.EventBindingManager` never goes into the `isActive = true` state when the touches begin, and the `SwiftUI.UIKitGestureRecognizer` does not transition to the `ended` state on `UIGestureRecognizer.touchesEnded(â€¦)`. A mitigation for this behavior is removing and re-adding the UIHostingController's view to the view hierarchy."
