    description: "Using the SwiftUI Lifecycle with a TabView causes navigation issues.\r\n\r\nThe example project attached shows you can swipe between tabs containing ContentView's, but when you click on the NavigationLink within the ContentView, the EditView opens then immediately navigates back.\r\n\r\nWith WatchOS 8.0 on both physical devices and the simulator this does not happen, the EditView remains active until you navigate back which is the expected behavior."
