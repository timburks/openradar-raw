This was happening on Catalina so I upgraded thinking that Monterey would resolve the issue, but it didn’t. I've also tested this on 4 other LG Smart Tvs and it keeps happening. I’m still having the same problem. I’ve tried doing a SMC reset and unplugging the HDMI cable and plugging it back in but still no response. I've done safe mode with a test account but it still happens. I have to hold the power button and completely shut down and turn it back on to get it working again. Please see that this gets resolved. Thanks."
