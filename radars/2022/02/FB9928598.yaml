    description: "Hi, I have an app that allows deletion of photos. It uses `photoLibraryDidChange(_ changeInstance: PHChange)` to be notified of changes to the asset collection after deletion has occurred, as documented here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phphotolibrarychangeobserver?changes=l_2\r\n\r\nMy app has been around for a few years now. I have noticed an issue on iOS 14 and iOS 15, but still works on iOS 12.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the response in fetchResultAfterChanges no longer includes deleted objects.\r\n\r\nConsidering a photo asset collection of 4 photos, and 1 is deleted.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 12, after deleting, the change details has 3 photos in the fetchResultAfterChanges and 1 item in the removedObjects.\r\nIn iOS 14 and 15, after deleting, the change details has 4 photos in the fetchResultAfterChanges and 0 items in the removedObjects."
