Install the watch-only watchapp from iOS by clicking Install in app store\r\n2. Remove the app from watch (or get a new watch)\r\n3. Find the app again in the iOS app store (eg. with link: https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1501958576 )\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThere should be an Install button again, which will re-install the app\r\n\r\nActual result\r\nThere is a *disabled* PURCHASE button which confuses a lot of users of my app:\r\n- the button is disabled, so they are confused and think that the app was pulled from app store or is for some reason unavailable\r\n- users cannot reinstall the app in a way they know to work with iOS apps\r\n- it says “purchased” even though they didn’t purchase anything inside the app"
