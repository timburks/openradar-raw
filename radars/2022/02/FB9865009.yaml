    description: "support docs: Incorrect info on \"Revive or restore a Mac with Apple silicon using Apple Configurator 2\" web page\r\nFB9865009 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nsupport docs: Incorrect info on \"Revive or restore a Mac with Apple silicon using Apple Configurator 2\" web page\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nSomething else not on this list\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.2 (21D49) but really https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-apdd5f3c75ad/mac\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n2:26pm EST 1/29/2022\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nApple’s support documentation for “Revive or restore a Mac with Apple silicon using Apple Configurator 2” has incorrect information.\r\nURL: https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-apdd5f3c75ad/mac\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n(1) The “Before you begin” section states “A supported USB-C to USB-C charge cable, such as the one sold by Apple” is required.\r\nIt then links to https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF72AM/A/usb-c-charge-cable-1-m which no longer exists, producing “Looking for something? We thought so. However, the product you're looking for is no longer available on apple.com.”\r\n\r\nIt appears the MUF72AM has been replaced with the MM093AM and so the URL should be updated to https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM093AM/A/usb-c-charge-cable-1-m\r\n\r\n(2) The “Before you begin” section states that “The USB-C cable must support both power and data. Thunderbolt 3 cables aren’t supported.”\r\nI do not understand this statement and it appears to be incorrect.\r\nThunderbolt3 cables are cables that have USB-C connectors on the end and support both power and data.\r\nI attempted to do the firmware recovery/download procedure using a a MQ4H2AM Apple “Thunderbolt 3 (USB‑C) Cable (0.8 m).”\r\nIt worked just fine. This was between two 2021 14” MacBook Pros (A2442 MacBookPro18,4).\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not tested every possible combination of the six machines that these instructions apply to, I think they are generally similar enough that if a Thunderbolt cable works in one situation, it should work for the others.\r\n\r\nI think these requirements are incorrect."
