    description: "UIWindow.screen is deprecated since iOS 13. In UIKit it is possible to get screen from window's scene(window.windowScene.screen). But there is no counterpart for CPTemplateApplicationScene, it's impossible to attribute screen to a CarPlay scene as screen property is not available there.\r\n\r\nThis is needed, e.g. to create a display link to the head unit's screen.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is, of course, to keep using UIWindow.screen despite it being deprecated."
