    description: "Migration Assistant can hang interminably when a Thunderbolt cable is plugged in mid-way.\r\nFB9864975 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMigration Assistant can hang interminably when a Thunderbolt cable is plugged in mid-way.\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nApplication Slow/Unresponsive\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nMigration during installation\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.1\r\n\r\nWhat were you migrating from?\r\nAnother macOS installation\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n3:00pm EST 01/26/2022\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nMigration Assistant can hang interminably when a Thunderbolt cable is plugged in mid-way.\r\n\r\nI attempted to migrate data between two A2442 MacBookPro18,4 (14” MacBook Pro 2021) machines. The source machine was running 12.1 and the destination machine was running 12.2.\r\n\r\n1. Connect the two machines via Ethernet.\r\nOn the source machine, I had an Apple Thunderbolt2 Gigabit Ethernet adapter plugged in to a TB2/TB3 bridge.\r\nOn the destination machine, I had a Anker A8313 USB-C Gigabit Ethernet adapter\r\nBetween them was a 4’ ethernet cable.\r\n2. Start Migration Assistant on the source machine.\r\n3. Start Migration Assistant on the destination machine.\r\n4. After a few hours of data transfer, Migration Assistant’s estimate says many hours are left.\r\n5. Migration Assistant regularly displays, “Connecting a Thunderbolt cable may transfer data faster.”\r\n6. I went to the Apple Store and purchased a brand new 0.8m Apple Thunderbolt3 cable.\r\n7. I plugged in the Thunderbolt3 cable.\r\n\r\nMigration Assistant hung. The number of files stopped increasing and the time estimate did not update.\r\nIt appears the transfer has hung.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Plugging in a Thunderbolt cable in the middle of a migration is not reliable.\r\nUnfortunately, Apple’s text appears to recommend this (“Connecting a Thunderbolt cable may transfer data faster.”).\r\n\r\nTHEREFORE EITHER:\r\n(a) Migration Assistant should be robust to changes in Thunderbolt connectivity in the middle of a transfer. This is the preferred option.\r\n(b) Migration Assistant should change the wording of the recommendation to not suggest connecting a Thunderbolt cable during the transfer is OK. For example, “Thunderbolt may transfer data faster. Consider terminating the transfer, plugging in a thunderbolt cable, and restarting it.” This is not the preferred option.\r\n\r\nI recognize this is difficult to test and there is not a clear reproduction case. It all felt very janky and unreliable."
