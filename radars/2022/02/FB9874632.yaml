    description: "Hi I regularly share with friends something in a podcast episode and I currently do this sharing a link to the episode with the time stamp. I think it would be a great feature if I could send link that includes the timestamp so the person doesn't have to manually seek to the timestamp in my message.\r\n\r\nThis would also be useful for me so I can save links in Notes for interesting quotes I've heard in my podcasts and might like to refer to again when messaging, tweeting or writing blog posts.\r\n\r\nThanks."
