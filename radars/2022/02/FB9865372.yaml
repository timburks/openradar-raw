    description: "System Preferences purports to allow \"Target Disk Mode\" on Apple Silicon but it does not exist and does not work\r\nFB9865372 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nSystem Preferences purports to allow \"Target Disk Mode\" on Apple Silicon but it does not exist and does not work\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nSystem Preferences\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhich preference pane are you seeing issues with?\r\nStartup Disk\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nFor whatever reason, Apple has replaced “Target Disk Mode” with Recovery mode’s “Share Disk” on Apple Silicon. But System Preferences has not gotten the message and the results are confusing to users.\r\n\r\n- A clear description of the problem\r\n(See above)\r\n\r\n- A step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem (if possible)\r\n1. Open System Preferences\r\n2. Enter “Target Disk Mode” in the search box. Startup Disk highlights (this is a problem already), see screenshot 17:48:40.\r\n3. There is no option to select Target Disk Mode or even Share Disk. (see screenshot 17:48:53)\r\n4. Selecting “Restart…” again gives no such option (see screenshot 17:49:05).\r\n\r\n- What results you expected\r\nIdeally, Startup Disk should allow you to reboot in Recovery mode’s Share Disk.\r\nBut if not, it should give instructions on how to access Share Disk for people who are familiar with Target Disk Mode but don’t know how to further proceed.\r\n\r\n- What results you actually saw\r\nNone of the above. (see step-by-step)\r\n\r\nIf nothing better can be done, at least searching for “Target Disk Mode” should not return Startup Disk on Apple Silicon machines, as they do not support Target Disk Mode.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\nSystem_Profile_full.spx\r\nScreen Shot 2022-01-29 at 17.48.53.png\r\nScreen Shot 2022-01-29 at 17.49.05.png\r\nsysdiagnose_2022.01.29_17-49-30-0500_macOS_MacBookPro18-4_21D49.tar.gz\r\nScreen Shot 2022-01-29 at 17.48.40.png"
