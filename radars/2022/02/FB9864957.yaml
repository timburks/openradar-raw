    description: "Migration Assistant misidentifies Thunderbolt as Ethernet and does not achieve Thunderbolt speeds\r\nFB9864957 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMigration Assistant misidentifies Thunderbolt as Ethernet and does not achieve Thunderbolt speeds\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nMigration during installation\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.2 (21D49) \r\n\r\nWhat were you migrating from?\r\nAnother macOS installation\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n11:02pm EST 1/27/2022 \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nMigration Assistant misidentifies Thunderbolt as Ethernet and does not achieve Thunderbolt speeds.\r\n\r\nI attempted to migrate data between two A2442 MacBookPro18,4 (14” MacBook Pro 2021) machines both running 12.2.\r\n\r\n1. Connect both machines with a brand new Apple Thunderbolt3 0.8m cable.\r\n2. Boot the source machine and run Migration Assistant\r\n3. Boot the destination machine and run Migration Assistant\r\n4. Begin the transfer.\r\n\r\nproblems:\r\n(a) Migration assistant says “Current connection: Ethernet”. The connection is thunderbolt and there is no ethernet interface or adapter plugged in to either machine. \r\n(b) The reported connection speeds are low, ranging from 20-40 MB/s. With Thunderbolt, they should be 400 MB/s, that’s 10 to 20 times faster.\r\n(c) MA reports “Connecting a Thunderbolt cable may transfer data faster.” But a Thunderbolt cable is already connected, so it is obviously confused.\r\n\r\nSee screenshot.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\n20220128_015644 tb-as-ethernet.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1/29/22, 20:34:11  EST\r\n\r\nI attempted to replicate these steps to provide some screenshots, and instead I encountered FB9865600 where Ethernet.\r\n\r\nBut I was able to obtain screenshots of MA labelling Thunderbolt as both “Ethernet > Unknown” and “Ethernet > Ethernet”, even though there is no Ethernet. Attached here.\r\n\r\n20220129_192240 p2p connection details.jpg"
