    description: "Migration Assistant prefers Peer-to-Peer over Thunderbolt\r\nFB9865600 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMigration Assistant prefers Peer-to-Peer over Thunderbolt\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nMigration during installation\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.2 (21D49) \r\n\r\nWhat were you migrating from?\r\nAnother macOS installation\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n7:20 pm EST 01/29/2022\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nMigration Assistant prefers Peer-to-Peer over Thunderbolt\r\n\r\nThis is similar to FB9864957, but slightly different. I was attempting to replicate my problem in that bug and get some screenshots, and instead *this* happened.\r\n\r\nI attempted to migrate data between two A2442 MacBookPro18,4 (14” MacBook Pro 2021) machines both running 12.2.\r\nThey are connected with a newly purchased (Wednesday) Apple Thunderbolt3 cable, 0.8m length.\r\nI have verified that the two machines can communicate via Thunderbolt through Recovery > Share Disk, although that is not being used here.\r\n\r\n- A clear description of the problem\r\n\r\nWhen two machines are connected via Thunderbolt, Migration Assistant can activate Wifi (even if it is disabled) and initiate a peer-to-peer wireless connection between the two machines, and use that instead of Thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n- A step-by-step set of instructions to reproduce the problem (if possible)\r\n\r\n0. Connect both machines via the Thunderbolt cable. Confirm the thunderbolt connection works by temporarily booting the destination machine to Recovery> Share Disk and connecting to it from the Finder on the source machine. Having done so, reboot the destination machine into the setup process and begin the MacOS setup. \r\n1. Start Migration Assistant (MA) on the source machine, and continue through the setup process on the destination machine to get to Migration Assistant.\r\n2. Begin the migration.\r\n3. Observe that MA has selected “Peer-to-Peer” (wifi) and not Thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n- What results you expected\r\nMA should have selected Thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n- What results you actually saw\r\nMA selected Peer-to-Peer wifi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles\r\n20220129_192240 p2p connection details.jpg"
