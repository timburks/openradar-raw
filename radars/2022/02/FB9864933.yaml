    description: "Migration Assistant does not reject Share Disk thunderbolt connections.\r\nFB9864933 â€” macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMigration Assistant does not reject Share Disk thunderbolt connections.\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nMigration during installation\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.2 (21D49)\r\n\r\nWhat were you migrating from?\r\nAnother macOS installation\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n11:02pm EST 1/27/2022\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nAt present, Migration Assistant does not support migrating over Thunderbolt via \"Share Disk,\" the Apple Silicon equivalent of \"Target Disk Mode.\" See FB9864910.\r\n\r\nIf it is not supported, and until it is supported, Migration Assistant needs to detect this condition and inform the user that it is not supported, rather than displaying \"Looking for sources...\" and suggesting the user should wait.\r\n\r\n1. Connect two 14\" Macbook Pro machines via a 0.8m Thunderbolt cable.\r\n2. Boot the source machine into Recovery Mode (holding down power button at startup)\r\n3. Select Utilities > Share Disk, Unlock the Disk if necessary, and Start Sharing\r\n4. Boot the destination machine and begin Migration Assistant\r\n5. It displays \"Looking for sources...\" forever and never reports this is an unsupported configuration.\r\n\r\nIf the second machine is booted into the Finder, the shared disk is available via afp over Thunderbolt as described in https://support.apple.com/en-sa/guide/mac-help/mchlb37e8ca7/mac."
