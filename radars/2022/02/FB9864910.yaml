    description: "Migration Assistant does not support Share Disk thunderbolt connections\r\nFB9864910 — macOS\r\n\r\nBasic Information\r\n\r\nPlease provide a descriptive title for your feedback:\r\nMigration Assistant does not support Share Disk thunderbolt connections\r\n\r\nWhich area are you seeing an issue with?\r\nInstallation/Setup/Migration/Recovery\r\n\r\nWhat type of issue are you reporting?\r\nIncorrect/Unexpected Behavior\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nWhat does the installation/setup/migration/recovery issue you are seeing involve?\r\nMigration during installation\r\n\r\nWhat build of macOS were you upgrading from?\r\nmacOS 12.2 (21D49)\r\n\r\nWhat were you migrating from?\r\nAnother macOS installation\r\n\r\nWhat time was it when this last occurred? (Example: 12:00 pm EST 02/14/2018)\r\n11:02pm EST 1/27/2022\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nPlease describe the issue and what steps we can take to reproduce it:\r\nMigration Assistant does not appear to support “Share Disk,” the Apple Silicon equivalent of “Target Disk Mode.”\r\nI attempted to migrate data between two A2442 MacBookPro18,4 (14” MacBook Pro 2021) machines both running 12.2.\r\n\r\nWith the source machine in Share Disk mode (Boot to recovery, Utilities > Share Disk), the two machines connected by a brand new 0.8m Apple Thunderbolt3 cable, the destination machine running Migration Assistant reports “Looking for sources…” forever.\r\nFrom the Finder on the destination machine, I can Browse Network (as explained in https://support.apple.com/en-sa/guide/mac-help/mchlb37e8ca7/mac) and connect to the source machine, so I know the Thunderbolt connection is working.\r\n\r\nBecause Migration Assistant directs users to plug in a Thunderbolt Cable to speed transfers, this mode of connection should work.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\nsysdiagnose_2022.01.29_13-24-16-0500_macOS_MacBookPro18-4_21D49.tar.gz\r\nSystem_Profile_full.spx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1/29/22, 20:25:04  EST\r\nHere’s a screenshot of the “Looking for other sources…” screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20220129_192705 looking for other.jpg"
