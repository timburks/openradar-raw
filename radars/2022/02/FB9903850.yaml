    description: "Till now macOS only supports Dachen (com.apple.keylayout.ZhuyinBopomofo) and Eten Traditional (com.apple.keylayout.ZhuyinEten) dynamic keyboard layouts for Zhuyin IME. These layouts can also be utilized by non-Apple Input Methods as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't find an article teaching how to utilize a dynamic keyboard layout introduced by the developer himself / herself. I am currently maintaining an open-source zhuyin input method project (which can do a lot of things that macOS built-in Zhuyin cannot do) which can utilize Apple Dachen and Eten Traditional dynamic keyboards. I want to find a way to support IBM Zhuyin, MiTAC, and JINYEI dynamic keyboards as well (see attachment).\r\n\r\nThis report is to suggest Apple to add support for these three new keyboard layouts. If you Apple has no plan to introduce that, could you please share me some details about how to ship a keyLayout file and use it in a Cocoa App?\r\n\r\nP.S.: I recreated the Zhuyin Eten layout since the current one doesn't have a good fame with JIS keyboards, according to my Google-searched results."
