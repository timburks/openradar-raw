    description: "PNG 8 (such as 256-color palette) images are significantly brighter and washed out in QuickLook preview and Preview.app's main window than in thumbnails in Preview.app's sidebar, Finder icons, Safari, Photoshop and other applications.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if gamma correction/color profile has been applied twice to the image (perhaps once to the palette and second time to remapped pixels?)\r\n\r\nThis is regression from Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen http://i.imgur.com/KpGIQ7g.png in Preview.app or QuickLook\r\nCompare with 24-bit version of the image: http://i.imgur.com/TWYciB0.png\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth images are expected to look the same. Paletted PNG is expected to be displayed as sRGB gamma 2.2 image (http://i.imgur.com/KpGIQ7g.png) and look the same as 24-bit version (http://i.imgur.com/TWYciB0.png)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBrightness of PNG8 images is clearly inconsistent: http://i.imgur.com/wRI04ij.jpg"
