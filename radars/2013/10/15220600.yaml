    description: "Summary:\r\nUser is unable to access the Exchange Global Address List from the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController.\r\n\r\nOn attempting to view EGAL contacts, navigation controller contains an empty table view with search field. But searching does not return any results, as it does when using iOS 6.\r\n\r\nHowever, the activity indicator in the status bar (next to the wi-fi signal icon) does show that the device is doing something. But this is seemingly never-ending.\r\n\r\nAs well as not being able to browse or search contacts from the Exchange GAL, after attempting a search, the \"Done\" button has disappeared from the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController popover. Tapping outside of the popover does not close it, which means the user is stuck in that view. (They can get around this by tapping Exchange Global Address List again, and then they are able to tap out of the popover to dismiss it.)\r\n\r\nThis whole process seems very unstable. Running exactly the same app on another device running iOS 6, everything works as expected - the user can search for contacts from their Exchange GAL.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open \"Settings\" app on the device and go to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\r\n2. Add an \"Exchange\" account.\r\n3. Create an iOS app with an ABPeoplePickerNavigationController view\r\n4. Launch the app on a device that has linked to it \"Exchange\" account contacts\r\n5. Open the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController popover and tap the \"Groups\" button\r\n6. Tap \"Exchange Global Address List\"\r\n7. Table is empty\r\n8. Enter a \"Search\" query\r\n9. No results are returned and activity indicator in status bar never stops\r\n10. Tap \"Cancel\" to cancel the search, which takes the user back to the start screen of the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController, with no \"Done\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the user to be able to enter a search query in the Exchange Global Address List \"group\" and have returned a list of matching contacts to pick from.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch returns no results, but it does not say \"No Results\" as it would ordinarily. Instead, the activity indicator in the status bar just keep spinning\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nfirst noticed in iOS 7, still an issue in iOS 7.0.2"
