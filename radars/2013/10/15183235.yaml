    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPicture an RSS reader, podcast client, or Twitter app that needs to mark large numbers of objects as read all at once. (The Google Reader API, for instance, used to return a set of 10,000 article IDs to mark as read.)\r\n\r\nRight now it's necessary to fetch each object, flip the read bit to YES, and save.\r\n\r\nBetter would be to not have to fetch each object.\r\n\r\nI'd like to write code something like this:\r\n\r\n[managedObjectContext updateProperties:@{@\"read\" : @YES} forObjectsMatchingPredicate:predicate entityName:@\"Articles\"];"
