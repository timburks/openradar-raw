        Summary:
        Xcode complains that « Segues initiated directly from view controllers must have an identifier […] », yet it makes if very hard to find which one exactly is the culprit.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have a well furnished storyboard, with a lot of segues, including one segue going from a view controller to another.
        2. Open the Issue Navigator, releaving the issue ("Segues initiated directly from view controllers must have an identifier for use with -[UIViewController performSegueWithIdentifier:sender:]")
        3. Double-click on the issue and wonder which one of the tens of segues is at fault.


        Expected Results:
        Clicking on the warning triangle next to the issue should open the .storyboard file, select the segue at fault and open its Utilities pane under the Attributes inspector.
