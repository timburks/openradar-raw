    description: "Summary:\r\nI've received many crash reports from users of our apps pointing to a SIGABRT crash in TextKit. It is an NSArray out of bounds exception in the method doURLificationOnDocument in the class DDTextKitOperation where it tries to add an attribute to an NSAttributedString. I suspect this happens in some cases when UITextView tries to detect URLs in a UITextView using data detectors and gets the substring range wrong.\r\n\r\nI have seen very strange behavior on iOS 7 with UITextView not adding the highlight attribute the right character ranges for URLs/phone numbers, so this might be related. I've attached a video of this behavior, along with the crash report.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNot reproducible, only reported through customer crash reports. Please find the crash report attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUITextView should handle the text ranges properly and not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUITextView causes the app to crash.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nWe have seen these crash reports from all types of devices capable of running iOS 6 and above, including iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad (3rd gen) etc."
