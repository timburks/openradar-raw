    description: "Summary:\r\nApps often include a \"Review this App\" button in their interface. If the user wants to rate or review the app, they click the button.\r\n\r\nStoreKit allows the developer to display the App Store inside their app. This is a perfect use for the \"Review this App\" function; the user clicks the button inside the app, the app displays the app's page in the App Store via StoreKit, and the user is able to write a review via the \"Write a Review\" button in the app store.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in iOS 7 the \"Write a Review\" button is disabled when the App Store is presented using StoreKit.\r\n\r\nAlternately, the app can present the App Store by opining a special url: @\"itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/%@/app/id%@\". In this case, \"Write a Review\" is *not* disabled. Disabling \"Write a Review\" in StoreKit will force developers to use the URL method to open the App Store.\r\n\r\nDisabling \"Write a Review\" removes a major utility from the StoreKit-presented App Store.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Programmatically open the App Store via StoreKit's `SKStoreProductViewController`.\r\n2. Tap the \"Reviews\" tab.\r\n3. Attempt to tap \"Write a Review\"\r\n4. Notice that \"Write a Review\" is grayed out and disabled (see attached image).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n - \"Write a Review\" should *not* be grayed out or disabled.\r\n - User is able to review the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n - \"Write a Review\" is grayed out and disabled (see attached image).\r\n - User cannot rate the app.\r\n - App developer will choose to open the App Store via the \"itms-apps://\" URL method, rather than StoreKit.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2 \r\n\"Write a Review\" was enabled in iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'AppStoreViaStoreKit.png' and 'AppStoreViaURL.png' were successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nApp Store opened via URL: \"Write a Review\" is enabled\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hdhnEIU.png\r\n\r\nApp Store opened via StoreKit: \"Write a Review\" is disabled\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1ukynJH.png"
