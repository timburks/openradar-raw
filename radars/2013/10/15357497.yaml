    description: "Description:\r\nIf you’re searching for a buddy and there are no results, and then that buddy comes online, the “No Results” text wills tay in the buddy list.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages.app.\r\n2. Make sure Show Offline Buddies is disabled.\r\n3. Get a friend to sign off. It should be a friend with a unique name among all your other buddies (this won’t work if you have two people named Dave and only one of them is online).\r\n4. Use Command-F to bring up the Search field in the Messages buddy list (not the combined chats and current chat window).\r\n5. Type some text that would make that buddy appear in the list if they were online. You should see no buddies, and “No Results” appears overlaid on the window.\r\n6. Ask that buddy to sign on.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe “No Results” text disappears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe “No Results” text stays there, so that when the buddy appears, it is partly covered by the text. You can use the keyboard to select the buddy, but you can’t click through the “No Results” text."
