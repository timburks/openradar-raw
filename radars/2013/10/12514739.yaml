    description: "W Lewis\r\n\r\nGetMacOSStatusCommentString and GetMacOSStatusErrorString are deprecated without an apparent replacement.\r\n\r\nIt is undesirable to present errors to the user as cryptic numeric codes, and these functions produce strings which are at least minimally informative. However, they were deprecated in 10.8.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations 13-Feb-2013 01:42 PM\r\n\r\nThank you for filing this bug report.\r\n\r\nWe are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue, and they have determined that the issue behaves as intended."
