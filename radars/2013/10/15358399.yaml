    description: "Summary:\r\nReading the intrinsicContentSize property of a UISegmentedControl causes that control to resize visually even if that control has a layout constraint that forces the height to be greater than the intrinsic content size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a UISegmentedControl as a subview.\r\n2. Add an NSLayoutConstraint that pins its height to 60 points.\r\n3. Call intrinsicContentSize\r\n4. The returned size is smaller than 60 points high (this is expected, because the intrinsic content is smaller)\r\n5. The on screen size of the control (and frame property of the UIView) will have changed (this is unexpected).\r\n\r\nIf you then call setNeedsLayout on the superview of the UISegmentedControl the UISegmentedControl will return to the size specified by its height constraint.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample app shows this bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the layout size of the UISegmentedControl is not changed by the read only intrinsicContentSize property.  This method should have no side effects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layout and frame of the UISegmentedControl changes when reading intrinsicContentSize.  This behaviour seems to be in both iOS 6.x and 7.x.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.2/11A501\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Test3.zip' was successfully uploaded."
