    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UINavigationController does not implement childViewControllerForStatusBarStyle to return the topmost view controller in its stack. \r\n\r\nWhen using \"View controller-based status bar appearance\" with a UINavigationController none of the UINavigationController's viewControllers will get the -preferredStatusBarStyle method called. \r\n\r\nThis renders the view controller based status bar appearance pretty useless when using a UINavigationController, and can be fixed by subclassing UINavigationController or creating a custom container view controller but this is an annoyance and does not seem like it should be necessary just to get the preference to be observed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS project with the empty template in Xcode\r\n2. Set UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance to YES in the applications' info.plist\r\n3. Create a UIViewController subclass with an implementation for -preferredStatusBarStyle\r\n4. In the app delegate create a UINavigationController with the UIViewController subclass as its rootViewController\r\n5. Set the window's rootViewController to that UINavigationController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npreferredStatusBarStyle would be called on the UIViewController subclass and the status bar style would be updated to whatever the style returned in that method\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npreferredStatusBarStyle is never called on the UIViewController that is set as the rootViewController of the UINavigationController. Calling setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate also has no effect.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCreating a subclass of the UINavigationController and returning self.topViewController in childViewControllerForStatusBarStyle and childViewControllerForStatusBarHidden fixes this problem.\r\n\r\nSample Code: https://github.com/danielrhammond/Preferred-Status-Bar-Style-Navigation-Controller-Experiment\r\n\r\nWorkaround: https://gist.github.com/danielrhammond/6894539"
