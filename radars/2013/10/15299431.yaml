UIAppearance blocks setting the tintColor for anything, and because the MFMailComposeViewController is presented in a _UITextEffectsRemoteView there's no way to even iterate the view hierarchy and set it manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nClosed by Apple as \"Duplicate of 10535951\""
