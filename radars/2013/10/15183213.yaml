    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPicture an RSS reader, podcast client, or Twitter or ADN app. Those apps continually pull down more data -- and, as they do, they need to delete older data.\r\n\r\nOften they need to delete a *ton* of older data. And that deletion may be pretty simple: delete everything older than 31 days, for instance.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is a pain: it's necessary to fetch each object and delete it. That takes more time and uses more memory than a SQL call.\r\n\r\nBetter would be the ability to delete based on a predicate -- something like this:\r\n\r\n[managedObjectContext deleteObjectsMatchingPredicate:predicate entityName:entityName];"
