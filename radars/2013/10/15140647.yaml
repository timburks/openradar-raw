    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 7, CTFramesetter ignores paragraph spacing if the framesetter's path is more complex than a single rectangle. This is a regression from iOS 6. The bug manifests even if you compile for iOS 6 SDK and then run on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached Xcode project. The app should be run on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be two rectangles on the screen containing text, with text flowing from one to the other. There should be spaces between the paragraphs of text.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe two rectangles appear as desired, with text flowing between them. However, the paragraphs do not have spacing between them.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding a clipping path can also trigger this bug."
