    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new Apple Radar UI is a way better to the old one (even if with iOS7 now is already really dated and ugly). But in terms of UI/UX there is some pitfall that I can't understand.\r\nWhy there is a section Archive if anything ever goes inside it?\r\nAt first I expected that duplicate Bug Report goes on closed until the original one is marked open and the when even the original one is closed they all move to the Archive one but clearly that is not the case because in my Closed directory there are many report with the original stated as closed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a bug report.\r\n2. Try to put anything inside the Archive folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen a bug report is open for resolving it stay on the Open directory, if there is a duplicate it can be moved inside the Closed directory and finally when a bug report is closed by Apple or by the developer whom opens it, the original one and all the duplicates can be moved on the Archive folder.\r\nThe Hidden folder for me has no utility at all for its existence if not to put a flow for the developers to hide really old report that remains on the closed folder and in the counts in the Products category cluttering the report experience.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEverything goes inside the Open or Closed folder for the eternity.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
