    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Safari login dialog for HTTP basic access authentication has autocorrect enabled for the username field, which can lead to incorrectly entered usernames, particularly in cases where usernames are case-sensitive (i.e. 'Rob' instead of 'rob').\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to any page that requires HTTP based authentication (such as typically set by .htaccess files).\r\n2. Enter a username that would typically get autocorrected. Lowercase proper names seem to match this criteria often.\r\n3. Select the password field, either by clicking or with the tab key.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe username should match user input exactly, including capitalization.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe username gets autocorrected with capitalization or other adjustments, causing the login to fail if the user does not notice the change.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 7.0 (9537.71) on OS X 10.9 13A603"
