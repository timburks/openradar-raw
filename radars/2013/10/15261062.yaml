    description: "Summary:\r\nWith Xcode 4.x and the iOS SDK 6.0 the localization of the storyboards files its become a little better than before, now we can use strings file for every language different from the base one.\r\nBut there is another serious problem, the localized file is unreadable for a human, not predictable, and not updated with changes in the storyboard file.\r\n\r\nIf in an application we have different button with the same name, in the localized file is almost impossible to determine which label refer to which buttons, and worse the label have not a logic order but seems to me that are throw in the file with a perverse logic to complicate everything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNow that the storyboard files are been reworked from ground up in Xcode 5.0 its time to rethink even the localization of that files.\r\nThe comments now are useless, try to put some more insightful information, like the view controller or the window where is contained, the labels must be in a meaningful order, like in every label in a view must be grouped with all the others label inside that view, ditch completely the object id in the comments because if the file is compiled correctly that information is useless, substitute it maybe with the Xcode labels that a developer can put for every objects and push the use of them.\r\nAnd for god sakes make it auto updated, if I delete and object delete even the relative label, and if I'm adding a new one add it to the file as well.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe relative file auto generated is a nightmare, it can be put together to the PSD file format as the complexity of it."
