    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 6.1, neither overlapping overlay scroll bars nor a placeholder graphic (if overlay scroll bars are disabled) are displayed; instead a plain white rectangle appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, open a multipage PDF, such as http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/ipad_user_guide.pdf.\r\n2. Resize/zoom such that both horizontal and vertical scroll bars are displayed.\r\n3. Experiment with overlay scroll bars enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOverlay scroll bars overlap and extend to the bottom right corner of the view.\r\nNon-overlay scroll bars do not overlap but a placeholder graphic appears in the bottom right corner of the view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA plain white rectangle appears in the bottom right corner of the view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe expected results appear in Safari 6.0.\r\n\r\n-- (later feedback) --\r\n\r\nThis really looks like a bug (and yes, it does also affect web content which scrolls both horizontally and vertically); it makes Safari inconsistent with other applications on OS X.  Not drawing anything in the scroll corner looks unfinished.\r\n\r\nI've attached a PDF demonstrating exactly what I'm talking about.  If you're sure this is what you want, feel free to keep this bug closed.\r\n\r\n[PDF is available at http://sabi.net/temp/Safari%206.1%20scrolling.pdf]."
