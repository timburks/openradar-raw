    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter updating to Mavericks DP 7 I was asked to set up iCloud Keychain (again). After choosing a 4 number PIN code I was asked to provide a telephone number. Iceland isn't available as one of the options...\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to System Preferences -> iCoud\r\n2. Check Keychain, provide your password when asked\r\n3. Enter a 4 digit security code and repeat\r\n4. Try to select Iceland as a country\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIceland is a country with its own international phone number prefix (+354). It should quite obviously be in the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIceland isn't in the list.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks DP 7"
