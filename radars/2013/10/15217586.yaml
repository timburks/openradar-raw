    description: "In some cases, the code\r\nSKSpriteNode *sprite = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@\"img_name\"];\r\ndoes not find the image, if it is included in a texture atlas\r\n(the error in the log is \"SKTexture: Error loading image resource\").\r\nin such cases, if you add the row \r\nSKTextureAtlas * atlas = [SKTextureAtlas atlasNamed:@\"containg_atlas_name\"];\r\nabove the fore-mentioned code, the problem disappears.\r\nI was able to reproduce it many times (a sample project is attached).\r\nNot sure of the exact definition of the scenario that causes it."
