    description: "Summary:\r\nXCode 5.0 saves (possibly accidental) edits to a file even if it read-only, resetting the file protection without permission and with no indication it has done so.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen read-only file.  Type into read-only file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRespect file protection.  Either prevent edits or present warning message.  Silent corruption should be a configurable opt-IN alternative, not even opt-out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanges are saved to read-only file and permissions are silently changed.  There is no indication available in XCode that the file has been changed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode Version 5.0 (5A1413)\r\nOSX 10.8.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
