    description: When I'm crashing (e.g. http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5771770325893120) and then restarting, FCPX will load the project I had opened the last time I closed (without crashing) FCPX. Same goes with my screen setting (e.g. I had the Event View on the secondary display but when reopening it went on the main display again).
