        Summary:
        Command-backtick should work (to switch between windows) while dragging.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Make sure you're in an app that supports drag and drop, and has more than one window open
        2. Start dragging something
        3. Press command-backtick to switch windows

        Expected Results:
        The active window switches and you continue dragging.

        Actual Results:
        The window does not switch.

        Notes:
        Many other actions, such as expos√© or changing spaces, work while dragging, so it is natural to expect this one to do so as well.
