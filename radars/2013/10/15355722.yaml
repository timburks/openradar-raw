        Summary:
        The built-in weather app queries for my location in the background even when this is disabled, as can be seen on the privacy->location services screen indicated with a blue arrow.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Go to settings->general->background app refresh and disable Weather.
        2. Go to settings->Notification Center and disable the "today summary" which shows the weather on the Notification center.
        3. Make sure Weather.app is not in the task switcher.
        4. Slide down the notification center

        Expected Results:
        The arrow icon doesn't appear on the status bar, and going to the privacy screen where apps that use location are shown doesn't indicate that Weather queried your location.

        Actual Results:
        Going to the privacy screen where apps that use location are shown indicates that Weather queried your location.

        Regression:
        N/A
