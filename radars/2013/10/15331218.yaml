    description: "As iBooks doesn't feature a 'Get info' inspector, it's impossible to modify a book's metadata. It is a pain even for people buying their books w/ the iBookstore, as the author and categories infos aren't always coherent.\r\n\r\nPrior to iBooks, it was possible to modify a book's metadata via the iTunes 'Get info' inspector."
