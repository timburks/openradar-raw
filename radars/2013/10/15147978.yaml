    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, NSRuleEditor and NSPredicateEditor draw a grey background color and dark grey separator lines between their rows. I would like:\r\n\r\n1) Ideally, an override to do my own custom drawing in the row backgrounds, or the ability to provide rowViews to the NSRuleEditor (similarly to how we provide rowViews for NSTableView).\r\n\r\n2) If not 1, then the ability to simply STOP the NSRuleEditor from drawing any background at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A; see Description.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A; see Description\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A; see Description\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nAll versions of Mac OS X are affected.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached screenshot for an example of why I want to do this. The background of the NSPredicateEditor looks terrible in a customized UI. I want to turn it off and simply have the buttons, textfields and text sit on top of my custom background.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll configurations."
