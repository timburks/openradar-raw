    description: "Summary:\r\nUnfortunately an app of mine, Otto's Remote, was updated with a fatal flaw preventing it from working. On discovering the problem, I temporarily removed the app from sale by deselecting all territories in which to make the app available. \r\n\r\nTo help those who had already downloaded the broken update, I had thought I could use the \"Manage iCloud download settings for this app\" feature to disable downloading the broken version of the app. My hope was that this would allow users to download the previous version instead until a fix is released.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not appear to work as I expected. When looking for the app in the Purchased section of the app store app, it still shows the current, broken version. Attempting to download it results in an error message stating \"The item you tried to buy is no longer available.\" \r\n\r\nIt is possible that the changes require some time to propagate out to the App Store and this problem will resolve itself. However, it has been several hours since I made the change and it has not yet updated making me feel that slow propagation is not the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an App and place it for sale on the iOS App Store.\r\n2. Create an update for that app and release it through the App Store.\r\n3. In iTunes Connect, on the app's Rights and Pricing page, remove the app for sale by deselecting all territories to make the app available in and clicking Save.\r\n4. Wait for the app to no longer be available on the App Store.\r\n5. In iTunes Connect, under the app's Rights and Pricing page, click the link that reads \"Manage iCloud download settings for this app.\"\r\n6. A list of app versions should appear. Click the checkbox next to the most recent version.\r\n7. Click Save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsers who have already purchased the app should be able to download the most recent unchecked version of the app, in this case the initial release via the App Store app's Purchases page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App Store app only lists the current version of the app on the Purchases page. Attempts to download it fail with an error message.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 7, all devices.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
