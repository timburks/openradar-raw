    description: "OS will echo recorded audio when Airplay mirroring is turned on and using AVCaptureSession with the AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord category set. This only occurs on iOS 7 (through 7.0.2 so far) and not on iOS 6. I have only tested on an iPad, though I would expect this to also occur on an iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an application that records audio using the AVCaptureSession with the AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord category. Turn on Airplay mirroring and begin recording audio.\r\n\r\nTap the microphone and you will hear an audible echo from the speaker as the tap was echoed and then picked up by the microphone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be no sound output to the speaker.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe speaker echos the input to the microphone, despite no output audio routes configured."
