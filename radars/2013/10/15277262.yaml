        Summary:
        OS X 10.9 installer does NOT ask for FileVault2 passwort after restart

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Install OS X 10.9 13A603 (GM2) The installer does restart twice. Upon each restart EFI does NOT ask the user to enter the disk password to unlock the startup volume. The installer just continues the installation.

        Expected Results:
        When a computer with FileVault2 is restarted I _ABSOLUTELY_ expect to be asked to enter my disk encryption password EACH and EVERY time. That is the whole purpose of FDE!

        Actual Results:
        The OS X installer is able to fully restart the computer without the need for the user to enter the disk encryption password.
        Since this seems to be possible I've lost trust in FileVault2 where this security measure is obviously circumvented by the installer.

        Regression:
        This did not happen with OS X Mavericks Developer previews before 13A603 (GM2).
