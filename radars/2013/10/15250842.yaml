    description: "Summary:\r\nSummary: iPad unlock while running app with a UIWebView containing html text fields caused the keyboard to appear without resizing the full-screen UIWebView.  This caused it to be scrollable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run app with view containing a full-screen UIWebView which has two text fields on the html page displayed (in this case, a login page).  No keyboard displays as the fields have not been touched.\r\n2. Due to inactivity, the iPad times out.\r\n3. Unlock the iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same view of the html login page that is full-screen and unscrollable, without keyboard raised.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe same login page displays, however the keyboard is raise without any further user touches.  \r\nThe page, which normally resizes when the input field is touched and keyboard raise, does not resize to accommodate the unsolicited keyboard.\r\nPart of the page is now beneath the keyboard, and the page becomes scrollable.  \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Version : 7.0.2 (11A501)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPAD Version : iPad3-Retina\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'loginPageWKeyboard.png' and 'ScrolledLogin.png' were successfully uploaded."
