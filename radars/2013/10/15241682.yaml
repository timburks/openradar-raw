    description: "When one text field is rendered next to another (such as the State/Zip fields when editing a contact in the attached screenshot), the two borders overlap, making a noticeably darker border between them. Presumably they are alpha-blended together, making a darker line.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nOpen a contact. Edit it. Scroll down to the address section.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe vertical border between fields on the same line should be the same darkness as the vertical border on the left-hand side of fields.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe vertical border between fields on the same line is darker than the vertical border on the left-hand side of fields.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis has been tested on an iPhone 4S running iOS 7.\r\n\r\nVersion/Build:\r\niOS 7.0.2 build 11A501"
