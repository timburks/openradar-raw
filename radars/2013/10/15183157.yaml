    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere are APIs for calendar, reminders, and contacts -- but not for notes.\r\n\r\nThis would allow developers to create notes apps that sync together and sync with Apple's Notes app.\r\n\r\nIf developers adopted the API, then users could mix and match note-taking apps. They could use their favorite one for each device and not pay a penalty for switching."
