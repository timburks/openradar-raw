    description: "My iPhone is currently in a state in which automatic app updates are not being downloaded. iOS does know that updates are available; the app store icon is getting badged with a number that's ticking up each time a new app has an update available. Two apps (iMovie and Numbers) in the Pending Updates screen in the app store show a stop button, although no downloads are actually taking place. On Springboard, these app icons aren't showing the normal signs of an app being currently updated.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nUnsure; I've purposefully not altered any settings or manually applied any updates so I can keep my phone in this state. This is so I can help debug if you need more information.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApps are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps do not update, instead, the pending updates simply pile up over time, the app store badge increases its count, and the pending updates screen in the app store displays two stop buttons as though Pages and iMovie were being updated (even though they aren't)."
