    description: "Summary:\r\nThe version of Apache present in OS X Server 10.7 (Apache v2.2.22) through 10.8.5 (Apache v2.2.24) exhibits a bug when using name-based SSL virtual hosts and when multiple virtual hosts draw on the same password-protected wildcard SSL certificate.\r\n\r\nThis bug manifests in OS X Server 10.7 and 10.8 as an unusable \"Web Server\" configuration when adding multiple SSL virtual hosts on the same IP where all web hosts share a single wildcard SSL certificate.\r\n\r\nThe bug is known to the Apache developers, and has been fixed in post-2.2.x release, and also backported to 2.2.22. See: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31709\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet up a vanilla OS X 10.7/10.8 server. Obtain a wildcard SSL certificate, e.g. *.example.com. Create a virtual host bound to a specific IP address and using the wildcard SSL certificate, e.g. host1.example.com. Enable web service and verify functionality. Now add a second virtual host using the same wildcard SSL cert, e.g. \"host2.example.com\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVirtual hosts are separately accessible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWeb server crashes on launch with error in log:\r\nerror] Oops, no RSA or DSA server certificate found \r\nfor 'host2.example.com:0'?!\r\nServer then repeatedly attempts to restart. Web service is effectively lost.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe fact that no virtual host is (or indeed can be) bound to port 0 as displayed in the error message makes the error distinctive. The bug is in Apache's handling of password-protected SSL certs, as can be verified by removing the password on the wildcard cert.\r\n\r\nA fragile workaround is to disable ALL SSL certs on the server, add the required virtual hosts, then in the \"Machine\" portion of Server.app, manually select a certificate for each site, leaving the default virtual hosts SSL off. However, this workaround breaks under a number of circumstances, including any change in web config, and sometimes even after a reboot."
