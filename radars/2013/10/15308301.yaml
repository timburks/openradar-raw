    description: "Summary:\r\niCloud may be a nice thing, that is, if you are an American citizen or have zero interest in privacy of your data. As the current NSA scandal has shown, any data of all non-US citizen have absolutely no data or privacy protection in the USA. All the laws requiring sensible handling of the data apply to data of US citizen only. As such, using iCloud for any data you want to be secure and protected is not an option for non-US citizen (and I guess quite a lot of Apple's customers fall into that category)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Try to sync contacts/calendars w/o using iCloud\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is possible, like it used to always be possible it the past.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot possible any longer.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacOS 10.9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
