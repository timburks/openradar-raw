    description: "Summary:\r\nOur localization workflow is based on ibtool to localize XIBs. We used to have something like this in a build script:\r\n\r\ncd fr.lproj\r\nibtool --import-strings-file MainWindow.xib.strings --write MainWindow.xib /Users/joe/Product/en.lproj/Mainwindow.xib\r\n\r\nSince ibtool 5.0 this fails with \r\n\r\nThe stringsfile MainWindow.xib.strings does not appear to contain valid data for UTF-16 string encoding.\r\n\r\nThe error message is completely misleading. The problem is caused only by ibtool's broken interpretation of path names.\r\n\r\nProblems we discovered:\r\n- single quotes around file names aren't accepted\r\n- \"..\" in path names isn't accepted\r\n- for the \"--import-strings-file\" argument files without \"/\" (in the local directory) aren't accepted"
