    description: "I recently finished a 3-day restore from iCloud. It was incredibly frustrating, as there was no way to know exactly what was going on, whether the process was stuck, how much longer I would be waiting for it to finish, etc. I even called into Apple tech support to find out if there were any known issues with iCloud that would be delaying it, or how to know when it was done, as it was the longest iCloud restore I've ever waited through.\r\n\r\nThis is a horrible UX. There must be a way to show progress in the iCloud area when a restore is happening."
