    description: "When creating Bots that check out git repositories, if any submodules are in a detached HEAD state, checkouts will always fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Install Xcode 5.0 on your machine, and set up 10.9 Server on another with the Xcode service running.\r\n\r\n2. Open a project in Xcode that contains a git submodule checked out to an arbitrary commit, and is thus in a detached HEAD state.\r\n\r\n3. Create a Bot with this project and attempt to Integrate it.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode service on the server machine should check out the project and build it.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\n\r\nDuring the checkout process, checkout fails and the integration fails.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by ensuring that you always have the HEAD of a branch checked out in your submodules. However, having a detached HEAD in submodules is a very common case."
