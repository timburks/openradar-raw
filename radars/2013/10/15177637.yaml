    description: Control center is obviously a great way of turning off/on wifi/bluetooth, etc. It does not however handle changing wifi-networks, bluetooth networks, etc. So I'm proposing adding the ability to long-tap on the wifi and bluetooth. That way you can still turn them on and off easily but also get into the settings to actually switch networks just as quickly.
