    description: "Summary:\r\nI downloaded an app and removed it from device. Then the app got updated. After that I downloaded it from AppStore again but it is still the old version.\r\n\r\nIf this bug occurs, the AppStore will always return the old build when I re-download it. The bug persists even if I totally remove the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I delete the app from my device.\r\n2. The app got version update.\r\n3. Go to the store, install the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. It should download the most updated version.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. It downloaded an old version.\r\n2. Suppose I downloaded the old version. If I clicked the \"Open\" button in the AppStore, it prompted me again for the password. If I entered the password, it started app update.\r\n3. If I removed the app from the device and installed it again, it repeated step 2.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\non iOS 7 iPad\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
