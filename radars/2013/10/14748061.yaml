    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen returning from the full-page bookmarks display (Bookmarks > Show Bookmarks) to a PDF, loading progress is not displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari 6.1 (or 7.0), load http://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1595/en_US/ipad_user_guide.pdf\r\n2. Press Command-Option-B to display the bookmarks.\r\n3. Press Command-Option-B to return to the page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdeally, the bookmarks display would be treated as a transient activity and the PDF would remain cached, so it would display immediately after returning to the page. At the least, there'd be no regression and PDF loading progress would be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA gray view appears with no progress indication during PDF loading.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPDF loading progress appears in the address bar in this situation in Safari 6.0."
