        Summary:
        Using AirDrop in iOS 7 causes the completion handler to NOT be called.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a standard UIActivityViewController with a completion method that displays AirDrop in the icon selection. Run the app and select AirDrop. Either complete the share or cancel,

        Expected Results:
        The completion handler should be called if the user cancels or completes the AirDrop share.

        Actual Results:
        Completion handler is never called.

        Regression:
        Always

        Notes:
        Makes it impossible to do any post-share cleanup (such as re-enabling any UI that was disabled to prevent use via accidental user-interaction during share UI, etc)
