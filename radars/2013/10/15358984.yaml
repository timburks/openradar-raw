    description: "Summary:\r\nThe bug affects the animation when pushing or popping a navigation controller's stack inside a popover. It seems to occur when the navigation controller is not the top-level view controller presented by the popover controller. During the animation, the content from both levels is briefly displayed superimposed on top of each other.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the sample Xcode project at this URL\r\nhttps://github.com/rjsdev/PopoverNavigationBug/tree/bugDemo\r\n\r\n2. Build and run in the iPad iOS 7 simulator or an iPad device.\r\n\r\n3. Tap any of the \"Tap\" buttons to present the popover with the root view of the navigation controller displayed.\r\n\r\n4. Tap any table row in the popover to activate the transition to the second level of the navigation hierarchy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew content slides in, replacing old content and hiding it. A variant of the project showing the expected result is at:\r\nhttps://github.com/rjsdev/PopoverNavigationBug/tree/bugFree\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nContent of both levels of the hierarchy is superimposed during the transition.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two projects is that the navigation controller is presented directly in the popover in the bug-free version. In the bug demo, there is an extra intermediate view controller. I believe the view controller containment hierarchy is set up correctly in the bug demo, with the navigation controller added as the child of the intermediate view controller. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3 (11B508) on iPad Simulator\r\niOS 7.0.3 (11B511) on iPad mini model A1432 16GB\r\nXcode 5.0.1 (5A2053)\r\nOS X 10.8.5 (12F45)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug originally manifested in a project where the navigation controller's view does not occupy the whole popover, so omitting the intermediate view controller is not an acceptable workaround. The best workaround I can find for now is to disable navigation animations.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
