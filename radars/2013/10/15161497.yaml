    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever you attach events to a <textarea> for keydown & keyup, if arrows (up, down, left, right) are pressed within, the corresponding events aren't triggered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an HTML document with a <textarea>\r\n2. Add keydown event listeners and console.log() them or alert() them.\r\n3. If you press arrows with a bluetooth keyboard, those events aren't triggered.\r\n\r\n(I've included an HTML file as an attachment that has just this.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should trigger the events with the correct key codes."
