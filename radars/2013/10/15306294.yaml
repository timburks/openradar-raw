        Summary:
        If you select a segment of an iBook that ends in a quotation and share it on Facebook, the excerpt begins with a quotation mark, then ends with the closing quotation mark from the quotation, but also has a quotation mark at the beginning of the quotation, causing them to become unbalanced.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an iBook that contains a quotation surrounded by quotation marks.
        2. Select the text before the quotation and the quotation in its entirety, such as this passage:

        A report by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons concluded that distance running is “an outrageous threat to the integrity of the knee.”

        3. Select More -> Facebook to bring up a Facebook share sheet.

        Expected Results:
        The excerpt will be surrounded by quotation marks. The inner quotation marks will change to single quotes to signify that they’re a quotation within a quotation.

        Actual Results:
        This is the result from the above passage:

        “A report by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons concluded that distance running is “an outrageous threat to the integrity of the knee.”

        Excerpt From: Christopher McDougall. “Born to Run.” iBooks. https://itun.es/us/fDa9y.l

        As you can see, the quotation marks are unbalanced.

        Regression:
