    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the new multi-display feature in OS X 10.9, where each screen can have its own full screen app, if you have a full screen Safari window on one display, but the current active window is on another display, there is no visual indication that the Safari window is not active. This makes it difficult to tell where keyboard input will go, among other things.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Mission Control system preferences pane, enable the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" option.\r\n2. On a machine with two displays, open a Safari window, and make it full screen on display A.\r\n3. Open another Safari window, and put it on full screen mode on display B\r\n4. Hold down command-` for a couple seconds, to randomize which of the two full screen windows is active.\r\n5. Press command-w\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to tell from the visual state of the two windows which one of them is going to be closed by the command-w key press.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth windows display with the same dark grey toolbar, giving no easy way to tell which one is active. The only visual difference I can see is that the \"Share\" button gets disabled on the inactive window. Otherwise the windows appear identical\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9/13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that this is not a problem in non-full screen Safari windows. In that case, the toolbar of the inactive window has a lighter grey color."
