    description: "Newsstand was a great option for magazines in iOS 5 and 6. But now, almost all of its advantages disappeared (mainly background updates, which are now possible for all apps), and it has one big disadvantage: the app is hidden away in Newsstand app. It's even worse: it looked like a folder in iOS 5/6, so you could see the covers peeking through. In iOS 7, it's just a solid icon. It became a place where apps go forgotten. That's not good.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to opt out of Newsstand and become an ordinary app again. Right now, it's not possible.\r\n\r\nPS. I understand one reason you're not doing it now: big corps' magazine apps suck and they often have 200+ MB issues. By forcing them to use NewsstandKit, you're allowing iOS to manage space on the device better. But there are ways around it: you can force magazine apps to use NewsstandKit even if they appear as regular apps."
