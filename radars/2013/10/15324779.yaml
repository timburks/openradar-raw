    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen VoiceOver is turned on, a 3-finger swipe causes scroll views to scroll. However, if the currently focused accessibility element is a UIControl in a UITableViewCell, a 3-finger swipe down does not cause the table to scroll. Instead, VoiceOver reads \"Refreshing content\". This includes the standard delete and move controls when the table is in edit mode.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly serious accessibility issue, as when you scroll a table view down in edit mode the delete button of the topmost cell is generally focused by default, so the table view can't be scrolled up unless you switch focus to an element that is not a UIControl.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build the attached project with the iOS 7 sdk. The project contains just a UITableView in edit mode.\r\n2. Install the VoiceOverScrollBug app on an iOS7 device.\r\n3. Turn on VoiceOver.\r\n4. Scroll the table view down with a 3-finger swipe up\r\n5. Tap the delete or move control on a cell\r\n6. With the delete or move control focused, attempt to scroll the table view up with a 3-finger swipe down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe table view should scroll up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVoiceOver reads \"Refreshing content\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'VoiceOverScrollBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Comments:\r\n\r\nThis bug is easily reproducible in Apple's own apps with table views, including Phone, Contacts, Music, Reminders, Messages, and Photos"
