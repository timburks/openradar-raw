    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Artist and Albums lists can be very long but are only viewable on the top of the window where they are limited to relatively few entries.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run iTunes 11\r\n2. Select Songs\r\n3. Select Show Column Browser if not already displayed\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe column browser has an option to move to lists to the side of the window. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe column browser is restricted to being shown at the top of the window only. The album list, which in the attached screenshot has 391 entries, only shows six entries. It is difficult to browse through a lost of 391 entries when only seeing six at a time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 11.1.1 (11), OS X 10.8.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis worked fine in iTunes 10"
