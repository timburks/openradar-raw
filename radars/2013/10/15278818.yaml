    description: "We have an app that does most of the work of scheduling events.  We allow the user to invite attendees using EKEventEditViewController.  Some calendar (like the local iCal one) never have an \"Invitees\" panel, while others (like a Gmail one) does.\r\n\r\nWe haven't found a good pattern for this, so we'd like a call on the calendar \"canInvitePeople\" to decide whether to allow the user to bring up the EKEventEditViewController."
