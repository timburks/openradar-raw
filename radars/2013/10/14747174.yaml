    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 6.1, you can no longer use the up and down arrow keys to move between pages in a multipage PDF, nor can you use Home and End to move to the first and last pages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, open a multipage PDF, such as http://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1595/en_US/ipad_user_guide.pdf.\r\n2. Choose \"Single Page\" from the PDF's shortcut menu.\r\n3. Press Command-0 and/or Command-minus so a page fits in the window without scrolling.\r\n4. Press the up/down arrow keys.\r\n5. Press the Home/End keys (or Fn+left-right on most Apple keyboards these days).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe PDF displays the previous and next pages when pressing the up and down arrow keys. The PDF displays the first and last pages when pressing the Home and End keys.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUp and down arrow keys, Home and End keys work fine in Safari 6.0.  They also work fine in Single Page Continuous view in Safari 6.1."
