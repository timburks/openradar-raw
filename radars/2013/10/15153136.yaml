    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 5, I have a workspace with multiple projects and a scheme that should run all the test targets of the various projects. When I kick off the tests about 3 test project targets pass. So far, so good. But at the fourth test target I get an error message from Xcode telling me that the simulator can't be launched because it is already in use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create workspace in Xcode\r\n2. Add multiple projects with test targets\r\n3. Add all the different test targets to the \"Test\" Scheme.\r\n4. Run the tests\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the tests run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tests abort with Xcode complaining about the \"Simulator being already in use\""
