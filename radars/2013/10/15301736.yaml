    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ability to see network traffic on a per-app basis in the 10.9 Activity Monitor is a great addition, but would be greatly improved with one addition, and one element restored from the previous versions.\r\n\r\nTo make it truly useful for tracking network activity per app, rate columns (i.e. Bytes/s and packets/s) should be added, rather than just absolute values. Having absolute values is useful, but can make it hard to find what's using data at a particular moment, as processes that have been open for some time and/or have downloaded lots of data push others that may be currently using lots of data out of view when sorted. Nor in a large list of processes is it particularly easy to find apps using data at the current time, or sorting by it (as you can sort by CPU usage, etc.).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the removal of the \"peak\" metric for the overall network traffic statistics is a step backward. It previously served a good means of estimating the scale of the network traffic graph, whereas now the only means is looking at the current indicators for data sent/received, which makes for a poorer estimate, particularly in variable traffic.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, adding a proper scale to the traffic graph would alleviate this issue even better."
