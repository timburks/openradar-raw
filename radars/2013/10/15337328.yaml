    description: "Summary:\r\nOn some occasions, swiping the trackpad to go back/forwards produces a glitch: the animation stops after a short time, and the tab view is not updated, albeit pages still seem to load.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. navigate to a page\r\n3. swipe right-wards to go back in the browsers history\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe page slips towards the right to reveal the previous page, which loads, and allows the user to continue navigating\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation stops after a short time and no new page can be shown until the tab is closed\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSafari 7.0 (9537.71)\r\nOS X Mavericks\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo message is shown in the console under Safari's name\r\nOnce the problem occurs once, it will occur every time until the laptop is rebooted or sent to sleep mode.\r\n\r\nWhen the problem occurs, other apps seem to be concerned: Tweetbot, for example, stops accepting scrolling using the trackpad as soon as a lateral swipe is made.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Air 2013 11\"\r\nCore i5 1.3GHz\r\n4GB RAM\r\n128GB SSD\r\nOS X Mavericks 10.9 (13A603)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'safari_swipe.mp4' was successfully uploaded."
