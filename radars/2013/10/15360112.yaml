    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter using the camera from the lock screen by pulling up the bottom right camera icon, locking the screen, and going to the lock screen again later, the keyboard may appear in a manner that makes password entry impossible.\r\n\r\nI have not tested whether this is the case with a passcode instead of a complex password.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Show the lock screen by pressing the Home button\r\n2. Swipe up the bottom right camera icon\r\n3. Take a photo\r\n4. Lock the screen by pressing the Power button\r\n5. Show the lock screen again by pressing the Home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe lock screen should appear as in after step 1. The keyboard should not be visible. I should be able to swipe to the right to get to the keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe lock screen appears, but the right part of the keyboard is visible. Swiping to the right brings up the left part of the keyboard; however, I cannot type in my password due to 'missing' keys. Sometimes, Locking and unlocking fixes this. Sometimes, a reboot appears to be necessary.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.3/11B511\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4S (A1387), iOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nComplex password (not simple passcode)"
