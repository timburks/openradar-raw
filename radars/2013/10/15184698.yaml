    description: "Summary:\r\nIn cases where we have a UINavigationController within a UITabBarController, if the view controller pushed on the navigation controller has `hidesBottomBarWhenPushed` set (causing the tab bar to disappear) but sets toolbarHidden to NO on the UINavigationController, `bottomLayoutGuide` will return incorrect result -- the length will include the height of both the tab bar AND the toolbar.\r\n\r\nscreenshot of a view controller that has 93 as the bottom layout guide despite there only being a toolbar in the bottom:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zlgxo71ut91k17x/Screenshot%202013-10-09%2002.03.09.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITabBarController containing UINavigationController as one of the tabs\r\n2. Push a view controller onto the UINavigationController, with hidesBottomBarWhenPushed set to YES\r\n3. Sets toolbarItems on the view controller and call setToolbarHidden:NO on the navigation controller\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nbottomLayoutGuide should only include the height of the toolbar\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI looks correct (tab bar is hidden and toolbar is flushed against the bottom), but bottomLayoutGuide returns a length that includes the tab bar height.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 (11A465)"
