    description: "When attaching additional displays beyond a single primary display, HDMI attached displays will override a user's display preferences (resolution and arrangement of additional displays).\r\n\r\nThis has been tested and reproduced using both USB to HDMI adapters, Thunderbolt to HDMI adapters, and the HDMI output built-in to a current gen USB 3.0 Mini.\r\n\r\nWhen using a HDMI to DVI adapter (apple branded or 3rd party), the issue is not reproduced: the error seems to be triggered specifically by HDMI (regardless of whether the HDMI is a built-in port, a thunderbolt to HDMI adapter or cable, or a USB to HDMI adapter. \r\n\r\nTo be clear, I AM able to use a mix of DVI or VGA attached displays without hitting this issue: the issue only occurs when attempting to add an HDMI display.\r\n\r\nAfter manually disabling mirroring and arranging the displays, they will work normally- however the issue will recur on reboot and typically whenever the HDMI display is re-attached.  In the case of the Thunderbolt to HDMI cable or adapter or a USB to HDMI adapter (DisplayLink 2.0 and 3.0 based), a reboot or hot plug event will \"break\" the non-mirrored display arrangement- although anything other than \"deep\" sleep does NOT.  That is to say display arrangement is retained until the system reboots or enters deep sleep, or on hotplug events.\r\n\r\nPlease note that similar issues were seen on earlier 10.9 builds, however these actually got worse on the GM seed pushed 10/7/13.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use a normally working 10.9 mavericks system with built-in thunderbolt and HDMI display outputs. \r\n2. Attach any HDMI display via built-in HDMI port, USB to HDMI display adapter, or Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter/cable.\r\n3. Observe that HDMI display comes up in mirror mode rather than as an extended display.\r\n4. Disable display mirroring, arrange displays to match physical locations.\r\n5. Reboot system: observe that display preferences are lost.\r\n\r\n6. Repeat, substituting a DVI or VGA connection to the same HDMI display.  Observe that mirror mode issue is not encountered, and that display preferences are retained up on reboot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplays should come up in \"extended\" mode, regardless of how they are attached.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn my testing on 3 Mavericks systems, any HDMI display comes up in mirror mode, and causes display preferences to be lost on reboot (and various other conditions previously mentioned)."
