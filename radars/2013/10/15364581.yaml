    description: "Summary:\r\nI've setup netcat on my Mavericks 10.9 to listen to UDP packets received on port 9 using the command \"nc -u -l 9\". I sent WOL packets from the router and website and they were both received and shown in the output of netcat.\r\n\r\nI then enabled the \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" option and clicked the sleep button on my mac. After sending numerous magic packets from both my router and many websites, my mac neither woke up or responded to ping requests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSteps to confirm connectivity is available:\r\n1. Open terminal and run \"nc -u -l 9\"\r\n2. Go to http://wakeonlan.me and fill in the MAC address and IP of the machine where nc is working.\r\n3. Click Wake up my PC and observe the output on the terminal from the received magic packets\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce problem:\r\n1. Enable \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" in Energy Saver\r\n2. Press \"Sleep\" button\r\n3. Go to http://wakeonlan.me and fill in the MAC address and IP of the machine and click Wake Up my PC.\r\n4. Ping IP (after ensuring there's no firewall) and observe there is no response from the machine which should be awake now.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe macbook should at least respond to ping\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo response from the machine.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 (13A603)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro\r\nRetina, Mid 2012\r\nProcessor  2.3 GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory  8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nGraphics  Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB\r\nSoftware  OS X 10.9 (13A603)"
