        I shortly enabled iCloud keychain syncing then disabled it due to security concerns (mainly the fact that it relies on just the PIN code on iPhone).

        Now I have a "Local Items" keychain that I can neither delete nor specify access settings for. When I delete all items from it, Mail and other system apps don't take their credentials from the default (login) keychain but display a password dialog and save passwords in this "Local Items" keychain again.

        It defeats the purpose of selecting a default keychain if system apps don't care and use the fixed "Local Items" keychain instead.
