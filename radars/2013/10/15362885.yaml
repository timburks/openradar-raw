    description: "Summary:\r\nIf Time Machine is on and configured and is not excluding any data, both /Library/Logs/ and ~/Library/Logs/ are not backed up. They should be so individual log files can be retrieved from a backup for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Time Machine to back up to a drive\r\n2. Do NOT exclude any data from the backup, let alone System and Applications\r\n3. Let Time Machine complete a backup\r\n4. Browse the Time Machine backup and look for both /Library/Logs and ~/Library/Logs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll log files would be located in the correct folder in the Time Machine backup, available for reading and for restore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folders are either empty or do not even exist."
