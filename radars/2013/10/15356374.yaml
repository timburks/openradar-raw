    description: "Summary:\r\nAn NSURLSession configured with backgroundSessionConfiguration ignores the allowsCellularAccess setting on an NSMutableURLRequest. It will start and continue a download task over cellular even if allowsCellularAccess is set to NO on the request.\r\n\r\nI have attached a demo project that illustrates this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is not the behaviour documented here: xcdoc://ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/NetworkingOverview/Platform-SpecificNetworkingTechnologies/Platform-SpecificNetworkingTechnologies.html which recommends \"At the Foundation layer, you can use the setAllowsCellularAccess: method on NSMutableURLRequest to specify whether a request can be sent over a cellular connection. You can also use the allowsCellularAccess to check the current value.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSURLSession configured with backgroundSessionConfiguration.\r\n2. Create an NSMutableURLRequest and set its allowsCellularAccess property to NO\r\n3. While connected to a cellular network (not wifi) initiate a download request using that NSMutableURLRequest against the background session.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe download should fail since we're on cellular and have set allowsCellularAccess = NO\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe download proceeds using cellular data despite allowsCellularAccess = NO being no on the request.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.1, iOS 7.0.3"
