    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to use systemLayoutSizeFittingSize to get the height of a table cell row, but find that about 10-20% of the time it returns a value that is too small.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot exhibiting the image clipping that happens from the invalid size returned.\r\nhttp://cloud.carpeaqua.com/image/0B43012g0217\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have attached a sample problem that exhibits the issue. Run it and scroll. You should notice that the thumbnail of the map image is clipped in some of those cells (if you don't see it, relaunch the app and try again)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe value from systemLayoutSizeFittingSize should be accurate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nhttp://cloud.carpeaqua.com/image/0B43012g0217\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nSample is available at https://github.com/justin/AutoLayoutZen/tree/master/8.%20Dynamic%20Table%20Cell%20Heights"
