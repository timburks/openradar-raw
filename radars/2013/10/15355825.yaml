        Summary:
        Transition animations opening and closing apps and unlocking the device are so slow that people are using the accessibility setting to disable them. These transitions are cool at first, but when using the device a lot they get tiring and they make iOS 7 feel _significantly_ slower than iOS 6 did, even on the fastest devices lil the iPhone 5s.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open an app from Springboard, background it with the home button, unlock the device....
        Try to do something quickly, like tap on another app icon. It's not possible and you have to wait until the animation is over, slowing down your productivity when using the device.

        Expected Results:
        These animations don't get in the way. I thought iOS 7's design was all about "removing details that get in the way of the user experience". These animations definitely do. The timing of the animations should be at least as fast as it used to be on iOS 6.

        Actual Results:
        The animations are painfully slow and it makes using iOS 7 very annoying. Enabling "reduced motion" in the accessibility settings makes your decide feel a lot faster, like it should be.

        Regression:
        IOS 6 didn't have any issue with this.
