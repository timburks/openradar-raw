    description: "Summary:\r\nThe first time XCode 5.0.1 is started (on OS X 10.9) it installs command line tools, e.g. so that the cc command will work. This is automatic and there it is no longer possible to explicitly install the command line tools from within XCode.\r\n\r\nThe automatic install done by XCode does not create the /usr/include/ directory.\r\n\r\nThe /usr/include/ directory is installed by any of the following\r\n1. xcode-select --install (on OS X 10.9)\r\n2. cc --version on OS X 10.9 without XCode will launch a dialog offering to install the command line tools, which will behave as (1).\r\n3. Earlier versions of OS X and XCode (and possibly XCode 5.0.1 on earlier OS X) when the \"Command Line Tools\" was installed from the Preferences menu item (Downloads/Components)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install OS X 10.9\r\n2. Copy XCode 5.0.1 to Applications.\r\n3. Launch XCode 5.0.1. Let it install the components at startup.\r\n4. There is no /usr/include/\r\n5. xcode-select --install\r\n6. Now there is a /usr/include/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the automatic install performed by XCode launch to install the same things as xcode-select --install.\r\n\r\nFor some applications, e.g. installing third-party compilers, it is important that /usr/include/ exists so I think it is important that XCode is changed to install /usr/include/ (as opposed to making the behavior identical by changing xcode-select --install to not create /usr/include/)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe automatic install performed by XCode launch does not create /usr/include/ but xcode-select --install does create /usr/include/\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 (13A603), XCode 5.0.1 (5A2053)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDiscovered while installing gcc with MacPorts, see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/40809#comment:8>.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
