    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen unlocking an iPhone that has been rotated into landscape mode, the app unlocks in portrait and then re-rotates into landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Unlock an iPhone and open Safari. \r\n2) Rotate the phone into landscape mode and note that Safari rotates into landscape\r\n3) Without rotating the phone (so it stays in landscape) lock the phone\r\n4) Without rotating the phone (so it stays in landscape), unlock the phone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe phone unlocks and the app is displayed in landscape mode. I verified that this was the behavior in iOS 5 on a 3GS\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe phone \"zooms\" in to the app in landscape mode. The app then rotates into portrait mode before rotating back into landscape mode.\r\n\r\nFor apps like Safari where the contents may be re-laid out as the app rotates, this can cause the page to relayout and scroll to lose the user's place in the content. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.2 (11A501)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
