    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen presenting an instance of a UIPopoverController more than once from a subview, the presenting button does not get deallocated.  This only happens when running on iOS 7.0 or later.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing the Allocations tool in Instruments, I was able to reproduce this issue and will provide a sample Xcode project with instructions.\r\n\r\n1. Add a subview which contains a UIButton (this button presents a UIPopoverController).\r\n2. Select the button to present the popover.\r\n3. Dismiss the popover and remove the subview.\r\n4. Using the Allocations tool in Instruments, observe that UIButton gets deallocated.\r\n5. Add the subview for a second time.\r\n6. Select the button to present the popover.\r\n7. Now dismiss it and present the popover for a second time.\r\n8. Now remove the subview again.\r\n9. Observe that the UIButton does not get deallocated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button which invoked the presentation of the UIPopoverController should be deallocated after its subview has been released from memory.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button which invoked the presentation of the UIPopoverController was NOT deallocated and remains in memory.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 or later\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on iOS 7.0 or later; Simulator and all versions of iPad\r\nThis does NOT occur on iOS 6\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PopoverTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
