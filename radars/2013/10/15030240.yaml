    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen viewing songs for a given artist, there are multiple Shuffle icons: one at the top, which seems to imply \"Shuffle All Songs for this Artist\"; and one by each Album, which seems to imply \"Shuffle All Songs for this Album\". The functionality is either broken or works differently than it implies.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Music app on iOS 7 GM (iPhone 5)\r\n\r\n2. Select Artist tab\r\n\r\n3. Select an Artist (e.g., Sara Bareilles)\r\n\r\n4. Observe the \"Shuffle All Songs\" table view cell, along with separate \"Shuffle\" icons next to each album section header (i.e., the row with the cover art and album information).\r\n\r\n5. Tap \"Shuffle\" icon for the album entitled \"The Blessed Unrest\"\r\n\r\n6. Music begins playing - I like the song \"Brave\"\r\n\r\n7. Scratch my head when \"Bright Lights and Cityscapes\" starts playing - it's part of her \"Once Upon Another Time\" EP.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the Shuffle scope to work as noted in the description.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShuffle Album seems to Shuffle All.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM on iPhone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
