    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen clicking the fullscreen icon on some applications, the area of the menu bar is not used (so a black bar is visible above the application).\r\n\r\nTerminal, App Store and Mail work correctly, they go entirely full screen.\r\niTunes, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox do not work correctly, they leave room for the menu bar (even though the menu bar itself is hidden).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Mavericks on a dual-monitor system\r\n2. Start iTunes and drag it to the second monitor\r\n3. Click the top-right fullscreen button in iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should take up the entire screen, the menu bar should be hidden and only appear when the mouse cursor is moved to the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes leaves room for the menu bar.  The menu bar is hidden though, and only appears when the mouse cursor is moved to the top of the screen -- when the menu bar is hidden there is a black space which iTunes is not using.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2009, with external Dell 2009W monitor at 1680 x 1050."
