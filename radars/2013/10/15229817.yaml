    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a brief moment after the WWDC of this year its been possible to delete the Application Identifiers that are not been used, but after the big outage of the end of August this option is disappear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in in your dev account.\r\n2. Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles\r\n3. Select an App ID\r\n4. Try to delete it\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInside the edit button for the App ID it must be a delete button that is active if there is no App currently in sale on the App Store with that ID.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to delete old IDs, and this can be an issue if the dev are a contractor an for testing purpose he create a lot of testing IDs that now are useless."
