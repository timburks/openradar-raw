    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPerformance of assigning a large number of weak references grows progressively worse on 10.9.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExecution time for each iteration is approximately the same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nExecution time grows progressively worse.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\nOS X 10.9/13A603\r\nXcode 5.0.1/5A2053\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe problem case is only observed under specific conditions, launching the attached project through Xcode or Launch Services will result in the problem case, launching it through Instruments or directly from Terminal will not. Attached is an Instruments trace for the slow case showing the time is mostly spent in append_referrer().\r\n\r\nThanks to Mike Ash for investigating the issue and noticing that in the slow case the addresses of the weak references are incremented consistently while in the fast case they are much more scattered (see attached logs). He also noticed that append_referrer() previously had code to produce better hash values for the problem case, but this appears to have been removed in 10.9.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\nAlways observable on 10.9.\r\nDoes not occur on 10.8.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\n'WeakRefTest.zip', 'WeakRefTest.trace.zip' and 'Logs.zip' were successfully uploaded."
