    description: "Summary:\r\nSimply referencing the topLayoutGuide property within a UITableViewController makes it impossible to scroll the table beyond what is currently on screen (as if the content size was == to screen bounds).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with an empty Xcode template\r\n2. Create a UITableViewController subclass, initialise it and set it as the window's root view controller.\r\n3. In viewDidLayoutSubviews, call self.topLayoutGuide (you only need to call it, you don't need to do anything with it).\r\n4. Observe that scrolling is now broken.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling should not be broken.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached sample project contains some code not relevant to this bug as I have been using it to reproduce and report other bugs related to search display controllers.\r\n\r\nThe project is configured to be built and run and demonstrate the bug.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the code relating to:\r\n* Search bars, search display controllers\r\n* Custom containment controller\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded."
