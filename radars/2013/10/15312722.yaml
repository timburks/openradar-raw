    description: "Summary:\r\nMany aspects of the build in progress by a build bot are exposed by environment variables, e.g. BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR.\r\n\r\nBots have the concept of a build integration number, as can be seen in the web view of any bot's history. This build integration number should be exposed as an environment variable as well.\r\n\r\nHaving this exposed is useful for producing properly versioned archives that tie back to their particular integration. The data is there, it just needs to be exposed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.1(5A2053)\r\nOS X Server app 3.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
