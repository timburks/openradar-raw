    description: "Summary:\r\nIn many occasions the unread count of a smart mailbox does not reflect the actual number of unread messages in it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a smart folder with unread items, and mark messages as read, or mark them as unread. The number of the smart folder will change, but might not reflect the number \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe smart folder count number should reflect the actual number of unread messages in view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, you get a bogus unread count, and there is no way to show a correct one. See attached screenshots for examples.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 (13A598)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe first time it occurred, I also had several Mail.app plugins (MailPerspective, MailTags, MailActions, in beta versions for Mavericks) installed. However, the problem also occurs without them.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nDifferent snapshots of smart mailbox definitions, and wrong unread counts."
