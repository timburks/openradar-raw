    description: "Summary:\r\nThe list of scenes on a Storyboard along the left side could be organized into groups just like project files so that developers can organize them logically so scrolling to find the current scene would not take so long. (Though it would be very helpful if there was a button to scroll to make the currently selected scene visible in that last. Please do this as well.)\r\n\r\nIt would be most helpful to have options to collapse all groups to quickly find the group I want to access a scene quickly. Then double clicking on a scene in the list could focus it on the design surface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStoryboards only show scenes as a long list.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would list scenes and allow me to organize them into groups just like I can with project files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is very cumbersome to navigate to different scenes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
