    description: "The CLLocationManager reference document says significant location change monitoring \"is available only in iOS 4.0 and later and requires a device with a cellular radio.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore on a device without a cellular radio, like my iPad 2, significantLocationChangeMonitoringAvailable should return NO. Instead it returns YES.\r\n\r\nReturning YES when it shouldn't means code like this won't work:\r\nif ([CLLocationManager significantLocationChangeMonitoringAvailable]) {\r\n[clManager startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges];\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhen I run above code on my Wi-Fi-only iPad 2, there are no errors. Worse, the delegate methods to notify me that a new location is available are never invoked. It just fails silently.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install XCode\r\n2. create a new project for iPad or a universal app\r\n3. add the CoreLocation framework\r\n4. create a view controller and import CoreLocation header\r\n5. observe [CLLocationManager significantLocationChangeMonitoringAvailble] will return YES regardless of there being no cell radio available"
