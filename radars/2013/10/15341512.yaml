    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 7 introduced the very nice keyboardDismissMode with its different modes that allow dragging a keyboard offscreen. The problem is that during the drag, which in the interactive mode can take several seconds as the user can wiggle the keyboard, the different keyboard notifications are not being fired, and so there's no way for the app to adapt to the visible portion of the keyboard on screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup an iOS project with a UIScrollView\r\n2. Set scroll view's keyboardDismissMode to UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissModeInteractive\r\n3. Add a text view to the scroll view\r\n4. Add observers on notification center for UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification\r\n4. Run the app\r\n5. Tap inside the text view\r\n6. Drag down the keyboard slowly\r\n7. See that the notification observers were not called\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification observers should know that the keyboard is now taking a different size of the screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo notification is being triggered until the keyboard is dragged completely off screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is something that's very important for apps that want to have a view similar to Messages.app where the text view is moving along the keyboard as the drag is happening"
