    description: "Summary:\r\nFrequently, but not consistently, my app crashes immediately on launch. The thread that crashes is an NSOperationQueue serial queue being used by DataDetectors, specifically it's DDOperation.\r\n\r\nDDScannerScanQuery is frequently near the top of the backtrace. I have occasionally seen this error in the console:\r\n\r\n2013-10-15 13:28:37.271 CAN[80590:a803] assertion on /SourceCache/MobileDataDetectorsCore_Sim/MobileDataDetectorsCore-355/Sources/PushDown/DDTokenCache.c:360 \"delta >= 0\" failed :Bad shift in DDTokenCacheMoveStreamOffset, aborting\r\n\r\nI've yet to reproduce this in a sample app, and disabling data detectors on some text views in my app doesn't seem to prevent the issue.\r\n\r\nOthers have observed this issue too:\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/900134#900134\r\n\r\nI'm yet to see this on an actual device, just in the simulator, although the above thread contains reports of it happening on the device too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs yet unknown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0, Xcode Version 5.0 (5A1412)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've as yet only observed this in the iPad simulator.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nA sample app has been submitted to Apple that exhibits this bug - it's a single view template application, with a UITableView and each cell has a text view with the same hardcoded text and data detectors enabled. This appears to be related to text views in cells but I haven't confirmed that."
