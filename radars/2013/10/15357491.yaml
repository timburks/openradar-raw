    description: "Summary:\r\nUICollectionViewCells are not being reused when running on an iPhone 5s device with iOS 7.0.3. This behaviour differs to the same code running on iPad 4 or Simulator (7.0.3) where cells are reused properly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UICollectionView\r\n2. Register a UICollectionViewCell nib or class with a reuse ID.\r\n3. Use the standard API to dequeue reusable cells.\r\n4. Add some debugging code (or breakpoints) to the UICollectionViewCell subclass to watch object lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA number of UICollectionViewCells should be created initially and then reused then on. The creation of new cells is not expected after enough cells have been created by the UICollectionView.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn an iPhone 5s running iOS 7.0.3 our tests show that UICollectionViewCells are never reused. New cells are always created by the call to -dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:forIndexPath:.\r\n\r\nHowever, this unexpected behaviour is unique to the iPhone 5s device (I hear iPhone 5 also suffers the same problem, although I haven't verified this). The same code running on an iPad 4 (7.0.3) or the iPhone Simulator (7.0 (463.9.4)) behave correctly (cells are reused).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3 (11B511)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA sample iOS project is attached, demonstrating the problem.\r\n\r\nThis may be a duplicate of rdar://15348611\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe problem has only been reproduced on an iPhone 5s running 7.0.3.\r\niPad 4 (7.0.3) and iPhone Simulator (7.0 (463.9.4)) running the same code behave correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'collection-cell-radar.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nIt turns out that collection view cells are not reused when Accessibility Shortcuts are enabled. i.e. Settings.app / General / Accessibility / Accessibility Shortcut (VoiceOver).\r\n\r\nIf Accessibility Shortcuts are disabled and the collection view app re-launched, cells are reused as expected.\r\n\r\nIf an Accessibility Shortcut is enabled (e.g. VoiceOver) and the collection view app is re-launched, cells are no longer reused.\r\n\r\nThis was reproduced on both iPhone 5s and iPad 4 running 7.0.3 (11B511).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n07-Nov-2013\r\nDuplicate of 14569740"
