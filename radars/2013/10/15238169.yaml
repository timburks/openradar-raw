    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I get a FaceTime call and I take it one one device, e.g. on my iPhone, it later shows up as missed on my other devices, e.g. my iPad and Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up FaceTime on at least two devices with the same account\r\n2. Have somebody call you\r\n3. Pick up the call on one device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOther devices go silent (works) and show the call in history.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOther devices go silent and show the call as missed, even on the lock screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Mavericks GM, iOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\nUpdate 2013-10-17\r\n\r\nCan confirm that the issue does NOT appear on Mavericks GM. FaceTime goes silent when taking a call on another device and the call does NOT show up in the call log later, not as missed and not at all.\r\n\r\nSo it's iOS only.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\nUpdate 2013-10-17\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 11966479 (Open)\r\n\r\n-----\r\nFixed in iOS 7.1, hooray"
