    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you create a Bot for an Xcode project that has git submodules that are checked out at a specified commit, the Xcode Server will not be able to check the project out.\r\n\r\nYou can see from the log below that it appears to be trying to checkout the string '(detached from 4b79bd9)' instead of the commit SHA.\r\n\r\nOct  4 14:11:31 cylon.local xcsbuildd[7125] <Error>: [XCSCheckoutOperation.m:518 78ee4310 +138ms] Error in Git checkout Error Domain=CSBotSCMAction Code=-1000 \"error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t\" UserInfo=0x7f9d52465a50 {NSLocalizedDescription=error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t} <stderr>= error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSSH Known Hosts file path is located at /Library/Server/Xcode/Config/ssh_known_hosts\r\n\tSSH strict host checking is disabled (you can enable this by editing the SSHStrictHostKeyChecking key in /Library/Server/Xcode/Config/xcsbuildd.plist\r\n\tUntrusted HTTPS certificates is enabled (you can disable this by editing the TrustSelfSignedSSLCertificates key in /Library/Server/Xcode/Config/xcsbuildd.plist\r\nOct  4 14:11:31 cylon.local xcsbuildd[7125] <Error>: [XCSOperation.m:33 78ee4310 +0ms] Error Domain=CSBotSCMAction Code=-1000 \"error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t\" UserInfo=0x7f9d52465a50 {NSLocalizedDescription=error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t}\r\nOct  4 14:11:31 cylon.local xcsbuildd[7125] <Debug>: [XCSOperation.m:28 78ee4310 +0ms] Cancelling operation: XCSCheckoutOperation\r\nOct  4 14:11:31 cylon.local xcsbuildd[7125] <Error>: [XCSBuildBundle.m:680 78ee4310 +0ms] Got an error from the checkout operation: Error Domain=CSBotSCMAction Code=-1000 \"error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t\" UserInfo=0x7f9d52465a50 {NSLocalizedDescription=error: pathspec '(detached from 4b79bd9)' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode Project and make several git commits.\r\n2. On the command line in project folder, check out an old commit that is not attached to the head of any branches.\r\n2a. or you can also add a submodule like RestKit (https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) which has its own submodules checked out at specific commits.\r\n3. In Xcode, under the Source Control menu item, make sure the working copy says (detached from xxxxxxx). xxxxxxx = commit SHA\r\n4. Create a Bot for project and see if it integrates successfully.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bot should integrate successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe bot fails to integrate.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 2.2.67 (13S411)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBook Pro \r\n15-inch, Early 2011\r\nProcessor  2.2 GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory  8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\r\nGraphics  Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\r\nSoftware  OS X 10.9 (13A598)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ServerLogs-cylon-131004-141711.tgz' was successfully uploaded."
