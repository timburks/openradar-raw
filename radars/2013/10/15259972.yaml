    description: "Summary:\r\nptr_refs is a very useful way for tracking memory leaks by scanning the heap for all objects that have a pointer to a region of memory. Whenever invoking it for the iOS simulator, lldb will crash itself and the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a debugger session on an iOS app launched in the simulator\r\n2. Execute 'command script import lldb.macosx.heap' in lldb\r\n3. Execute 'ptr_refs <anobjectaddress>' \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA list of all objects in the heap that point to a specific memory address\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nlldb and xcode crash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXCode 5.0\r\nOSX 10.8.5\r\nlldb-300.5.46\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've tried this on three different machines with the same results. I recall a conversation from WWDC2013 labs with an Apple Engineer who demonstrated that the leaks tool has changed in Mavericks, he showed that the leaks instrument via the command line can do the same thing. I can't find any documentation for this in the manpage or on the developer portal,\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n15\" Retina MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
