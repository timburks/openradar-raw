    description: "Summary:\nGame Center provides the badge count on my app for in how many games it is your turn. But sometimes it says (1) and the Game Center app itself says (0) turns. Also when you open the game you do not see any games where it is your turn. The wrong badge can stay for a long time (weeks).\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nTake a Game Center app, play a few games, it will sometimes happen.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe badge count should be the same as the number of games where it is your move. \n\nActual Results:\nThe badge count is sometimes off by 1\n\nRegression:\nN.a.\n\nNotes:\nN.a."
