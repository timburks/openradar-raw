    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's really annoying that currently if you have a build that requires building a private github repo with some submodules that are also in github, You have to configure the SSH key for each repo (and submodule) separately, and then have it added to your account in github (or edit them in Server.app separately).\r\n\r\nThis can take a lot of time, and it's a bit flaky in general (authentication fails for some repositories without any obvious reason).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install OS X Server version 3\r\n2. Create a bot of your github.com project with github.com submodules from your Xcode developer station (by going to the Logs Navigator -> Right Click -> Create Bot... -> Use the server)\r\n3. Try to define an ssh key authentication for all your created repos using the Server.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect being able to set up my github.com ssh key in one place in the Xcode server configuration, and all github.com repos to automatically authenticate by using it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to do the same process of setting the ssh key for dozens of repos.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X Server 3 (13S440)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA workaround could be setting the key /var/teamsserver/.ssh/config, but this seems to work only in some occasions (sometimes authentication fails for no obvious reason).\r\n\r\nAlso, it could be much more convenient to be able to define an ssh key when creating the bot in Xcode instead of doing it from the Server.app's config."
