    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen running any iOS app from Xcode 4.6.3 on Mavericks in the Simulator, Xcode crashes with the attached crash log if Xcode 5.0.1 (installed in a different location) ran before.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible in Xcode 4.6.3 and 4.6.0.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 5.0.1\r\n2. Install Xcode 4.6.3 in a separate directory\r\n3. Run Xcode 4.6.3 and install the Legacy Simulators as required on first launch\r\n4. Debug on the Simulator (works fine)\r\n5. Quit Xcode 4.6.3\r\n6. Launch Xcode 5 and debug on the Simulator (works fine)\r\n7. Quit Xcode 5\r\n8. Run Xcode 4.6.3 and debug on the Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Simulator should start, the app should run in debug mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Simulator starts, the launch image of the app is visible shortly, then Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 4.6.3 (4H1503) on OS X 10.9 (13A603). Also is reproducible with Xcode 4.6.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI need Xcode 4.6 to build and test iOS apps that haven't been ported to the iOS 7 UI yet. There's no way (at least known to me) to build \"legacy UI\" apps under Xcode 5.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLaunching Xcode 5 after Xcode 4.6 seems to install or change some components that cause the subsequent crash of Xcode 4.6."
