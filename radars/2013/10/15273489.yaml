    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://15263236\n\nMac developers benefit from this informal protocol to make code more readable. For example:\r\n\r\n  [aDate isLessThan:anotherDate]\r\n\r\nis much more readable than:\r\n\r\n  [aDate compare:anotherDate] == NSOrderedAscending\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  [aDate isEqual:[aDate earlierDate:anotherDate]]\r\n\r\niOS developers should have it just as easy."
