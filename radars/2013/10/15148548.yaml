    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen I tap in a UITextView, the keyboard comes up. Sometimes the keyboard is in front of the insertion point.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it's possible to type in a UITextView and have the insertion point end up behind the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a UITextView. Tap below where the keyboard would appear.\r\n\r\nOr: hit return a whole bunch of times until the insertion point disappears.\r\n\r\nSee my attached project for a simple test case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe UITextView would scroll automatically so that typing is always visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe UITextView doesn't scroll automatically.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TVScrollingBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
