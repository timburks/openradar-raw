    description: "Summary:\r\nMy manifest.plist mistakenly contained ${PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier} instead of the real bundle identifier (issue with the process used to generate the plist). Understandably this caused the install to fail. However, the app wasn't cleaned up once the installation was done, nor could I do so manually.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Ad Hoc build via manifest.plist with identifier not matching the app's real bundle identifier\r\n2. Installation completes almost completely, but hangs at the last moment\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp attempted to install being removed again, and an error dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp remained installed, unopenable, undeletable (even after multiple restarts).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
