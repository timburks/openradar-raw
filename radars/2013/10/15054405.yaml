    description: "See also 15054302, 15054386.\r\n\r\nAll dynamic behaviors except for snap have an -items property, along with mutators. However, -items is not part of <UIDynamicBehavior>. That makes it hard to write generic handlers to add and remove items from behaviors. The -items property and its mutators should be a required part of <UIDynamicBehavior> and added to the snap behavior."
