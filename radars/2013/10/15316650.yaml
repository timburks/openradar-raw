    description: "Summary:\r\nA UICollectionViewCell will disappear from its containing UICollectionView when positioned such that both its left edge and bottom edge extend beyond the corresponding edges of the collection view. That is, if the cell's x origin is less than zero, and its y origin is greater than the collection view's height minus the cell's height, then the cell will disappear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new empty iOS application in Xcode.\r\n2. Create custom subclasses of both UICollectionViewLayout and UICollectionViewController.\r\n3. In the app delegate, create an instance of the custom collection view controller using the custom collection view layout, and make it the root view controller.\r\n4. Configure the collection view controller as the collection view's data source. (Only one cell is needed to illustrate the bugâ€”make sure it is visible by, for instance, setting its background color to red.)\r\n5. Configure the collection view layout to return the cell's layout attributes when needed and (again just to illustrate, taking scrolling out of the picture) make the collection view's contentSize equal to the size of the collection view itself.\r\n6. Set the frame of the cell's layout attributes as described above, with its lower-left corner protruding beyond the lower-left corner of the collection view.\r\n7. Build and run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe part of the cell which does not extend beyond the lower-left corner of the collection view will be visible, just as when the cell is positioned partially outside any other corner of the collection view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell is completely invisible when positioned in this way. It *is* visible when positioned similarly in any other corner, or with any *one* edge extending beyond the bounds of the collection view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3 (11B511)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis occurs on my iPhone 5s running iOS 7.0.3 (11B511) when using Xcode 5 on a Macbook Pro with Retina Display running OS X 10.8.5."
