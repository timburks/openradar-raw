    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe tap that makes the UITextView become first responder causes UIKeyboardWillShowNotification to get posted -- but before UITextView has updated its selectedRange property.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because you might want to scroll the UITextView to show the selectedRange -- you might want to make sure the typing is visible to the user. (See #15148548: UITextView doesn't scroll to show typing.)\r\n\r\nIf you get the selectedRange on the next turn of the run loop, it will be accurate -- but you won't be able to properly sync your scrolling animation with the animation of the keyboard appearing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee the attached project that demonstrates the bug.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nselectedRange is correct when UIKeyboardWillShowNotification is posted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nselectedRange is not correct when UIKeyboardWillShowNotification is posted.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TVKeyboardSelectionBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
