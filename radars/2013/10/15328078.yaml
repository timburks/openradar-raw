        Summary:
        I often switch between showing all music available to me through iTunes Match, and showing only that music which is stored on my iOS device. At present this requires a trip to the Settings app. I (and I'm sure many others) would appreciate the convenience in having this setting replicated in the music app.

        Alternatively some additional logic could be added to the Music app to display only the local music when the device is not connected to a network that it is allowed to download/stream music over. For example, my devices are configured not to download music while connected to the cellular network. In that case I would be happy for the Music app to not display any non-local music.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open the Music app while connected to a non-WiFi network, or no network at all.

        Expected Results:
        2. The Music app displays only the music stored on the local device.

        Actual Results:
        2. The Music app displays all music, even though the device cannot access it.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        This may not be a huge inconvenience in well-connected urban environments, but is more so for users who live in rural areas, or simply have to pay a lot to download data over cellular networks.
