    description: "I ran into a memory leak where I had a view controller with strong references to an MKMapView and a MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem. When my view controller was deallocated, the map view remained in memory.\r\n\r\nThe culprit was a retain cycle, caused because the MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem was retaining its map view. I solved it with a workaround, by setting the MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem's mapView property to 'nil' when my view controller was deallocated. \r\n\r\nHowever, this should not need to be the case. The MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem's mapView property should be a weak property."
