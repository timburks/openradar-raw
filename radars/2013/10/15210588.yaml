    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, if a Launch Agent is loaded/started and then the system fast user switches to a user that is already logged in, the agent is not loaded in that user's context. This would be a very useful feature to have.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start with two logged-in users on OS X.\r\n2. As user A, install a launch agent in /Library/LaunchAgents/\r\n3. Fast user switch to user B.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be very helpful if launchd would load the agent even if the user is already logged in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe launch agent is not loaded for user B."
