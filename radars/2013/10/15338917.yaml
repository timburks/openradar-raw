    description: "NOTE: This is a regression from 10.8.x and affects existing binaries already shipped, including my MarsEdit application. Moving any MarsEdit document window to full-screen mode exhibits the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen a window that is transitioned to Full Screen Mode has both a toolbar installed, and its width constrained by the window:willUseFullScreenContentSize: delegate method, the default full-screen animation is clunky and includes extreme, ugly drawing artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the problem appears to be that a version of the original (unconstrained) window target size is zoomed in the transition along with the primary (constrained) window target size. The result is during the transition and until the Full Screen Mode takes full effect, there is a large, low-resolution ghostlike image of the window drawn behind the primary, constrained window.\r\n\r\nScreenshot attached to demonstrate what this looks like at the peak of the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is a sample project to reproduce the problem. In my tests the problem happens with a simple test app that can be reproduced as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Mac application from the basic Xcode template.\r\n2. In the app delegate, add code to install a toolbar on the app's main window, to enable full-screen mode, and to constrain the size of the window in full-screen mode.\r\n3. Run the app and click the \"Full Screen\" arrows icon in the upper right corner of the window.\r\n\r\nResult: See Screenshot.\r\n\r\nExpected: The window should zoom to the desired target size without the superfluous, ugly ghosted window image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9 13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'BadTransition.png' and 'ToolbarFullScreenBug.zip' were successfully uploaded."
