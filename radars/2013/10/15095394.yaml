Send an MMS in Messages.app and tap on the photo while it's being sent\r\n2. Try to exit out of that view, you will notice you cannot\r\n3. Tap so the UI becomes visible and then the background turns black. You can now tap go back to the individual conversation view, but not the conversation list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping a second time should return me to the conversation list view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUI enters an infinite loop which is inescapable except for force quitting Messages.app in order to return to the conversation list view.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2 (11A501)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a video reproducing the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone6,1 A1533 32GB Unlocked\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'IMG_3115.MOV' was successfully uploaded."
