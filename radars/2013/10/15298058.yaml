    description: "Summary:\r\nNB. This problem is reproducible when running on device but not in the iOS simulator. Tested and reproduced on iOS 7.0.2.\r\n\r\nCalling -[UIImage resizableImageWithCapInsets:] with insets which touch, overlap or exceed the bounds of the source image cause Core Graphics to log a large number of polite, yet slightly ominous and rather unhelpful, error messages. These messages did not help in tracking down the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In an iOS project (or using the attached sample project), instantiate a UIImage from an image file.\r\n2. Call -[UIImage resizableImageWithCapInsets:] on the image, giving it insets which are too large for it.\r\n3. Run on device and observe the log.\r\n4. Modify the insets to fit within the image.\r\n5. Run on device again and observe the lack of errors to the log.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUseful feedback to allow the developer to track down the problem.\r\n\r\nI suggest that at least a specific error message be logged (e.g., \"-[UIImage resizableImageWithCapInsets:] called with invalid insets for image\"). Even more helpfully, return nil from the method to make the developer more likely to notice the issue.\r\n\r\nConsider throwing an exception?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExample extract error log attached.\r\n\r\nThe error messages logged are almost entirely unhelpful in identifying the problem.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.2 (11A501)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRunning on device, specifically."
