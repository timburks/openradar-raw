    description: "For apps that sync data using Core Data and iCloud, it would be nice if the new background fetch mode would – when enabled – automatically update the data store. This could be something triggered by the developer's code in -application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler: or even better if it could happen without any additional code on the developer's part. This enhancement would greatly improve the user experience for apps that store most of their user-visible data in an iCloud-enabled Core Data store and it seems like a natural fit for the background processing mode introduced in iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSome developers are leveraging background fetching by kicking off a timer when they get the call to -application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:. If they see a NSPersistentStoreDidImportUbiquitousContentChangesNotification notification before the timer expires, they return  a result of UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData. Otherwise they return UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData.\r\n\r\nSee dev forum thread here: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/197095\r\n\r\nThis works reasonably well, but I think that with a bit of framework help as I described, we could avoid using timers."
