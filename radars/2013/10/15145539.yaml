    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn my app we make extensive use of UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer -- and we also get bug reports that it's not forgiving enough, that it’s too hard to activate.\r\n\r\nOne of two things would probably make this work better:\r\n\r\n• Make it more forgiving.\r\n\r\nOr...\r\n\r\n• Add an API that allows developers to specify how much tolerance is allowed, so we can choose to make it more forgiving (and by how much)."
