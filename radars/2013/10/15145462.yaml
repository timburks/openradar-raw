    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nLots of apps -- starting with Facebook and Path, and many more since -- use a sidebar menu. (Often known as a \"basement,\" often opened by a \"hamburger\" button.)\r\n\r\nThough it isn't that difficult to do, it's still up to each developer to figure it out and implement it.\r\n\r\nAt this point it's become a de facto standard, but it's implemented unevenly. Direct support in UIKit would help developers -- and would help users by defining and ensuring standard behavior."
