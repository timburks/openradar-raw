    description: "When setting up a Bot from Xcode, the available authentication options don't include \"SSH Key\" in Xcode. This means that I can't successfully set up my Bot from within Xcode itself.\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n\r\n1. Install Xcode 5.0 on your machine, and set up 10.9 Server on another with the Xcode service running.\r\n\r\n2. Open a project that's hosted in a repository that requires an SSH key to access on your machine.\r\n\r\n3. From the Product menu in Xcode, choose \"Create Botâ€¦\"\r\n\r\n4. Click \"Next\" until you arrive at the pane to configure authentication for your repository.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: \r\n\r\nI should be able to choose \"SSH Key\" as an authentication method and paste in my SSH key.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour: \r\n\r\nThe available options don't include \"SSH Key\".\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to choose \"Guest\" in Xcode - since my SSH key is installed authentication will still succeed locally. Once the repository is in the Xcode service on the server, I can edit it and add my key."
