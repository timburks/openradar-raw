    description: "Reordering the items in a Target's Link Binary With Libraries can cause crash. This is not always reproducible, but it happens enough for me that it's annoying. \r\n\r\nMy project has multiple targets. I was reordering the linked libraries in one to match another and the crash happened. Multiple times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode.\r\n2. Open desired project. \r\n3. Click on project. \r\n4. Click on Build Phases\r\n5. Expand Link Binary With Libraries. \r\n6. Drag and drop libraries to other locations. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe library would be moved to the new location without issue. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes the app will crash, sometimes the app will work as desired. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0 (5A1413)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
