    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 6.1, Automatically Resize scales a PDF page so it fits in the window horizontally, and doesn't continue to scale as the Safari window is resized. There is no obvious way to fit the height instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, open a multipage PDF, such as http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/ipad_user_guide.pdf.\r\n2. Choose \"Single Page\" from the PDF's shortcut menu.\r\n3. Choose \"Automatically Resize\" from the PDF's shortcut menu.\r\n4. Resize the Safari window.\r\n5. Observe the \"Automatically Resize\" item in the PDF's shortcut menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInitially after choosing \"Automatically Resize\" and as the window is resized, the PDF page is scaled such that it fits in the window vertically.  \"Automatically Resize\" gets a checkmark next to it when it's selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAutomatically Resize scales a PDF page so it fits in the window horizontally, and doesn't continue to scale as the Safari window is resized. No checkmark appears next to \"Automatically Resize\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn Safari 6.0, Automatically Resize scales a PDF page so it fits in the window vertically, and continues to rescale as the Safari window is resized.  In Safari 6.0, \"Automatically Resize\" gets a checkmark next to it when it's selected."
