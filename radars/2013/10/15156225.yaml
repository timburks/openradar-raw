    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a project contains only a Static Library target and a Unit Test target for that library and you attempt to run the tests, Xcode either hangs or crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Xcode 5.0.1 on Mavericks 13A598\r\n2. File > New Project...\r\n3. Framework & Library > Cocoa Touch Static Library\r\n4. Give the Project the name \"SampleKit\" and create a git repo for it (on My Mac)\r\n5. Pick a simulator (not a device)\r\n6. Cmd + U to run the tests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnit tests to execute and complete (pass or fail)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs or Xcode crashes (see crash log below)\r\n\r\nIf the simulator was previously open, Xcode hangs\r\nIf the simulator was previously closed, Xcode crashes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode Version 5.0.1 (5A2034a)\r\nOSX Version 10.9 (13A598)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIf a new project is started as an iOS Application (e.g. Single View Application) and then a Cocoa Touch Static Library is added to the project and its tests are run (the library's not the app's), the tests execute correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 15138036 (Open/Closed)"
