    description: "I have much old App IDs in my \"Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles\" section. However, it is not possible to delete them. According to Stack Overflow the option was introduced in April 2013, but gone after the outage of last month. Please add the option to remove App IDs again.\r\n\r\nEspecially now Xcode 5 automatically creates development provisioning profiles (which works pretty good, up till now) it's important to keep the list of App IDs clean."
