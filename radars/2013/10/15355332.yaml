    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an UIControl is placed at the lower part of the screen it doesn't highlight (doesn't receive an UIControlEventTouchDown event either until TouchUpInside happens).\r\nIt looks like something is delaying the touches began in that part of the screen, maybe it happens because of the gestures to open Control Center on IOS 7.\r\nI did reproduce this issue using an iPad and I didn't test it on an iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Calendars app on an iPad.\r\nTap and hold one of the buttons in the bottom bar (Today, Calendars or Inbox).\r\nNotice that the button doesn't show the highlighted state unless you slightly move your finger. This bug does not happens with the add event button.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA user should be able to tap on a button consistently as long as it is enabled (iOS gestures shouldn't interfere with that).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIOS 7.0.3 running on an iPad."
