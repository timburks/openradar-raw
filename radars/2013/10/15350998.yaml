    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a multi-monitor setup the monitor that the application switcher (CMD+Tab) appears on is not user configurable. The application switcher appears on the monitor that the dock was last used on. As a user I find this behavior confusing and annoying. I would like to specify which monitor the application switcher appears on via System Preferences.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect multiple monitors to your system\r\n2. Interact with the dock on a monitor that does not currently show the application switcher\r\n3. The application switcher is now shown on the latest monitor that had dock interaction\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the application switcher to stay on the primary monitor as configured by the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application switcher moves to the monitor that last had dock interaction.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 GM Mavericks\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIssue is present on all Mavericks based systems that have multiple monitors. Issue is not present on Mountain Lion based systems.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
