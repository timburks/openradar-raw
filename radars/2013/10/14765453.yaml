    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 5, \"Use Storyboards\" is no longer an option when instantiating a project template, and storyboard use is required.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create a new project.\r\n- Find that you're forced to use Storyboards, or that you have to create a blank project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- We get the option of whether we want to use Storyboards, as was the case in Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- The template forces the use of Storyboards.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Storyboard usage is forced.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nXcode 3 was a perfectly usable IDE. I'm disappointed that Xcode 4 and 5 have abandoned much of what made Xcode 3 nice to use in favor of full-screen operation, infinite canvases, and a one-size-fits-all mentality about what your end-developers want and need."
