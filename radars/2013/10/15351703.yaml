    description: "A static cell background is showing up as white, despite setting that background color in the Storyboard. \r\n\r\nI have two storyboards, one for iPhone and one for iPad. I have two list views, both with static cells setup. Both have the same background color for static cells. The iPhone version shows up correctly, the iPad one does not. \r\n\r\nI have a work around that sets the background color in - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\r\n\r\nI would suspect that setting the background color of a static cell in the storyboard would set the background color correctly."
