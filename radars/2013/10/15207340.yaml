    description: "The issue list in Xcode's Issue Navigator loads too lazily. In older Xcode versions (e.g. 3) and even way back in CodeWarrior, I was able to click the \"Errors\" icon in the progress display in the center of the Xcode window, below the title, and it would select the first error.\r\n\r\nIn a large project, with a large number of errors and/or warnings (nearly 400 warnings in this case), the first error below the warnings loads later, so when I click the error icon, it opens the Issue Navigator and then has nothing to select or scroll to.\r\n\r\nI then have to manually scroll down and trigger a load of the error messages, suffering jumps in scroll position as the various sections unfold to get to the first error.\r\n\r\nIt would be appreciated if you could fix this issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Cause about 400 warnings and 20 errors in a project with lots of files, with the errors in a file that is low down in the error list\r\n2. Click the \"Error\" icon next to the number of errors at the top of the Xcode window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFirst error is scrolled in and selected in the Issue Navigator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIssue Navigator opens, scrolled to the top."
