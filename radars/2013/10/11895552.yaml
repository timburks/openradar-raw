    description: "A class which uses UISplitViewController can specify whether it wants the master (left) view controller to be shown or hidden by providing a delegate. The delegate method splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation: would then be called for various orientations.\r\n\r\nSince iOS 6.0 UISplitViewController caches the information from the delegate in UISplitViewController in order to avoid calling the delegate method many times.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a delegate is replaced (without destroying UISplitViewController), the cached information is not reset.\r\nThe result is that the method splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation: will NEVER be called on the new delegate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an app using UISplitViewController. Assign it a delegate. Show the split view controller. Assign a different delegate (returning a different value in its splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation: method)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe method splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation: must be called on the new delegate. This was the case before iOS6.0\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe method splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation: is NOT called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
