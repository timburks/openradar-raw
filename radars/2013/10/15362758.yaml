        Summary:
        The downloads folder in the dock is stuck showing a progress bar even though it is empty and nothing is downloading into it.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I'm not really sure how to reproduce it. It's happened since the Mavericks Betas, and is unpredictable as far as I can tell.

        Expected Results:
        After file downloads are complete, the progress bar under the dock icon disappears.

        Actual Results:
        Once this bug appears, the progress bar stays visible at all times until the computer is restarted. So far I have seen it stuck at 0% and 100%. The progress bar seems to be cumulative of all active downloads, so when an actual download starts it is reflected in the progress bar, but is affected by the bug as well.

        For example, right now the progress bar is always displaying 100%. If I start a download, the progress bar will drop down to maybe 80% and grow to 100% as the download finishes.

        Regression:
        Restarting the computer is a temporary fix.
