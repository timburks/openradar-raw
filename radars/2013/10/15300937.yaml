        Summary:

        When a UIWebView instance's `paginationMode` is set to `UIWebPaginationModeUnpaginated`, it is possible to make the web view completely transparent if the document loaded is also transparent. When the web view's `paginationMode` is set to `UIWebPaginationModeTopToBottom`, it is not possible to make the web view fully transparent.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Instantiate a UIWebView instance and set its `opaque` property to `NO`, its `backgroundColor` to `[UIColor clearColor]`, and its `paginationMode` to `UIWebPaginationModeTopToBottom`.

        2. Load the following HTML document into the web view, e.g. using `-[UIWebView loadHTMLString:baseURL:]`:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type="text/css">
                        body, html {
                            background-color:transparent !important;
                        }
                        h1 {
                            color: black;
                        }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <h1>Testing</h1>
                </body>
            </html>

        Note that the `background-color` of the `html` and `body` elements must be set to `transparent`.

        3. Set the background color of the web view's superview to something other than white, e.g. `[UIColor blueColor]`.

        Expected Results:

        If the web view is not opaque and its background color is clear, it should be fully transparent and you should see “Testing” in black on a blue background.

        Actual Results:

        The web view's background color defaults to opaque white when using the new pagination API introduced in the iOS 7 SDK.

        Regression:

        This bug was introduced with the iOS 7.0 SDK.

        Notes:

        Changing the pagination mode of the web view back to `UIWebPaginationModeUnpaginated` yields the expected visual appearance.
