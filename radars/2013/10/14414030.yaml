    description: "When UISearchDisplayController is used, UISearchBar is misplaced and has an incorrect frame after the search has ended.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Create a view controller with a table view.\r\n- Place this view controller inside a UINavigationController.\r\n- Use a custom table header view.\r\n- Make UISearchBar a subview of that custom table header view. Don't use a scope bar (default). The frame of UISearchBar must be (0,0, 320, 44).\r\n- Make use of UISearchDisplayController to initiate the search.\r\n- When the search has started, the UISearchBar is moved up and becomes active. At this stage UISearchBar is actually moved to a different parent view (which is managed by UISearchDisplayController).\r\n- Cancel the search.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- UISearchBar must be moved to its original parent view.\r\n- UISearchBar must have its original frame (0,0, 320, 44).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- UISearchBar is NOT moved to its original parent view (which is the custom table header view mentioned above).\r\n   Instead it's added a direct subview of UITableView (incorrect!).\r\n\r\n- The frame of UISearchBar is not restored to its original value. Instead, it becomes (0,0, 320, 88) (incorrect).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I was NOT using story boards and created the views programmatically."
