    description: "Summary:\nSwitching between applications happens without animation when pressing the home button 3 times instead of two (which occurs fairly often by accident) and tapping on an app other than the current on the task switcher. This feels really weird.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Be in the home screen.\n2. Press the home button 3 times consecutively.\n3. Tap on an application, not on the preview of the home screen.\n\nExpected Results:\nBecause you pressed the home screen 3 times, you should come back to the home screen.\n\nActual Results:\nYou come back to the home screen, and then it's swapped by the other application without animation. \n\nRegression:\nThis wasn't possible on iOS 6 because the multi tasking interface was different.\n\nNotes:\nThis can occur when inside an application, not just when on the home screen."
