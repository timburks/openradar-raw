        Summary:
        OSX teases retina MBP owners with the possibility of upgrading their RAM.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open "About this Mac"
        2. Press "More Info"
        3. Choose the "Memory" tab

        Expected Results:
        The description states "Your computer contains 16GB of built in memory"

        Actual Results:
        The description states "Your Mac contains 2 memory slots, each of which accepts a 1600 MHz DDR3 memory module." There is also a "Memory Upgrade Instructions" button.

        Notes:
        Since this model of Mac does not have upgradable RAM, the instructions are misleading.
