    description: "Summary: When presenting a UINavigationController via UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal, the status bar is cut off during the animation leading to a noticeable content jump once the animation is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a StoryBoard which has a manual modal segue (animations: yes, style: flip horizontal) from a view controller within a UINavigationController to another UINavigationController. When you press a button within the initial controller, trigger the segue; the flip animation occurs and the content is 20 points higher (due to ignoring the status bar) during the animation. Once the animation is complete, everything looks and works as it should. Dismiss the modal view, and the animation will happen in reverse and exhibits the same problem. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The navigation bar shouldnâ€™t move at all between animations. It should start underneath the status bar (20 points) and stay there through the animation.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results: The navigation bar frame of the controller you are animating to is shifted up 20 points during the animation but jumps to the correct position once the animation is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Xcode 5, iOS 7.0; tested on simulator and iPhone 5 and 4S.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: Other modal animations seem to be work fine and respect the status bar. It is just the horizontal flip that shifts the navigation bar during animation. Please note the shift is only on the navigation bar of the controller you are animating to and this happens regardless of whether you are presenting or dismissing (for example, when presenting Controller B from Controller A, Controller B will have the incorrect navigation bar during animation; when dismissing Controller B, it is Controller A that will have the incorrect navigation bar. I have reproduced this in a completely fresh project to verify that this happens with all default appearances."
