    description: "Summary:\r\nUISearchDisplayController calls the private method _deselectAllNonMultiSelectRowsAnimated when the view appears, which is not always desired. This is the equivalent to having clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear = YES for a UITableViewController. By forcing the private method _deselectAllNonMultiSelectRowsAnimated, there's no way to customize whether or not the selected cell in the UISearchDisplayController can remain selected.\r\n\r\nOne solution might be to expose a property similar to clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. User searches in a UISearchDisplayController and is presented with a list of choices.\r\n2. User taps a cell to get more detail, and a new view is popped in a UINavigationController\r\n3. User presses the UINavigationController backButton to return to the search because they tapped the wrong item.\r\n4. User thinks about selecting the next item\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser knows which item they just selected, and chooses a different one, if the developer adds that functionality.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelected item is always deselected, so user must guess which item was previously selected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
