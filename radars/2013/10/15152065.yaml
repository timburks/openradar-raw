    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to apply a newly created mail rule to existing messages, the rule is not applied, and selected messages remain in place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a message in the Inbox folder (or any other folder)\r\n2. Create a new rule applying to said message that includes a rule to move it to an existing folder (different from the original)\r\n3. Apply the rule, either through the Mail.app menu command Message > Apply rules, clicking Command-Option-L, or clicking Apply in the sheet that appears after creating the rule.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected message, or matching messages from the selection, would be moved to the folder selected in 2.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages remain in the same folder/mailbox (or at least are displayed as remaining in the folder; after closing Mail.app and opening it again they remain in the original folder).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9 Developer Preview 8, and GM (13A958) at least. Mail data was migrated from a Mac OS X 10.8.5 installation.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRules _do apply_ to newly received messages. It doesn't matter whether matching messages are selected or not when using Apply rules on previously existing messages.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
