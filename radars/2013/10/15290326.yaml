    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7.0.2, saving an image with UIImageJPEGRepresentation tints the image with a slightly purple color. Other versions of iOS such as iOS 6 do not have this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 5.0\r\n2. Download and upload sample code.\r\n3. Use the sample code to select an image from the camera roll using UIImagePickerController. (It is easiest to notice the bug by choosing a black and white image).\r\n4. The sample code converts the selected UIImage to NSData using UIImageJPEGRepresentation.\r\n5. It creates a UIImage from that NSData and displays it on screen.\r\n6. By tapping on the image, you can easily switch between the original image, and the image after JPEG compression and restore, this way you can see how the images differ.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image after converting to JPEG data and then back should look almost identical to the original image. There should be no noticeable color differences. This is the behavior on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou should see that the image from the JPEG compression is tinted purple and differs noticeably \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote, using a black and white image to test with, will most noticeably display the purple tint.\r\nThis bug is not reproducible in the simulator, only on the device. \r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots from the sample project using iOS 7.0.2 on my iPhone 5s.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed this bug in the Twitter.app.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 7\r\niPhone 5s\r\nXcode 5.0\r\nOSX Mavericks\r\n\r\nOriginal Image:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/0IPRrKm\r\n\r\nImage after JPEG Compression:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/kRQgFpZ\r\n\r\nSample Project:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d895jop3694a3ad/Purple%20Tint%20Bug%20Sample%20Project.zip"
