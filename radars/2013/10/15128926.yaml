    description: "Summary:\r\nSample project described in \"Steps to reproduce\" shows a simple iPhone project with a UISearchBar attached to the top of the screen. The project is correctly configured for the search bar background to extend behind the status bar. However this only happens when no search display controller is used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open this Xcode project in Xcode 5 https://github.com/rjsdev/SearchDisplayControllerBugDemo.git\r\n\r\n2. Build and run in iPhone Simulator.\r\n\r\n3. Comment out lines 24-26 in RJSViewController.m.\r\n\r\n4. Build and run again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUISearchBar background extends under status bar on both runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUISearchBar background does not extend under status bar on first run, where the search bar is linked to a search display controller.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 (11A465)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will submit a separate report about appearance of search bar compared with other bars, which is also illustrated by this sample project."
