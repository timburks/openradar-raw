    description: "Jonathon Mah09-Oct-2013 00:22 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nUILabel instances with a custom class set in Interface Builder - both an empty subclass an a nonexistent subclass (which falls back to UILabel itself at runtime) aren't given localized strings, and retain the Base localization value set in the nib / storyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun attached project with Xcode 5.0 (5A1413). Uses iOS 7 SDK.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll three labels in the attached project get their target localization, \"en value\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UILabel instance with no custom class gets the localized value; the custom subclass and the nonexistent subclass retain their value in the Base.lproj storyboard of \"Base value\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0 (5A1413)\r\nDevelopment machine is running 10.8.5 (12F45)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'UILabel Subclass Bug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
