    description: "When using a UISearchBar in connection with UISearchDisplayController the \"Cancel\" button besides the search field has a rather small touch target that is easy to miss.\r\n\r\nOther elements in the navigation bar have huge touch targets that cover the complete height of the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nUISearchBar's Cancel button has a touch target not higher than 30 pt."
