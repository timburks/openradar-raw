        Summary:
        Mail.app asks for my iCloud password every time I start Mail.app. Mail.app also greets me with the “New to mail.app“ welcome screen that should only come on the first launch.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have an iCloud Email account configured. Launch Mail.app.

        Expected Results:
        Mail.app should remember the password for iCloud in the keychain when instructed to do so by checking the “remember password in keychain“ checkbox.

        Actual Results:
        Mail.app always asks for the iCloud password upon launch.

        Regression:
        This happens on a 10.8.5 system migrated to Mavericks GM.

        Notes:
        Verification of the Keychain did not show any problems.
