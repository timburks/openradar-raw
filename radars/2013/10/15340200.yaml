        Summary:

        When swiping a cell from the edge of the screen from the right to the left (where the "i" button is also located) it displays the "remove" button but often also activates the "i" button, which causes a new view controller to be pushed.

        This is confusing, because one would assume that it will simply display the Delete button rather that displaying the Details.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        * Create a table view cell with an Details accessory view ("i"), and a editing style of UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete.
        * Swipe the cell from right to left, with the initial touch being on the Details accessory view.

        Expected Results:

        * When the swipe gesture ends, the Delete button is made visible and stays there.

        Actual Results:

        * When the swipe gesture ends, the Delete button is made visible, but the Details accessory view is activated â€” which most of the time causes a new view controller to be pushed.
