    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I setting a table view cell background color to something other than white in a NIB or storyboard, that color gets changed to white sometime after the NIB is loaded.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour appears to affect iPad only. When running on an iPhone, I see the table view cell background colors that I expect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Main.storyboard in the attached sample. Note that the single prototype cell has a black background color.\r\n2. Run the app in the iPhone simulator. Note that the cells are black as expected.\r\n3. Run the app in the iPad simulator. Note that the cells are white.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPad cells should be black as specified in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cells are being set to white by the framework at some point.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM (11A465)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: The background color can be customized in -[UITableViewDataSource tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:] or in -[UITableViewDelegate tableView:willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath:]\r\n\r\nSample Project:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o2ebkqvkmnuz8ns/CellColour.zip"
