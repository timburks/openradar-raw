    description: "Summary:\r\nSince each team must be registered from a DUNS number, both the names are exactly the same because the team name will take the company name from the DUNS account.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to distinguish from the two teams when logging into the developer portal.\r\n\r\nIt also makes it really difficult when producing builds, since you have two certificates with the same name for each account. I often have to go into the keychain and delete one (by looking up the team ID). This certificate is often re-added back to the keychain by Xcode and doesn't always work.\r\n\r\n\"Code Sign error: Certificate identity 'iPhone Distribution: Company LTD' appears more than once in the keychain. The codesign tool requires there only be one.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a developer team with a business account from a DUNS number\r\n2. Create a secondary team for an enterprise account from the same DUNS number\r\n3. Log into the Apple ID which is associated with these two teams.\r\n4. You are taken to a \"Select Your Team\" screen at https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/selectTeam.action (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPotentially naming the enterprise one \"Company (Enterprise)\" or providing some way to differentiate between them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBoth teams have the exact same name, so you do not know which one is which.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the teams on the account \"[redacted]\".\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-10-02 at 18.30.32.png' was successfully uploaded."
