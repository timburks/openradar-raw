    description: "Summary:\r\nThe updated look of Pages 5 has done away with the side bar that shows all tracked changes and notes. However, when collaborating on a project such as a scientific document, it's important to see the notes and changes at a glance. This is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if showing all changes and notes in the left sidebar and turning off the (rather annoying) hover popups would be possible.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nPages 5.0 (1465)\r\nOS X Mavericks 10.9 (13A603)"
