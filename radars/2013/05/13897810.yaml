    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://12863734\n\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf an attributed string contains both a font attribute as well as a paragraph style attribute that sets minimum/maximum line height those line height constraints are ignored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an attributed string that contains a font and paragraph style attribute. Make sure the paragraph style attribute sets a minimum and maximum line height that is less than the font line height.\r\nSet this attributed string on a UITextView's attributedString property.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe lines should be spaced by the amount of the specified minimum/maximum.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe lines are spaced as they would be without the paragraph style settings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUITextView only supports attributed strings since iOS 6. Since then this is broken.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to result if you have multiple different fonts, like when you have some bold or italic text in the string."
