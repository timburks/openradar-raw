        Summary:
        Instruments for run loops would be very useful. Specifically, I would like to see:

        1. Each thread with a run loop
        2. What modes it was running in, when it was running in them, and when it changed
        3. Reentrant run looping, like when you run a modal loop in the action of a control
        4. When it was stopped, when it was run, paused, limit modes, etc; basically all the run loop state available in CFRunLoop and NSRunLoop.
        5. Run loop sources, especially stuff like timers.
        6. For the main run loop, how it interacts with the main dispatch queue, user input events, autorelease pools, and so forth.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        N/A

        Expected Results:
        N/A

        Actual Results:
        N/A

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        Thanks! :)
