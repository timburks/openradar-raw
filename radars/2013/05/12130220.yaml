    description: "20-Aug-2012 09:52 AM Andrew Harrison:\r\nSummary: When an email account is disabled, the notification settings for that account are not restored when the account is re-enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. In Settings, open Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\r\n2. Select an email account that has notifications turned on\r\n3. Turn the Mail account off with the toggle.\r\n4. Wait a moment and then turn the Mail account back on with the toggle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The email account should have the notification settings restored to the way they were set up before the account was turned off.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The email account's notification settings are set to what seems to be \"default\" settings (?) As follows:\r\n- Notification Center is OFF\r\n- Alert Style is set to None\r\n- Badge App Icon is ON\r\n- New Mail Sound is set to Ding\r\n- Show Preview is ON\r\n- View in Lock Screen is OFF\r\n\r\nIn my test, Notification Center, Alert Style and View in Lock Screen were set differently prior to the account being disabled. The notifications system follows these settings.\r\n\r\nRegression: I turn my work email account on my phone off every Friday afternoon and turn it back on the following Monday morning. I noticed this straight away on the Monday after installing iOS6b4, and did not notice it in earlier betas. I have not tested this in iOS5.\r\n\r\nNotes: I have tested this with multiple email accounts set up in different ways - Exchange, Gmail, iCloud, IMAP/POP etc. and all behave the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n03-May-2013 04:44 PM Andrew Harrison:\r\nThis bug persists with the same behaviour as described above in every version of iOS6 including the latest iOS6.1.4 release.\r\n\r\n16-Jun-2013 09:18 AM Andrew Harrison:\r\nThe bug is present in iOS7b1 with the same behaviour as described above."
