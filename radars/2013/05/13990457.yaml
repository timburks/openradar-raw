    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a UIRefreshControl is present in a table view that is too small, it becomes impossible to activate because the view cannot be over-scrolled far enough.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open Mail app on an iPhone\r\n2) Rotate to landscape\r\n3) Try to refresh using the UIRefreshControl\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is possible to refresh mail using only one finger.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA very tricky manoeuvre using two fingers is required to activate the control.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt would probably be best if the amount of over-scroll required to activate a UIRefreshControl was proportional to the frame height of the UITableView that contained it."
