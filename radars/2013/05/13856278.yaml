    description: "Apple lists a number of developer related certificates at http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/.\r\n\r\nAll CAs can be installed in System Keychain with Basic Constraints set to Trusted; and all other settings can be set to Untrusted sans \"Code Signing\". In addition, the Timestamp CA is set to allow \"Time Stamping\" (and does not require \"Code Signing\").\r\n\r\nHowever, for Worldwide Developer Relations CA, the settings must be \"Use Default Settings\" which appears to be \"do anything you want with anything you would like\", or \"everything fully trusted\". Apple's CPS for WWDR does not discuss the need for additional capabilities and usage (http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/Apple_WWDR_CPS).\r\n\r\nIf the settings for Worldwide Developer Relations CA are Basic Constraints and Code Signing, Code Signing will fail with:\r\n\r\n.../DerivedData/XXX-YYY/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/XXX.app: CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED\r\nCommand /usr/bin/codesign failed with exit code 1\r\n\r\nFiled under UI/Usability, even though violating Principal of Least Privilege is often a Security bug (confer, Android and app permissions). Please feel free to change."
