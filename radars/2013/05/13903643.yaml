    description: "15-May-2013 02::\r\nSummary: The NSTextAttachmentCell protocol reference states that NSCell implements all but . NSCell does not actually implement most of those methods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa application (or any app that links AppKit).\r\n2. Call [[NSCell class] instancesRespondToSelector:@selector(cellFrameForTextContainer:proposedLineFragment:glyphPosition:characterIndex:)]\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The call to +instancesRespondToSelector: returns YES.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The call to +instancesRespondToSelector: returns NO.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNSCell does not actually declare conformance to NSTextAttachmentCell (with good reason, since it is documented to not implement 's methods); however, it also does not redeclare or describe a significant portion of those methods as that protocol's documentation states.\r\n\r\nSample code is attached.\r\n\r\n15-May-2013 02::\r\n'nscell-textattachment-selectors.m' was successfully uploaded\r\n[ed. note: code at https://gist.github.com/lithium3141/5587371]"
