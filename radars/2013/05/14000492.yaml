        When the phone alarm goes off, you should send it to bluetooth headsets/devices as an incoming call. Use a caller ID string of "Alarm:" followed by the alarm's name.

        If the user uses the bluetooth device to reject the call, it should silence the alarm.

        This feature should be optional, with a setting under Notification settings.

        Example use case: I've used my phone alarm to wake me up, but I snoozed it rather than silencing it. I'm now in the shower, but I'm still wearing my (waterproof) Pebble watch. The alarm goes off again, threatening to wake up all my housemates.
