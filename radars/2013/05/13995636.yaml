    description: "my bad -- apparently, the unwind action methods needs to be declared on the VC you're going back to (or perhaps in a protocol or category to reduce coupling). so, not a bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n27-May-2013 02:31 PM Chris Adamson:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhile it is possible to set up an unwind segue on a cell in a UITableView, it does nothing useful: it does not unwind to the previous view controller, and sometimes doesn't even call its connected action or prepareForSegue:.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnzip the attached SelectAndUnwindBuglet Xcode project. It consists of the following storyboard:\r\n\r\n-(initial-VC)->[navigation controller]-(root-VC)->[SNFViewController]-(segue)->[SNFPickControllerViewController]\r\n\r\nThe idea of this app is that the user will press a button to bring up the table VC (SNFPickControllerViewController), pick an item from the table, and be immediately returned to the first VC, with their pick indicated.\r\n\r\nThis is set up by connecting the table cell's selection to an unwind segue, pickAndUnwind:.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect selecting a row to call prepareForSegue, then pickAndUnwind:, and then return to the previous view controller (using whatever transition got us here in the first place: modal, nav controller push, whatever)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf the segue is of type \"push\", prepareForSegue:and pickAndUnwind: are called, but the segue is never actually unwound. In other words, we stay on the table VC.\r\n\r\nIf the segue is of type \"modal\", nothing happens at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApparently, canPerformUnwindSegueAction:fromViewController:withSender: must return YES for even the \"push\" case to work.\r\n\r\n27-May-2013 02:31 PM Chris Adamson:\r\n'SelectAndUnwindBuglet.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n[OpenRadar readers: sample code at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12216224/buglets/SelectAndUnwindBuglet.zip ]"
