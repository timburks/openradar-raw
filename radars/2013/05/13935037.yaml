    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nLocalizing a xib in an iOS project that uses \"Base Internationalization\" causes a crash when debugging the app on device or in simulator, but the crash magically stops when you quit Xcode and relaunch Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\n\r\n(Assumes a project that has chosen \"Use Base Internationalization\" in the Project's Info)\r\n\r\n1. Click on a .xib resource in the File Navigator, which loads Interface Builder\r\n\r\n2. Using the File Inspector, click the Localize button\r\n\r\n3. A modal presents asking which language you would like to use (\"Base\" was unavailable to me, so I picked \"English\")\r\n\r\n    3a. Try to clean, build, and run to device or simulator - crash with message: ***Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Could not load NIB in bundle:***\r\n\r\n4. In the Localized section of the File Inspector place a checkmark is next next to Base\r\n\r\n    4a. Try to clean, build, and run to device or simulator - crash with the same message as before\r\n\r\n5. From the picker for the English internationalization, already selected is \"Interface Builder Cocoa Touch XIB\" so let's try \"Localizable Strings\"\r\n\r\n    5a. Try to clean, build, and run to device or simulator - crash with the same message as before\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAny of those mid-point clean, build, and run steps should have worked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOnly upon quitting Xcode and relaunching Xcode will the project build and run without problems.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI only can confirm that after going through all five steps and finally quitting the crashes stop.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
