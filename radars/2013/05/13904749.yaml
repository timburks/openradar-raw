    description: "15-May-2013 02::\r\nSummary: Creating a custom subclass of NSTextAttachmentCell that overrides -cellFrameForTextContainer:proposedLineFragment:glyphPosition:characterIndex: and calling the superclass' implementation from the debugger inside that method crashes Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa application.\r\n2. Add a custom subclass of NSTextAttachmentCell. Override -cellFrameForTextContainer:proposedLineFragment:glyphPosition:characterIndex: to do nothing but return the superclass's result.\r\n3. Set a breakpoint inside the overridden method.\r\n4. Write the rest of the app such that the overridden method gets called. (Sample code attached.)\r\n5. When the debugger stops at the set breakpoint in the overridden method, issue the following command:\r\n\r\np (NSRect)[super cellFrameForTextContainer:textContainer proposedLineFragment:lineFrag glyphPosition:position characterIndex:charIndex]\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The debugger prints a nicely formatted NSRect that NSTextAttachmentCell's implementation of the method in question returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Xcode crashes. No Problem Reporter window appears, and no crash report is saved to ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes: Sample code attached. Set a breakpoint at CFSCAppDelegate.m:32.\r\n\r\n15-May-2013 02::\r\n'CellFrameSuperCrash.zip' and 'rmbp.spx' were successfully uploaded"
