    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening files for printing in another application from a sandboxed app may fail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. In a sandboxed app, choose to print a file, such as a PDF, with Preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe file is opened and printed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing happens. A message such as this is logged in Console:\r\n\r\nappleeventsd[53]: Sandboxed application with pid 41542 attempted to lookup App:\"Preview\"/4037/0x0:0x125125 prvw1110 sess=100004 but was denied due to sandboxing. (handleMessage()/appleEventsD.cp #2067) com.apple.coreservices.appleevents.peer.0x7f938300a3f0.xpcq\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe method used to print is NSWorkspace's -openURLs:withAppBundleIdentifier:options:additionalEventParamDescriptor:launchIdentifiers with the options (NSWorkspaceLaunchAndPrint | NSWorkspaceLaunchDefault), and nil passed for everything else but the array of NSURLs.\r\n\r\nBoth apps are sandboxed and have the printing entitlement.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to open the file and then print it.\r\n\r\nOpening and printing may succeed if the file is stored in some locations, for example a subfolder of ~/Library/Mobile Documents which is not the target app's folder."
