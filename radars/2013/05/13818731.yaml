    description: "06-May-2013 01:09 PM Tim Ekl:\r\nSummary: Clicking twice on the detail chevron next to a song title when viewing a playlist will cause the button to disappear after the popover is dismissed; a third click will then select the song.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new playlist. Add at least one song to it.\r\n2. View that playlist. Hover the mouse over the song; the contextual button will appear next to its title.\r\n3. Click the contextual button twice in succession (at any speed).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The detail popover is presented and dismissed, leaving the contextual button visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The detail popover is presented and dismissed, but the contextual button also disappears.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown, but not an issue before iTunes 11 (when this button was introduced).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* The button appears to behave correctly in other views (e.g. all music by artist).\r\n* Moving the mouse any amount causes the button to reappear.\r\n* If the mouse is not moved, subsequent clicks behave as the user would expect (a single click selects the song, a double-click begins playing it, etc.)"
