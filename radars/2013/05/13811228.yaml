        Summary:

        Right now, storing binary data such as images and movies inside Core Data requires double handling to load NSData blobs into memory and then pass them off to media frameworks such as AVFoundation. It would be great to be able to address binary data that allows external storage via a URL, so that AVFoundation and other frameworks could just read the data directly from Core Data themselves.

        It's more of a convenience than anything, but it would be nice to have!
