    description: "10-May-2013 04:00 PM Jesse Peterson:\r\nSummary: When authenticating using a username and password the authentication takes an unacceptably long time (roughly 0.1 to 0.25 seconds) and opendirectoryd CPU usage spikes greatly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Execute in a terminal:\r\n\r\nwhile true; do date; dscl /Search auth username password; done\r\n\r\nDo replace username and password with the username and password of either a local user or remote user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Very fast scrolling of dates - say hundreds or thousands per second. Each time a date is printed an authentication has happened.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Only 3-4 authentications happen a second, and opendirectoryd uses close to 100% CPU during this test.\r\n\r\nRegression: All OS X systems exhibit behaviour.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHave noticed this issue with PAM authentication, too, using the pam_opendirectory.so module. Would like to implement PAM authentication for a web server, but this incredibly slow authentication makes this impossible."
