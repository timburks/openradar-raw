    description: "When my backup disk reaches full capacity, Time Machine keeps prompting me with the attached message:\r\n\r\n\"Time Machine couldnâ€™t complete the backup to \"Gambit\".\r\n\r\nThe backup disk ran out of space unexpectedly. Time Machine will try to make more space available by removing expired backups during the next scheduled backup.\r\n\r\nOpen Time Machine preferences to select a larger backup disk or make the backup smaller by excluding files.\"\r\n\r\nTime machine doesn't appear to be removing expired backups, because when my disk becomes full, these messages start happening every time the backup job runs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Enable Time Machine\r\n2) Wait for backup disk to become full\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTime Machine would remove expired backups to allow new backups to successfully complete.  If unable to remove backups, Time Machine would tell me WHY it was unable to do so.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTime Machine does NOT remove expired backups, and I am continually prompted by the attached message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nOnly tested on 10.8.x\r\n\r\nNotes:"
