    description: "25-May-2013 01:33 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen replying or forwarding, iCloud webmail adds localized prefixes to the subjects such as \"Ri: \" and \"I: \" (for the Italian version).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login to www.icloud.com.\r\n2. Open the webmail app.\r\n3. Try to reply of forward an e-mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niCloud should add the \"Re: \" (for a reply) and \"Fw: \" (for a forward) prefixes to the subject of the original e-mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCloud adds the localized versions of the standard prefixes, such us \"Re: \" (for a reply) and \"I: \" (for a forward) in the Italian webmail version.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI am sure the problem exists in the Italian iCloud webmail version but I've not been able to test other localizations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor the sake of the worldwide e-mail system compatibility, the \"Re: \" and \"Fw: \" prefixes should never be localized.\r\n\r\nAccording to RFC 5322, it doesn't make any sense to localize the \"Re: \" prefix, since it stands for the Latin \"in re\":\r\n“When used in a reply, the field body MAY start with the string \"Re: \" (an abbreviation of the Latin \"in re\", meaning \"in the matter of\") followed by the contents of the \"Subject:\" field body of the original message.”\r\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.5\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, exchanging e-mails with users of other e-mail clients, or even with iCloud webmail users that use it in another language, would lead to subjects like:\r\n\"Re: Ri: Re: Ri: This is really silly.\"\r\nFor the same reason it makes sense to not localize the \"Fw: \" prefix.\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Jul-2013 11:48 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following:\r\n\r\nChanged all back to \"Re:\" and \"Fwd:\"\r\nmme.coreweb.mail._ComposeMessage.ReSubjectText\r\nmme.coreweb.mail._ComposeMessage.FwdSubjectText\r\nmme.coreweb.mail._ComposeMessage.FwSubjectText\r\nFix will be visible in Production after July 1.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether that helps you resolve the issue by updating your bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\n12-Jul-2013 02:43 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
