    description: "03-May-2013 02:38 PM Daniel Keogan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCreating a CIImage from some PNG files discards color information, without reporting any error or problem with the file. The same file is handled correctly by UIImage and all image utilities I tried (e.g. Photoshop and Preview).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached project. The project is Apple's PocketCoreImage sample code with a single change; it now loads my PNG instead of the included one.\r\n\r\nThe issue is reproducible on the simulator (6.1) and an iPhone 5 running 6.0.1 10A525)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen no filter is applied the image should be color.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCIImage is the monochrome version of the image (i.e. color information has been lost).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
