    description: "10-May-2013 03:26 PM Stewart Gleadow:\r\nSummary:\r\nBeing able to run unit tests from the command line is essential to make the tests useful. Currently, it is possible to run logic tests from the command line by passing TEST_AFTER_BUILD=YES into the xcodebuild command. However, it is not possible to run application unit tests in the same way. There are various hacks available on the internet in order to do this, but they are unsupported and often break with new versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\nIdeally, unit tests (whether logic or application) should run using 'xcodebuild test' and specifying the necessary workspace/scheme/project/target arguments."
