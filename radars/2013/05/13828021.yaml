    description: "Summary: With MapKit in iOS 6 running on an iPhone 4, the map views in third party apps are very sluggish, extremely so in some cases. This is not the case in the Maps app on the same device which although not as smooth as on iPhone 4S or iPhone 5 running iOS 6, remains quite alright.\r\nA third party app using MapKit should expect the same rendering performances.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Attached is a sample project. Run this on an iPhone 4 with any version of iOS 6. Compare the panning and sliding animation performance with this app to that of Maps.app running on the same device. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: iPhone 4 with its limited hardware probably can't render and animate the maps interface as smoothly as later devices, but the performance remains okay, all third party apps using MapKit and the Map View should expect the same performances.\r\n\r\nActual Results: MKMapView's rendering and animation performances are significantly poorer then that of Maps.app running on the same device.\r\n\r\n** sample project can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/danielphillips/mapkit-performance-demo-app"
