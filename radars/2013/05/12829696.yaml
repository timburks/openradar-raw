    description: "Summary: It is impossible to play iTunes match songs in a music app built on AVFoundation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Try to play an iTunes match song using AVFoundation that is not on the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Be able to note the nil asset URL, trigger a download using some API call, receive notification when the download is complete, play the song.\r\n\r\nActual Results: We need to tell the user that they cannot play the song (or they need to switch to the OS Music app to trigger a download then come back to our app). User is sad or angry or confused.\r\n\r\nNotes: We have a crossfading DJ app that users and the press really love, but the #1 complaint from reviewers and press is that it can't download iTunes match songs that they want to play.\r\n\r\nPrototypical user response: \"Great app! Unfortunately it isn't compatible with iTunes Match. So kinda wasted 2 bucks.\"\r\n\r\nFrom iMore.com: \"It wasn't all rock and roll; because Party Monster uses the iOS music library, you're limited to on-device DRM-free music. That means that older songs from iTunes won't play, but more notably it means that you'll be hearing a lot of silence if you rely heavily on iTunes Match.\"\r\n\r\nMore than 50% of our support email is from this issue.\r\n\r\nWe realize that if you use the simpler MPMedia APIs it will handle iTunes Match, but this isn't an option for a crossfading, beat matching, seamless DJ app.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration!\r\n\r\nAllen Pike\r\nSteamclock Software"
