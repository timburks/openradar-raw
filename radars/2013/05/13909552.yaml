    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iWork Technical Production role with req. #11157798 asks for a \"technical production ninja\". The word \"ninja\" in this context is misapplied, and could lead to good candidates ignoring the role.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Think \"I'm a qualified candidate with many years of experience, I'll see what jobs Apple have for someone like me.\"\r\n2. Search jobs.apple.com\r\n3. Find req. #11157798\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4a. Job req describes in neutral terms the role and the expected skills of the candidate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4b. Job req describes the role using martial language, biasing applications towards people who identify with militaristic concepts.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe divisive nature of terms like \"ninja\" or \"rock star\" in job reqs is widely documented, e.g. http://ask.metafilter.com/222159/The-path-to-programming-rockstardom. Hopefully Apple is actually willing to consider candidates with a diverse range of backgrounds and interests, and turning some of them away in the title of the position was an unfortunate accident.\r\n\r\n\"Please report this issue directly at http://www.apple.com/contact/feedback. This issue is now closed.\""
