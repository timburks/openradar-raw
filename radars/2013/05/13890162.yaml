    description: "I have been working on SSL features of the AFNetworking library, and will soon be refactoring that code to make it more testable as we stand up a unit testing framework around library. We expose the ability to allow an invalid ssl certificate, as well as advanced SSL pinning options which provide increased network security for a mobile app.\r\n\r\nHowever, when digging deep into the NSURLConnectionDelegate callback methods, I found that connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: only gets called once, prevented me from actually applying different behavior in the future after that credential has first been applied.\r\n\r\nDigging deeper, it looks like this is a result of the TLS cache hanging around for 10 minutes, per this Q&A doc:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1727/_index.html\r\n\r\nIn addition, that doc links to a rdar://8957312, which describes what I need here: A way to flush the cache.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a request to allow a developer to flush that cache if necessary."
