        Summary:
        ObjC currently supports indexed and keyed subscript methods for access and assignment:

        array[0];
        array[0] = value;
        dictionary[@"key"];
        dictionary[@"key"] = value;

        I would like to add unindexed, unkeyed assignment syntax to that list:

        array[] = value;

        Regardless of what message selector this would be mapped onto, it would be intended to be used on e.g. NSMutableArray and NSMutableSet as a synonym for -addObject:. It would not be implemented on NSMutableDictionary, since assignment to a dictionary without a key does not make sense.

        I do not know if an additional access syntax would make sense:

        id object = set[];

        If so, I would presume this would effectively be a synonym for -anyObject.
