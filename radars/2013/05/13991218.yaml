        Summary:
        It is a common need to make changes to an NSURLRequest for a UIWebView, regardless of navigation type. However, officially there is no way to do this.

        Unofficially, many have found that the request passed in to webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType: is often mutable, and making changes to it will affect the load. However this is undocumented can cause other issues.

        Instead, there should be a callback that returns an NSURLRequest that can make changes to the request.
