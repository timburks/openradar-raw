        Summary:
        After migration from OS X Server 10.6.8 to 10.8.3 it is not possible to authenticate ANY DAV based service anymore. This affects Calendar Server, Contacts Server and Webservices.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have 10.6.8 server running fine with iCal-, Addressbook- and Webservices with WebDAV. Downgrade your server system from 10.6.8 to 10.8.3 to get rid of these working services.

        Expected Results:
        I expect these services to be working after a migration.

        Actual Results:
        CalDAV can't be used anymore, login is not possible. Even a correct password will always be rejected.
        The same goes for contacts server (CardDAV). WebDAV isn't possible anymore since the configuration options have been removed from OS X Server. The existing and formerly working configuration is removed as well.

        Regression:
        Only seems to affect Open Directory Users, not accounts in the local directory.

        Notes:
        This renders existing services unusable with no know or documented way to fix them. Effectively a denial of service forcing either a complete new installation which is out of the range for most installations or a switch to another operating system and server solution which is cheaper.
