    description: "Summary:\r\nNow that we can use bluetooth keyboards with our Apple TVs it would be amazing if we could enter iTunes gift codes directly on the big screen. Some of us do have additional foreign iTunes account which they do only use on the Apple TV. So to redeem gift cards we always need to take another device, log out the own main iTunes account, log in to the foreign account, see the message that this account uses another country's store, redeem the voucher, log out of that account and finally log in to the main account. This is rather annoying.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a button within settings or the account management that allowed us to enter coupon codes. Maybe a button on the bottom of the 'start page' like on the iPad App Store app would be fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such button.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm using a second generation Apple TV w/ 5.2.1 installed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
