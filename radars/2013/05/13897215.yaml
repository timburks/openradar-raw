    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nSubmitting an app that contains a nested executable (in our case, a droplet template) fails with Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8.3. Xcode validates the (parent) app, uploading via Xcode's Organizer works flawlessly, but a few minutes later, you get an email pointing out a sandboxing problem:\r\n\r\n\"App sandbox not enabled - The following executables must include the \"com.apple.security.app-sandbox\" entitlement with a Boolean value of true in the entitlements property list. Refer to the App Sandbox page for more information on sandboxing your app.\r\n\r\nName Mangler 3.app/Contents/Resources/Prototype Droplet.app/Contents/MacOS/Prototype Droplet\"\r\n\r\nThis is not true. Examining the Xcode archive that was just uploaded (cf. NOTES) reveals that the executable in question _is_ sandboxed. There don't seem to be any codesigning problems either.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1) Archive an app that contains a nested executable with Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8.3.\r\n2) Upload via Xcode's Organizer. (Alternatively, export an installer package and upload that via Application Loader. The result is the same.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe app's status switches to \"Waiting for Review\".\r\n\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\nAfter the app passes validation and Xcode uploads it successfully, the upload is ultimately rejected based on the incorrect assertion that sandboxing is not enabled for the nested executable.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected with Xcode 4.4 on OS X 10.7.5, otherwise following the same steps described above for the unaltered same Xcode project. That's how we got the last three versions of the app into the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\n(Not tested: Xcode 4.4 on OS X 10.8.x.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nAttached is a zipped Xcode archive of the affected app, as archived by Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8.3. This is the very same archive that was rejected by Apple earlier today, before we successfully re-uploaded with Xcode 4.4 on OS X 10.7.5.\r\n\r\nAlso, if Apple keeps track of failed submissions/uploads, Name Mangler 3's (Bundle ID: com.manytricks.NameMangler.MAS3; Apple ID: 603637384) submission history might be of interest."
