    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen instantiating MKMapView in code, the initializer will crash if given a frame that has a negative size in either or both directions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  include the code [[MKMapView allloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, -100, -100)]; in a view controllers loadView method. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalling [[MKMapView allloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, -100, -100)]; returns nil like other UIView subclasses that cannot be instatiated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCalling [[MKMapView allloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, -100, -100)]; causes the app to crash with EXEC_BAD_ACCESS\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown, I don't have access to any iOS versions lower than 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis normally should not be an issue but if the maps frame is calculated at runtime it is possible that a negatively sized frames could result. In such cases MKMapView should behave like its parent class UIView and validate the frame and return nil if the view cannot be created."
