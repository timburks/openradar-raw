    description: "17-May-2013 04:19 PM Jeremy Sherman:\r\nSummary:\r\nA label name including a literal newline will not be truncated at one line but will flow text over following elements.\r\n\r\nConstraints including the name show the same behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a view XIB.\r\n- Start editing the XIB.\r\n- Show the document outline.\r\n- Add a label.\r\n- Duplicate the label a few times.\r\n- Go to the first label and change it to allow 2 lines.\r\n- Enter 2 lines of text with a newline in the middle. (I think Opt-Return might do it, or just copy-paste from TextEdit.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Either the label entry in the outline is 2 lines large, or the label name is truncated to fit in one line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The label name (which incorporates the label text by default) overlaps following entries. This also affects constraints including the name.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- ???\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Screenshot attached.\r\n\r\n17-May-2013 04:19 PM Jeremy Sherman:\r\n'Captura de pantalla 2013-05-17 a la(s) 16.12.05.png' was successfully uploaded"
