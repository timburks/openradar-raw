    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUITextView draws its text at a different y offset if textColor is set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a UITextView instance, add it to a view, observe where the text is drawn within the UITextView. Then set  textColor with any color and rebuild, notice that the text is now drawn at a different y offset than when textColor was not set.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUITextView should draw its text at the same offset regardless of whether textColor is set or not.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUITextView draws its text at a different y offset when textColor is set.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI Don't have a previous SDK to test with, but I haven't noticed this in the past."
