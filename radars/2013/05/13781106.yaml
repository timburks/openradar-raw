    description: "Summary:\nSound out doesn't follow the display in closed clamshell mode\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open safari and load a page with videos or music (trailers.apple.com will work fine)\n2. Close the lid and let the mac sleep.\n3. Wait 5 minutes or so\n4. Connect Apple USB keyboard to mini DP Cinema Display\n5. While keeping Mac closed, connect it to a mini DP Cinema Display - first USB, then DP, then power \n6. Press the space bar to wake the mac\n7. Check mail, do some work, whatever\n8. Go back to safari and play the video / music\n\nExpected Results:\nSound should play from the cinema display. When the Mac is closed clamshell the internal screen should be off and the internal speakers should be de-selected. Always, by default, and reliably. I never want to use the MacBook FaceTime Camera, display, microphone or speakers while in clamshell mode and shouldn't have to fiddle with the system preferences to do so.\n\nActual Results:\nSound plays from inside the Mac speakers, and not the speakers of the cinema display.\n\nRegression:\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\n\nNotes:\nworkaround is to open system prefs, go to sound, go to output, select display audio"
