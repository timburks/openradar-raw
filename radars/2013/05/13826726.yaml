    description: "Summary:\r\nOn 15\" or 13\" monitor when both the Navigator and Utility panels are open the visible area for editing the xib is very small (especially for iPad's xib) and we have to continuously scroll and it's impossible to have a full view of the xib. Despite it's possible to zoom when editing a Storyboard this is not possible when editing a single xib. It would very useful to add the ability to zoom in & out in the xib editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a xib\r\n2. Open the Navigator and Utility panel or other panels\r\n3. Scroll repeatedly\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
