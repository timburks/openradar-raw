    description: "Summary: Apple provided reachability code (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Reachability)  was last updated to support iOS4.0.  iOS now allows many more capabilities to developers since iOS4.0 and while this code is Apple provided as way of testing reachability it should be expanded to include results other than having or not having a connection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nGo to http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Reachability \r\nClick Download Sample Code\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  It would be useful to first have an official Apple code sample for reachability with ARC.  Also since the network link conditioner is available to developers on the device in iOS6, it would be useful to be able to code against those varying connection types.  For example, if the reachability code sent notifications if varying percentages of packets were dropped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI can set a custom profile in network link conditioner that would drop 100% of packets sent, and the reachability code in the sample app does not change it's result.  It still tells me I have a connection even though no packets get through."
