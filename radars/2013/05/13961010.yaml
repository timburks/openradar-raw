        Summary:
        Currently apps may be limited in iTunes Connect for sale to specific countries. There is no such limit for IAP in an app.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. create an app with IAP that is for sale in all countries on the Apple App Store
        2. once the app is approved and available to App Store users try to limit which regions some IAP are available in
        3. all regions can access all IAP at all times

        Expected Results:
        A filter either in the iOS SDK or iTC that would limit which countries an IAP is available in. There are many reasons to do this, but the major reason would be publishing rights. Certain works may not be available for sale either in some regions or outside of some regions.

        For example, if you are selling works in an app via IAP that are published not by you but a third party the following may occur:

        - Publisher X has a digital art book "The Art of Blah" they wish to publish through your app and sell with IAP
        - Publisher X has pre-existing contracts such that "The Art of Blah" may only be sold in your app to customers in the USA
        - Putting out IAP in an app that is available worldwide will cause the work to be sold in countries where you are contractually forbidden from doing so

        Actual Results:
        IAP in an app that is available worldwide will cause the work to be sold in countries where you may be contractually forbidden from doing so or do not desire to sell.

        Regression:
        All existing IAP configurations for App Store apps.
