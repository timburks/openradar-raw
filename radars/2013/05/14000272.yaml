    description: "This should probably be forwarded to the UIKit team, and is likely a dupe Apple is already aware of...\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen using UICollectionView's -performBatchUpdates: method to respond to changes initiated by the delegate callbacks from an NSFetchedResultsController, an exception is thrown:\r\n\r\nCoreData: error: Serious application error.  An exception was caught from the delegate of NSFetchedResultsController during a call to -controllerDidChangeContent:.  *** -[__NSArrayM objectAtIndex:]: index 1 beyond bounds for empty array with userInfo (null)\r\n\r\nAt first it seems like this is a Core Data or NSFetchedResultsController error, however UICollectionViewFlowLayout is the offending class that is calling index out of bounds. Attached you'll see a stack trace that's stopped by an exception breakpoint.\r\n\r\nThis exception happens when the collection view is using supplemental views (i.e. header or footer views).\r\n\r\nI think it is *likely* to be replicated without using NSFetchedResultsController (which would result in an immediate crash since the exception is not caught and handled).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(NOTE: Attached http://i.stack.imgur.com/8lPvP.png )"
