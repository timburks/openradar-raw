    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen showing a save panel in an app with ubiquity containers configured, there is no way to disable \"iCloud\" in the Save panel Where pop-up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttempting to disable \"iCloud\" via the panel:shouldEnableURL: delegate will not work as the method is not called when \"iCloud\" is chosen from the pop-up.\r\n\r\nOne reason for allowing this to be disabled or not even shown is an app that syncs with iCloud via Core Data may show a Save panel to export something, but saving that to the file's ubiquity container will mean the user has no visibility of the file once saved as the app does not support directly opening files from iCloud."
