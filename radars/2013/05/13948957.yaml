        Summary:
        When you share a URL with the official Facebook app, it shows a preview of that URL's title, description and thumbnail alongside the post you are composing. However, when you share a URL to Facebook via the Social framework, it only shows a generic icon representing a URL, and doesn't allow the user to preview which page will be shared.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Set up an SLComposeViewController for Facebook. Add a URL but not an image
        2. Present the view controller

        Expected Results:
        Inside the compose window, underneath where the user enters text, I would expect to see that URL's title, description and thumbnail, taken from Open Graph data. Obviously it'll take a few seconds to load, so while it is loading I'd expect to see a dotted outline containing the URL itself, and a generic placeholder image. As soon as the system has pulled the page containing the metadata, it should substitute in the actual values.

        Actual Results:
        In the compose window, an image of a torn piece of paper displaying a compass is present. This image represents that a URL is attached, but it doesn't tell you which URL or where it goes.
