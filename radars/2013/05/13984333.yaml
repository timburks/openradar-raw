        Summary:
        In iOS 3, UITableViewController added an automatic adjustment for the keyboard that scrolls the selected view into position and adjusts the content inset. However, there are many times when you want to override this behavior to provide your own.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add your own notification callbacks to a UITableViewController
        2. Adjust the tableView's contentInset manually

        Expected Results:
        Our implementation should win out over the superview's implementation.

        Actual Results:
        Depending on which notification callback gets called first, and a handful of changes, often times the content inset is doubly adjusted causing it to be negative on a hide or to big on a show.

        Notes:
        Ideally this behavior should be better documented and able to be controlled from the subclass. We should be able to completely disable the behavior.
