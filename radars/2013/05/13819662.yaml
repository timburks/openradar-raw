    description: "06-May-2013 02:26 PM Tim Ekl:\r\nSummary: If a file is open in the assistant editor by way of the Callers mode, using Quick Open to view that same file in the assistant editor doesn't change the editor's mode from Callers to Manual.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make a new project with at least two Objective-C files. For the purposes of this repro, call them A.m and B.m.\r\n2. Ensure that a method in B calls a method in A.\r\n3. Open A.m in the main editor. Open the Assistant Editor and select Callers mode; B.m should appear.\r\n4. Press ⌘⇧O to present the Quick Open dialog.\r\n5. Type \"B.m\" and ensure that B.m is the first proposed result.\r\n6. Press ⌥↩ to Quick Open B.m in the Assistant Editor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: B.m remains open in the Assistant Editor and the mode switches to Manual (since the file was opened manually).\r\n\r\nActual Results: B.m remains open in the Assistant Editor, which remains in Callers mode.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
