    description: "05-May-2013 09:23 AM Florian Heiber:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen opening the 2011 11\" MacBook Air sometimes it starts playing some sounds like the notification \"bing\", the mail sent \"swoosh\" and others for a few seconds in what seems to be random order. This does not only happen when opening or waking up the laptop, this does also happen when I plug headphones in. It looks like it's only doing this after some time when some new sounds or events got \"buffered\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse your computer. Wait a while. Plug in your headphones.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be no playback like that.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLots of sounds are being played for no reason.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis does not happen on my 2010 iMac."
