        Summary:
        While you can change the text of the return key on text inputs, you can only choose from a limited set of options. It's frustrating, because while there are several very specific choices, such as "Google" or "Yahoo", you cannot set your own specific return key if it is not one of these.

        Instead, there should be properties for regular or done type (gray or blue) and the text of the key.

        @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *returnKeyText
        @property (nonatomic) UIReturnKeyStyle returnKeyStyle

        typedef enum {
           UIReturnKeyStylePlain,
           UIReturnKeyStyleDone,
        } UIReturnKeyStyle;
