        Summary:
        Webservices does not allow me to turn off the default pages that are configured to be served on ALL IPs on port 80 and 443. This makes it impossible to use another web server or performance cache or to host ANY other SSL site since Apache 2.2 is not SNI capable.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Run server.app, try to delete the default pages. The minus button to remove them is disabled.
        In addition, it is NOT possible to edit the IP binding for a server with multiple IP addresses to only serve the default pages on a subset of IPs freeing bound ports/IPs.

        Expected Results:
        Default pages can be turned OFF or removed completely and configured to use an IP instead of hogging all IPs on any server.

        Actual Results:
        Default pages can't be deleted. Default pages can't be configured to be only served on one IP instead of all IPs.

        Regression:


        Notes:
        Makes OS X Server unusable as a web server for your own webpages. Especially if one wants to use SSL sites.
