        Facebook's own Share dialog (new in SDK 3.5) allows posting OpenGraph actions, if you've set up such an action on the Facebook developer site. I propose SLComposeViewController should allow the same thing.

        There should be two new properties on the SLComposeViewController. One should be openGraphObject. It should take an id, and you can pass it either a URL (of a page that has Open Graph metadata), a string Open Graph ID, or a dictionary containing all the fields needed for a new Open Graph object.

        The second property should be openGraphAction. This should take a string, in the form @"myNameSpace:myVerb".

        Setting either of these when the SLComposeViewController is not in Facebook mode should throw an exception.

        If both of these values are set when the SLComposeViewController is presented, it should show a preview of the action. See radar rdar://13948957 for my thoughts on how previews should work. For Open Graph actions, as well as the thumbnail/title/description of the object, there should be some text at the top that says "Amy Worrall <verb>ed a <noun>". This should be exactly as the Facebook Share dialog (from Facebook SDK 3.5) displays it.
