    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nscrollsToTop does not work as expected when using UIViewControllerContainment on iPhone. For example, lets say you have three child view controllers, two of which have their views set to hidden. If those views contain UIScrollView subviews, their scrollsToTop is still consulted, even though the parent view is marked as hidden. This prevents the visible UIScrollView from getting the scrollsToTop behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is discussed in the following places:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15974893/scrollstotop-not-working-with-uiviewcontroller-containment\r\nhttps://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController/issues/28\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Build a UIViewController Container that holds multiple View Controllers with scroll views\r\n2) Set all but one of the child view controllers views to hidden\r\n3) Observe the visible view controller does not get the scrollsToTopBehavior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf only one view is not hidden, scrollsToTop should work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nscrollsToTop does not work.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInterestingly this is not a problem on iPad, as it supports having multiple scroll views visible at one time."
