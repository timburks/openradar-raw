    description: "31-May-2013 09:22 AM Tim Ekl:\r\nSummary: Sometimes, after opening the App Store from a Notification Center notification, the app update count in the toolbar doesn't match the number of updates actually available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install a bunch of software from the App Store.\r\n2. Wait until a notification appears that some apps have updates.\r\n3. Click the notification to open the App Store.\r\n4. Wait for the updates page to load.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The update count in the toolbar and the number of updates shown in the update list match.\r\n\r\nActual Results: In some cases, the toolbar count doesn't match the actual updates available.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has happened to me multiple times; however, I haven't tracked many details about the problem (what apps are available for updates, the previous updates I applied, etc.), so I'm not sure of an exact repro case. I believe opening the app from a user notification is a common step to all the instances I've seen.\r\n\r\nScreenshot attached; the toolbar indicates 4 updates, but only 2 are available in the content pane."
