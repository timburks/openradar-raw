        Facebook's platform policies (section 4.2) says:

        "You must not pre-fill any of the fields associated with the following products, unless the user manually generated the content earlier in the workflow: Stream stories (user_message parameter for Facebook.streamPublish and FB.Connect.streamPublish, and message parameter for stream.publish), Photos (caption), Videos (description), Notes (title and content), Links (comment), and Jabber/XMPP."

        Facebook have specifically stated that "Use of the iOS 6 Share Sheet is subject to Facebook's Platform Policies, especially section 4.2 which states that apps may not pre-fill. In the context of the Share Sheet, this means apps may not pre-fill the Share Sheet's initialText field with content that wasn't manually generated by users earlier in the app's workflow."

        I believe it is misleading to allow setting the initialText property of the SLComposeViewController when posting to Facebook. I suggest that for a SLComposeViewController that is set to use service type SLServiceTypeFacebook, setting the initialText property should throw an exception.
