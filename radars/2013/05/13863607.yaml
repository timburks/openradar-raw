    description: "10-May-2013 03:01 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFetch request templates in a Core Data model lose most of their configuration when compiled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a managed object model to a project.\r\n2. Add one or more fetch request templates to the model.\r\n3. Configure one or more of the following attributes of a fetch request to have non-default values:\r\n\r\n\tResult Type\r\n\tFetch limit\r\n\tBatch size\r\n\tInclude Subentities\r\n\tInclude Property Values\r\n\tReturn Objects as Faults\r\n\tInclude Pending Changes\r\n\tReturn Distinct Results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAt run time, these fetch request templates would have the values configured for them in Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nValues of these attributes are unaffected by the values shown in Xcode:\r\n\r\nResult type is always 1 (\"Objects\").\r\nFetch limit and batch size are always 0.\r\nReturn distinct results is NO.\r\nAll other settings listed above are YES.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached. This project has three fetch request templates in its data model using a variety of values for the above settings. At run time, the code looks up the templates and prints the values of these settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n10-May-2013 03:01 PM Tom Harrington:\r\n'FetchRequests.zip' was successfully uploaded"
