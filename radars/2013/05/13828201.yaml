    description: "Good Objective-C practices prescribe the use of exceptions only in the case of unrecoverable conditions caused by coder error, especially since ARC makes them much more expensive to throw. This restriction is really helpful for debugging, since a breakpoint set to fire when an exception is thrown should always break on error conditions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Core Data catches exceptions (I'm actually not sure if it throws them intentionally or if it's abusing the code beneath it) during normal use. The exceptions never escape Core Data's context, but exception breakpoints are still triggered, making debugging onerous. Core Data should not be throwing exceptions.\r\n\r\nA workaround exists in the form of a conditional breakpoint: http://restkit.tumblr.com/post/40736602228/dealing-with-core-data-phantom-breakpoints"
