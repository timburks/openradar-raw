    description: "Summary: mdworker is too invasive, it does it work at inopportune times, and makes my personal computer unusable for the time that it's active.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: every user of OSX experiences this\r\n\r\nExpected Results: it would be fantastic if usage laptop information were collected locally and this controlled when mdworkers were triggered (presumably by mds)\r\n\r\nActual Results: it runs at extremely unfortunate times\r\n\r\nNotes:  Sorry for the softness of this bug report, but this is something that has irked me for years now, to the point where I prefer to turn off indexing entirely. Obviously this is just an unknown headache for people who don't know about mds, but it seems like a very quick patch would be to just keep a histogram of time the user is active, estimate the length of an indexing run (presumably it's also sharded so that the work can be broken down) and schedule the worker at the time least likely to hit the user.  \r\n\r\nAgain, sorry that I've had to presume a lot about how mds does its work. I hate to think that this is hurting OSX UX for the average user."
