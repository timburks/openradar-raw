    description: "Summary:\r\nThe header for NSRulerView states the following:\r\n\r\n- (void)drawHashMarksAndLabelsInRect:(NSRect)rect;\r\n    // You should never need to call this, but you might want to override it.  This method is called by -drawRect: to draw the actual hash-marks and labels on the ruler.  If you want to do custom hash-marks and labels you should first look at doing it with a delegate.  You can do whatever kind of custom hash-marks you want through delegation as long as the hash-marks and labels are evenly spaced.  But if you need to do hash-marks or labels that are not evenly spaced you will need to override this.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll point out specifically the mention of \"You can do whatever kind of custom hash-marks you want through delegation…\" — there are no delegate methods that I can see on NSRulerView that would let you do anything of the sort. \r\n\r\nI'd love to be proven wrong, but I assume this is a mistake."
