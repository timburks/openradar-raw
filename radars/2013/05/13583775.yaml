    description: "04-Apr-2013 09:52 PM Carl Brown:\r\nSummary:\r\nI often find myself hearing about an app that I would like to purchase while I'm not near that platform (for example, today at lunch, an iPad App was recommended to me and I wanted to buy it with my iPhone, but could not).  Also, since I read twitter on my iOS device, I often hear there about Mac Apps that I would like to purchase but cannot until I get back to my Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On Safari on an iPhone, follow an App Store link from a website for a Mac or iPad-only app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would like to purchase the app, which will then be downloaded to my iPad/Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI get a screen telling me the app is unavailable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBeen like that since the iPad launched.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis may well be done by means of some Setting to cut down on the confusion from non-power-users."
