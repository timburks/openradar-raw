        Summary:
        When editing an recurring event, if the time of the event is not "touched", when the event is saved the endDate is set to the startDate.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an recurring non all day event in an EKEventViewController that allows editing.
        2. Tap the edit button.
        3. Change the title, and nothing else. Do NOT tap on the "Starts Ends" cell.
        4. Tap Done and select the span (doesn't matter which one).

        Expected Results:
        The endDate should remain the same if not changed while editing.

        Actual Results:
        The event's endDate is set to the same as the startDate.

        Notes:
        The editing UI shows the correct date, and if you tap on the cell to change the date, even if you don't change it, will keep the endDate from changing.

        A workaround is to subclass EKEventEditViewController and redirect the Done action. In this action, doing the following will cause the endDate to remain the same:

        	self.event.endDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceReferenceDate:self.event.endDate.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate];
