    description: "Summary:\n\nSetting a shadowOffset & shadowColor on UILabel using UIAppearance API results in wrong shadow offsets if \"tighten letter spacing\" is enabled on the UILabel.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Open the attached project snapshot\n2. Run the app on a device or simulator\n\nExpected Results:\n\nRed shadow to be 1 pixel below text on the label that shows it has tighten letter spacing ON.\n\nActual Results:\n\nRed shadow is many pixels below the text on the label that shows it has tighten letter spacing ON. By comparison the UILabel that is also on screen with tighten spacing OFF is correct.\n\nBoth have shadow set using UIAppearance.\n\nRegression:\n\nNotes:\n\nSee attached project.\n\nThe only workaround I have found is to disabled tighten letter spacing, which is not good. OK, you could manually specify all shadows in IB instead of using UIAppearance too. \n\nThis seems to only occur if using UIAppearance to set the shadow. If you set the shadow in IB and remove the UIAppearance code from the app delegate, it works as expected."
