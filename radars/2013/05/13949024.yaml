        Summary:
        Posting to a user's Facebook stream with SLComposeViewController results in a post attributed "via iOS", rather than "via My Great App". I suggest that, if the FacebookAppID key is present in Info.plist, the post is attributed to that Facebook app. In order to avoid any security issues, the SLComposeViewController should show the name of the app that is doing the posting, as the Share dialog does in Facebook SDK 3.5.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Ensure you have a valid Facebook app set up, and put its FacebookAppID in your Info.plist
        2. Create and present a SLComposeViewController for Facebook.
        3. Post a message.
        4. Check your Facebook timeline to see what the new post looks like.

        Expected Results:
        The post should be attributed "via <MyAppName>"

        Actual Results:
        The post is attributed "via iOS"

        Notes:
        This is not a security issue, since the SLComposeViewController makes it very explicit that the user is authorising this app to post to their timeline. Note that Facebook's own Share dialog allows this, without needing to request new permissions.
