    description: "I thought this problem was unique to be, but some research (http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=63033) shows that it is not.\r\n\r\nWhen using the \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" preference in the Energy Saver prefs pane, any AFP volumes mounted will drop after an indeterminate amount of time (it appears to be based on the last time the volume gets accessed).\r\n\r\nThis is quite annoying for multiple reasons, but the most annoying part is that this behavior didn't exist prior to 10.8.3.  I'm hesitant to say if it existed or not in 10.8.2, but I know that as of last fall, when I received my Synology DS1512+, drive mounts were persistent; they remained through multiple sleep/wake cycles of my Mac Pro, and persisted through extended on-but-idle periods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Use an AFP-compatible file server, such as a Synology using DSM 4.1 or 4.2.\r\n\r\n* Connect to an AFP volume on the aforementioned NAS\r\n\r\n* Leave said volume untouched for a period of time\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* Drive remains mounted through extended idle periods, sleep/wake cycles, etc., so long as the server is still reachable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* Drive disconnects, mount disappears, files no longer accessible.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a regression from previous behavior, where drive mounts were much more persistent.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=63033 for others complaining of similar issues.  Similar complaints can be found through various keyword searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosed as Duplicate of 13537674"
