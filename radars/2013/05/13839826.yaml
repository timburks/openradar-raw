    description: "Summary: \r\nCurrently, if an app is using the Alerts style on Notification Center, there is no way to expire a displayed alert when it is no longer relevant; the _removeDisplayedNotification: API is private and thus verboten for App Store applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Have an application which generates alerts on unseen content.\r\n\r\n2) Ensure notification style is set to Alert.\r\n\r\n3) View the unseen content in the application, without interacting with the alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrom the point of view of the user, the expected result is that the alert vanishes (now that the content is no longer unread), as happens with Apple's Messages.app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEither the alert does not vanish because the app is using only approved API and thus only calls removeDeliveredNotification: (causing the user to complain and log a bug report, pointing to Messages.app as \"But, look, it's possible because Messages.app does this.\") or the app uses _removeDisplayedNotification: and works as the user expects, but gets bounced from the App Store.\r\n\r\n(Similarly, if I quit the application, the user expects the alerts to vanish; the same issues apply with _removeAllDisplayedNotifications being private API.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease may we have access to a non-private version of _removeDisplayedNotification: and _removeAllDisplayedNotifications?  Thanks! :)"
