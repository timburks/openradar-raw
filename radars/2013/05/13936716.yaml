        Summary:
        Web services cannot be turned off completely

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Turn off web services in Server.app.

        Expected Results:
        Webservice is OFF.

        Actual Results:
        Apache is still running service pages that web service is turned off and can be turned on by an administrator.

        Regression:
        When I turn off a service it HAS to be OFF. Not just lying to me that it is. The ports 80 and 443 are still bound by Apache.

        Notes:
        Why is Server.app lying to an administrator who wants to use something different than Apache? For example nginx or Varnish to increase performance? Impossible.
