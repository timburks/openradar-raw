    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you write an iPad app that shows UI on a secondary display, the views will not be laid out correctly if the XIB for the secondary display views uses Auto-Layout, and the app is running on a retina iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build the attached sample code, and run the app in the iOS Simulator with the 1x iPad and TV-Out enabled. The display resolution of the TV-Out display doesn't matter.\r\n2. On the main display of the iPad, there is a switch that will modify the view on the secondary display to use either Springs&Struts or Auto-Layout. In either case, there will be labels displayed in each corner of the secondary display, numbered clockwise from top-left. There will also be a label that is centered in the display.\r\n3. If you switch between Auto-Layout and Springs&Struts, the layout of the secondary display should remain consistent.\r\n4. Switch the simulator to Retina iPad, and repeat the same test.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf you switch between Auto-Layout and Springs&Struts, the layout of the secondary display should remain consistent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nObserve that the Springs&Struts display is laid-out correctly, but the Auto-Layout display is not. If you dump out the view hierarchy of the Auto-Layout display, it appears that the views were laid out based on the secondary display being retina when it is not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI dont know whether this is or is not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nsample code for openradar available at https://github.com/chucks/autolayout-second-display-bug"
