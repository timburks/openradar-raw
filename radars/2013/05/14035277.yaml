    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's very convenient to be able to see when various features were released in the iOS App Store. Today I discovered that, as far as I can find, that feature does not exist in the Mac App Store.\r\n\r\nThis is sad, because I like that feature.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nApp Store Version 1.2.2 (129.13)\r\nOS X 10.8.3"
