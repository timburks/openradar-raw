        Summary:
        Sometimes I get emails that there are issues with the Newsstand Atom feed for my applications, saying "Cover Art Error: The cover art with size name "SOURCE" was unable to be saved." I can't find any problems with the atom feed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Add an atom feed that conforms to the specification to a newsstand application
        - Wait until the Apple scrapers load the atom feed

        Expected Results:
        The issue shows up in the App Store

        Actual Results:
        The issues and their covers do not show up in the App Store and I get an email that their were issues found with the Newsstand Atom feed:
        The following issues were found with the Newsstand Atom feed for NRC Reader.

        Issue ID 183:
        Cover Art Error: The cover art with size name "SOURCE" was unable to be saved.
        Issue ID 184:
        Cover Art Error: The cover art with size name "SOURCE" was unable to be saved.

        Regression:
        I did not have this problem before

        Notes:
        This happens on two independently developed feeds for two applications, so I assume it is a bug an Apple's side.
