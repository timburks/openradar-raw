    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling preventDefault() from onmousewheel does not disable two-finger back/forward history navigation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open up Safari on a MacBook with OS X Lion\r\n2. Set \"Swipe between pages\" to \"Scroll left or right with two fingers\" under System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom (the default for new installs)\r\n3. Visit http://jsfiddle.net/Qs3JJ/ and scroll around horizontally using two fingers on the trackpad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCalling preventDefault() from onmousewheel should prevent the default action of back/forward navigation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScrolling around works for a bit, but then the back/forward horizontal navigation transition is triggered. This happens more often when scrolling slowly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nChrome also has this issue but I'm fixing it.\r\nIssue: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=239731\r\nFix: https://codereview.chromium.org/14795004/"
