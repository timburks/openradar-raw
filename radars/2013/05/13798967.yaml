        Summary:
        When using an NSOpenPanel to select a directory with the view set to Cover Flow, double clicking a folder will immediately select that folder and close the panel

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create a new project in xcode
        2. Add an openFolder method to the app delegate as follows:
        - (void)openFolder:(id)sender {
            NSOpenPanel *openPanel = [NSOpenPanel openPanel];
            [openPanel setCanChooseFiles:NO];
            [openPanel setCanChooseDirectories:YES];
            [openPanel beginSheetModalForWindow:self.window completionHandler:^(NSInteger result) {
                NSLog( @"%@", [openPanel URLs]);
            }];
        }
        3. Hook up a menu item
        4. Run and select the menu item
        5. Set the view to Cover Flow
        6. Try to navigate into a folder by double clicking

        Expected Results:
        The Finder window should display the contents of the folder

        Actual Results:
        The open panel closes and returns the folder that was clicked on

        Regression:
        If the view is set to Icons, List or Columns, double clicking the folder opens the folder as expected.
