    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, when I'm typing a URL in Safari's location bar, it suddenly acts as if I had hit <Enter>. It removes focus from the bar and starts loading a page. I believe it's loading what the \"Top Hit\" would be in the autocomplete drop down list, but I haven't even seen the list yet.\r\n\r\nMost recently, it happened while I was trying to go to 'npr.org'. I had typed \"np\", and suddenly it was loading npr.org. While this happened to be the correct location in this instance, I've had other cases where it didn't magically read my mind and go to the right place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt's not easily reproducible, but I see this once or twice a day."
