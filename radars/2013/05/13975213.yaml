    description: "Mapping Model created in Xcode has different order of entity hashes from that of source model and destination model, which result in Core Data's failure to pick it. For example, here is my data:\r\n\r\n/* omitted */\r\n\r\nIf you compare one-by-one you can verify that all entity hashes match. But just because the orders are different Core Data refuses to use it.\r\n\r\nYou can see others' findings here: http://blog.vucica.net/2013/04/core-data-migrating-ignores-manual-mapping-model-or-fails-migration-despite-mapping-models-existence.html"
