    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen having custom subclasses of UIViews (even empty ones) localisations don't get picked up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI created an example project (see attachment). I took the following steps to do this:\r\n\r\n1. Create new Project based on Storyboards\r\n2. Added a label with the text \"Hello\"\r\n3. Enable Base localization, added Dutch as a second language\r\n4. Made sure the StoryBoard got translated as a .strings file\r\n5. Translated the text to \"Hallo\"\r\n6. Everything works as expected (so far)\r\n7. Create an (empty) subclass of UILabel named CBELabel\r\n8. Changed the class of the label in the storyboard to CBELabel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe label should say \"Hallo\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe label says \"Hello\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
