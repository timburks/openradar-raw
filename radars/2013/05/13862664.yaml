    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen calling a UIPopoverController via a local variable in an ARC project, the controller has dealloc called on it while it is still active.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCall a popover controller with the following code:\r\n\r\n    UIPopoverController *popover_ = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:controller];\r\n    [popover_ presentPopoverFromRect:scale_.frame inView:self.view permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown animated:YES];\r\n    popover_.delegate = self;\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe view presented via the popover controller does not cause the application to crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application crashes when dealloc is called on the popover controller.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the popover is assigned to an instance variable, the dealloc method is not called. Unfortunately, if simply a quick popover is needed, one cannot be made without the instance variable. Also, if a project is not in ARC, the code works as well without the dealloc crash.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNothing additional."
