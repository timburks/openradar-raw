    description: "I have a simple UIViewController_A in a Storyboard with a button on it. The button modal segues (page curl) to UIViewController_B which has a container view. The container view then embeds UITableViewController_A. The table displays 1 section containing 3 custom static cells. Each cell has a label on the left and a switch on the right.\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the button, the table is properly displayed where I want it but the cells content, labels and switches, are animated to their positions.\r\n\r\nHow can I disable this animation? I suspect it is the embedded tableview getting animated while being resized, but am not sure.\r\n\r\nI attached a demo project of the problem and the same demo can also be found on github : https://github.com/droussel/UnwantedAnimation"
