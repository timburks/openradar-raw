        A reasonably common way to share things on Facebook is for the user to share a URL augmented with a photograph the user has taken.

        I would like SLComposeViewController to have a new property, BOOL allowsUserGeneratedPhoto. When this property is set to YES, and the SLComposeViewController is presented, there will be a new button on the SLComposeViewController that looks like a camera. Pressing this button will allow the user to take a photo or to choose one from their photo library. If they do this, the photo will be attached to that post.

        If a photo is attached in this manner, it should be previewed as a thumbnail in the SLComposeViewController, and there should be a way to remove it again (by tapping it maybe?). When the SLComposeViewController is posted, the image should be uploaded to Facebook, and the image[0][user_generated] API property should be set to true (so that Facebook knows that this is a user generated image).
