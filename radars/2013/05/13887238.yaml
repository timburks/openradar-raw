    description: "Core Bluetooth alerts the user when an application tries to use a CBCentralManager or a CBPeripheralManager. There is currently no way to suppress the alert.\r\n\r\nIf you instantiate a CBPeripheralManager or a CBCentralManager while Bluetooth is off.\r\n\r\nAlert shows up to inform the user Bluetooth is off and directs the user to Settings.app or to cancel.\r\n\r\nThe delegate of one of the above classes gets a callback informing the application bluetooth is off.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the ability for the application to choose to show the \"Bluetooth is off\" alert or to not show it and allow the application to continue."
