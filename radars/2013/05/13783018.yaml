    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iOS Network Link Conditioner is awesome. So I use it a lot.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes I forget that it's on, and then I just grumble at my iPhone all day. That's annoying.\r\n\r\nI wish it would turn the status bar purple or something when the conditioner is on, so I don't forget."
