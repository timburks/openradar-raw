    description: "An application I've written seems to (unintentionally) cause Security::KeychainCore to never return across the entire system for any app, causing many applications to hang (including mine). In addition, TCP connections would not open (tested using ssh, telnet, and Google Chrome) - they would time out. ping would function like normal. Killing the app causing the problem did not solve the problem - a reboot was required.\r\n\r\nThe application has no UI (using LSUIElement YES in its Info.plist), just a menubar icon.\r\n\r\nIt has happened across different OS reboots, and it first started happening about two weeks ago. After deleting and reinstalling the .app, and attempting some changes to how the application was signed, the problem went away. Today it came back.\r\n\r\nI was unable to attach to the process with Xcode. I will attach two pairs of spindumps, each pair taken no more than a few minutes apart on a malfunctioning system. Between the two pairs, I performed a reboot (to return the system to normal), and then started the app again.\r\n\r\nI've attached a ZIP of the app from my system, generated using `ditto -ck --keepParent /Applications/GrabBox.app ~/GrabBox.zip`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Start GrabBox.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- App starts\r\n- System functions correctly\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- App starts\r\n- System misbehaves wildly"
