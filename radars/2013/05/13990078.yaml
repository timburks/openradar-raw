    description: 'CLLocation provides the method -distanceFromLocation: for calculating the great circle distance between two locations. I can''t see any reason for this functionality to be tied only to CLLocation objects; sometimes it would be useful to perform that calculation with just CLLocationCoordinate2D structs and it would be nice to have it available without allocating CLLocation objects or implementing the calculation yourself.'
