    description: "Summary:\r\nCopying from Console produces corrupt text\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect an iOS device and view its console in the Xcode organizer\r\nSelect one of the random zillion lines of text.\r\nPaste it into Messages. It shows up for you, but all your coworkers can't see it and think you didn't paste anything.\r\nAfter a half hour of this, paste it into a plain text document in Text Edit and save it.\r\nOpen the document in Hex Fiend\r\nNotice that the beginning of each line has two NUL bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should produce text pasteboards w/o embedded NULs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmbedded NULs for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 4.6.2"
