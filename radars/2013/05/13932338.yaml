    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the keyboard to select an application window in the application window overview, it is difficult to distinguish the highlighted window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open TextEdit.\r\n2. Open two untitled windows.\r\n3. Press and hold the Command key. Press tab, then press the left arrow and the down arrow, before releasing the Command key.\r\n4. Type the 'U' key to select the first untitled window.\r\n5. Compare the appearance of the highlighted and unhighlighted windows.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is easy to see which window is highlighted and which window isn't, at a glance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI spend a few seconds trying to discern the highlighted window, which more than balances the time saved from using this method of selecting a window.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn OS X 10.6, the highlight ring was both considerably thicker and brighter; I never had any difficulty viewing it from a distance.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTwo screenshots are attached, demonstrating the appearance of the application window highlight ring in OS X 10.6 and 10.8.\r\n\r\nIf previously open documents are present in the bottom section of the application window overview, the highlight rings surrounding their icons are easier to see, though a little lopsided. On mouse over, the document titles are highlighted, which would be an even more easily discernible cue when navigating from the keyboard.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttp://sabi.net/temp/13932338/10.6.png\r\n\r\nhttp://sabi.net/temp/13932338/10.8.png"
