    description: "02-May-2013 07:08 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nWhen an NSPopover is detached to a window, it calls -popoverWillClose: on its delegate, passing the notification with the \"detach to window\" reason. But then it calls -popoverShouldClose:, and if the delegate happens to return NO (because that method has different criteria), the popover's window remains on-screen in a broken state. -popoverShouldClose: should NOT be called in that case, because the popover has already decided that it will close (it has sent and posted WillClose)."
