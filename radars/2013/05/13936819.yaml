    description: "Summary:\nAfter migrating from 10.6.8 RADIUS is not usable anymore since it segfaults.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nHave 10.6.8 server with RADIUS running to authenticate your WiFi against OD. Migrate to 10.8.3. After installation and the message that „Server has been configured successfully“ (which is about as far from the truth as it possibly can be) RADIUS and hence all of your company WiFi is not usable anymore.\n\nExpected Results:\nSince in the backend RADIUS hasn't changed it should migrate properly and just work.\n\nActual Results:\nRADIUS can't be configured anymore at all even with radiusconfig(1) and cannot be used anymore. \n\nRegression:\nThis is an effective denial of service for company/school/university WiFi. It forces one to reduce security in an unacceptable manger by switching o WPA2/Personal with globally shared passwords. In essence a security reduction that can only be mitigated by turning off WiFi for all users of the company/school/university.\n\nNotes:\nConfiguring of RADIUSd on the command line is not working as well. RADIUSd segfaults even when configured from scratch rendering RADIUSd unusable on OS X Server. This defeats the purpose of OS X Server and it's very nice single sign-on approach."
