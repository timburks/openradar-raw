    description: With the current implementation of NSDateFormatter, 12:00 AM is displayed as "上午12:00" in Chinese locale. It is quite confusing for Chinese people, many people may think it is "12:00 PM". It is not such a big problem for realtime because we can easily tell it is day or night, but is really an issue for historical time or future time. I think you should use "午夜 12:00" or "凌晨 0:00" for that time because that's what we Chinese use in everyday life.
