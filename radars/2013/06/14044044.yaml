    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPlease add a switch for Airplane Mode to the Settings app on the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nOn an iPad, or an iPhone, when you use the Settings app, there is a useful switch for Airplane mode which lets you easily disable network connectivity on your device. Because the iOS Simulator lacks this switch, it is difficult to test how iOS applications under development will perform in Airplane Mode - a device must be used.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the lack of a network on the iOS simulator, you must disable the networking on your development machine, which is an unacceptable workaround given that the tools and services we need to log bugs, fetch source, and communicate with our coworkers all require Internet access.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Acquire an iPad or iPhone.\r\n2. Launch Settings on your iPad or iPhone.\r\n3. Note the Airplane Mode switch at the top of the list of settings.\r\n4. Launch Xcode.\r\n5. Launch the iOS Simulator, by choosing Xcode > Open Developer Tool > iOS Simulator using the Xcode menu in the Mac OS X menu bar.\r\n6. Launch Settings on the iOS Simulator.\r\n7. Note that there is no switch for Airplane Mode present. ( Nor is there a Wifi switch. )\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant Software Versions:\r\n\r\nMac OS 10.8.3 (12D78)\r\nXcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) \r\niOS Simulator 6.0 (369.2)"
