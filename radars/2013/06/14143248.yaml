    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter hitting the space key in Safari's unified search box, the .com key probably isn't needed anymore.  When attempting to search, the .com key is really easy to accidentally hit instead of the space key if you're not paying attention.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start a search, not looking at the keyboard\r\n2. Try to hit space, and accidentally hit the .com\r\n3. Don't notice until two words later\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n.com doesn't end up in my query\r\n\r\nMaybe the .com key could disappear when the box decides you're doing a search, given that spaces in domain names won't ever happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n.com ends up where I want a space\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
