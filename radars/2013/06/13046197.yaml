    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nQ&A1637 states:\r\n\r\n\"Important: Beginning with iOS 4.0, drawing to a graphics context in UIKit is thread-safe. This includes accessing and manipulating the current graphics stack, drawing images and strings, and usage of color and font objects from secondary threads.\"\r\n\r\nBut this is out of date as o f iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe iOS 6 SDK documentation for UIStringDrawing had this line added from the iOS 5 docs:\r\n\r\n\"The methods described in this class extension must be used from your appâ€™s main thread.\"\r\n\r\nAfter hard-learned experience, I've found this to be true. The Q&A really needs to be updated to reflect the current reality."
