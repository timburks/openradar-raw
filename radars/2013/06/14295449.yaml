    description: "Summary:\nIn the documentation about multitasking (https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/ManagingYourApplicationsFlow/ManagingYourApplicationsFlow.html), figure 3-3 shows what happens when an app is launched into the background. It appears to be saying that applicationDidBecomeActive: is called upon entering the background but that doesn't happen on device.\n\nWhat to change:\nI think that arrow from \"Enter Background\" to \"applicationDidBecomeActive:\" and \"applicationDidBecomeActive:\" should be removed. It would be nice to have more substantial documentation around what happens as well.\n\nNotes:\nI tested this out a bit on simulator and device and these are the results I got.\n\n\n## Launching into the background\n \nHow I tested: I checked \"Launch due to a background fetch event\" on in the run scheme of the app in Xcode 5 and added background-fetch to the app's capabilities.\n \nResults\n- In `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` application state was set to `UIApplicationStateBackground`\n- No notifications were posted ****\n- `applicationDidEnterBackground:`, `applicationWillEnterForeground:`, and `applicationDidBecomeActive:` were not called ****\n\n\n## Waking to handle a background event\n \nHow I tested: I used `[CLLocationManager startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges]` to listen for significant location changes and wake my app in the background.\n \nResults\n- `locationManager:didUpdateLocations:` was called\n- Application state was set to `UIApplicationStateBackground`\n- No notifications were posted\n- `applicationDidEnterBackground:`, `applicationWillEnterForeground:`, and `applicationDidBecomeActive:` were not called"
