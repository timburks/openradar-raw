    description: "Summary: Some emoji faces have high baselines or large shadows\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open TextEdit and open a new document.\r\n2. Type Option-Command-T to bring up Special Characters.\r\n3. Go to the Emoji sidebar pane.\r\n4. Double click on every yellow-style face in turn to type it into the document. I started at SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING EYES and ended at EXPRESSIONLESS FACE.\r\n5. Select all.\r\n6. press Command-equals to increase the font size. I went up to about 104 pt for the attached illustration.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the faces sit exactly the same on the baseline, and all have the same style shadow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n13 faces sit high on the baseline. 8 faces have a heaver drop shadow than the rest.\r\nAdditionally, the purple frowning IMP face has a lighter shade of purple (especially in the region of the head gloss gradient) than its SMILING FACE WITH HORNS counterpart.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nunknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is visible at the default 12pt font size, but I enlarged the text to magnify the effect.\r\n\r\nIllustration at http://cl.ly/PuEK"
