    description: "Summary:\r\nIn a web document, if a touch event listener (touchstart/touchmove/touchend) is added to any HTML node enclosing a textarea/text input located inside an iframe and we move the cursor while editing the text, it becomes then impossible to enter any new text (tapping keys on the keyboard will result in having no effect).\r\nThis problem occurs when we attach a touch listener to a node inside the iframe containing the input and/or to a node containing the iframe. This is true even if the listener is an empty javascript function.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be seen on iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad/iOS Simulator and Mobile Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.Get the related test case files at: https://github.com/rubenalvarado/bug_ios_textarea_in_iframe\r\n2.Put the files on a web server and load them in a UIWebView or Mobile Safari\r\n2.Tap the textarea and enter some text\r\n3.Move the cursor somewhere else inside the textarea\r\n4.Try to enter new text in the textarea\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText appears in the textarea as the user is typing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo text appears (is entered)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis issue is present on iOS 6.0 and iOS 6.1 (maybe also on previous versions, did not test).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttps://github.com/rubenalvarado/bug_ios_textarea_in_iframe"
