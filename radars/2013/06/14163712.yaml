    description: "Summary: When setting a panorama wallpaper from the settings screen, the behavior of the feature is not at all what I was expecting it to be and the actual behavior feels cheesy compared to the rest of iOS. Having the wallpaper move with the gyroscope seems really confusing as opposed to moving the panorama offset with the icon page scroll action which is what I feel like I was expecting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select and set a panorama photo on your device's home screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Something visually consistent with the rest of iOS like scrolling the panorama offset with the icon page scroll view in a parallax manner.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Wallpaper is weirdly tracked around using the gyro, making it look extremely cheesy.\r\n\r\nRegression: iOS 7.0 Seed 1 (11A4372q)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
