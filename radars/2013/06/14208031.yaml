    description: "Summary: Prior to iOS 7 there were no system gestures associated with swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Many apps in the App Store now use that swipe up gesture for critical interactions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Timer (https://itunes.apple.com/app/id507518845) on a device running iOS 7.0\r\n2. Launch app and swipe up from the bottom of the screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The main view of Timer slides up to reveal theme selection and other critical interactions.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Control Center slides up and prevents users from using the gesture with Timer.\r\n\r\nRegression: Prior to iOS 7 this was not an issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOther apps with swipe up gestures:\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/id507518845\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-dial-simpler-more/id536445532?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bible+/id332615624?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bible+-maps/id287455446?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sous-chef-unit-conversion/id545884525?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choremonster/id532344230\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-tennis-3/id506515857?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bang-on-a-nice-search-app/id521507324?mt=8\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radarscope/id288419283?mt=8\r\n\r\nIt also breaks pretty much every swiping/line drawing game such as Temple Run, Flight Control, etc."
