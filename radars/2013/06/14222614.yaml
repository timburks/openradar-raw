    description: When cleaning a build, you often want to also remove the app from the simulator or device. It would be great if there was an optional 'proper clean' in Xcode that performed this step. At the moment, you either have to regularly 'Reset Content and Settings' in the simulator or delete the app manually off the device in order to reset application state. This would be a great addition to both Xcode and xcodebuild, and would support the continued improvement of automation and continuous integration support in Xcode.
