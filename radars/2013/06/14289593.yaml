    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Xcode assets are a nice addition that simplify the management of all the images in the project. But in this state of the beta I have some suggestion.\r\nFor example the auto discover of the needed Default images is a bit buggy, so I think is a nice to have to insert a button to add or remove groups of images for the device, so if I turn the iOS6 target I can add all the Default images for iOS6 manually if Xcode fail to add those, or, if I turn off the landscape compatibility I have the opportunity to delete the Landscape group.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to change some settings that influence the icons and the default needed and see how sometimes Xcode mess the things around.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBetter Xcode Xcode Asset update ability or a nice button to remove/add category inside the group of the asset\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMy english is very bad. I'm so sorry for the engineer that must read and understand this radar."
