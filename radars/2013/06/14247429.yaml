        Summary:
        The documentation for QLPreviewItem clearly states that previewItemURL should return nil until the item is available:

        "If the item is not available for preview, this property’s getter method should return nil. In this case, the Quick Look preview controller displays a “loading” view."

        However, doing so causes a crash.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Return nil from previewItemURL

        See example project: http://cl.ly/1B0Z2o3K2V3J

        Expected Results:
        - The preview view controller will display a spinning loading indicator until some event that refreshes the controller. This is unclear in the documentation, but either calling reload on the controller, or preferably, sending a kvo notification for the previewItemURL key.

        Actual Results:
        The controller does show a loading screen, but only until the appearance animation completes, at which point the app crashes.
