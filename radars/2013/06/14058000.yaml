    description: "04-Jun-2013 11:00 AM Martin Adoue:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf iOS device with auto lock enabled locks while connected to a dev computer, and you run an app on Xcode, you get \"Permission denied\". You need to unlock the device to debug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a device with autolock in 1 minute.\r\n2. Connect the device to a computer running Xcode.\r\n3. Wait a minute.\r\n4. Press \"run\" on Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter copying the app, Xcode attempts to start it and an alert \"Permission denied\" appears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAn option on the device to not lock while connected if the device is used for development would be very nice."
