        Summary:
        Since installing Xcode 4.6.3, it's been jumping up to 230+% CPU periodically, even with no projects open (sample file attached)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Xcode 4.6.3, use as normal (I'm writing/testing iOS code with the iOS 6.1 iPhone Sim).  Wait for fans to spin up (I'm on a 2011 MacBook Air i5).

        Expected Results:
        Xcode CPU should not exceed 100%, and even then only for a short time.

        Actual Results:
        Xcode (while still responsive) turns the MacBook Air into a space heater. Tried rebooting, that didn't help.

        Regression:
        4.6.2 never did this.

        Notes:
        I do have Xcode 5 DP1 installed under /Applicaitons/Xcode5-DP.app, but xcode-select is set to /Applications/Xcode.app (and I had Xc5 installed while I was using 4.6.2 with no issues.
