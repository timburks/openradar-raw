    description: After submitting the app  to the apple store I recevived an email (attached) about the app not being comply to PIE Binary and a link to make it. Following the steps on the document ( Technical Q&A QA1788 - Building a Position Independent Executable) my settings are already on that configuration, but the otool -hv doesn't give me the PIE flag.
