        Summary:

        iOS allows subscribing to a shared calendar by tapping on a "webcal://" URL. However the UI provides no feedback that the tap on the link is being processed. This makes the feature barely usable for non-technical users.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open the Notes app on an iOS device
        2. Copy the following link: webcal://webservices.polk-fl.net/c/Calendar.svc/PCSB_traditional_school_calendar
        3. Save the note. The link should become tappable.
        4. Tap the link.

        Expected Results:

        Some dialog pops up immediately to confirm the user that her action has been recorded, and that the remote calendar is being fetched.

        Actual Results:

        Nothing happens.

        After some time, a dialog pops up, where the user can confirm she wants the remote calendar to be added.

        Notes:

        The use-case here is a booking service that would provide a remote calendar for all the upcoming trips of the user. The URL to this remote calendar would be included in the confirmation email.
