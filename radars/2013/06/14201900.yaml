    description: "19-Jun-2013 03:15 AM Andrey Marinov:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen you get back into an app, using the new multitasking the screenshot that was taken last is visible onscreen.\r\nThese often contain the last state that the app was in and hang around for a couple of seconds, which causes the user to think that he can act on what's seen on screen, which isn't the case.\r\nFor example a very misleading case is when the keyboard was up when the screenshot was taken, which is often the case in iMessage and Safari, the user thinks that the app has loaded and tries to enter data and of course nothings happens until the app gets back to a usable state, which leaves the user with an impression of a slow device.\r\n\r\nThe problem is even more pronounced in apps that don't support state restoration as they usually take a couple of seconds to startup their usual workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen you get back into an app, using the new multitasking.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere shouldn't be any feeling left in the user that the app is unresponsive or slow.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app looks unresponsive.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
