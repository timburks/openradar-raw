    description: "Summary: Xcode 5-DP appears to have a hidden default header search path of $(SRCROOT). This can cause Xcode to #import incorrect header files if a subdirectory and root directory have headers with the same file name, even if the one in the root directory is not in the project. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Empty View application.\r\n2. Create a custom NSObject class in a subfolder of your project called Foo. Make sure Foo.m is in your app target.\r\n3. Copy the empty Foo.h/.m to the root folder of your project (where the AppDelegate, main.m etc are located). Do not add the copied empty Foo files to the project. Make sure to remove the ' copy' added to the file name.\r\n3. Open the original Foo class file in Xcode and add a method, -(void)bar\r\n4. In the ViewController.m, #import \"Foo.h\", in viewDidLoad, alloc/init a Foo, then call -bar.\r\n5. Try to build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProject should build.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nProject fails to build because \"no visible @inteface of Foo declares selector bar\". Note that if you call performSelector:@selector(bar), you still get a warning about an undeclared selector, but bar will be called when run. \r\n\r\nRegression: Regression from Xcode 4.6\r\n\r\nNotes: No workaround. Sample project attached."
