    description: "Summary:\r\nDisabling a toolbar's UIBarButtonItem as a result of a user choice in an UIActionSheet doesn't \"visually\" disable the button if the button is of type Plain. The button is not clickable (as expected), but still appears enabled.\r\n\r\nA sample Xcode project demonstrating the issue is attached. It contains an empty view with a toolbar containing a button (with a trash icon). Pressing the toolbar button opens an action sheet, with an action that disables the toolbar button. Choosing this action demonstrates the problem: the button isn't grayed out like it should be.\r\nThere is also a button in the view toggling the button's \"enabled\" property to show that it works properly outside of an action sheet.\r\n\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3659886/ActionSheetBug.zip\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nMake a view with a toolbar containing an UIBarButtonItem.\r\nSet the bar button item's type to Plain.\r\nMake the button open an action sheet, and in actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex: delegate method, set the button's \"enabled\" property to NO.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen the action sheet's button is pressed, the action sheet should be dismissed and the button should be disabled and appear grayed out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button doesn't appear grayed out. Note: the button is actually disabled, tapping it doesn't do anything (not even highlight it). But it still appears enabled (white icone instead of gray)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem happens in iOS 6.0 and higher. It is not occurring on iOS 5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis doesn't happen with a button of type Bordered."
