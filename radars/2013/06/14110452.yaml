    description: "Summary:\r\nSarah Palin used Maverick so much that it now has a \"unique\" connotation. OS X deserves a better name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nListen to Sarah Palin say Maverick 10 times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou realize what she has done to this word, and how anytime you hear it, you now hear it in her words.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou somehow still think this is a good idea.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOS X LOLCAT sounds better...\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOS XI versions should be named after famous galaxies/globular clusters."
