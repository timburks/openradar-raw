    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 5, the provisioning profile UID is now added to the .pbxproj, which will get checked into source control. This prevents automatic selection of code signing if one is not added. Also, for open source projects, checking in a UID is not ideal. If schemes are not duplicated, a different profile might be used developing locally vs building with the Bot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project in Xcode. Make sure you set the bundle ID to something you have provisioning for.\r\n2. Create a new Bot for this project\r\n3. Integrate. The Bot should fail with a code signing failure.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to specify the Provisioning Profile to use for a build in Bot Settings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe build fails if I have not added a Provisioning Profile to my Build Settings, and checked that into source control.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
