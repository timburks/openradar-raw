    description: "I have a dual screen setup and I use my main screen for work and the secondary screen to display IM, email, tutorials etc. These things rarely, if ever, need the menu bar. But whenever the focus is on an app on the second display and I activate Spotlight using a keyboard shortcut it is displayed on the second display.\nThe displays are big and not directly next to each other. I only see the Spotlight  corner of the second screen in the corner of my eyes and more often then not I think that maybe I mistyped the shortcut or the Mac is freezing, when it doesn't pop up on my main working screen. \nI would really prefer having Spotlight (and Notification Center) on a fixed and expected location, rather then having to think about what screen has the focus currently."
