        Summary:
        When cleaning a build, you often want to also remove the copy of the code and data stored on the device or in the simulator. In these cases deleting the app has to be done from the device or from the simulator; I propose adding it to Xcode as an optional step when cleaning that removes the built product from the destination.

        This could be considered as a step beyond the Clean Build Folder menu item.

        This would greatly simplify the workflow for these (not uncommon) cases when you need to blow away the data, and would therefore greatly improve my day.

        Thanks! :)
