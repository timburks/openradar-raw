        This is always the missing piece of the puzzle for me. We only want to send a new build to our testers when we have an appropriate set of features/fixes to show. I'd love to be able to set up a button on the web UI for Xcode's CI server called "Release to Testers". It's found next to every build in the archived builds list (alongside the flag button), so I can choose which build I want to release. When I click it, the following things happen:

        1. A dialog box appears, asking me to type in my chosen version number for this release.
        2. The server checks out the commit that was used to build the archive in question.
        3. It changes the version number in Info.plist, then commits that change back to the repository.
        4. It then builds another build, with the updated version number
        5. Finally, once that build is built, signed and turned into an IPA file, it runs a custom shell script that I configured earlier, passing the path to the IPA file as a parameter.

        With that tech, I can write a shell script to upload the build to TestFlight. The crucial thing is this incrementing the version number — when sending builds to our clients, the project managers tell us what version number to use, so an auto-generated build number is not OK. We need to be able to type in the version number manually.
