    description: "When submitting a problem with the Bug Reporter, it is in both ours, the developers', and Apple's best interest to have the bug filed as appropriately as possible to ensure that it reaches the right people in a timely manner. So it puzzles me then, that the current Product category listing does not correctly represent the current Apple product suite, or even appropriate general categories.\r\n\r\niOS is most of Apple's business now. So how come it is so hard to report a general iOS bug, which, as of June 2013, encompasses the following devices: iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and iPad mini. However, it is still mostly a single piece of software, sharing more than just some code and visual assets. Let's say I want to submit a genreal iOS bug — again, this is Apple's largest business right now — let's say, some random bug in the user interface. These are the sort-of-relevant categories I'm offered:\r\n• iOS App Store (» nope, this is the app store)\r\n• iPad (» but iOS runs on iPhones as well, and my bug is hardware-agnostic)\r\n• iPad SDK (» does the iPad have its own SDK? Does it not use the iOS SDK? This together with \"iPhone SDK\" is the weirdest option of them all.)\r\n• iPhone/iPod touch (» again, my bug report is about iOS, not about the device)\r\n• iPhone SDK (» same as with iPad SDK)\r\n• iOS SDK (» how is this supposed to work with the \"iPhone SDK\" and \"iPad SDK\" categories? This might actually be the one to choose, only my bug is about iOS itelf, not its SDK which is something you use in Xcode)\r\n\r\nSo far I've been using iOS SDK, even though, like I said, iOS SDK is something you use in Xcode, not the actual iOS on my device. However right now for iOS 7 I find myself using the \"iPhone/iPod touch\" option for now, as 7 is not yet available for the iPad.\r\n\r\nIn any regard, this needs to be fixed. Best to consolidate all the redundant categories into three simple ones:\r\n• iPhone/iPod touch/iPad (the hardware)\r\n• iOS (the software)\r\n• iOS SDK (the development tools — SDK)\r\n\r\nThank you."
