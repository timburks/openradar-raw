    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new Bot from Xcode, I am not given the option to change the repository and/or branch. If I'm working on an open source repository, it would be nice to not have to setup SSH keys on the machine running Server, and instead have it simply pull over HTTPS. Also, depending on when I create the Bot, I may want to select a separate branch. I also may want to setup multiple Bots for one project (master, development, etc), and doing so without changing codebase branches would be ideal.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Product > Create Bot\r\n2. Fill out the Create a new bot screen and hit Next\r\n3. On the next, Provide repository credentials for this bot, screen the Repository and Branch are not editable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to modify Repository and Branch for a Bot during creation\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI cannot modify Repository and Branch for a Bot during creation\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
