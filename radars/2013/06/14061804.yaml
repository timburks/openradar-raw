    description: "Summary:\n\nThe new WWDC app for iOS is a great improvement - opening up videos to all registered devs is fantastic. The fact that this seems to provide a relatively bug-free way to browse and view the videos without all the Videos app and iTunes U app authentication and download bugs is positive.\n\nHowever I am disappointed to find:\n\n1) Video sessions are streaming only, there is no download option for offline viewing i.e. when travelling\n\n2) Video streaming does not use \"reachability\" info nicely, and attempts to stream over GSM data even if 3G is not available (OUUUUCH!)\n\n3) There is no way to favourite session videos to return to them later\n\n4) There is no way to get the session number or share the session with another developer without writing the entire title out and telling someone to search for it\n\n5) That this is not integrated into iTunes U, where it was previously attempted but failed quite badly (I have raised a past issue about this). This solution is quite nice, but the lack of a more general ongoing effective iTunes U course for WWDC materials is disappointing and ... casts doubt on iTunes U as a learning platform due to lack of dogfooding.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Use the WWDC app\n2. Find a video\n3. Watch some of it\n4. Turn off wifi on the device\n5. Open the app again\n6. Watch the same video again from the beginning. \n\nExpected Results:\n\n1. Lovely informative WWDC videos viewable offline if previously viewed or explicitly tagged for downloading.\n\n2. A \"Share\" sheet to allow me to email/message/tweet a URL to a specific WWDC session video that will open the WWDC app if the recipient taps the link, and only shows to registered developers i.e. a WWDC app URL scheme.\n\n3. Sessions numbers should be visible in the Session info text view. I notice that searching by session numbers already works, but there is no way to find these in the app, and this is needed for part of (2), i.e. a custom url scheme wwdc-video://sessions/234\n\nActual Results:\n\nIt tries to stream over the cellular data network, or fails totally if you have no signal, even though you previously watched this part of the video.\n\nRegression:\n\nN/A\n\nNotes:"
