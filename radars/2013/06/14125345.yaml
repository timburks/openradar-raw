    description: "Summary: If a text is set on a label after textAlignment was set, the text stop respecting the textAlignment (and shows aligned to the left).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an UILabel via storyboard and set its textAlignment to NSTextAlignmentCenter (on the storyboard too)\r\n2. Create an outlet\r\n3. Set UILabel's text on viewDidAppear\r\n\r\nThis is happening when compiling with Xcode 5 beta and iOS 7 SDK, but running on iOS 6. When I run on iOS 7, it behaves as intended.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The label text is align according to the value of textAlignment\r\n\r\nActual Results: The label text is aligned on the left\r\n\r\nRegression: First seen on iOS 7.0 beta\r\n\r\nNotes:"
