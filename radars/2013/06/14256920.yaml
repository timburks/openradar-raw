    description: "Summary:\r\nThe lock /w setup screen swipe gestures cancels out the hold and drag to select extended ASCII characters on the lock screen keyboard. User may never be able to input those characters to get through the slide to unlock process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a non-simple passcode with extended ASCII characters\r\n2. OTA update to iOS 7 beta 2\r\n3. Firmware successfully installed, users are locked out from their own passcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt lock screen, user key in extended ASCII characters by holding on one key, wait until popover shows up and drag to select other characters.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe whole screen moves and the popover dismisses.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPut the device into restore mode and do firmware restoration.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
