    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen archiving any CLPlacemark object using NSKeyedArchiver and later trying to load the archived object, it does not save any of its properties like location or addressDictionary. This used to work prior to iOS 7, and the class indicates it conforms to NSCoding.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to obtain any CLPlacemark, like using CLGeocoder\r\n2. Archive it.\r\n3. With the NSData obtained, try to unarchive it.\r\n4. Check its properties, they are mostly nil.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProperties such as location or addressDictionary should be saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThose properties are nil after unarchiving.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt worked fine on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached sample code that can reproduce the issue. Notice the difference when ran on iOS6 vs iOS7. Please see output from NSLog."
