    description: "duplicate of 13487602\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlay a game that uses swipes up the screen, for example our popular game Hit Tennis 3. Swipes up the screen to hit the ball often trigger opening of control center, even in a landscape game. This makes the game un-fun.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n    Play Hit Tennis 3 on iOS7   https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-tennis-3/id506515857?mt=8 \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n   Should not continually open control center.\r\n   BTW Hit Tennis 3 is the most popular and successful tennis game on iOS, with over 9M downloads and growing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n   Does often open control center.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n   iOS6 game is great\r\n   iOS7 game controls are broken\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n   Can iOS7 have an API to disable control center for a game like Hit Tennis 3 that is designed around swipes up the screen? \r\n   Can opening control center be less sensitive in landscape orientation?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
