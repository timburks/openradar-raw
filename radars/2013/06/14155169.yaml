    description: "A program that acts as a remote debugger stub (of the Xojo development system) is suffering from falling into the power nap mode when it should not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nYou'd have to install Xojo and its remote debugger from xojo.com on two separate Macs and then set up a remote debug session.\r\n\r\nRather, I'll explain what's going on, which hopefully helps the engineers to find a better solution:\r\n\r\nThe remote debugger stub is a helper program that has one regular window and opens a network socket, waiting for commands from the IDE. Eventually, the IDE contacts the debugger and transmits several MB of data that the stub stores locally on disk, unpacks it and then launches the unpacked app. It also provides a local communication socket in order to allow the running app to be traced remotely once it runs, but that's not so relevant here.\r\n\r\nThe big issue is that, if this debugger stub is put into the background or even hidden (which is the sensible thing to do as its UI is not needed once it's set up and running), it comes to a crawl due to the nap mode, and thereby the IDE can't talk to the stub any more over the network at normal speed.\r\n\r\nI suppose this app should be treated like any \"server\" app therefore, i.e. it should not be put into nap mode, especially when it's having active network traffic on its socket. I guess that many other server-like apps would suffer from the same issue."
