    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new app using Xcode 5's Single View app template, the app is created with a single Storyboard.  This is irritating if the intention is to NOT use Storyboards - it then becomes necessary to adapt the App Delegate to launch the app from a xib.   \r\n\r\nMuch preferable would be to either create the Single View app with a xib file as in prior Xcode versions; or provide an additional explicitly Storyboard-based template or option to select which UI approach is used."
