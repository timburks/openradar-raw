        Summary:
        In "artist" view, when a song is selected, typing the return (enter) key doesn't play the selected song, but another one from the same artist.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. turn on Shuffle Play
        2. In "Music", got to "Artist"
        3. Select an artist
        4. highlight (select) a song
        5. Type "Enter" on the keyboard

        Expected Results:
        The highlighted song should be played

        Actual Results:
        another, seemingly random, song from the same artist is played.

        Regression:
        The problem doesn't occur when Shuffle mode is disabled, or anywhere else than the Artist view

        Notes:
        Happens on Mountain Lion 10.8.4, English (UK). Wasn't tried on another hardware.
