        Summary:
        Checkbox "Use Storyboards" is missing when creating a new project

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Launch Xcode5-DP
        Choose Project from File â†’ New menu
        Choose Single View Application from iOS Applications templates
        Click Next

        Expected Results:
        An option to Use Storyboards should be presented allowing to avoid creating storyboards and going with xib flow

        Not sure if is intended or just missing from the current build since there is an option to create xib files along with UIViewController subclass
