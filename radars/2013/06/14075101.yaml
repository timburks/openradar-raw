    description: "Summary:\r\nUIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification incorrectly sent twice when an app with a background task is killed from Springboard\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up an app that has some background work to do, is capturing audio or otherwise running in the background.\r\nBackground it -- it receives UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification.\r\nKill the app from Springboard before it finishes its background work -- it receives another UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAlready backgrounded apps should not be sent a redundant backgrounding notification. If there is a need to tell background apps that they've been told to knock it off, there should be another notification for this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication lifecycle listeners have to be wary and not mess stuff up when they are lied to by the system.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
