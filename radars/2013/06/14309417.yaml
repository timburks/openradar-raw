        Summary:
        Once a storyboard is upgraded to the new format, the Attributes Inspector does not show the "Presentation" drop-down when a modal segue is selected. This means that new modal segues cannot be changed from the default presentation. Existing modal segues (created before the storyboard was upgraded) with "Full Screen", "Page Sheet", "Form Sheet" or "Current Context" presentation styles still retain this information but it cannot be changed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
         - Create a new Single View iOS application project for iPad in Xcode 4.6.3
         - Add a second view controller to the Main
         - Create a manual "modal" segue between the two view controllers in the storyboard
         - Select the modal segue and change the presentation style in the Attributes Inspector to "Form Sheet"
         - Save the storyboard
         - Quit Xcode 4.6.3
         - Open the same project in Xcode 5
         - Select the Main storyboard and allow Xcode to upgrade it to the Xcode 5 format
         - Select the modal segue

        Expected Results:
        Expect to see the following drop-downs in the Storyboard Segue section of the Attributes Inspector:
         - Style
         - Presentation
         - Transition

        Actual Results:
        The Presentation drop-down is missing

        Regression:
        This issue appears to only affect storyboards that are created or upgraded to the new Xcode format.

        Notes:
        Downgrading a storyboard by changing the "Opens in" value to "Xcode 4.6" in the File Inspector restores the Presentation drop-down. After making changes, the storyboard can be upgraded back to the Xcode 5 format. However, this is a costly workaround as autolayout information can be lost.
