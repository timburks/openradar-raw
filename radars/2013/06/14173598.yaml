    description: "Hello, at the moment when one decided the slicing of an image in a xcassets, it's impossible to delete it  or to change modes (horizontal only, vertical only or both).\r\nIt would be nice to have a button on the screen that if any show slicing allows you to delete them to start over from scratch."
