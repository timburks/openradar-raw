    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen my iPhone 4 is connected to a 4G network, and wifi is turned off, my correct location is shown in Maps and other applications that show location. This seems to indicate that GPS works correctly on the phone.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I turn on the iPhone's wifi while at my home, the iPhone then shows my location as being at my Internet Service Provider's offices, which are over 50 miles away.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that Apple should use its database of wifi locations to assist in determining device location, but when the GPS information and wifi information conflict, the GPS information should be used, as that is more likely to reflect the actual location of the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Turn off wi-fi on phone. Verify that correct location is shown in Maps\r\n\r\n- Turn on wi-fi.\r\n\r\n- Show Maps application. Watch current-location dot suddenly move 50 miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDevice should display actual location based upon GPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDevice shows location that is unrelated to actual physical location.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nUPDATE: 2013/06/10:\r\n\r\nReceived email from devbugs@apple.com asking me to see whether bug still exists with iOS 7 beta 1.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can no longer reproduce the bug with iOS 6. I used the Maps \"Report a Problem\" feature to indicate the true position of my phone, and since that time, my phone's location has been displayed accurately. I don't know how to return it to the state where it used incorrect wi-fi location information.\r\n\r\nThe only other iOS devices I have are iPads and an old iPod touch. These devices do not have GPS. They do display incorrect location information, based upon inaccurate wi-fi information which I assume is still in Apple's location database, but iOS 7 beta 1 is not supported on these devices."
