    description: "Summary:\r\nSlide to unlock works across the screen. However, when there are notifications all over the screen, one can't swipe on the bottom side of the screen to unlock since that would swipe an app and hence open that app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave many notifications so as to occupy the whole lock screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nHave some space at the bottom dedicated to sliding as it used to be in iOS 6 and before. Only allow notifications until a certain space.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotifications go all the way from top to bottom. So one has to stretch his finger all the way up to swipe over the clock in order to unlock screen without opening any app."
