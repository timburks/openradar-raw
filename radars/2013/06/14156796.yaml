    description: "14-Jun-2013 09:38 AM Paul Goracke:\r\nIf you accumulate a number of projects for work and experimentation, it becomes difficult to remember which is which without actually opening the project in Xcode. I find that most often what I look for once open is the main XIB or Storyboard.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to provide an image representation of the main XIB or Storyboard for the project's QuickLook, so a developer can fairly easily confirm that a project is what they are looking for before opening full Xcode"
