        Summary:
        When copying an SKNode, the NSMutableDictionary userData property doesn't seem to be copied. I would expect this to happen. If this is by design, you should really put a warning in the documentation (I couldn't find anything).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In a Sprite Kit project run this code:
        	// Assuming Spaceship.png is part of the project.
        	SKSpriteNode *original = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"Spaceship"];
        	original.userData = [@{@"key1" : @"value1"} mutableCopy];
        	NSLog(@"Original userData: %@", original.userData);
        	SKSpriteNode *copied = [original copy];
        	NSLog(@"Copied userData: %@", copied.userData);

        Expected Results:
        The copied node is an exact copy of the original, including the userData dictionary.

        Actual Results:
        The userData dictionary seems to be nil. Output of the above code:
        2013-06-27 20:35:50.977 CopyTest[88781:303] Original userData: {
            key1 = value1;
        }
