    description: "Summary: Motion file browser uses naive numeric sort\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new Motion project\r\n2. Import a series of images named thusly:\r\n\r\nWallpaper-1.png\r\nWallpaper-2.png\r\nWallpaper-3.png\r\nWallpaper-4.png\r\nWallpaper-5.png\r\nWallpaper-6.png\r\nWallpaper-7.png\r\nWallpaper-8.png\r\nWallpaper-9.png\r\nWallpaper-10.png\r\nWallpaper-11.png\r\nWallpaper-12.png\r\n\r\n3. Make sure the \"view image sequences as one file\" icon is turned off.\r\n4. Sort by name, with the sort direction indicator pointing up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe images are in the order as listed above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sort is wrong in two ways:\r\n1. The sort order is interpreted the opposite of what is in the Finder. The small end of the sort direction indicator should show where the lowest values are - in the case of alphanumeric sort, this should be the beginning of the alphabet and the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc. Instead, it puts the end of the alphabet and the numbers 9, 8, 7, etc. at the top of the list. This is backwards from what the Finder does (as well as every other application I have seen).\r\n2. The two-digit numbers are sorted na√Øvely alphabetically, instead of being sorted numerically like in the Finder. The order as it appears in my copy of Motion is as follows:\r\n\r\nWallpaper-9.png\r\nWallpaper-8.png\r\nWallpaper-7.png\r\nWallpaper-6.png\r\nWallpaper-5.png\r\nWallpaper-4.png\r\nWallpaper-3.png\r\nWallpaper-2.png\r\nWallpaper-12.png\r\nWallpaper-11.png\r\nWallpaper-10.png\r\nWallpaper-1.png\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: screenshot at http://cl.ly/Psyr"
