        Summary:
        Connecting to a web server that uses an 8192bit RSA key is not possible.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a web server that uses an 8192bit RSA key and a valid SSL certificate.

        Expected Results:
        Safari and any other software using the system SSL libraries should be able to connect to such a server and validate the certificate.

        Actual Results:
        Safari as well as any other application using the system libraries for SSL connections cannot successfully connect to such a server. The SSL certificate is garbled. Safari in particular doesn't show any page.

        Regression:
        Connecting with Firefox 21.0 on 10.8.4 works fine. (It doesn't use the system SSL functionality but a recent version of OpenSSL.)

        Notes:
        The same problem exists in OS X 10.6.x, 10.7.x, 10.8.4, 10.9DP2, iOS 6.x.y, iOS 7DP2
