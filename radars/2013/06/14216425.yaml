    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a property and declares it to have attributes (nonatomic, readonly, strong), but then redefines it in a category to have attributes (nonatomic, weak), Xcode helpfully displays a warning:\r\n\r\nwarning: property attribute in class extension does not match the primary class\r\n\r\nHowever, if a property is declared with attributes (nonatomic, readonly) and redefined in a category as (nonatomic, weak), there is no such warning. Since the default storage mode is strong, the property is implicitly a strong reference.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the resulting attribute, checked at runtime, is strong.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the attached sample project. [available at http://tertiumquid.org/radar14216425/Strong%20References.zip]\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode warnings on lines 13 and 14 of ReferenceTest.m, where defaultRefString and strongRefString are redeclared as weak.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode warning only on line 14.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTested with Xcode 4.6.3 (4H1503) and with 5.0 (5A11314m).\r\n\r\nThe sample project, when run, prints the attributes of the properties and shows that both defaultRefString and strongRefString are strong references."
