    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen right clicking on a row in a (view-based) NSTableView, a blue outline highlight is drawn. This highlight is apparently drawn in a private method, -[NSTableView drawContextMenuHighlightForRow:], with no public way to customize it. It would be useful to be able to customize this drawing."
