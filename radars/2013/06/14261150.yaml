        Facebook emails notifying users about Facebook events are very, very common. It would be great it Mail.app could preview them well. As it stands, the preview includes "facebook" at the beginning, followed by an appended name of the person who generated the notification, with no separating spaces.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Get a Facebook notification email in Mail.app.

        Expected Results:
        Better formatting. Either get rid of the "facebook" at the beginning, or at least make sure that there is a separating space between it and the name,

        Actual Results:
        http://cloud.mgorbach.name/image/1n42360B1I1o
        "Facebook" and name not separated by spaces.
