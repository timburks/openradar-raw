    description: "26-Jun-2013 02:43 PM Chris Miles:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPlease release the Scene Kit framework and API for the iOS SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nScene Kit is currently unavailable when developing for iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWe would love to port some of our Scene Kit code to iOS. Scene Kit is a fantastic 3D scene graph abstraction and it would help us immensely with our 3D and OpenGL development of iOS apps.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWe are stuck developing 3D scenes the slow way using OpenGL ES directly and GLKit.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWithout Scene Kit, many iOS developers are forced to use third party 3D engines, even for fairly simple use cases. Let's keep everything clean & native Objective-C."
