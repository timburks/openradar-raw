    description: "13-Jun-2013 01:48 PM Roman Busyghin:\r\nSummary:\r\nCurrently it is impossible to recreate vector maps on iOS the same way MobileMaps.app does because of lack of synchronization between CAEAGLLayer and UIKit views.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample in the iOS simulator\r\n2. Pan scroll main app view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCenters of white and red squares are synchronized\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is a lag between red square and white square\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can fix this problem by using private method  -[CAEAGLLayer setAsynchronous:]. Pass NO and everything will work fine."
