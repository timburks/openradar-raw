    description: "18-Jun-2013 03:21 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCalled with a string longer than one character, UIAKeyboard.typeString throws an exception.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the simulator and set its version to 7.0 (11A4372q).\r\n2. Make sure that no other SDKs are installed. It suffices to temporarily remove iPhoneSimulator[5.1, 6.1, etc].sdk from /Applications/Xcode5-DP.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/. Note that you must do this *after* the Simulator has been opened and its version set, otherwise the Simulator will crash.\r\n3. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments should successfully run the `LogIn.js` script using the Automation trace template (as directed by `RunUIAutomationTests.sh`).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments gets to line 5 of LogIn.js (target.frontMostApp().keyboard().typeString(\"Jeff\");), taps the \"J\", and then prints the following:\r\n\r\n2013-06-18 14:26:02.245 instruments[72962:1207] _msgObj is __NSCFString\r\n2013-06-18 21:26:02 +0000 Debug: target.frontMostApp().keyboard() failed to tap 'e'\r\n2013-06-18 14:26:02.246 instruments[72962:1207] _msgObj is __NSCFString\r\n2013-06-18 21:26:02 +0000 None: Script threw an uncaught JavaScript error: target.frontMostApp().keyboard() failed to tap 'e' on line 5 of LogIn.js\r\n\r\nWhich causes the trace to terminate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes: following the steps to reproduce using the Xcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) developer tools (i.e instruments 4.5 (46000)) and iOS 6.1 yields the expected results.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is similarly broken when using iOS 5.1.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to test this using iOS 6.1 due to http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=3115412."
