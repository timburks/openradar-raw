    description: "14-Jun-2013 12:15 PM Nils Hayat:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nif I set a text color on a UILabel in interface builder in XCode 5. When later on I set the text of that label in code, the label loses the color I had set.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a label in a viewcontroller in a xib file,\r\n\r\nAssign a custom color to it.\r\n\r\nIn your code at some point, update the text of that label.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nthe text should be updated to the new text while keeping the old color\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nthe text is updated but the color is reset. (I think the alignment is also reset)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMost likely this is because XCode 5 actually sets the attributedText property of a label instead of it's text and textColor properties."
