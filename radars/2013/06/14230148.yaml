    description: "Many third party apps could benefit by being silences according to the device user's Do Not Disturb settings.  It is myopic to think that these settings should only impact Apple's apps and that third parties have to each implement their own DND settings.\r\n\r\nPlease expose the DND API to developers, even in a minimal fashion.\r\n\r\nOur app is a Voice-over-IP app, an alternative to the Phone app on the iPhone and on the iPad it is the phone that Apple doesn't provide.  This app should go silent if the user sets DND and should remain silent during the set hours.  Simply knowing that DND is on or off would go a long way.  Having access to the \"allow calls from\" group and the setting of the \"repeated calls\" switch would be icing on the cake."
