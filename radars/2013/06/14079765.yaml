    description: "06-Jun-2013 11:45 AM Simon Booth:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a mail account through the Settings app, the user is required to enter a password.  However, this password is not sent to the IMAP server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Open the Settings app, and navigate to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" > \"Add Account...\" > \"Other\" > \"Add Mail Account\".\r\n* Enter a name, email, password and description. Tap \"Next\".\r\n* Under \"Incoming mail server\", the password appears to have been filled in\r\n* Enter details of a mail server including user name, but do not alter the password\r\n* Tap \"Next\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe password should be sent to the IMAP server\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe password is not sent to the IMAP server.  However, if the password is deleted and re-entered under Incoming mail server, the password is sent.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOur mail server does not use SSL, so we have to tap 'Yes' when prompted to continue without SSL.  I don't have access to an SSL-enabled IMAP server to test whether this makes a difference."
