    description: "Static images are insufficient to represent the interactions and features provided by iOS apps.  Demo videos would provide more information and a more accurate impression of what the apps do and how it is done.  Many developers already provide videos on their own web sites as a means of demonstrating the value of their product to consumers.\r\n\r\n1) The iTunes App Store should support the use of developer-submitted demo videos in place of static screenshots.\r\n\r\n2) Apple should recommend and should prefer the use of demo videos over static screenshots."
