    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter updating to Developer Preview 2 of OS X Mavericks Server, some background processes begin writing data to the /Library/Server directory until the startup volume runs out of room (and the whole system ends up freezing as a result).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpgrade from DP1 to DP2 via the Mac App Store. Leave the system idle for 3-6 hours. Return to find your startup volume running low on disk space.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour system does not run low on disk space.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTens of Gigabytes of data get written to the /Library/Server/PostgreSQL For Server Services directory (23 GB worth for me) and /Library/Server/ProfileManager (18 GB worth for me) until the Volume runs out of disk space.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes. This issue did not happen in DP1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Server.app does not need to be running to exhibit this behavior, however deleting Server.app and the /Library/Server directory stopped the disk filling activities from occurring any longer. Here are other experiencing the same problem: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/192339?tstart=0"
