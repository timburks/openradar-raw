    description: "04-Jun-2013 01:05 PM Ben Kennedy:\r\nSummary: A key shortcut for \"Use Selection for Find\" is missing by default; the expected shortcut (as used in Xcode and elsewhere), Cmd-E, is instead assigned to \"Extended Detail\".  Since the former function is oft handy for initializing a symbol search in Xcode based on a stack frame viewed in Instruments, and the latter function is less-regularly toggled, it would be helpful to re-assign these commands.\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Assign Cmd-Shift-E to \"Extended Detail\"; it is a key shortcut not in use, yet easily typed.  Assign Cmd-E to \"Use Selection for Find\" for consistency with Xcode and many other apps."
