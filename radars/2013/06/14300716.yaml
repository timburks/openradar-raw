    description: "Summary:\r\nI have problems playing certain songs with iTunes Match, but the system never gives any error messages as to why things are failing. I've filed Case ID 461159607 with iTunes Support for a song I cannot download, but I have no information to give them other than \"it does not work\" because iTunes won't log any errors whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis is a bad experience for me, and for Apple, because I can't help you quickly find the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n - Have an error in your iTunes Match account. (Like, a song won't download.)\r\n - Click the exclamation mark.\r\n - Check syslog.\r\n - Expect a modal error dialog.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny error output whatsoever.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo error output save for a zero-information exclamation mark icon next to the song.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A. iTunes Match has never had good error output."
