Go to the detail page of a wifi network\r\n4. Quickly scroll down and see the HTTP proxy segmented control title animate\r\n5. Quickly scroll back up and see the same thing happen with the IP Address settings selection\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe title of the selected segment is static and doesn't move when it comes on screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe title of the selected segment animates when it is added to its superview\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSegmented control titles never moved before\r\n\r\nNotes:"
