    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using the volume rockers (especially while watching a movie or playing a game), a big HUD is displayed, indicating the current level of sound. \r\n\r\nIt covers the most important content in the center. \r\nAccording to the new Apple Human Interface Guidelines, UI should never compete with content: \r\n\r\n(first line: \"Deference. The UI helps users understand and interact with the content, but never competes with it.\")\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Use the volume rockers (buttons on the side of the iPhone) to change the volume while watching some video or using the iPhone in general.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA more subtle indication of the current sound level on the top or bottom of the screen without covering important content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA big window indicating the current level of sound that covers the most important content of the iPhone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProblem occurs on all versions of iOS. It's more obtrusive in iOS 7."
