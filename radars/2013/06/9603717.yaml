    description: "Summary:\r\nThe ability for iOS Developers to create widgets to work alongside their apps. (Similar to the \"Weather\" and \"Stocks\" widgets pre-loaded into the new Notification Center.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. The developer creates a widget that is bundled with the app when compiled (this limits the number of widgets to one per app).\r\n2. The developer submits their app to the App Store, and the app is reviewed in the same manner.\r\n3. The user then downloads the app, and has the ability (through the Notification Center Settings) to enable/disable the widgets.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe widgets can communicate with files from the application bundle, and can display data, give the user options, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nA useful feature addition to iOS 5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
