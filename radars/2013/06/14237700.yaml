    description: "22-Jun-2013 03:31 PM Kevin Chen:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nOn OS X 10.8.4 (12E55), Find My Mac will deactivate itself after awhile. This is a very serious issue, as it happens silently. The user probably won't notice that Find My Mac has disabled itself until they lose it and try to track it. \r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open System Preferences > iCloud. Check the \"Find My Mac\" box.\r\n2. Wait a few weeks to a few months.\r\n3. Open System Preferneces > iCloud.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nWithout user intervention, the \"Find My Mac\" box is still checked and the service is still turned on.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe box is not checked. On iCloud.com, the Mac appears as \"offline.\"\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nAlso observed on all OS X releases since 10.8.0, possibly earlier\r\nMid-2010 13\" MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nI haven't been using Mavericks long enough to see if this is a problem.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nOther users with the same problem:\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3860093?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4986639?start=0&tstart=0\r\nhttp://mac.bigresource.com/iCloud-find-mac-turning-itself-off-pciIqFVx9.html\r\n\r\n12-Jul-2013 02:58 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with them.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n\r\n09-Aug-2013 06:24 PM Kevin Chen:\r\nSorry if I misunderstood, but isn't this a serious issue? As it is now, Find My Mac is useless because it can't be activated for more than a few weeks at a time:\r\n\r\nIf a user turns on Find My Mac, then he/she expects to find the Mac when it connects to the Internet. Therefore, the Mac shouldn't randomly change the user's intended setting in a way that would make the Mac impossible to find. \r\n\r\nMaybe someone can explain the reasoning for closing this bug report as \"behaves correctly\"\r\n\r\n11-Jul-2013 11:58 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with them.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Aug-2013 10:07 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThank you for the feedback.\r\n\r\nEngineering has reviewed this report, and provided the following information:\r\n\r\nResetting NVRAM disables FMM setup.\r\n\r\nIts possible that you did a PRAM reset or installed an OS on another partition & turned of FMM there.\r\n\r\nNothing much to be done given the current architecture.\r\n\r\nWe are leaving this report closed.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to check new Apple releases for updates that might affect this issue."
