    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new inline documentation parsing/support is awesome!\r\nAs it stands now, it doesn’t seem to be able to emphasize portions of the comments.\r\n\r\nAs it is so much nicer to write than HTML, I’d love to see markdown support for documentation comments.\r\n\r\nThe most important Markdown features I’d love to see for commenting methods/functions are emphasis, and strong emphasis.\r\n\r\nFor class level conceptual documentation, I guess, the full feature would be pretty much required."
