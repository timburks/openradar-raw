    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://14172432\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nA user of an app is able to write and submit an App Store review from beta versions of iOS. This rarely results in meaningful information, as the behavior of the OS is subject to change until the final version, and as the app may be updated between the beta phase and the final release to accommodate API changes. More often than not, it makes for complaints of instability, performance issues, and other problems, which is non-constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an app on a beta version of iOS.\r\n2. Hop over to App Store.\r\n3. Write a review about the app, complaining about, say, stability, or (particularly in the case of iOS 7) a poorly adjusted UI.\r\n4. Submit it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should not be possible to submit the review.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe review can be submitted, giving the developer no helpful feedback (as they may already be working to adjust their app to the new OS version, and as the OS behavior itself is likely to be in flux until the final release), and giving other users a false impression of poor quality.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
