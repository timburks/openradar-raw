    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting setAutoresizesOutlineColumn to YES appears to have no effect.\r\n\r\nThe OS X 10.8 SDK documentation states:\r\n\r\nSets whether the receiver automatically resizes its outline column when the user expands or collapses an item.\r\n- (void)setAutoresizesOutlineColumn:(BOOL)resize\r\nParameters\r\nresize\r\nYES if the outline column is automatically resized, otherwise NO.\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe outline column contains the cells with the expansion symbols and is generally the first column. The default is YES.\r\n\r\nAvailability\r\nAvailable in OS X v10.0 and later.\r\n\r\nHowever in a simple sample project this option appears to have no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThat the first column of the outline would automatically expand or contract (resize) as items are expanded in the outline view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe column does not resize.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've not tried this on other OS versions but given the documentation description probably.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1632081/OpenRadar/NSOutlineView-Radar-14242845.zip"
