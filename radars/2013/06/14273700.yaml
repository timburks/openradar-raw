    description: "Summary:\r\nLooping an MP4 video file infinitely with AVPlayer, AVPlayerItem and AVPlayerLayer pauses the video playback after a random count of loops. I was able to reproduce this issue on iPhone 4 (with iOS 6.1.3). I was not able to reproduce it on iPhone 4S or iPhone 5. I did not try to reproduce it on other devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure an AVPlayer with the default option AVPlayerActionAtItemEndPause\r\n2. Observe the AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotification notification\r\n3. In the configured invocation for the notification, call [playerItem seekToTime:kCMTimeZero]; and [player play];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movies loops infinitely.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe movie stops after a random count of loops.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen using the option AVPlayerActionAtItemEndNone and omitting the call [player play];, the movie loops infinitely without any problems. Please see the attached project. The class FGMMoviePlayerController encapsulates all the AV Foundation logic."
