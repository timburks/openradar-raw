        Summary:
        One way of adding a framework to an Xcode project is to select the top item of the left tab of the left sidebar (the Project itself), then choose your target, choose the Summary tab, and click the Plus button by "Linked Frameworks and Libraries". When doing this, the new framework appears int he project navigator sidebar as a child of the Project, rather than in the "Frameworks" group (which is created by default).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Select the Xcode project in the project navigator, then choose your target, choose the Summary tab, and click the Plus button by "Linked Frameworks and Libraries". Select a system provided framework to add.

        Expected Results:
        New framework appears in the Frameworks group in the project navigator.

        Actual Results:
        New framework appears as a child of the project, and not in the Frameworks group.
