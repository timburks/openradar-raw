    description: "Summary:\n\nThe new IB tools for drag-in-a-direction-to-create-constraints and related constraints warning and repair mechanisms are very promising, but due to the fully expected bugs in the betas, and some limitations are very hard or impossible to use to achieve relatively simple UI tasks.\n\nAttached is a project showing a Messages.app-like UI with a full screen UIScrollView containing two views - another UIScrollView occupying the top part and  a fixed height view \"bar\" at the bottom. \n\nThe intention is that on any screen and orientation the bar and the \"content area\" scroll view will automatically fill the available width, and the nested content scrollview will use all the available height after subtracting the height of the fixed height \"bar\" view at the bottom.\n\nSetting this up in IB requires using the \"Pin\" menu options because of the direction \"smarts\" of the ctrl-drag mechanism (IMO this is flawed and should be adapted to always allow all available constraints, perhaps via a \"Show more\" option).\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nUnzip the project, open it in Xcode 5 beta 1, edit the iPhone storyboard and notice there are layout warnings on the bar view, indicating that the Y coordinate is not going to work out right. Preview shows it ok.\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThere should not be any constraints problems here. the bar view is pinned to the superview for leading, bottom and trailing, and has a fixed height. Its location would appear to be unambiguous.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThere is a layout warning that the Y coordinate is not correct.\n\nRegression:\n\nN/A\n\nNotes:\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
