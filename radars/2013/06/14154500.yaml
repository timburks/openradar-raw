    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nEvery single file, of every bit of Apple Sample code has the same copyright notice at the start.\r\n\r\nThis is really annoying. Sometimes it means there are 96 lines of Copyright comment for as little as 7 lines of code.\r\n\r\nIt means when you are browsing around a new sample, eager to get to the guts of the code and learn whats going on, you have to manually fold or delete the comment, before you can even read the code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHow about including a single license file with each sample project? This approach seems to work for a lot of Open Source software."
