    description: "01-May-2012 05:03 PM W Lewis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf \"Settings\" prompts to verify a mail server's identity, and you press Cancel, you get caught in a loop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet up an SMTP (outgoing) and IMAP (incoming) mail server which use SSL. Give them a certificate which is signed by an authority unknown to your iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSettings will 'verify' the server, notice that it doesn't trust the certificate, and ask you what to do. If you select \"Cancel\" it should cancel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf you select \"Cancel\", Settings will immediately retry verifying the server. There's no way to get out of this loop or to quit settings, unless you want to accept an untrusted certificate, which obviously you don't want to do.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
