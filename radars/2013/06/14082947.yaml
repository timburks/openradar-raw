    description: "Summary: During the completion block of animating content within a row in a collection view, if you reload rows in the collection view to have a larger height, and the user scrolls the UICollectionView rapidly at the same time, a \"phantom\" row can be created in the collection view.  This row is an additional, visible row which seems to have been forgotten by the inner workings of the collection view. \r\n\r\nNote: I have seen these rows appear without scrolling and in other scenarios, but this seems to be the most consistent way to reproduce the problem.  I have also seen this happen in the UITableView but it is far harder to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: See the attached project.  It has an example of code that can cause this crash.  The steps when running the project are:\r\n\r\n1. Click reload on 3-6 cells.\r\n2. Scroll the collection view up and down rapidly\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All of the cells reload correctly.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The cells reload correctly, but there are one or more additional rows created\r\n\r\nRegression: I am not aware of any version of iOS where this works.\r\n\r\nNotes: See the attached project for an example."
