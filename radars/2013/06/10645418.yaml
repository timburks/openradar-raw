See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBring up the WebDAV signin panel (tap wrench icon, \"Share and Print\", \"Copy to WebDAV\"). Enter a server address, username, and password as shown. Tap \"sign in\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEither success or an informative error message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCompletely useless dialog box.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the parameters of this bug are, of course, because Pages' error message is crap. It always happens on some servers. It doesn't happen on some other servers. Who knows why? Pages presumably knows, but it ain't telling. I used to expect better from you, Apple.\r\n\r\nNo informative errors are shown in the iPad's device logs."
