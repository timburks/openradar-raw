    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt appears that Disk Utility on Mac OS X 10.8.4's Recovery HD partition no longer can decrypt FileVault 2-encrypted Macs. \r\n\r\nIf you boot from a 10.8.4 Recovery HD partition, you can unlock a FileVault 2-encrypted boot drive but you can't decrypt it from Disk Utility.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Boot Mac and hold down ⌘-R (Command –R) to boot from the Mac’s Recovery HD partition.\r\n\r\n2. Open Disk Utility.\r\n\r\n3. Select your locked hard drive.\r\n\r\n4. Under the File menu, select \"Turn Off Encryption…\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Boot Mac and hold down ⌘-R (Command –R) to boot from the Mac’s Recovery HD partition.\r\n\r\n2. Open Disk Utility.\r\n\r\n3. Select your locked hard drive.\r\n\r\n4. Under the File menu, select \"Turn Off Encryption…\"\r\n\r\n5. When prompted for a password, enter the password of any authorized account on the drive.\r\n\r\n6. Mac should begin decrypting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Boot Mac and hold down ⌘-R (Command –R) to boot from the Mac’s Recovery HD partition.\r\n\r\n2. Open Disk Utility.\r\n\r\n3. Select your locked hard drive.\r\n\r\n4. Under the File menu, unable to select \"Turn Off Encryption…\" due to it being grayed out.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWent back to 10.8.3's Recovery HD and saw the same behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAll testing done in VMware running OS X VMs"
