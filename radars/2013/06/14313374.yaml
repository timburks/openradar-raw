        Summary:
        Often times, two developers will be working on the same project together, trying to track down the same bug, over chat. It can become very cumbersome to keep explaining "that line in this class" or something similar. Xcode has a wonderful "open quickly" feature where you can type the name of the file and the line number and go directly there. But there currently isn't any good way to quickly copy that line number.

        When you secondary click on a line number, there should be a menu item for "copy line number", that copies the name of the file and line number in a format that can be directly pasted into open quickly. e.g. "TUExample.h:34".
