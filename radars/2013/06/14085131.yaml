    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that any app run via Xcode into the iOS 6.1 simulator leaves a zombie process after you close the simulator or hit the stop button in Xcode.  Also, there are unpredictable but frequent crashes of apps right at launch which appear to have no valid cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project using the standard single view iOS/iPhone template.  Run the app, wait for it to launch and then hit stop.  At this point, a zombie of that process will be left over.  You can see this by using \"ps -el | grep Z\" on the command-line.  Each time you launch the app and stop it, you'll get another zombie of that app.\r\n\r\nSometimes as you run the process, it will crash.  This seems to happen about 1 in 4 launches or so.  It crashes in the main() function in the template code created by Xcode on the line with \"return UIApplicationMain\" -- this happens even if you do nothing to the template code.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should not crash, and zombies should not be left after any app is run in the simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis appears to be happening since the computer was upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8.4 yesterday.  We have confirmed this issue on multiple computers, all running XCode 4.6.2 and Mac OS X 10.8.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe see the zombie problem in each app we try, both existing apps we've written as well as new projects created just to test the issue (where we've written no code aside from the template-created stuff)."
