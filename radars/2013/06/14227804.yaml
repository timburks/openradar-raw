    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you have the notification center open you can scroll it down, which makes the backgroud visible and there are two status bars visible at one time. See screenshot for a visual representation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open notification center\r\n2. Grab the arrow, scroll up a little and then scroll down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Notification center should always be present at the top and the background shouldn't be visible, which as it happens has a second status bar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe background of the home screen is exposed and the home screen status bar peeks through, thus having two status bars.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs every time on iPhone 4S with iOS 7 Seed 1 (11A4372q)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached screenshot."
