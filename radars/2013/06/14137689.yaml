    description: "Summary:\r\nI use a Pebble watch with my iPhone, and it supports displaying push notifications via Bluetooth. System notifications such as phone calls and iMessages work fine, but other notifications are complex to turn on, and if the bluetooth connection is severed for any reason (like I walk out of range of the phone), they have to be reactivated in order to continue receiving them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect the iPhone to a Pebble via Bluetooth (or another bluetooth notifications capable device, I suppose).\r\n2. Set the \"Show Notifications\" switch in the Bluetooth device options to on.\r\n3. Turn on a custom push notification by opening the Notifications Centre settings, selecting an app (Tweetbot, for example), ensuring notifications are visible in the lock screen, and then setting the alert style to none and then back to banners.\r\n4. Send a test notification (I use a second twitter account to mention myself, which sends a notification). This should work by displaying the notification on the bluetooth device.\r\n5. Sever the connection by putting the bluetooth device into flight mode.\r\n6. Restore the bluetooth connection.\r\n7. Send another test notification. This one will fail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth test notifications should be seen on the bluetooth device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe second notification will not be displayed (and any other non-system push notifications sent).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSystem notifications (such as phone calls and iMessages) work fine without fail. Only custom push notifications fail to be sent after the connection has been severed and restored.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that the system forgets which apps to send notifications for once the bluetooth connection is severed. A fix for this would simply be to have an additional switch for each app that determines whether a notification should be sent to a connected bluetooth device or not. This should be remembered regardless of whether the connection is severed."
