    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you try to share something using SLComposeViewController with type SLServiceTypeTwitter and you add an URL via the method addURL: or if you write it directly on the setInitialText: or in the share sheet, automatically the count of the character remained dropped down to 109 even if the URL is something like http://a or bit.ly\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to share something with the built in share sheet for twitter and adding an URL\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe character count is diminished by the effective length of the string inserted\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf the system parse an URL the character count goes bananas.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt's seems that is always been like that, and in a social network severely character constrained every character lost is a big deal.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOn the bright side if the URL is something like 100 character long the count dropped always to 109 (please don't tell me that this is not a bug but a feature :))\r\n\r\n01-Jul-2013 04:24 PM Jacopo Andrea Giola:\r\nAs requested from the Engineering team, I've tested empirically the same problem on the iOS7 b2 on the simulator.\r\nIn Safari try to go on jury.me an share the URL with the built in twitter sistem. If we count event the http:// in the character count we found a total character count of 14 but the remaining character count drop to 118.\r\nThere is a stunning 8 characters missing!\r\nI know that most sites have a larger characters count but for sharing URLs already minified with external services is a waste of precious character."
