    description: "Summary:\r\nUIAppearance is a tremendously powerful API, however, it would be great if one could interact with it in IB.\r\n\r\nOne possible way of building that, might be a new kind of storyboard scene:\r\nImagine an “Appearance Catalog” scene, where every instance you create through drag n drop into that scene, actually coresponded to the appearance proxy for that class.\r\nSince it would be presented just as any other instance of that class, customizing of its properties would be directly visible, and could be done pretty much with the same inspectors that are already in place to edit standard instances.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as IB would already be aware of these customizations (at least inside that storyboard) these customizations could also be visualized in the view controller scenes of that storyboard.\r\n\r\nFor that “Appearance Catalog” scene, it’d be useful to set a class list corresponding to the varargs of the +[id<UIAppearance> appearanceWhenContainedIn:] call."
