    description: "28-Jun-2013 10:21 AM David Anderson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nHave recently begun using instruments + UIAutomation to perform functional testing of an iOS app.  Given the complexity of the app, it would be FANTASTIC if I could specify a file of UIAutomation javascript that could be performed as a \"post-run\" action that would programmatically walk through the UI, setting up the app-condition needed for the current development task.\r\n\r\nThat is, the UIAutomation script could define the setup condition necessary to facilitate development in a specific area of an app.  This would simplify the tedium of tapping through multiple views, text entry, etc before having the app configured for the next debug session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWrite UIAutomation javascript file to define the pre-conditions needed for the current development task, attempt to trigger that javascript to run as a post-run action in the Xcode Run scheme\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter running the app via Xcode, the javascript is executed bringing the app to the pre-condition specified and the developer may then enable breakpoints interact with the simulator/device and step through the code manually.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNot possible\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
