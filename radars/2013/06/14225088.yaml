    description: "20-Jun-2013 10:58 PM Mark Struzinski:\r\nSummary:\r\nAny time 2 developers are editing storyboards in the same project and both commit to source control, it causes merge conflicts\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nEdit a storyboard on 2 different machines based on the same source control revision\r\nTry to commit from both machines. The 2nd commit will cause a merge conflict.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEnhancements to storyboards would prevent these conflicts or make them easier to resolve\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMerge conflict causes extra development time to untangle. The only way to avoid it is to not make changes at the same time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
