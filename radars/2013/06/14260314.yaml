        Summary:
        Two status bar are displayed when the iPad Mini is in landscape orientation: one where it should be, and a second one as if the iPad was in portrait mode.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Turn on iOS 7b2 on an iPad Mini
        2. rotate the iPad so that it switches to landscape orientation

        Expected Results:
        The UI rotates, and one status bar is displayed on top of the screen

        Actual Results:
        The UI rotates, but the status bar is duplicated, thus leaving one on the side ("portrait" position), the other one on the top (normal landscape position).

        Regression:
        The aforementioned bug doesn't occur in iOS 6.
