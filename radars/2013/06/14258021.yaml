    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new file in Xcode, the checkbox to add the file to a target is not selected by default.  There are vanishingly-few scenarios where a new file would *not* be added to a target, therefore not selecting the checkbox by default adds an unnecessary step to the file creation process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a new file:\r\n* File -> New -> File (or cmd-N)\r\n* Select file type\r\n* Provide filename and select superclass\r\n* click next\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFile location dialogue is displayed, with the main target selected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFile location dialogue is displayed, but no target is selected.  Target has to be selected manually.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone."
