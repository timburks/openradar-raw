    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 5 introduced queue confinement for managing the concurrency of NSManagedObjectContexts. To use this functionality developers must submit blocks to the context using performBlock: or performBlockAndWait: . This is currently best documented in the iOS 5 release notes:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS5.html\r\nAnd in 2011 and 2012 WWDC Core Data sessions.\r\n\r\nQueue confinement is not covered at all in the Core Data Programming Guide section \"Concurrency With Core Data\" :\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdConcurrency.html\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a major oversight as the new queue confinement pattern offers significant benefits over thread confinement, but developers are likely to overlook queue confinement due to it's absence from the programming guide. \r\n\r\nDocumentation should include common use cases, correct and incorrect use, as well as information about safe and unsafe operations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
