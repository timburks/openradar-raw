    description: "In the Xcode 5 beta 2 after the placement of the constraint the UIImageView can't state to the compiler that it's intrinsic size is the size of the image loaded in the storyboard, so at building time spit out some warning to missing size and misplacement of all the views depending on the size of the UIImageView.\r\nThis seems a bug because if I specify that the UIImageView must sizeToFit, and I specify an image in the storyboard the compiler can derivate the intrinsic size of the imageView without prompt the user to insert it.\r\n\r\nAnd if this is not possible maybe it is possible to insert an intrinsic size popup on the view to specify directly without open the appropriate bar in the utilities bar? Or an automatic fix like the one for the missing semicolon or misspelling of a variable.\r\n\r\nThank you and go on for the amazing work for Xcode 5!"
