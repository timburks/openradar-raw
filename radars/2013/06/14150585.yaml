    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Key-Value Observing Programming Guide appears to cover the specific CoreData use case in some areas while not covering the more general use of KVO with objects (i.e. not managed objects)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis is most apparent in the section \"Registering Dependent Keys\"\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/KeyValueObserving/Articles/KVODependentKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002179-BAJEAIEE\r\n\r\nThe documentation here seems to be talking about CoreData relationships rather than general KVO use cases. While objects may have collections as properties available to KVO, this is not the same as a managed object having a relationship.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The KVO documentation should cover general KVO use rather than examples, etc. that are specific to use with CoreData.\r\n- CoreData documentation should cover using KVO with CoreData, and how CoreData uses KVO to perform it's magic. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConfusion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
