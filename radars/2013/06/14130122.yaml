    description: "Summary:\r\nCamera app only rotates part of the UI when switching to landscape. This makes is slightly difficult to change between video, photo, square and panorama.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen camera app in portrait mode, switch to landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText that says \"Video\", \"Photo\", \"Square\", \"Panorama\" should rotate it's text to be vertical or similar. Otherwise it looks a bit strange and might not be very friendly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText stays the same, everything else rotates"
