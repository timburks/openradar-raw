        Summary:
        There's a 50MB limitation for apps to be able to be downloaded via 3G networking. Most people try to stay under this limit on their apps for obvious reasons. Unfortunately this is very tricky when the launch images have to be in png format, and a  2048-by-1536px image can be as big as 6MB. This would be easy to solve if we were able to use jpg images.

    title: iOS should allow launch images in jpg format because having to ship a 6MB iPad@2x launch image takes too much space
