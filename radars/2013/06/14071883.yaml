    description: "05-Jun-2013 11:28 AM Ben Kennedy:\r\nSummary:  Beginning with a recent 10.8.4 seed, and still present in the GM release (12D55), is a regression in the dev toolchain that causes every fresh build and run in the Simulator to crash with a message like this in the log:\r\n\r\nCouldn't register com.kashoo.mobile.Kashoo-ipad-Dev with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code (1100).\r\nThis generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Build and run a project targeting iOS 6.1 simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  Process is launched in the iOS simulator and runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Process crashes in the simulator, and a message (unknown error 1100) is logged, as above.\r\n\r\nRegression:  Worked properly (same project/code) under 10.8.3 and earlier OS.\r\n\r\nNotes:  The workaround is to manually quit the iOS simulator after every run.\r\n\r\nThis is more of an inconvenience with the dev toolchain rather than an end-user crash or data loss scenario, so I'm classifying as \"performance\" rather than \"crash/hang/data loss\".\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Jun-2013 11:28 AM Ben Kennedy:\r\n'iOS sim process crash log 12E55.txt' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n05-Jun-2013 11:34 AM Ben Kennedy:\r\nTypo in the summary; by 12D55 I meant 12E55."
