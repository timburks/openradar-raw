    description: "12-Jun-2013 05:21 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nThis is a duplicate of rdar://13607967. The following is copied from that Radar, lightly edited, with some additional notes at the end.\r\n\r\n>>>>>>\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen launching UIAutomation tests in command line, the iPad simulator is always opened for Universal app, and  there is also no simple way to set the Simulator device type. One possible way is to force TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY at build time to force the Simulator to either be iPhone or iPad. But in this case, we can also not tell the Simulator to be 3.5\" or 4\", or Retina and Not retina for instance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a xcode project for an Universal app in Xcode 4.6.1.\r\n2. Create some UIAutomation script for this project:\r\nTest1.js:\r\n  var testName = \"Test 1\";\r\n  var target = UIATarget.localTarget();\r\n  var app = target.frontMostApp();\r\n  var window = app.mainWindow();\r\n\r\n  UIALogger.logStart( testName );\r\n  app.logElementTree();\r\n  UIALogger.logStop( testName );\r\n3. Launch the iOS Simulator with its device type set to \"iPhone\".\r\n4. Launch instruments in command line for this script\r\n\r\ninstruments \\\r\n-t \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Instruments.app/Contents/PlugIns/AutomationInstrument.bundle/Contents/Resources/Automation.tracetemplate\" \\\r\nname_of_app \\\r\n-e UIASCRIPT absolute_path_to_the_test_file  \r\n\r\n4. The Simulator changes to an iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to precise which Simulator is launching at CLI for instruments.\r\nIdeally, one could ask for \"iPhone\", \"IPhone Retina 3.5\", \"iPhone Retina 4\", \"iPad\", \"iPad Retina\", etc... \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere is no simple way to set the Simulator device type when launched in CLI.\r\n\r\n<<<<<<\r\n\r\nAdditional notes: it is possible to work around this issue by doing the following prior to testing:\r\n\r\n1. building with an TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY override, and\r\n2. GUI scripting the Simulator to set its device type\r\n\r\nBut it would be much more useful if instruments did not _at the least_ forcibly choose to run a Universal application using the iPad Simulator.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, it would be nice if instruments could be invoked with a specific device type to remove the need to change the Simulator's device type, using GUI scripting, before running the tests."
