    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAttempting to start Xcode Server on OS X Mavericks, after an update from OS X Mountain Lion, won't work because of the Xcode license needing to be accepted. When Xcode is opened normally, i.e. when Server is not trying to start, there is no license agreement alert.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade to OS X Mavericks from Mountain Lion 10.8.3 with Xcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) installed.\r\n2. Install Xcode 5-DP (5A11314m) and OS X Server 2.256 (261.3).\r\n3. Open Xcode 5 and accept license.\r\n4. Open Server and try to start the Xcode server\r\n5. Server will \"Try to connect with Xcode\"\r\n6. Server will fail to connect with Xcode: \"To use this Xcode, you must agree to the terms of its software license agreement.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode Server should start if you are able to open and run Xcode 5 normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode Server cannot be started.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
