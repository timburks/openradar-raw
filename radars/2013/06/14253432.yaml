    description: "24-Jun-2013 07:33 PM Joel Housman:\r\nSummary: In iOS 7, Beta 2, various large metropolitan cities are having their names cut off. Washington, DC is a prime example.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add Washington, DC as a city under the World Clock section.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: To display the full, proper name of the city without it being cut off.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The name appears as Washington,...\r\n\r\nRegression: This was also present in Beta 1.\r\n\r\nNotes: I think it is completely unacceptable that the capital of the United States of America has it's name truncated in order to accommodate the new font and font size in the Clock app. Content before Design? Please refer to your own HIG."
