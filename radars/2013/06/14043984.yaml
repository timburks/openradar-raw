    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen downloading a file from Safari, the download progress is correctly reported in the Safari toolbar button, downloads popover, and downloads folder in the Dock, but is not updated in a Finder window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download a large enough file in Safari such that you can observe the download progress.\r\n2. Open the Downloads folder in the Finder.\r\n3. Switch to Icon or List view if necessary.\r\n4. Observe the download progressing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe progress bar in the Finder, either within the icon in Icon view, or in the Size column in List view, updates to reflect the progress of the download.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe progress bar in the Finder remains \"stuck\" near its start and does not update until it disappears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPerhaps twice, I have observed this behavior not to occur. I'm not sure what I did to cause this to work properly, but I have observed this behavior several hundred times on multiple different Macs running all released versions of OS X 10.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see attached screen shot (http://sabi.net/temp/14043984/downloads.png)."
