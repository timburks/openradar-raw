    description: "Summary:\r\nIn this beta of iOS 7, Siri no longer recognizes the humor in hiding a body.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Activate Siri.\r\n2. Say: \"I need to hide a body.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should respond with: \"What kind of place are you looking for?\" and list: dumps, reservoirs, swamps, mortuaries, cremation services, funeral services, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri responds with: \"Here's what I found on the web:\" and lists Bing search results.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe expected result still functions in iOS 6, but is removed from iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried wording the phrase in various different ways, but all resulted in Bing search results."
