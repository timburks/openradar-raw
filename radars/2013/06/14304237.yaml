    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing an MPVolumeView as an indicator of AirPlay availability (and to select the AirPlay endpoint) suffers from the deficiency of ALWAYS using the iPhone-sized art.  Thus when building an AVFoundation-based video player and including an iPhone-size UI as well as an iPad-sized UI, the AirPlay selector on iPhone is a correct size, but on iPad (with slightly larger video controls) the AirPlay selector *only* shows up in an iPhone size and therefore is disproportionally small compared to the rest of the UI.  (This assumes a custom AVFoundation player with video controls size to match the iPad MPMoviePlayerController player control sizes.)\r\n\r\nThat is, it is not possible to fully replicate the UI of MPMoviePlayerController on iPad because the MPVolumeView, configured as an AirPlay selector, only ever shows up using the iPhone artwork.  (UIKit-Artwork-Extractor confirms that there is iPad-specific AirPlay artwork, but MPVolumeView cannot be configured to use it.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlace MPVolumeView configured as an AirPlay selector in an iPad UI.  Note the size difference between the MPVolumeView vs the AirPlay selector in MPMoviePlayerController.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat MPVolumeView automatically recognizes that it is on an iPad and uses the iPad-size art (matching MPMoviewPlayerController)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMPVolumeView only ever displays the iPhone-sized art.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
