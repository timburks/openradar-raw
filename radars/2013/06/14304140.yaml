    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile developing an AVFoundation-based video on demand player, we encountered numerous numerous AVPlayerItemErrorLogEvent instances and for each instance the errorStatusCode (property defined in AVPlayerItem.h) the error codes are not published or otherwise documented.  While its nice that we can investigate issues using AVPlayerItemErrorLogEvent, it is frustrating to not know what each errorStatusCode means (even loosely).\r\n\r\nSome of the error codes we encountered include\r\n-12660 seems to be related to geoblocking error (a 403)\r\n -1009 seems to be a network error\r\n -12938 seems to be is a 404\r\n\r\nThe ability to understand and properly respond to these error codes would allow us to improve the reliability, robustness and user experience of our AFFoundation-based VOD apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe presence of AVPlayerItemErrorLogEvent.errorStatusCode values in a header.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nerrorStatusCode values with no description of their meaning.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
