    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAccording to Apple's documentation, if a class overrides isEqual: it must also override hash to preserve the invariance. SKPayment appears to override isEqual: but not hash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a SKPayment object. To do this you'll have to get an SKProduct, which can only be created as part of a SKProductsResponse object, which requires a custom StoreKit setup. Thus, no sample project is provided.\r\n\r\nSKProduct *product = ... //Get this from somewhere\r\nSKPayment *paymentA = [SKPayment paymentWithProduct:product];\r\nSKPayment *paymentB = [paymentA copy];\r\n\r\nBOOL equal = [paymentA isEqual:paymentB];\r\nNSUInteger hashA = [paymentA hash];\r\nNSUInteger hashB = [paymentB hash];\r\n\r\nNSLog(@\"isEqual: %d     hashesEqual: %d\", isEqual, hashA == hashB);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nisEqual: 1     hashesEqual: 1\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nisEqual: 1     hashesEqual: 0\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
