    description: "Summary:\r\nThe text of multiple UILabels is combined into 1 UIAStaticText when inside a UIATableCell from UI automation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UITableCell.  Add multiple UILabels to it (each with text).  Log an element tree in Instruments UI Automation.  Observe that all UILabels are combined into 1 UIAStaticText instead of appear as multiple UIAStaticText.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a UIAStaticText for each UILabel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll text from the UILabels is combined into 1 piece of text in a UIAStaticText.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBecause the text of multiple labels is combined into one string (one UIAStaticText) it makes it impossible to test the string portion of each individual label by itself.  It also makes it impossible to perform tests that verify a label appears to the left/right top/bottom relative to another label.  It also makes it impossible to perform size and location tests of the labels."
