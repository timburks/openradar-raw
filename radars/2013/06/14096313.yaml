    description: "Summary:\r\nOnly UIACollectionCells which are on screen appear in the element tree in Apple instruments UI automation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an app that uses collection views.  Populate it with enough collection cells such that you need to scroll to view the rest.  Write an automated test that logs the element tree.  Only the UIACollectionCells that are on screen appear in the element tree.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll UIACollectionCells should appear in the tree (even ones that we haven't scrolled to yet).  This is inconsistant with how UIATableCells work: UIATableCells always appear in the tree - even the one's off screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the UIACollectionCells which are on screen appear in the element tree."
