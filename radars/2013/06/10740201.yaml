    description: "23-Jan-2012 01:02 PM Ben Kennedy:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the usage statistics shown to the user, the iPhone accounts for the net duration of FaceTime calls under \"cellular call time usage\", whether or not the FaceTime sessions are conducted over the cellular network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. visit Settings.app > General > Usage > Cellular Usage.\r\n2. observe  the \"Call Time\" listed under \"Current Period\".\r\n3. using a Wi-fi connection, engage a FaceTime conversation for several minutes or hours.\r\n4. re-visit Cellular Usage, and observe the increase in \"Call Time\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo change for Call Time, since no cellular network activity was incurred.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCall Time increments, despite the lack of cellular network activity.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is misleading to the user, since it foils any useful reporting of the actual number of cellular airtime minutes used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23-Jun-2013 05:25 PM Ben Kennedy:\r\nThis bug still exists in iOS 7 (11A4372q)."
