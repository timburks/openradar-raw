    description: "Summary: \r\nSafari has a setting called \"Safari opens with\" and a value that it can be set to called \"All windows from last session\". This setting is honored if Safari is opened by launching the application directly. However, it is not honored if the application is opened by clicking on a URL from an external application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nSet the \"Safari opens with\" preference to \"All windows from last session\". Open up some web pages in tabs. Close Safari. Go to another program with a URL. Click on that URL to open it in Safari.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nSafari opens the tabs from the previous session as well as a new tab or window containing the URL that was clicked on from the external program.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari opens a new window with the URL from the external program, but never re-opens the windows from the last session. Those windows can be re-opened manually using the History menu, but if you navigate or open too many tabs before you remember to do so, your previous session is gone forever. This only happens if the opening of Safari is triggered by clicking on a URL from an external application. If you click on Safari directly to open it, it always remembers the windows from the previous session."
