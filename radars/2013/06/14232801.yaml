    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe new snapshot method in UIView returns a UIView based on the contents of the current view - I would like a similar method that returns a UIImage or CGImageRef composited from the layers of the current view, in a more performant manner than CALayer's renderInContext: method. \r\n\r\nThis would be useful for image processing effects, such as blur, for the purpose of screenshot based animations, since CIFilter or OpenGL filters can take in CGImageRefs as input. Otherwise, having to perform renderInContext: prior to image processing, whether cpu or gpu, significantly slows down the animation. \r\n\r\nIf it helps the performance, probably the rendering can be done at a low resolution, since the image data is going to be filtered and then animated within a short period of time, and for other purposes that require high resolution I believe the snapshot method is sufficient.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
