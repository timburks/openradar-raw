    description: "26-Jun-2013 10:56 AM Sorin Cioban:\r\nSummary: Since the introduction of folders, it's been very complicated to copy apps from one folder to another. With iOS 6, it was fairly understandable as folders had a limited size. With iOS 7, however, folders are unlimited. So in this case, it would be nice that if a folder is dragged on top of another, the contents of the two folders are merged into the folder content is being dragged to.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFolder A has apps A1, A2, A3\r\nFolder B has apps B1, B2, B3, B4\r\nDrag folder A on top of folder B\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFolder A becomes A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, B4\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFolder A moves aside to leave room for folder B\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
