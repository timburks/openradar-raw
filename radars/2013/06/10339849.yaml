    description: "In iOS 5 beta 1, users can selectively delete Documents & Data from within Settings - General - Usage - <App Name>. This proved to be a good solution that developers can provide to end users instead of telling them to delete the app and reinstall from the App Store. For example, developers can tell the user to delete a certain settings file that will reset the application back to its original state without having to delete the entire app (including data) and reinstall from the App Store, something which may be an issue if the user is not connected to Wi-Fi and the app size is very large. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap on Settings\r\n2. Tap on General - Usage\r\n3. Tap on any app that appears in the list\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA list of data files used by the app is listed. If Restrictions are not in effect, users can even tap on Edit on the top right corner and selectively delete any data files from the list. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDocuments & Data is listed together with its size. \r\nUsers are not able to delete Documents & Data. \r\nIf Restrictions are not in place, Delete App button appears. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUsers wanting to reset their application back to its original factory settings would have to delete the app using the normal method (e.g. tap and hold until it wiggles, tap on X). If users are mobile, they will have to wait until they are back to their Mac/PC before reinstalling the app. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nHaving the ability to at least delete Documents & Data from General - Usage - <app name> brings iOS 5's PC-Free initiative to an even higher level. Users are able to reset their applications back to factory state without worrying about losing data or having to connect to a Wi-Fi, if the app is larger than 20MB."
