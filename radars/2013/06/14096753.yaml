    description: "Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n* There could be a method that waits until an element is in the tree.\r\n* There could be a method that searches the tree for an element with the given name, value, class or a combination thereof.\r\n* All visual components should adhere to the accessibility identifier protocol.  Example: UIBarItem does not inherit from UIView therefore it does not have the accessibility identifier property.  Another example is action sheet items/buttons.\r\n* Debugger.\r\n* Test assertion functionality.\r\n* More robust javascript runtime.  Example: jQuery can't be loaded because its too large for the current runtime.\r\n* Is there a way to simulate running multiple devices (like 500) at one time for load testing the services (assuming the app is networked).\r\n* Provide various log level control e.g. info, debug, warning, error, etc...\r\n* There could be many methods on UIAElement and descendants such as:\r\n    A method on UIAElement to tap the element based on coordinates.  You'd want this because some elements\r\n    may not be tappable, but you might want to tap them.\r\n    Add a method to select the enter and delete keys on a keyboard."
