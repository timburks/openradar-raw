    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOne of the recent releases in llvm introduced the \"objc_requires_super\" attribute, and it's available in Xcode 4.6.2 and above.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no official documentation on its use, neither in the Apple docs, nor on the llvm.org release notes. The \"most official\" source for info about this is a Stack Overflow post by Bill Bumgarner: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16094095/give-warning-when-super-method-is-not-called\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have an official documentation explaining the exact semantics of this attribute."
