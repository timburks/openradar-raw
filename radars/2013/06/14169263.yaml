    description: "Summary:\r\nSiri does not use the phonetic first name field to pronounce the first name of a contact when the contact has a nickname.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a contact whose first name is \"First\" and last name is \"Last\".\r\n2. Set the phonetic first name field to \"Phonetic\".\r\n3. Set the nickname field to \"Nickname\".\r\n4. Open Settings, tap General, tap Siri, tap My Info, and select the contact we just created, \"First Last\".\r\n5. Activate Siri, and ask: \"What's my name?\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should respond by saying: \"You're Phonetic, but you asked me to call you 'Nickname'.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri responds by saying: \"You're First, but you asked me to call you 'Nickname'.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem does not occur when the nickname field for that contact is left empty. Siri would respond by saying: \"You're Phonetic. That's what you told me, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease refer to the attachment for an example contact containing these fields as described.\r\nThis issue was also reproduced on a device running iOS 6.1.3, yielding the same results."
