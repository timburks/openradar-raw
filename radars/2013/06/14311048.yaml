    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWithin the sample code section of ADC/iOS Dev Center there is \"ThreadedCoreData\". This is a good example of the old model of thread confinement used prior to iOS 5.\r\niOS 5 introduced the alternative, queue confinement, and with that nested contexts. This has many, many benefits.\r\nThere is no sample code illustrating it's proper use. Creating a counterpart to ThreadedCoreData that shows the best practices for using queue confinement and nested contexts would be extremely helpful to the developer community.\r\n\r\n\"Nested contexts make it more important than ever that you adopt the “pass the baton” approach of accessing a context (by passing a context from one view controller to the next) rather than retrieving it directly from the app delegate.\"\r\n\r\nThis in particular should be illustrated by the sample code, as previous sample code and XCode Core Data templates actually do the opposite - which has some developers under the impression that putting the whole core data stack on the app delegate is a best practice.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
