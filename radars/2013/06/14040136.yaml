    description: "Summary:\r\nIn an application that makes use of autolayout, set up a UIPickerView with 10 rows. If the method selectRow:inComponent:animated: is called from viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear, the the picker will not successfully select the last row, but will display the next-to-last row.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with a UIPickerView contained in a nib that uses autolayout\r\n2. Assign a data source that provides 10 rows.\r\n3. In viewWillAppear, select the last row\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selected row is displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view appears with the next to last row selected. All other rows can be selected successfully.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCalling selectRow: from viewDidAppear selects the row properly, but the UIPickerView either jumps or rotates to the correct row, which doesn't look good"
