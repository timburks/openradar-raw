    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen driving an app via UIAutomation it would be incredibly useful to be able to specify the Network Link Conditioner setting for the simulator and the device via UIAutomation. This would allow the UIAutomation framework to be used to create network-condition-specific tests, allowing validation of the app in *controllable* network conditions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nNo steps. Network link conditioner settings are available only on the device and only via the Settings app.  UIAutomation does not have access to the network link conditioner settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUIATarget should have access to the network link conditioner settings for the device *and* the simulator, including the ability to enter airplane mode, turn off wifi, and vary the performance of the app via the normal network link conditioner.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCurrently the simulator can only simulate no network by disconnecting the host computer from the network. The iOS device must be manually entered into a specific network condition by hand, and it is not possible to mix UIAutomation testing with varying (per-test) network conditions.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis ability would increase the usefulness of UIAutomation to test real-world conditions, simply the testing process for developers, and increase the quality of apps that have to deal with varying network conditions."
