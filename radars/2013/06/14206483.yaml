    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring app install or update, the time remaining indicator fluctuates or is generally inaccurate in compared to actual time taken to install.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTo reproduce, install or update any large app. XCode 4.6 is a good example.\r\n\r\nWatch as the time indicator jumps from 15 minutes, to 7 minutes, to 5 minutes, to less than a minute, and back to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nInstead of using a absolute disk speed, use moving weighted average to compute a more realistic time remaining count. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe time indicator jumps from 15 minutes, to 7 minutes, to 5 minutes, to less than a minute, and back to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas always happened.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
