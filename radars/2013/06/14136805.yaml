    description: "12-Jun-2013 06:15 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe instruments command-line tool will only run using the iOS Simulator 6.1 SDK. This prevents testing an application against multiple versions of the SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the iOS Simulator. Set its device type to \"iPhone\" and its version to \"5.1 (9B176)\".\r\n2. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments should run the `LogIn.js` script using the Automation trace template (as directed by `RunUIAutomationTests.sh` using the 5.1 Simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments switches the Simulator to 6.1, then runs the script.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis bug is reproducible regardless of the SDK that the application is built with--even if it is built using the 5.1 SDK, instruments will still launch the 6.1 Simulator.\r\n\r\nThis bug is also reproducible even when instruments runs a template which has configured to run a particular executable using the 5.1 SDK--when that template is run using the Instruments GUI, the 5.1 Simulator will launch; but when the command-line tool runs the template, the 6.1 Simulator will launch.\r\n\r\nUsing the instruments command-line tool included with the Xcode 5 developer tools (build 5A11314m), the tool chooses the *oldest* SDK installed (and in fact will not even run tests using the iOS 6.1 SDK: http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=3115412)."
