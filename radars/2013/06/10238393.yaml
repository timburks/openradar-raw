    description: "05-Oct-2011 02:05 PM Chris Hubbard:\r\nSummary:  In iOS 5, the new notification center has the default \"Alert Style\" as Banners.  For my app \"Your Turn - Kid Timer\", it works best if the Alert Style is defaulted to \"Alerts\".  One solution would be to allow a setting in the info.plist that would specify the default setting.  \r\n\r\nAnother possible solution would be to allow the application to specify what are the allowed Alert Styles for the application, but I don't like that as much.\r\n\r\nWhat about allowing the application to change the setting programmatically?  Otherwise I will have to add first-run documentation on how to change the setting. ugh.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
