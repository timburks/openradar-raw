    description: "18-Jun-2013 02:37 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe instruments command-line tool included as part of the Xcode 5 developer tools (build 5A11314m) will not launch UIAutomation tests if the iOS Simulator is using the iOS 6.1 SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the simulator and set its version to 6.1 (10B141).\r\n2. Make sure that neither the iOS 5.1 SDK nor the iOS 7 SDK are installed. It suffices to temporarily remove iPhoneSimulator[5.1, 7.0].sdk from /Applications/Xcode5-DP.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/. Note that you must do this *after* the Simulator has been opened and its version set, otherwise the Simulator will crash.\r\n3. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments should run the `LogIn.js` script using the Automation trace template (as directed by `RunUIAutomationTests.sh`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments launches the app, prints a series of lines of the format \"pid 2 = <pid>\", followed by \"Its me!!!\" (sic), and then stalls.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes: following the steps to reproduce using the Xcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) developer tools (i.e instruments 4.5 (46000)) yields the expected results.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf the above steps are repeated using iOS 5.1 or iOS 7.0, the \"pid 2 = <pid>; ...; Its me!!!\" messages will still print, but LogIn.js will execute."
