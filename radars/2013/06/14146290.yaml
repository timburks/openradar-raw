    description: "13-Jun-2013 12:59 PM Monroe Williams:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe change to the behavior of the 'tintColor' property (as documented in the headers for UINavigationBar and UIToolbar in the iOS 7 SDK) causes existing, shipping applications that use this property to behave incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall the shipping version of an application that uses UINavigationBar.tintColor or UIToolbar.tintColor on an iOS 7 device.  Examples among our applications include the various \"Gumtree\" applications for Australia, South Africa, and the U.K., and the \"eBay Annunci\" application for Italy.  Compare the appearance of the nav bar in the application when running under iOS 7 to that when running under earlier iOS versions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav bar and toolbar in apps which were compiled against pre-iOS 7 versions of the SDK should have the same color tints when running under iOS 7 as under previous versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNav bars and toolbars that are colorized using the tintColor property are now no longer the proper color under iOS 7.  Nav bar buttons may be colorized or not, depending on whether they are using the system default assets or have custom graphics.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2013 12:47 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue: \r\n\r\nPlease attach a sample project that demonstrates the issue you're reporting.\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2013 02:45 PM Monroe Williams:\r\nAttached a simple project, TintColor.zip that demonstrates the issue.\r\n\r\nBuild this app against the iOS 6.x SDK, and install it on an iOS 6.x device.  Notice that the color of the tab bar and nav bar change when switching between the two tabs.\r\n\r\nInstall the same build on an iOS 7 device, and notice that neither the tab bar nor the nav bar change colors when switching tabs.\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2013 02:45 PM Monroe Williams:\r\n'TintColor.zip' was successfully uploaded"
