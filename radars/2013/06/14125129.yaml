    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen doing a CORS AJAX request that does preflight the network activity spinner will show and never go away even navigating to other pages and refreshing the page. Closing the tab will stop it showing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen this demo[1] on an iPhone running iOS6 and click the CORS button. I've also created a gif of the issue[2].\r\n\r\n[1] http://thecssninja.com/demo/spinnerbug/\r\n[2] http://thecssninja.com/i/spinnerbug.gif\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe network activity spinner should show and then go away upon success.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe spinner persists for the life of the tab and won't go away.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf there is no preflight in a CORS request then the spinner works as expected. This issue is still present in iOS7 beta."
