    description: "Summary: The \"full screen\" transition effects (whereby the key window slides slowly into its own full frame space, and opposite) are cumbersomely slow and an impediment to the user, particularly when they are encountered frequently in one's workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Pick any app that supports \"Full Screen\" (e.g. Xcode, iTunes, Safari, …).  Enter \"Full Screen\".  Sit patiently and watch the eye candy.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Snap! Full screen, no waiting.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Molasses.\r\n\r\nRegression: This irksome behaviour has been the norm since the feature was first introduced.\r\n\r\nNotes: PLEASE provide some means for the end user by which to turn this off—preferably as a user default that can be set globally or on a per-app basis.  Icing on the cake would be developer API to suppress such behaviour on a per-window basis."
