    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI use CocoaPods in my projects. Part of my current CI setup is running the `pod install` command before each build, so that new dependencies are loaded. It's possible to do this using pre and post build actions, but if the 'Find Implicit Dependencies' check box is selected, the build gets canceled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install CocoaPods by running `[sudo] gem install cocoapods`\r\n2. Unzip the attached project, then open the folder for the it in terminal and run `pod install`\r\n3. Open the attached project in Xcode, which is already using CocoaPods.\r\n4. Build the Bots target.\r\n5. Edit the Podfile, located in the Pods.xcodeproj and add `pod 'HockeySDK'`\r\n6. Try to build. It will be Canceled with No Issues.\r\n7. Edit the Bots scheme. Under the Build section, uncheck 'Find Implicit Dependencies'.\r\n8. Build again. This time it will succeed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIn a pre-build action the contents of a workspace should be able to change without the build being canceled, while Xcode is able to Find Implicit Dependencies.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe build is canceled if the contents of the workspace change and Find Implicit Dependencies is enabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo, but this hasn't been necessary before. Until there are pre/post build actions for Bots this is the only way to consistently make sure all of the dependencies have been loaded.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA enhancement to OS X Server has been filed under rdar://14221477 to add pre and post build steps to Bots."
