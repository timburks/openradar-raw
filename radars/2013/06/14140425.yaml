    description: "Summary: When you install iOS 7 to a iOS 6 device and try to restore the iCloud Backup. The backup process are having 2 main problems. The first problem is, that the backup wizard is asking me for the old AppStore Account that i have changed to another email adress. I can't login with my old account informations, neither i can't change the email from the account in the screen. I skipped the screen without my login credentials and the install continued. The next problem is happening. The apps are not willing to be downloaded to the device. The restore process is always running and is hurting the battery.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. install iOS 7 to a iOS 6 device\r\n2. restore a backup from the icloud\r\n3. skip the appstore login\r\n4. wait for the homescreen to show up\r\n5. nothing is happening\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA full restored device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA device that is not really restored\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDowngrade to iOS 6"
