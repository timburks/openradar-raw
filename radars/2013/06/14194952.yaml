    description: "18-Jun-2013 02:56 PM Jeffrey Wear:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nDepending on the SDK used by the iOS Simulator, the instruments command-line tool included with the Xcode 5 developer tools (build 5A11314m) prints a large number of what appear to be internal log messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the simulator and set its version to 7.0 (11A4372q).\r\n2. Make sure that no other SDKs are installed. It suffices to temporarily remove iPhoneSimulator[5.1, 6.1, etc].sdk from /Applications/Xcode5-DP.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/. Note that you must do this *after* the Simulator has been opened and its version set, otherwise the Simulator will crash.\r\n3. Execute `sh RunUIAutomationTests.sh` from the root directory of the attached project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\ninstruments should run the `LogIn.js` script using the Automation trace template (as directed by `RunUIAutomationTests.sh`, only logging messages beginning with \"Debug: \".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe tool prints, in order:\r\n* a number of lines of the format \"pid 2 = <pid>\"\r\n* \"Its me!!!\" (sic)\r\n* a number of lines of the format \"CLTilesManagerClient: ...\"\r\n* and then, before every \"Debug: \" message logged, a message \"_msgObj is __NSCFString\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes: following the steps to reproduce using the Xcode 4.6.2 (4H1003) developer tools (i.e instruments 4.5 (46000)) yields the expected results.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis issue is also reproducible, with slightly different messages, using the iphonesimulator5.1 and 6.1 SDKs, but it is not fully apparent when using the 6.1 SDK due to http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=3115412."
