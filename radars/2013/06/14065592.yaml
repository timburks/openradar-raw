    description: "Summary: Differentiating between two states using only blue or purple colors is unhelpful for colorblind users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a layout in Interface Builder where some constraints are non-user constraints (which cannot be removed) and some are user constraints.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I am able to visually determine which constraints fall into which conditions.\r\n\r\nActual Results: I cannot discern this visually, because the colors are too similar.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown\r\n\r\nNotes: Providing an alternative for colorblind users would be greatly appreciated. Whether itâ€™s choosing more distant colors or changing the shape of the icon, anything else would be better."
