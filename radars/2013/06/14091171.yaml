    description: A great feature to add to iOS would be the ability to leave a video "voicemail" if someone doesn't answer their phone/iPad when being called via FaceTime.  I know implementation would be hard since it's not guaranteed when a device will start "ringing" but maybe give the caller an option to leave a iMessage video while the device is waiting for an answer.
