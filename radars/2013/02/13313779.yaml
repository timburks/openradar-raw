    description: "The documentation for MKRoadWidthAtZoomScale states \"You should not use this function to retrieve road widths in iOS 6 and later.\". \n\nI'd like to request an alternative. My use case is overlaying a route on the map, in a public transport app. I'd like to know how wide to draw the route line at the current zoom level."
