    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a movie has been changed in iMovie, which has previously been uploaded to Vimeo, it's possible to 're-share it with Vimeo' (I think that's the menu option).  This creates a _new_ video upload, rather than using Vimeo's functionality for replacing a video.\r\n\r\nIf this change is not desirable, then at least the documentation should be changed to clarify which of the two possible behaviours ('replace' or 'create new upload') is going to happen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create movie in iMovie and upload it to Vimeo\r\n2. Change the movie (observe that the 'Vimeo' text in the project library panel has acquired a warning sign)\r\n3. Choose to 're-upload to Vimeo' (I can't remember if this is the precise text, but it's something like that)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe video is _replaced_ on Vimeo, as described at https://vimeo.com/help/faq/video#replace\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA new video upload is created, with no relation to the previous one, and so having been given a new URL, and lost any metadata, including likes and so on.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone known\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee the Vimeo FAQ at https://vimeo.com/help/faq/video#replace\r\n\r\nThe iMovie help text appears to be the same as, or derived from, the text at http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2279 -- search for the text “Re-Publish to Vimeo”.  This text does not make it clear which of the two options ('new upload' or 'replace video') is what will happen.  Whether or not the change in behaviour is implemented, this help text should make this clear.\r\n\r\n(is iMovie part of the 'iLife' Product -- apologies if I'm misclassified this)"
