    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter waking from sleep changing the system sound output device to a device of type AirPlay sometimes fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make Mac fall asleep\r\n2. Wake Mac\r\n3. Open System Preferences -> Sound -> Output\r\n4. Select an output device of type AirPlay\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSystem audio output should change to the selected AirPlay output device, indicated by a highlight in the table view in system preferences. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter selecting the AirPlay output device, it is immediately deselected and the previous active output device (usually the built-in) is selected again.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe times I encounter this issue is directly after waking from sleep. I found that the issue can be resolved by both a restart and a off/on of the Wifi. A restart always fixes this issue. Wifi off/on only resolves this in some of the cases.\r\n\r\nStreaming to AirPlay from iTunes still works when this issue occurs. It seems to be related to the global system audio to AirPlay only."
