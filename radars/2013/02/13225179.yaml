    description: "15-Feb-2013 12:52 PM Matt Henkes:\r\nSummary: Create an API to allow consumers of AirPrint to bypass the AirPrint popover by calling it with the required information. (printer, copies etc).\r\n\r\nWe have a use case where we ask the user for a printer before performing some task. After the task completes we'd like to print but the user is forced to go back through the air print popover. (It would also be nice to be able to remove or disable the ability to print copies)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Look at the airprint documentation for an api to send a document directly to print.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The api is found. Apple is amazing. Everyone celebrates.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Sadness"
