        To Reproduce:
        Check the following directory: ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.1/tmp
        If you have iPhone Simulator installed, and you do iPhone development daily, you will probably find that it contains hundreds of megabytes (~ 600 MB for me) of temporary files.
        These files are not correctly excluded from Time Machine by iPhone Simulator, and they change rapidly as you use the simulator in iPhone development. Because of this, my Mac has been backing up these hundreds of megabytes of changed files every hour for who-knows-how-long.
        Workaround: Exclude in Time Machine.
        Expected: Temporary files should be excluded, either through an explicit call, or by residing in an excluded location, like ~/Caches.
