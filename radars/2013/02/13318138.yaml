        Summary:
        When switching between two different mailboxes, the list of messages will be rendered with the attributes of the previous mailbox. For instance, if the first message in mailbox A was unread (or replied to, etc.) but in mailbox B the first message was read, when switching from A to B, B's first message will be marked as unread (or have whatever attributes of A's message list).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Setup mail such that there are multiple mailboxes to switch between (at least two).
        2) In one mailbox, change the attributes of the first message (mark it as read, reply to the message, whatever).
        3) In the other mailbox, ensure the first message has different attributes (unread, not replied to, etc.).
        4) Select the first mailbox from the left panel.
        5) Select the second mailbox from the left panel.
        6) Note the first message in the second mailbox has the same visual attributes as the first message in the first mailbox.

        Expected Results:
        When selecting the second mailbox, the correct attributes should be displayed.

        Actual Results:
        Upon selection of the second mailbox, the messages are displayed with improper status attributes.

        Regression:
        This did not happen until a recent update of the Mail.app.

        Notes:
        When this happens, you can select the message in the second mailbox and the status will be correctly displayed.
