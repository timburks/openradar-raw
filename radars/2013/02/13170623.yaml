    description: "Summary: After reordering cells in a sectioned UITableView, the reordered cells remain at the top of the view hierarchy, and when scrolling, the cells cover the section header.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Reorder cells near the top of a sectioned table. Scroll the table upwards.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Reordered cell should pass beneath the section header\r\n\r\nActual Results: Reordered cell covers the section header \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: I am currently working around this by sending the cell to the back of the table view's subviews, after a short delay (because there is an animation in place on the cell which seems to undo the effect if I move the cell in the view hierarchy immediately)."
