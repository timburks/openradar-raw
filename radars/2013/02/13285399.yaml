    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode and iOS have come a long way in the last few years. When it comes to testing network conditions for our applications, the tools are still in the stone age. There are some older, less helpful tools to restrict network conditions for your entire machine. (e.g. Speed Limit and Network LInk Conditioner) These tools are helpful for recreating zero or poor network conditions, but they apply to your entire machine, and not the iOS Simulator. When I'm testing, I can't afford to lose connection to my instant messenger or web browsing when trying to find answers to issues. It would be extremely helpful to move these tools inside the simulator or make it possible to control the internet access going to the Simulator for better testing without affecting your entire development machine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis can be observed on every version of Xcode and iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn integrated setting or tool that allows fine grained control over network conditions that only apply to the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis feature does not exist\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI know this tool would be helpful to me, and from the other developers I have talked to, they would appreciate this feature as well."
