    description: "18-Jul-2012 04:17 PM Stephan Diederich:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn one of the recent Xcode releases (4.3.3 has it), a new default include path was introduced, namely $(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/include. \r\n\r\nThis is quite handy, as when an application depends on static libraries, those libraries can install/copy their headers to that directory and the application just picks them up.\r\n\r\nThis does not work in Archive builds, as \"$(OBJROOT)/UninstalledProducts/include\" is missing in the default includes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an empty project.\r\n1) Build and see in build output that $(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/include is present in the includes.\r\n2) Archive and see in build output that $(OBJROOT)/UninstalledProducts/include is not present in the includes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAdding a static library project to an app should not only work out of the box during nomal builds, but also in archive builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nArchive fails.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nin 4.5-DP3 (4G125j) this is still an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n18-Sep-2012 09:46 AM Stephan Diederich:\r\nSame in Version 4.5 (4G182) ."
