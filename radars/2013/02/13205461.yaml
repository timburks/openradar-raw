    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Mountain Lion, there is a setting called \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" in the Mission Control preference pane. I expect this checkbox to apply to all applications, regardless of the means to activate/switch to this application. However, in 10.8.2, clicking the Finder icon on the Dock always switches to a space with open Finder windows even when this checkbox is unchecked. Switching to Finder via Command-Tab honors this setting, as does switching via AppleScript.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Mission Control prefpane, uncheck \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\"\r\n2. Open one or more Finder window in one space, e.g Desktop 1\r\n3. Switch to another space, e.g. Desktop 2\r\n4. Click Finder icon on the Dock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder becomes activated (its name and men is displayed to the right of Apple menu on top left corner) without leaving the other space (Desktop 2)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDock switches to the space with open Finder windows (Desktop 1), activates Finder, and bring one of its Finder to the frontmost\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem seems to always occur, as long as one clicks on the Finder icon on the dock.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe problem does not occur, if\r\na) one uses Command-Tab to switch to Finder, or\r\nb) one executes `osascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to activate'` in Terminal, or\r\nc) one executes the above AppleScript in AppleScript editor"
