    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a UTF-16 strings file, commonly created from older versions of Xcode, Xcode will auto-detect that it's UTF-16 in the UI but will fail to treat it as such during build.  CopyStrings will produce a warning saying it detected that it's UTF-16 and not UTF-8 like it was told. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a UTF-16 strings file to a project (iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 Localizable.strings > Localizable2.strings is oen way of getting one if using Xcode 4.6)\r\n2. Hit build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo warnings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWarning about strings file being UTF-16 instead of the specified UTF-8. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFile inspector on strings file indicates \"Default (UTF-16)\" so there's no indication why it's doing UTF-8. Manually changing to UTF-16 will make warning go away."
