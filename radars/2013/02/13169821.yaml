    description: "3rd party routing apps are officially supported for various types including:\r\n\r\n- Airplane\r\n- Bike\r\n- Car\r\n- Ferry\r\n- Pedestrian\r\n- Other\r\n\r\nMany users find it very unintuitive that these types of directions apps are listed in the Maps app when tapping the Bus icon. A more generic icon or a completely redesigned UI would be helpful."
