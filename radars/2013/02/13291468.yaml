    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nWhen handling iCloud items, an application is not allowed to load items through use of +applicationMusicPlayer and has to use +iPodMusicPlayer. However, when this happens, the iPodMusicPlayer eats all the remote events and applications have to do dirty things to figure out what the iPodMusicPlayer is doing :( \r\n\r\nMPMusicPlayerControllerNowPlayingItemDidReachEnd isn't reliable enough, as it doesn't specify how it was changed (whether the player was stopped, or skipped forward or backwards). Also, the iPodMusicPlayer doesn't have a currentCollection that I can reference from, only a nowPlayingItem.\r\n\r\nCurrently, my flagship application Reprise (http://www.appstore.com/reprise/ is incapable of handling iCloud items, which made a lot of users sad. Until I figure out how to get around this, I won't be able to ship a proper iCloud update.\r\n\r\nIf these events could be forwarded, added to MPMusicPlayerControllerPlaybackStateDidChangeNotification notifications, or even have some sort of MPMusicPlayerControllerNowPlayingItemDidReachEnd event, it would make several people's lives much easier!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCall -beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome sort of event passed to the iPodMusicPlayer object.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWatch as iPodMusicPlayer eats the event :(\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've currently got a tracklist setup, monitor MPMusicPlayerControllerNowPlayingItemDidChangeNotification, and then check the list to try and guess how it changed, however there's far too many variables for this to remain reliable (as a user could manually pick a song in the player, which could also be coming up in the queue, or something)."
