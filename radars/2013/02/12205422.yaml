    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI am using asynchronous NSURLConnection with a delegate to make HTTP requests in my iOS app. It requires to make lot of HTTP requests to server (in order of 10 requests per second  to same host)  as, it has 'search as you type' feature with each search making HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nSome of these requests fail with NSURLErrorCannotConnectToHost (-1004) error.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nMy app has a UITextField control and I make HTTP requests in textDidChange: delegate of it. Typing a long word will reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll the HTTP requests should be successful as there is connectivity and server is working properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMost of the requests succeed but some random requests fail with -1004 error.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nGetting only one type of error all the time (domain:NSURLErrorDomain code:-1004).\r\n\r\nTested in iPod touch (model MD057HN) with iOS 6.0(10A5376e) and iPhone4 (model MC605ZA) with iOS 5.1.1 (9B208). Error occurs only in iPod touch with iOS6 beta.\r\n\r\nIt happens only in iOS6 and not in iOS5.1 and below.\r\n\r\nIssue is reproducible in different WiFi networks. \r\n\r\nMost of the time the first request to server after app becomes active from inactive state will fail with error.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached  is packet trace when the issue occurred. In this trace at least four requests failed with -1004 error. \r\n\r\n\r\n16-Oct-2012 01:10 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback and requested some additional information in order to further investigate this issue: \r\n\r\nIn this context, NSURLErrorCannotConnectToHost might mean the server is closing your connections because you have too many connections open. Are you canceling outstanding connections you don't want any more in your search-as-you-type implementation?\r\n\r\nReply: \r\nYes. I am canceling outstanding connections which I don't want.\r\n\r\nThe behaviors are different when I cancel and don't cancel.  \r\n\r\nIf I don't cancel outstanding connections, I don't get 'NSURLErrorCannotConnectToHost' errors but, the response to the request is received after long time. \r\n\r\nWhen I used 'asynchronous NSStream with delegate on main runloop' to carry out HTTP requests I no longer get that error. I think with NSURLConnection the problem still exits."
