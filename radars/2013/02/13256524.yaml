    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA duplicate field name at the same level in a JSON block can cause NSJSONSerialization to crash. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample project. \r\n2. The file test.json contains the JSON that will cause the crash.\r\n3. The crash is caused multiple occurrences of the field \"points\" at the same level in the JSON.\r\n4. Remove the extra \"points\" fields and NSJSONSerialization no longer crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpect NSJSONSerialization to either 1) report the format error, or 2) ignore the duplicate field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNSJSONSerialization crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHaving duplicate fields at the same level does not always cause the crash. However, test.json in the sample project does always crash. So the crash is related to the sequence of events that occur when parsing this particular JSON data.\r\n\r\nSample project and crash report  uploaded."
