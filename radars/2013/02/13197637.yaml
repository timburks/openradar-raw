    description: "I'm sure you've got this request many times, but I'm adding my voice to it. Here’s how I could see it working:\n\nDevelopers can choose whether to allow a trial of 1, 7 or 30 days, or to disallow trials all together, on a per-app basis. For those apps that allow trials, the App Store would show a “Try for 7 days” button alongside “Buy app”. \n\nIf you install the trial app, it gets flagged with a “Trial” flag over the icon, in a similar way to the “New” flag that was introduced in iOS 6.\n\nWhen you run the app, it permanently runs with a double height status bar, which shows the amount of time left. Tapping this status bar opens the app store page allowing you to purchase the app.\n\nOnce a trial is used up, you can’t get a trial of that app again on the same Apple ID. When the trial is used up, the app icon still remains on your device, but the flag says “Expired” and tapping on it takes you to the App Store rather than opening the app."
