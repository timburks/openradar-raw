    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niTunes play counts are stuck at 0 for some tracks no matter how many times they're played.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a track to your iTunes library\r\n2. Play the track all the way through\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"plays\" metadata value would now be 1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"plays\" metadata value is still 0. Repeated plays do not change it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is *relatively* new but I could not say when it first appeared. I have plenty of tracks with nonzero play counts, so I know it *used to* work.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI seem to have several hundred tracks like this. I have a \"never heard\" smart playlist which is defined as containing tracks where \"plays\" is 0 that currently has 745 tracks. After playing from that playlist all day long (roughly 100 tracks played so far), the number of tracks on the list has decreased by only 6.\r\n\r\nIn case it's important: I do use iTunes match, and this is on Mac OS X 10.8.2.\r\n\r\nA sample screenshot of the iTunes \"info\" window for an affected track is attached. This screenshot was taken immediately after the track had finished playing."
