    description: "Summary: The documentation for -[UIDocumentInteractionControllerDelegate documentIntersectionControllerViewControllerForPreview:] says \"If you return a navigation controller from this method, the document interaction controller is pushed onto the navigation stack using the standard navigation controller animations. If you return any other type of view controller, the document interaction controller is displayed modally, in which case, the view controller you return must be capable of presenting a modal view controller.\"\r\n\r\nThis does appear to be the case for an app when run on iPhone or iPod Touch, but when run on iPad, the preview is always shown modally even if a navigation controller is provided.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug in the UIDocumentationInteractionController implementation on iPad.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSample Xcode project is attached (also available at https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/DocumentPreviewTest). Code is identical for iPhone and iPad. When the app is run on iPhone, the document preview controller is pushed onto the navigation stack as described in the documentation. When run on iPad, the document preview is displayed modally.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPreview should be pushed onto navigation stack.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPreview is displayed modally.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis bug is further described/discussed in these online forum threads:\r\n\r\n- https://devforums.apple.com/thread/181223\r\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13057919/probable-bug-on-ipad-for-uidocumentinteractioncontroller-presentpreviewanimated"
