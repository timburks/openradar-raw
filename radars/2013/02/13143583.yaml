    description: "Summary:\r\nTyping some malformed URI sequence which the data detector mechanism fails to handle gracefully causes almost any application to hang or quit unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Activate TextEdit and ⌘N, or activate Mail and ⌘N, or activate Stickies and ⌘N, or open just about any application that allows you to type things, even the search box in Preview, Finder, iTunes, Aperture\r\n2. Type exactly \"File:///\" followed by enter. The letter F needs to be capital and there should be three slashes following the colon.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication processes this string normally, either doing nothing or perform a search, depending on where this string is typed.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication hangs or quits unexpectedly, creating several entries in system log, for example:\r\nassertion on /SourceCache/DataDetectorsCore/DataDetectorsCore-269.1/Sources/PushDown/DDResultExtraction.c:1576 \"CFStringHasPrefix(urlVal, CFSTR(\"file://\"))\" failed :wrong extraction: File:///\r\nwrong extraction: File:///\r\nAn uncaught exception was raised\r\ncondition \"wrong extraction: File:///\"\r\n[ call stack ]\r\n\r\nSometimes this also leads to data loss/inconsistency, for example Aperture detected library inconsistency on second launch.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn certain circumstances some applications do not exhibit this behaviour, including Pages, Keynote, Numbers. (This only applies to typing the string into the main area. Press ⌘F then type the string into the \"Find\" textbox will also result in a crash.)\r\nOther applications that provide its own mechanism for text input are also unaffected, such as Terminal, Mathematica, Emacs, MacVim, Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDue to this bug, filing a bug report is extremely difficult. For example, Safari would hang when I type the string into this textbox. Even merely opening the crash log in Console causes Console to crash.\r\n\r\nIn crash logs for some applications, DDCrashv is not mentioned but -[NSTextCheckingOperation dealloc] is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe data detectors are ostensibly activated by spell checking, therefore disabling data detectors does not seem to work."
