        In the UK, on every map you can get, motorways are blue.

        I notice that recently you changed Maps to draw the labels for the motorways with a blue background. That's a good start, but the roads themselves really must be drawn in blue. We're so used to them being blue on every pictographic representation, that it's really jarring and incongruous to not have them drawn as such.

        Ideally you should also draw A roads in green. But just the motorways would be a good start.
