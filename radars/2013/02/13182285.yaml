    description: "08-Feb-2013 02:52 PM Chris Adamson:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen sending an DTS incident followup from iPad, the DTS Auto-Ack creates a new followup number\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a DTS incident.\r\n2. After receiving the first auto-ack, reply from an iPad, copying the \"Follow-Up\" line to the top of the e-mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA second auto-ack should be received, with the same followup number.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe auto-ack e-mail has a different follow-up number, and is apparently not associated with the rest of the incident's e-mail trail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've only noticed this when replying from iPad; followups work fine from the Mac.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI believe the problem comes from automatic insertion of <tel:> tags in the outbound mail, as if the followup number is being mistaken for a telephone number by the data detectors.  Notice the \"Follow-up\" line in my original quoted e-mail:\r\n\r\nFollow-up:  <tel:255382891>255382891\r\n\r\nThere are also <tel> links to bug numbers in the body of the quoted mail, though these shouldn't affect the Follow-up parsing.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching the DTS auto-ack, the one with the wrong number, as \"erroneous-dts-auto-ack.eml\"\r\n\r\n08-Feb-2013 02:52 PM Chris Adamson:\r\n'erroneous-dts-auto-ack.eml' was successfully uploaded"
