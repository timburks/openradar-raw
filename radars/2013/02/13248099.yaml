        In a Cocoa app, when you copy an image with alpha transparency (perhaps from an image well), then paste it into Photoshop, the alpha channel does not survive. The same is true if you go the other way, from Photoshop to a Cocoa app.

        While I suspect this may be Adobe's fault, since Photoshop is so prevalent I think AppKit should learn how to deal with whatever format Photoshop is putting on the clipboard, in order to make copy/paste with alpha between Cocoa and Photoshop a possibility.
