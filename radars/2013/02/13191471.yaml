Using the @dynamic CoreData auto-generated accessors causes a SIGABRT when running on device.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that this has been known about since iOS 5.1 - and it would have been really helpful if this was listed in the known issues, as the workaround of implementing your own methods does appear to work (we have no idea how inefficient it is, but appears to work for our use cases.\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2013 02:18 PM Scott Corscadden:\r\nMight (I'm guessing? Wish I could see other originated issues) be a duplicate of 10114310"
