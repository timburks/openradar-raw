    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nA exception occurs in the internal methods of NSFetchedResultsController when processing a set of changes where a managed object is deleted from a MOC.\r\n\r\nDuring _postprocessDeletedObjects:, -[_NSDefaultSectionInfo indexOfObject:] is called ; the first argument is a managed object that has been deleted. This triggers an exception:\r\n\r\n    CoreData: error: Serious application error.  Exception was caught during Core Data change processing.  This is usually a bug within an observer of NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification.\r\n    *** -[NSArray indexOfObject:inRange:]: range {0, 2} extends beyond bounds [0 .. 0] with userInfo (null)\r\n\r\nThe NSFetchedResultsController has no explicit sections (sectionNameKeyPath = nil). There where two fetched objects before the deletion, and one after."
