        Summary:
        As far as I understand it is a common case nowadays that people have a lot of apps on their devices
        Amount of apps that use local / remote notifications is quite big as far as I understand
        Although adjusting notifications settings is not an often task that one might want to perform,
        still when I need to tweak notification settings it takes me awhile to find particular app
        A simple search text field on the top of the screen would really help

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Launch Settings.app
        Navigate to Notifications section
        Find a particular app

        Expected Results:
        There must be a simpler way to find a particular app.

        Actual Results:
        It's quite hard to find a particular app.
