    description: "Summary:\n\niTunes used to offer to save my iTunes password, but as of iTunes 11.0.2 it does not anymore and requires me to enter it quite a bit during use. \n\nSometimes it even asks me twice, like asking it to check for Available Downloads via the Store menu.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nDo anything that would normally ask for your password. This case I'll lay out the steps for the worst offender as mentioned above. \n\n1. Goto iTunes's Store Menu\n2. Select \"Check for Available Downloadsâ€¦\"\n\nExpected Results:\n\nIt asks me for my password along with an option checkbox to \"Save this password\" \n\nActual Results:\n\niTunes actually prompts me TWICE for my password, and neither box has the option to save the password.\n\nRegression:\n\nUsed to work fine in iTunes 10 and earlier versions of iTunes 11 if my memory serves. It's only been an issue recently. \n\nNotes:\n\nPlease fix this. :)"
