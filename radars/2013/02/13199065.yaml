    description: "Apps that rely on iCloud Documents & Data for syncing data across devices can benefit from waking up to perform various syncing operations whenever changes to files in its iCloud container are detected.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a todo app using iCloud for syncing can schedule local notifications as reminders for its todo items. When new todo items are added on one device, the app should be woken up on all other devices to schedule local notifications for the newly added items. Similarly, when modifying and deleting items on one device, the app should wake up on all other devices to modify or remove the scheduled local notifications accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis could work like Region Monitoring, where apps can register ubiquitous URLs to be monitored by the iOS iCloud daemon. When changes occur, the app can either be launched in the background (if not running) or woken up (if suspended) to handle these events.\r\n\r\nProposed additions to UIApplication \r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- (void)startMonitoringUbiquitousItemAtURL:(NSURL *)url;\r\n- (void)stopMonitoringUbiquitousItemAtURL:(NSURL *)url;\r\n\r\n@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *monitoredUbiquitousItems;\r\n\r\nProposed additions to UIApplicationDelegate\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didDetectChangesToUbiquitousItem:(NSURL *)ubiquitousItem"
