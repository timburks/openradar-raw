    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes should be able to synchronize the podcasts play time and status with the iOS Podcasts App.\r\nIt also should be also possible to launch downloading of a podcast when one of the devices does that.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- When downloading a podcast from the Podcasts App on iOS, the download should be also launched on iTunes.\r\n- When iTunes noticed a new podcast to download, then that should be also triggered to the Podcast Apps on the iOS devices\r\n- When playing a podcast using the Podcasts App on an iOS device, this should update the current playing position on iTunes.\r\n- If a podcast has been completely played, this should also update its status in iTunes so that, even if not able to connect the iOS device to iTunes, iTunes podcasts list can stay up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis behavior only works between two iOS Podcasts App"
