    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting the accessibilityIdentifier will also set the accessibilityLabel on UIImageViews provided the accessibilityLabel has not been previously set, has a value of nil or @\"\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a UIImageView.\r\n2) Give it an accessibilityIdentifier.\r\n3) Log both its accessibilityIdentifier and accessibilityLabel.  Verify they are the same, although they should not be.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSetting the accessibilityIdentifier should not have an affect on the accessibilityLabel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSetting the accessibilityIdentifier is also setting the accessibilityLabel to the same value (assuming the label has either not been set, has a value of nil or @\"\". \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nVerify that setting the accessibilityIdentifier does not set the accessibilityLabel."
