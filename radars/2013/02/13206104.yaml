        I'd like to request a very specific kind of Xcode plugin.

        When you've built an archive, you hit Distribute in the organizer, you have a few options (like save to disk, submit to Apple, etc). I suggest you make a plugin interface that lets plugin makers add new options there.

        My use case would be: for iOS apps, I'd like a plugin to submit the app to TestFlight using their API. For Mac apps, a plugin could enable me to perform the Sparkle code-signing and update the app cast feed. This distribution step shouldn't be part of the build process, so I can't use a shell script build phase — it's a specific action taken on an archived app.

        When such a plugin is installed, it'll appear as a new option in the Distribute… dialog box.

        It'd be nice if plugins could provide some UI as another step in the same dialog box, in case there are configurable options.
