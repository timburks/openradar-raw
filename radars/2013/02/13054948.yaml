    description: "21-Jan-2013 02:22 PM Nicholas Arnott:\r\nSummary:\r\niOS provides ways for developers to prompt users for access to sensitive things like their Address Book and location. However, there is no mechanism to ask the user's permission to access their microphone. More apps are starting to use audio syncing that requires access to the microphone. There are a number of security implications that could go along with accessing the user's microphone and transmitting audio without their permission. Apple should get ahead of this, and provide a mechanism similar to Address Book and location permissions for accessing the user's microphone to capture audio.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch an app that records audio and start recording audio.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser is presented with an alert asking to grant the app permission to access the microphone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApplication begins recording audio.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 12330496"
