    description: "14-Feb-2013 08:32 AM Bob Kressin:\r\nSummary:  Bluetooth 4.0 supports Human Interface Devices (HID) over their GATT Profile.  Apple's entire product line now supports Bluetooth 4.0, which presents an exciting set of opportunities for accessory manufacturers.  This is a request that future releases of iOS support the HID Over GATT Profile natively, allowing accessory manufacturers to build BLE keyboards, music controllers, and other novel devices.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:  Thank you for considering this critical Bluetooth Low Energy capability for iOS!"
