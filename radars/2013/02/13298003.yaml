    description: "Summary:\r\nQuickLook is a wonderful API, but the preview is just a preview, and doesn't always offer what I need. I'd like an API that takes an input PPT or .key file, an output path (where to save the slide images), and a completion block or delegate. It could render out an image for each slide (in a bg thread), and let me know when it's done. Other helpful methods, for slide count, slide size, etc would be great, too.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
