    description: "Summary: Menubar items remain highlighted after apps exit fullscreen by themselves. \r\nIt happens with applications that handle their own fullscreen, not the one provided by OSX starting with Lion\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and install VLC.\r\n2. Start playing a video file and go to fullscreen.\r\n3. While video is playing in fullscreen, select any item from the menubar and leave it opened until the video stops playing. Eg: File\r\n4. After the video has started playing, fullscreen will close. Click the selected menubar item again to close it.\r\n5. Select another menubar item and close that as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. No highlighting should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The opened/closed menubar items will be highlighted as in the screenshot.\r\n2. Clicking away from the application and back will clear the highlighting in the menubar\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. Happens only on Lion and Mountain Lion.\r\n2. Could find this issue in Skype as well.\r\nTo reproduce in Skype:\r\n* When being in a fullscreen video call, select the menubar items and have the remote party hang up the call.\r\nThe video will exit fullscreen and the menubar items will remain highlighted."
