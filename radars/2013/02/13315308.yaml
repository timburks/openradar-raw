    description: "Summary: When using UIPageViewController with UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll, after the page changes from the initial page, popping up the keyboard (due to the user tapping a UITextArea, for example) will cause the current page view to be dismissed without any delegate or data source methods being called; this also causes the keyboard to be dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCode that reproduces the problem is attached. To reproduce: run the app (simulator or device).  Turn to another page, then tap the text area.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to create a reproducible test case from scratch: create a UIPageViewController with UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll.  Have at least one page with a UITextArea or similar view that will cause the keyboard to come up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe keyboard comes up and the user is able to alter the text in the text area.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe keyboard pops up, then the current page goes away, another page (exactly which one seems nondeterministic) is shown, and the keyboard pops back down.  The UIPageViewControllerDelegate does not get notified of the page change; the UIPageViewControllerDataSource does not get a request for a view controller.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\niOS 6-only because UIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScroll is an iOS6 feature.\r\nThe bug is specifically related to the keyboard coming up; it does not reproduce if a Bluetooth keyboard is connected to the device.\r\nI have only tested this on iPad, but strongly suspect it would also occur on iPhone."
