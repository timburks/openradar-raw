    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApples Podcast App, aside from hideous looking, doesn't display all of my podcasts files on my iPhone. It seems to do only podcasts with subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. I find some potentially interesting Podcast on the web and download manualley 1 (one) audio file.\r\n2. I add this audio file to iTunes on the Mac.\r\n3. iTunes automatically adds the podcast file to the music section of the iTunes Library. Ok, I try to find the added file and change it's media kind to \"Podcast\".\r\n4. The podcast file is now in the Podcast section of the iTunes library. \r\n5. I sync with my iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI hope to be able to listen to the podcast file on my phone, since I expect that, after sync, the podcasts on iTunes Mac are the same as on the iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPodcast.app doesn't display the new added podcast file. Other Podcasts, which are subscribed via iTunes Store are displayed. \r\nIn iTunes (Mac) -> Devices -> My iPhone -> Podcast on the other hand my podcast file is displayed as synched and stored on the phone.\r\n\r\nMy mental model and the model of Podcasts.app clash. I think, I should be right."
