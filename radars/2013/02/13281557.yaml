        Summary:

        The Screen Sharing app has a checkbox that offers to "Remember this password in my keychain". It does seem to store the password, but when you reconnect to the remote server it forces the user to re-enter that password. I honestly don't know if that was the intention, but it seems reasonable to expect that if Screen Sharing has your password in the keychain it would use it.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1.  Connect to a remote server "as a registered user", selecting the "Remember this password in my keychain" checkbox.
        2.  Disconnect.
        3.  Try to connect to that server again.

        Expected Results:

        I would expect Screen Sharing to know my password.

        Actual Results:

        I need to re-enter that password.

        Regression:

        I am not sure this has ever worked as I would expect.

        Notes:

        Not only is this a nuisance, but it discourages good passwords.  I keep my passwords in 1Password, so I need to fetch the password from 1Password every single time I connect to a server using Screen Sharing.
