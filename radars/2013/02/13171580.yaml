    description: "Summary:\r\nA bug where the iPhone will present a black screen with just the battery life and and network provider. This bug occurs when the user is using the camera by swiping upwards on the lock screen and then receiving a phone call whilst on the camera viewfinder.\r\n\r\nAfter the phone call ends the phone returns to a black screen as opposed to the camera. Sleeping/Waking the phone has no effect as well as pressing the home button. \r\n\r\nThe only way I could escape this screen was to use siri to open the maps app and then press the home button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Press iPhone Sleep/Wake button\r\n2. Slide up lock screen on Camera Icon to activate Camera\r\n3. Have somebody call the iPhone\r\n4. Answer the call\r\n5. Hang up the phone call\r\n6. See black screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReturn to camera view on home screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBlack screen is displayed that is very difficult to get out of\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem always occurs on iOS 6.1 on iPhone 5. Unable to test on other iOS Devices currently.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUse siri to open an app such as maps to escape the black screen"
