    description: "Summary: Previously iTunes was pretty good about remembering how I had set up a particular view. I could search my music, for example, then go to the store, come back, and my search would still be there. Since iTunes 11 views are constantly resetting and it rarely remembers where I was.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Go to the Music > Songs view.\r\n2. Search for something in the search bar, and press return.\r\n3. Click the iTunes Store button.\r\n4. Click the Library button.\r\nExpected Results: My search should still be in the search bar, and the songs should still be filtered.\r\nActual Results: The search is gone, and the view is scrolled all the way up to the first song in the library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Go to the Music.\r\n2. Search for an album in the search bar.\r\n3. Click on the album in the popover.\r\n4. Click on Playlists.\r\n5. Click on Albums.\r\nExpected Results: It should take me back to the album.\r\nActual Results: It just takes me to the albums view, scrolled all the way back to the top.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Go to the Music.\r\n2. Search for an album in the search bar.\r\n3. Click on the album in the popover.\r\n4. Click the iTunes Store button.\r\n5. Click the Library button.\r\nExpected Results: It should take me back to the album.\r\nActual Results: It just takes me to the albums view, scrolled all the way back to the top.\r\n\r\nRegression: These problems started in 11.0. There were some similar issues in the past, but just prior to 11 iTunes had gotten very good at remembering where I was.\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
