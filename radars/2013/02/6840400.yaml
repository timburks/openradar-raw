    description: "29-Apr-2009 03:55 PM ben syverson:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the Save dialog's File View is active / in-focus / first responder, and when a folder is selected in the view, the return key should NOT save the document. It should open that folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Invoke a standard Save dialog\r\n2. Click on Applications in the sidebar.\r\n3. Press tab.\r\n4. Press the down arrow until the Utilities folder is selected.\r\n5. Press return.\r\n6. Your document will be saved in /Applications/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nReturn in this context should open the Utilities folder (as if Command-O were pressed).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe document is saved in the active folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHas been a problem since 10.0. Mac OS 1.0 - 9.2.2 did not have this bug.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is yet another of those little things that makes working with the Open / Save dialogs a nightmare from the keyboard. \r\n\r\nIF the File View has focus, and IF a folder is selected in that view within the active folder, THEN pressing the Return key should open the folder (as if Command-O were pressed). Pressing the Return key in any other context in the Save dialog, it should save the document, as it currently does.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, pressing Enter (not Return) should ALWAYS save the document in the currently active folder, even if the File View has focus and a folder is selected. Enter and Save should be semantically different, as they were in Mac OS \"Classic.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why this was left out when we moved to 10.0, but its omission is a bug.\r\n\r\n07-May-2009 01:37 AM ben syverson:\r\nJust wanted to amend to fix a typo. In the sentence \"Enter and Save should be semantically different...\" I meant to write \"Enter and Return should be semantically different...\"\r\n\r\nThis convention is used elsewhere. For example, in dialog boxes with text fields and \"default\" buttons, this is often the case. Return might add a carriage return to the text, whereas Enter would dismiss the dialog.\r\n\r\n11-Sep-2009 06:50 PM ben syverson:\r\nI installed 10.6, and it seems the cure is worse than the disease. The new behavior is unbelievably, hair-raisingly bad. It merits a new Radar #, but I'll put the details here instead, since I'm sure it's directly related to this bug.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOnce a folder is selected in the Save dialog box, it is impossible to save a document in the current folder without re-navigating to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open TextEdit\r\n2. Select \"Save\"\r\n3. Click on your Home folder under PLACES in the sidebar\r\n4. Click once on the \"Documents\" folder is the file view.\r\n5. Enter a name and click the \"Save\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny reasonable person would expect the result of clicking the \"Save\" button would be that the file \"Untitled.rtf\" would be saved in your Home folder. I would also expect that pressing the \"Enter\" key would do the same thing (save the file in the Hame folder), and that pressing the \"Return\" key would open the selected folder (\"Documents\").\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, clicking \"Save,\" pressing Enter, and pressing Return ALL open the \"Documents\" folder. If you want to save your file in the currently displayed folder (\"Home\"), you have to jump through hoops! You either have to get navigate away from the current folder and come back to it, or hold down Command and de-select the selected folder (something which average users will never in a million years figure out).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYES, the return key should open a folder in the Save dialog, which is why I filed this bug in the first place.  But clicking \"Save\" should NEVER open a folder. It should do what it says: Save the document in the CURRENTLY active folder (the one displayed in the hierarchy pulldown). And the Enter key should certainly be equivalent to clicking \"Save.\" It should also save the document in the currently active folder.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repeating myself, say I'm saving a document, and I double click on \"Documents,\" and then, for example, press Command-Up-arrow to go back to my Home folder (where \"Documents\" will still be selected). Clicking on the button titled \"Save\" will refuse to save the document!!! Which is the entire purpose of the \"Save\" dialog! This is hugely bad!\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2011 04:34 PM ben Syverson:\r\nAlmost two years later, and this egregious bug is still there, in 10.7.\r\n\r\nPressing a button named \"Save\" does not save. This is very un-Apple. If the button says \"Save,\" it should Save. It should not open anything. If it's going to open something, its name should change to Open.\r\n\r\n26-Feb-2013 10:56 AM Ben Syverson:\r\nThis bug report is approaching its fourth birthday. Apple is presenting users with a button that reads \"Save\", yet it does not save. It opens a folder that the user may not even see! They could have scrolled past a folder they selected accidentally, and now when they press Save, it does not Save.\r\n\r\nI've seen beginning Mac users encounter this bug and not know what to do. Are you really expecting a brand new Mac user to know how to Command-click a folder to deselect it?"
