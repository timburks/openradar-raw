    description: "08-Feb-2013 03:11 PM BJ Homer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nJust a red button.\r\nIn rounded rect styling.\r\nIt cannot be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary, in non-Haiku form:\r\n\r\nThere's no way to set the color of a UIButton in rounded rect style. I wanted a red one. But I can't just set a color on it like I had hoped; I have to build my own image. This made me sad.\r\n\r\nThen I wrote a terrible haiku."
