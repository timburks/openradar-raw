    description: "18-Sep-2011 07:41 AM Fraser Hess:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe App Stores (both Mac and iOS) need a developer feature to allow rolling back to a previously approved version of an application.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFeature doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iTunes Connect interface should allow a developer to pick the last known good version for App Store deployment. The developer should be queried as to whether or not the customer can safely roll back to the last known good version.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iTunes Connect interface only supports 2 version of an app. The current approved version and a version either in review or awaiting developer release.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nShould a developer introduce bugs in a version, this would allow a developer to switch back to a version without the bugs and keep their app in the store while working on and awaiting approval on the fixed version."
