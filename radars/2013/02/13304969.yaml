    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI unlocked an old iPhone today, and after being presented with the \"Congrats\" screen it says: \"To set up and sync this iPhone, click Continue\". \r\n\r\nI would LOVE to do that, but alas you are not presenting me a Continue button anywhere on the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Get carrier to unlock your iPhone \r\n2. Restore it or Place a 3rd Party SIM in it\r\n3. Plug it into your computer via USB cable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niTunes will inform you it's unlocked and allow me to sync the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niTunes informed me it's unlocked but has no Continue button to setup my sync.\r\n\r\nYou can see the image here: http://cl.ly/image/1M1z3A2W2t3g\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen the last time I unlocked a device on iTunes 10\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this because I only have one iPhone to unlock right now."
