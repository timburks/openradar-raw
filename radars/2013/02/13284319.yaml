    description: "25-Feb-2013 02:44 PM Nico Weber:\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached project. It is a custom view covering the whole NSWindow, and autoresizing to match the window's size. The view has a \r\n\r\n          [[NSTrackingArea alloc] initWithRect:frame\r\n                                       options:NSTrackingMouseMoved |\r\n                                               NSTrackingMouseEnteredAndExited |\r\n                                               NSTrackingActiveInActiveApp |\r\n                                               NSTrackingInVisibleRect\r\n                                     owner:self\r\n                                  userInfo:nil];\r\n\r\nand NSLog()s on mouseMoved:\r\n\r\nNow put the mouse cursor on the inside of the window in the lower left corner, so that a resize cursor appears. Size the window bigger by dragging your mouse the the left and down, slowly. Stop after a few pixels. Move the cursor to the middle of the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nmouseMoved: messages continue to be sent to the view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nmouseMoved messages stop being sent after resizing the window from its lower left corner.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis broke when all-window-corner resizing was introduced in 10.7 as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis breaks mouseMoved events in chrome.\r\n\r\n25-Feb-2013 02:44 PM Nico Weber:\r\nAn error occurred during file upload.Please try uploading the file(s) again.If the problem persists, please email your file(s) and Bug ID # to <devbugs@apple.com> and we will append the bug report with the file(s) provided.\r\n\r\n25-Feb-2013 02:45 PM Nico Weber:\r\n'trackingarea.zip' was successfully uploaded"
