    description: "Summary:\r\nCreating a new iOS app from the single-view Xcode template makes a UIViewController subclass, XXViewController, where XX is the class prefix. This is usually not a good name for the root view controller, so it's likely the Refactor function would be used to change that class name.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the App delegate, the VC's initWithNibName:: is called by specifying an NSString for the nib file name. This NSString literal is not refactored, so the app crashes on startup when it can't find the old-named nib for that VC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new Single View iOS App.\r\nFrom the \"Refactor\" menu, change the name of the root view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA buildable app that does not have any regressions due to the class name change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes on startup. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease simply change the \"NibName\" argument to nil, then the refactored code will work because the default behavior is to look for a xib that matches the class name."
