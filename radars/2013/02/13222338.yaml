    description: "Exceptions thrown in gcd-queued main queue blocks do not result in the 'except' of a try-except handler to be called.\r\n\r\n When wrapping a runloop spin in a try except block, one might expect any exceptions thrown in any code called as a result of the spin to be caught be a try except handler around the spin. This is not the case for blocks added to the run loop using dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), block)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the program crashes and \"Caught\" is not printed in the below.\r\n\r\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\r\n        [[NSException exceptionWithName:@\"ExceptionException\" reason:@\"Exception\" userInfo:nil] raise];\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    @try {\r\n        \r\n        [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate distantFuture]];\r\n    } @catch (NSException *e) {\r\n        NSLog(@\"Caught\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached project\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo crash. \"Caught\" is printed to the console. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nExceptions thrown as a result of code in a queued performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:  are caught gracefully. A commented line is provided to demonstrate this.\r\n\r\n14-Feb-2013 09:29 PM Nate Griswold:\r\n'ExceptionNotCaught.zip' was successfully uploaded"
