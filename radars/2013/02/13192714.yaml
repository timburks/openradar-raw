    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn a very simple iCloud/Core Data application, it is possible to create an entity on the Mac and have it sync to an iPhone. Deleting the entity on the iPhone however does not propagate the deletion back to the Mac.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple Core Data application using a single entity. Deploy to both Mac and iOS device and allow persistent store to be created and synchronized on both devices.\r\n\r\n2. Create an entity on Mac. Wait for entity to sync to iPhone.\r\n\r\n3. Delete entity on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Entity is deleted from iPhone.\r\n2. iCloud update is received on the Mac.\r\n3. Entity is deleted from the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Entity is deleted from iPhone.\r\n2. iCloud update is received on the Mac, but does not contain any entity deletion information.\r\n3. Entity is NOT deleted from the Mac.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFull sample application (based on a simplified version of SharedCoreData from WWDC 2012) along with a screencast demonstrating the problem was attached to original radar submitted to Apple."
