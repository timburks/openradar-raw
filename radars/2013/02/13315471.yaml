    description: "Summary: If you select a file in Finder, Get Info, look at \"More info\", close the Get Info window, then open it again, the \"More info\" section will now be blank.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a file in Finder. I notice this the most often with images (png, psd, gif, jpg), but on further testing I believe it happens with any file type that has a \"More info\" section.\r\n2. Choose Get Info (command-I)\r\n3. Notice the details in the \"More info\" section.\r\n4. Close the Get Info window.\r\n5. Choose Get Info (command-I) again\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The \"More info\" section should include the same details, assuming the file hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The \"More info\" section is blank, with only the text \"--\". Trying additional times does not bring the info back.\r\n\r\nRegression: Not sure. I believe this has been an issue for a long time, I'm just finally getting around to figuring out how to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nNotes: As a designer this comes up frequently because I often need to check the size of an image. And then I need to double-check it. At that point I'm forced to open the file in Photoshop or drop it in a browser or something just to figure out the dimensions."
