        If you try to build your iOS app, but you have unplugged your phone, you're likely to get an error message titled "Xcode cannot run using the selected device.", with detail text "No provisioned iOS devices are available with a compatible iOS version. Connect an iOS device with a recent enough version of iOS to run your application or choose an iOS simulator as the destination.".

        There is a single OK button for this message.

        When it appears, I instinctively hit the Escape key to dismiss it. Since it's an error, and results in cancelling the whole operation, my brain tries to get me to hit the keyboard shortcut that cancels stuff.

        Please make this dialog obey the Escape key!
