        Summary:
        Dragging a file into a sandbox app or opening the file through powerbox doesn't give access to the actual file.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Drag an alias into a sandboxed app that accepts dragging and then try to open the file the alias refers too.

        Expected Results:
        Access to the real file

        Actual Results:
        Sandbox error

        Regression:
        Sandboxing

        Notes:
        A user dragging an alias file into an app should count as user intent to give access to the real file.
