    description: "Similar to UIScrollView, I'd like to propose the following readonly properties to MKMapView:\r\n\r\n@property(nonatomic, readonly, getter=isDragging) BOOL dragging\r\n@property(nonatomic, readonly, getter=isZooming) BOOL zooming\r\n\r\nThis would be handy in various circumstances for programmatic region handling. For instance to block new region changes until the map stands still.  Another use case would be to implement a custom tap gesture recognizer that doesn't interfere with tap-to-stop-panning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30-Apr-2013 11:19 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information: \r\n\r\nYou can already achieve this by using the region change delegate callbacks:\r\n\r\n- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView regionWillChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated;\r\n- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated;\r\n\r\nSet a flag in the app between those callbacks and avoid setting a region or allowing gestures when the flag is set.\r\n\r\n\r\n02-May-2013 11:23 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nThat's what we're currently doing. We can't differentiate scrolling and zooming, though. And I believe I saw cases where the number of regionWillChange calls was not identical to the number of regionDidChange calls. I'll be at the WWDC MapKit lab and will be happy to discuss in detail."
