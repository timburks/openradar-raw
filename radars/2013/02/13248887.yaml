    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you choose \"Use Base Localization\", it only finds files to localize if you have just chosen the files in Xcode, and then when adding a language, it only creates \".strings\" files if you have just chosen the files in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Mountain Lion, Create a new project in Xcode.  Cocoa Application, Create Document-Based Application\r\n2. Verify that the project file is selected in the file navigator. DO NOT SELECT THE XIB FILES YET.\r\n3. In the main editor, the target icon should be initially selected.  Select the \"Project\" icon.\r\n4. Click \"Use Base Internationalization\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the \"Choose files and reference language to create Base Localization\" sheet, I should see the Document and MainMenu \".xib\" files listed there.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sheet contains no files!\r\n\r\n---- BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. ------\r\n\r\n5. Dismiss the sheet.\r\n6. In the file sheet, click on the icons for the document and the MainMenu xib, so that each nib is showing in the main editor.\r\n7. Now go back to the project icon in the file navigator.\r\n8. Once again, click on \"Use Base Internationalization\"\r\n \r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou shouldn't have had to open those .xib files to see them in the list\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNOW the files show up in the file list!  Huh?\r\n\r\n---- BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. ------\r\n\r\n9. Dismiss the sheet.\r\n10. From the \"+\" button in the list of localizations, choose a new language to add, e.g. French.  (IMPORTANT: Do not select your xib files in the file navigator first!)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the sheet that comes up, there should be three columns: Resource File, Reference Language, and File Types.  The third column should let you choose \"Localizable Strings\".  After finishing, you should be able to disclose the localizations in the file navigator and see that the nib files have .strings files for their newly-added language.\r\n\r\nActual results: \r\nThere is no third column for selecting whether to make a .strings file or a .xib file!  And, if you disclose the localizations in the file navigator, you will see that the localizations are xib files -- definitely NOT what we want.\r\n\r\n---- BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. ------\r\n11. Dismiss the sheet, if needed.\r\n12. This time, go to the file navigator and select the .xib files so that they load into the main editor view.\r\n13. Go back to the Project icon in the navigator\r\n14. Add another language from the \"+\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results = Actual Results : There is our third column allowing us to choose \"Localizable Strings\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSo apparently, the ability to add files for Base Localization, and the ability to add Strings files to localization, depends on the files having been recently opened in the file navigator.  So this appears to be two separate failures!\r\n\r\nIf these instructions are hard to follow, or if you just want to sit back and see the problem, you can check out a movie of these steps!
