This is timing sensitive. We've replicated this on three Retina MacBook Pros (see the attached system profile). It may repro on other machines, but the timing required might be different.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Feb-2013 04:57 PM Timothy Wood:\r\n'write-file-by-merging.m' and 'MacBook Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded"
