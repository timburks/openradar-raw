        I'm currently implementing hyphenation myself, by using some open source code combined with the OpenOffice hyphenation dictionary. It's not very good. The following blog post explains a similar approach to the one I took:

        http://frankzblog.appspot.com/?p=7001

        I'd like an option on CTFramesetter to hyphenate the text. It should let you specify the hyphenation locale to use, and it should allow you to opt for hanging punctuation (where the hyphen overlaps the right hand edge of the frame). This would save anyone displaying long-form text from having to reinvent the wheel.
