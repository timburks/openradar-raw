        Summary:
        The time displayed in the upper right corner of the screen when the screensaver lock screen is visible does not follow the user's settings for formatting. Specifically if the user has 24 hr. time set, the lock screen clock will not be displayed in 24 hr. time

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) As an Admin user, open "Language & Text" System Preference pane
        2) Select "Region" tab
        3) Click on "Customizeâ€¦" under the "Times" section
        4) In the "Short" format string section click on the disclosure triangle for the hour.
        5) Change the format to "0-23"
        6) Repeat steps 4-5 for "Medium," "Long," and "Full" format sections
        7) Open the "Security & Privacy" System Preference pane
        8) Select "General" tab
        9) Check "Require password"
        10) Allow the computer present the lock screen by allowing the time needed (from step 9) to pass
        11) Note the time format in the upper right corner of the lock screen does not obey the settings performed in steps 4-6.

        Expected Results:
        The time format in the upper right corner of the lock screen should obey the settings performed in steps 4-6.

        Actual Results:
        The time format in the upper right corner of the lock screen does not obey the settings performed in steps 4-6.

        Regression:
        Always occurs.
