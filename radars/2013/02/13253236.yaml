        Summary:
        The Developer Certificate Utility (https://developer.apple.com/certificates/index.action) allows the entry of lowercase UUIDs. These UUIDs are however not recognized by Mac computers which seem to require UPPERCASE.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Copy some Mac's UUID, maybe converting it to lowercase
        - Go to https://developer.apple.com/certificates/index.action
        - Add a device with the lowercase UUID
        - Observe the profile not working on this devices


        Expected Results:
        - Either the Utility issuing a warning
        - Or the Utility automatically converting to uppercase
        - Or the Mac recognizing it's UUID even if it's lowercase


        Actual Results:
        - The lowercase UDID was entered
        - Unusable, blocking one device slot for a year.


        Regression:
        The Developer Certificate Utility still allows the entry of the Uppercase version. We were lucky enough to find this issue before losing too many slots this way.
