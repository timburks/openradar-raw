    description: "There are currently exactly 10 KVC Collection operators : \r\n* @count,\r\n* @sum,\r\n* @avg,\r\n* @min,\r\n* @max,\r\n* @unionOfObjects,\r\n* @distinctUnionOfObjects,\r\n* @distinctUnionOfArrays,\r\n* @distinctUnionOfSets,\r\n\r\nThe docs about KVC Collection Operators clearly states that there is currently no API to add custom operators.  It's in fact very possible, by adding methods named \"_<operator>ForKeyPath:\" to NSArray (or NSSet).\r\n\r\nThere are many scenarii where this feature would benefit greatly. I wish Apple would provide a real API for this.\r\n\r\n(Note : I wrote about it recently,  on http://bou.io/KVCCustomOperators.html)"
