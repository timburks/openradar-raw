    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I load a local PowerPoint file in UIWebView to preview it for the user, this leaks memory (from the OfficeImport framework), as I can see in Instruments. Releasing/destroying the UIWebView properly still seems to leak that memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI'm including an example iOS project, UIWebViewTest, for iOS 6.x. Launch it in Xcode, and run it with the simulator, then launch it with Instruments (Leaks tool), and allow it to load the .ppt file. This appears to happen with any .ppt file I try from my customers, not just this one.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis shouldn't have any leaks. The view is instantiated with an XIB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen the included .ppt file runs, Leaks will show a handful of items, all from OfficeImport.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A\r\n\r\nUploaded file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sy582ju36gzm4i3/UIWebViewTest.zip"
