    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UITableView (or UICollectionView) with NSFetchedResultsController, I sometimes get a very strange crash during table view updates. This is symptomatic part:\r\n---\r\ninternal error.  Cannot find an outgoing row head for incoming head <unknown var (bug!) with engine as delegate:0x1db13500>, which should never happen.'\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis particular instance happened in table view + search bar which acts as filter bar. UISearchDisplayController is not used, but whatever is typed into UISearchBar is used to change predicate for the NSFRC, then re-fetch is done. It's hard to reproduce this, as it's seemingly random. TableView has no sections, if it helps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTable view should update to show result.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApp crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached huge crash log and also an output from LLDB's bt all."
