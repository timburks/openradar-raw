    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode keeps changing storyboard and xibs, although nothing has changed in them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Do modifications to a storyboard from user A.\r\n2. Commit and push.\r\n3. Pull from user B.\r\n4. Click on the storyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing should happen to the storyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStoryboard is marked as changed. If user B tries to commit, changes are visible in the source comparison.\r\nSame applies to xibs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this happens only with Git.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround: cmd + z immediately after changes occur as a result of clicking the storyboard."
