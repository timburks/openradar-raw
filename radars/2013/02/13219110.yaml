    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen having a localized resource like a strings file in a project, you can't access some of the file inspector options if it only has 1 localization.  These options are what show up if you have 2+ localizations and click on a specific locale.  For strings it's the \"Text Settings\" area that is most noticeably missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create new project\r\n2. Add new strings resource to en.lproj folder\r\n3. Click strings file in file list\r\n4. Show file inspector\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould see Text Settings in file inspector or be able to choose the specific english locale to access it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnable to access the locale specific file settings"
