    description: "Summary:\r\nAccording to the [Distribution Definition XML Schema Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/DistributionDefinitionRef/Chapters/Introduction.html):\r\n\r\n\"An installer package can contain only one distribution definition file, which must be named distribution.dist.\"\r\n\r\nAttempting to create this file in an Xcode project results in a file that Xcode thinks is a folder (Identity and Type just lists a \"Folder Name\" attribute) and is uneditable in Xcode. Adding an existing file named \"distribution.dist\" results in the file and content appearing in Xcode, but it still thinks it is a folder and the content is uneditable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new OS X Command Line Tool project.\r\n2. Add an \"Empty\" file (File > New > Fileâ€¦) named \"distribution.dist\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file should appear in the project navigator as a text file and be editable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file appears in the project navigator but with a disclosure triangle (as if it were a folder) and is not editable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis occurs with any file that has a .dist extension."
