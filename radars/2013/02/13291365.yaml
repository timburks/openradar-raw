    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt'd be super awesome if when I typed in an import statement for a header, and after I accepted what Xcode suggested (stock framework / library headers only perhaps? ), that Xcode would simply add/link against said framework / library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: n/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results: n/a\r\n\r\nActual Results: n/a\r\n\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOnly thing that I can think of it breaking is multiple build targets, perhaps, but then again it could be class dependant? or have a modal popover ask what targets to associate it with?"
