        Summary:
        When disabling "New Mail Sound" setting (effectively switching it to "vibrate only") sound alert keeps playing when new mail arrives

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Make sure you have at least one email account set up
        Launch Settings.app
        Navigate to Notifications section
        Tap "Mail" section
        Tap any email account
        Tap "New Mail Sound"
        Select "None" in "Alert Tones" section
        Wait for a new email to arriveâ€¦

        Expected Results:
        Notification Sound shouldn't play

        Actual Results:
        Previously selected notification sound is being played

        Regression:
        Happens both when device locked and unlocked

        Notes:
        As far as I remember it use to happen back in 6.0, not sure if happened in older releases
