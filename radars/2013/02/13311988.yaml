    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing multiple subdomains with localStorage, ala 1.filldisk.com, 2.filldisk.com, 3.filldisk.com, and so on allows a single domain to use effectively unlimited space on the user's hard disk. Also, Safari seems to crash when the amount of data stored is equal to the amount of RAM the user has.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit http://filldisk.com\r\n2. Safari crashes after amount stored into localStorage equals the amount of RAM the user has.\r\n3. Or, even if Safari doesn't crash, it's still really bad that sites can fill up your hard disk.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) suggests this:\r\n\r\n\"User agents should guard against sites storing data under the origins other affiliated sites, e.g. storing up to the limit in a1.example.com, a2.example.com, a3.example.com, etc, circumventing the main example.com storage limit. A mostly arbitrary limit of five megabytes per origin is recommended.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA single domain is allowed to fill up the user's hard disk / crash Safari.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOther browsers tested:\r\n  Chrome 25: Fail\r\n  Firefox 18: Pass\r\n  IE 10: Fail"
