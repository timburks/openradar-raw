    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTapping \"open\" in the Safari smart app banner is not calling the \"application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:\" app delegate method. This means the opened app doesn't know how to handle the request.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTap \"open\" on a Safari smart app banner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should be opened and the method \"application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:\" called on the app delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app opens, but the delegate method is not called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't believe this has worked in any of the developer previews of iOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:"
