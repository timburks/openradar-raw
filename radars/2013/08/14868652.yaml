    description: "29-Aug-2013 09:56 AM James Kubicek:\r\nSummary:\r\nWe are building our app for iOS 6 with Xcode 4, but testing on iOS 7 devices. Our app has the status bar disabled throughout the app. Opening the photo library browser VC will cause the status bar to appear and not dissapear.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate app with Info.plist value 'UIStatusBarHidden' set to YES.\r\n\r\nCreate and display the photo library as follows:\r\n    UIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];\r\n    picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary;\r\n    [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPhoto library would appear without status bar visible. Status bar would continue to not be visible when the library closes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus bar is permanently visible after the library has closed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n29-Aug-2013 09:56 AM James Kubicek:\r\n'StatusBar.zip' was successfully uploaded"
