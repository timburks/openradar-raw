    description: "Summary:\r\nAn SKShapeNode presented in an SKScene with its path property set to a CGPathRef created with CGPathCreateWithEllipseInRect is drawn with blurry edges compared to the exact same path drawn in a UIView's drawRect: method.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nProvided a SpriteKit project with the template code, create an SKShapeNode and modify it as such:\r\n\r\nSKShapeNode *node = [[SKShapeNode alloc] init];\r\nnode.path = CGPathCreateWithEllipseInRect(rect, NULL);\r\nSKColor *color = [SKColor redColor];\r\nnode.fillColor = color;\r\n\r\nThen position it and add it as a child of the SKScene provided by the template.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn ellipses drawn within the CGRect and drawn with an anti aliased edge that fulfill the capabilities of CoreGraphics.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn ellipses drawn within the CGRect, but with ugly, blurry edge.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is the case for both antiAliased = YES and antiAliased = NO.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee sample project."
