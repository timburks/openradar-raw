    description: "Summary:\r\nThe sound effect used for AMBER Alerts is far too loud and shrill for their contextual urgency, *especially* given that these alerts are enabled by default on millions of iPhones.  Please consider using a less abrasive sound effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReceive an AMBER Alert on your iPhone when its Silent switch is turned off.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA sound effect similar to – but not the same as – the ones used for new text messages should play when receiving an AMBER Alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA piercing, shrill sound effect is used, which disrupts sleep or activities which require intense concentration such as driving.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
