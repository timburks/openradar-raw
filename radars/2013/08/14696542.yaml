        Summary:
        The color well for editing the text color of an NSTextField in Xcode's Interface Builder module does not deactivate when a new object is selected on the canvas.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Take a XIB that contains a window, containing (at least) two NSTextFields.
        - Select field A, click the image well part of the 'Text Color' popup button.
        - The Color Picker palette pops up, showing the current color, and you can change its color, and the field follows suit.
        - Select field B. Note how the color picker is still visible, still shows the color we set on field A (not field B's color), and the image well is still highlighted as active
        - Change the color of the color picker.

        Expected Results:
        field B's text color should change to the color I selected.

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens. Neither field A nor field B change their text color, the color picker seems completely disconnected from any target
