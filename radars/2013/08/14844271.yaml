    description: "Summary: It would be great if there was something in the OS that allowed a user to distinguish when a click on the window belonging to an application other than the front most application will actually click through, or if it will just bring the application forward.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an application with a window and a visible button.\r\n2. Bring another application to the front such that you can still see the button from the first application\r\n3. Hover over the button on the first application's window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor was grayed/altered in some way that I could tell what will happen if I click on that button.\r\n- Normal cursor: clicking on that button actually will click through to the button and the action associated with that button will happen\r\n- Altered cursor: clicking on that button will only bring that first application to the front. If what I wanted was actually to click that button, I need to click it again once the first application is frontmost.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently, the user cannot tell whether a click will click through to the control or not"
