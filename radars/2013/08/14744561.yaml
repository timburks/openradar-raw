Download modified CollectionView-Simple sample code and launch.\r\n2. Tap of \"Plus\" button in the top-left corner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nVisually nothing should change, \"finished\" should appear in the Console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash EXEC_BAD_ACCESS due to attempt to invoke a `block` which is suddenly equals to `nil`.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem does not occur when data source defines non-empty state, that is, if you change collectionView:numberOfItemsInSection: to return non-zero value (1 for example, or 28 - default value for the CollectionView-Simple sample code).\r\n\r\nAlso, this bug affects iOS 6.0+.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached sample code: CollectionView-Simple-NULLifiedBlock.zip."
