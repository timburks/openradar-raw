    description: "Summary:\nPlease add a way to manage multiple Behavior Sets similarly to how it is already possible to have multiple Key Binding Sets. This would be very useful for different working environments, especially screen resolutions. \nI frequently change between a big external monitor at home and the built in monitor of my MBP on the go. I like to have the Project Navigator displayed all the time on the big monitor but I prefer to use the Jump Bar on the smaller display to have more coding space. \nThe problem is, if I add a Behavior that displays the Issue Navigator when a Build Fails and a Behavior that displays the Project Navigator when Running Completes, I get the Project Navigator on my small screen too. Instead, I'd like a different set of behaviors in this case that would close any Navigators when Running Completes.\nPreferably the changing between Behavior Sets would be as easy as running a custom Behavior from the Xcode > Behaviors menu."
