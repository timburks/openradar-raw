    description: "I have several IMAP accounts on the same server. When connection to the server fails, MobileMail creates one alert for every account, resulting in a series of alerts that are quite annoying to dismiss individually. See attached movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Add several email accounts on the same IMAP server to MobileMail\r\n- Somehow take down the server\r\n- Launch MobileMail and pull down to refresh\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- There should be a nice warning, ideally in the status bar only, that warns me about failure to retrieve mails from some accounts\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- MobileMail creates one UIAlertView per email account it fails to connect to\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is not an issue for many, but it could be solved elegantly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue exists since iOS 2."
