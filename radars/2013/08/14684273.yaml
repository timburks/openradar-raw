        When debugging XIBs (particularly bindings issues), it is very hard to figure out if a certain instance variable is referenced by any objects instantiated from XIBs. It would therefore be really helpful if it was possible to search through XIBs in addition to regular text files.

        It would also be really handy if the search results were displayed in some sensible fashion, maybe even including a small picture of the object in the XIB file in context (e.g. a snapshot of the top-level object, e.g. NSWindow, with a red rectangle over the object where the match was found. The search result should also indicate the property name or "binding: enabled2" or so, to make it easy to find and recognize the object.

        Of course, selecting the object in the XIB's outline view when a search result is clicked would also be important, in case an object is covered by other objects on the canvas or so.
