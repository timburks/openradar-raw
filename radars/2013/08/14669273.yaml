    description: "Summary:\r\nAPN settings are no longer respected nor modifiable on iOS 7 seed 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n - Set APN settings in Seed 2.\r\n - Upgrade to seed 3.\r\n\r\n - Upgrade to seed 4, notice internet no longer works.\r\n   - Attempt to fix settings in Seed 4, notice that changes to APN settings are not preserved when navigating away or closing Settings.\r\n    - Attempt to use iPhone Configuration Utility to set APN settings.\r\n    - Notice nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\n - Upgrade to seed 5, notice internet still does not work.\r\n    - Attempt all steps describe in seed 4 section, notice nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFunctional internet from my prepaid B-Mobile (bmobile.ne.jp) SIM card\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNon-functional internet, PDP failure messages.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHaven't tried\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this might have something to do with UITableViews requiring two taps in iOS 6 applications. Maybe some callbacks not being fired correctly? Please feel free to contact me about this issue, I am glad to help test.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/843100#843100\r\nseems to be an indication of a similar (the same?) problem.\r\n\r\n17-Aug-2013 08:50 AM Devon Stewart:\r\nThis is still an issue in Beta seed 6, is there any workaround?\r\n\r\nI restored back to 6.1.3 to test my SIM card and APN settings, everything worked until I upgraded again.\r\nIf there's a way to downgrade to Beta seed 2, that would also be acceptable, since more bugs with working internet is better than fewer bugs and no internet."
