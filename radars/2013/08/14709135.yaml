    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn Safari, when you have more than one tab open in a window, and the tabs are too narrow to show the full page title, it will omit any shared prefixes with other tabs.  This is a nice feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, some sites (such as http://www.youtube.com and http://www.thisismyjam.com) change the page title to be prefixed with \"▶\" when a video/song is currently playing on that page.  But, since this can then be a common prefix (if more than 1 tab is currently playing), then it will be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a window with 2 tabs, each playing a video on youtube.  Then make the window narrow so that the full title won't fit, and the prefixing \"▶\" will be omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the whole purpose of the \"▶\" is to help you see which background tab is playing audio.  Omitting the \"▶\" defaults the purpose of them, and makes it hard to see which tabs are playing audio.  So, I think the \"▶\" should never be removed, if if it's common to multiple tab titles.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"▶\" gets omitted."
