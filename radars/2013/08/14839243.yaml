    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS 7, UIScrollView has new functionality that allows the keyboard to be dismissed either on drag or interactively, which is especially useful when working with UITextView, a subclass of UIScrollView.\r\n\r\nThis keyboard dismiss functionality works well when the content size of the text view is greater than its bounds, e.g. when the text view is scrollable. When the text view isn't scrollable, however, this functionality no longer works.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't make sense. It requires the application to compromise on user experience by either a) providing some sort of dismiss button, defeating the purpose of setting a keyboard dismiss mode or b) forcing the text view to be scrollable even when its content is much smaller than its bounds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new single-view iPhone application in Xcode.\r\n2. Add a full-screen text view with one line of default text.\r\n3. Mark the text view as editable and change the keyboard dismiss mode to interactive.\r\n4. Run the app.\r\n5. Tap on the text view. The system keyboard will appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDragging the keyboard will cause it to be dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDragging the keyboard will perform no action.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nSet the alwaysBounceVertical property of the text view to YES. This will allow the keyboard to be dismissed while introducing an undesired UI side effect.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
