    description: "Summary:\nI want discretionary background NSURLSessions to intelligently wait to send uploads until there is internet (if there isn't any right now). Does it? \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Turn on airplane mode\n2. Send upload with NSURLSession\n3. Quit App and force it to stop running completely\n4. Turn off airplane mode\n5. Wait 10 minutes\n\nExpected Results:\nI expected the upload to send when the internet came back on.\n\nActual Results:\nThe connections didn't send after about 10 minutes. I reopened the app and I got \"The operation couldn't be completed\" errors (code -999). \n\nRegression:\nMaybe it would have sent them in a little while but just canceled because it hadn't sent them by the time I re-registered? If thats the case, please let me know and let me know how long it could potentially be until it is sent.\n\nNotes:\nHere is my use case: I work on an SDK that reports analytic information back to our servers. The data must be sent in a timely fashion so what would be optimal for me is if NSURLSession could send the data right away but if there is no internet, wait until there is internet, send the info, then notify me the next time the app is running so I can clean up the files.\n\nIf this is what discretionary does, then that would be perfect for me as long as it sends its data relatively quickly after it gets internet. What are the rules for when it sends data? Could it wait a day even if there is cellular internet because it is waiting for wifi or to be plugged in?\n\nIf not, could you recommend how I should be using NSURLSession with this use case? Another idea I had was to use Reachability, a non discretionary session, and a discretionary session. If there is internet, use the non discretionary one, if there isn't, use the discretionary one.\n\nThank you,\nJason"
