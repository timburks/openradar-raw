    description: "11-Aug-2013 02:53 PM Christian Niles:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n-[NSMutableIndexSet shiftIndexesStartingAtIndex:by:] is supposed to shift indexes in the set by a specified amount. I've discovered that the results are incorrect when delta is negative and (startIndex + delta) exists in the set.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists both on OS X and iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInvoke -[NSMutableIndexSet shiftIndexesStartingAtIndex:5 by:-1] on an index set like {0,4,8,12,16,20}. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI'd expect the index set to be {0,4,7,11,15,19}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe index set is {0,7,11,15,19}\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to always ensure that the method is provided an index that exists in the set. However, sample code that I've attached shows that the method works with many other inputs, so I believe this is a bug.\r\n\r\n11-Aug-2013 02:53 PM Christian Niles:\r\n'MutableIndexSetShiftBug.zip' was successfully uploaded"
