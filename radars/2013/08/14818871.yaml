        Summary:

        When I get a FaceTime call my Mac, iPhone and iPad all ring. The devices I don't answer show a missed call. This shouldn't happen; I didn't miss the call, I just can't answer it on all three devices.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Be online with a Mac and an iPhone signed in to the same iCloud account, then get someone to call you with FaceTime. Answer the call on the Mac.

        Expected Results:
        The iPhone doesn't show a missed call, since it is informed that the call was answered on another device.

        Actual Results:
        The iPhone shows a missed call.

        Regression:
