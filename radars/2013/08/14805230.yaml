    description: "When building apps for a device with a passcode enabled, Xcode displays a dialog saying \"Device Locked: Xcode cannot launch applications on <device name> as it is currently locked with a passcode. Please unlock the device and try again.\" In these cases, since the developer's focus is already on Xcode (since they just performed a run action), it would be super-useful for it to be possible to enter the passcode from Xcode, using their Mac's keyboard.\r\n\r\nOften when I hit this dialog, my device is locked, sitting across the table, and I don't usually plan on grabbing it right away since it takes a while for Xcode to build and run the application, attach the debugger, etc. Having to grab the device, enter the passcode and switch back to Xcode to restart the build is a weird context switch that would be much easier handled on the developer tools end."
