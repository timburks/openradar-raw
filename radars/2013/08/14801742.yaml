    description: "Summary:\r\nCollection view cells are sometimes hidden when applying a translation that results in their frame's x-coordinate becoming less than 0. This seems to be influenced by the zIndex set in the layout attributes applied to the particular cell.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample project provided.\r\n2. Drag each cell to the right and to the left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cells move laterally while remaining visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen dragging the cell to the right, the cell remains visible.\r\nWhen dragging the cell to the left, if the card isn't one of the first two cards, it becomes hidden.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* I noticed a similar bug in iOS 6 but never filed a radar. Sorry.\r\n* The hidden property of the cell's layer is literally being set by the collection view. I did KVO to verify this; the code is included as part of the sample project.\r\n* In my main project, viewing the backtrace seems to indicate that the cell is being marked for reuse for some reason."
