    description: "28-Aug-2013 11:25 PM Erik Price:\r\nSummary:\r\nAdding a periodic time observer to an AVPlayer playing an HLS asset using a serial dispatch queue results in a crash in -[AVPlayerPeriodicCaller _effectiveRateChange] .\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an AVPlayer for a HLS URL and add its AVPlayerLayer to the view hierarchy.\r\n2. Call -play on the AVPlayer.\r\n3. Create a dispatch_queue_t using dispatch_queue_create(\"myQueue\", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL).\r\n4. Add a periodic time observer to the AVPlayer on the created dispatch queue using an interval of CMTimeMake(120.0f, 600) and an empty block (or just put a call to NSLog in the block).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the periodic time observer to execute the block with no problems.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNearly every time I can get this to EXC_BAD_ACCESS in -[AVPlayerPeriodicCaller _effectiveRateChange]. If I can't, then I just have to add another periodic observer or two and it will crash reliably.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching a zipped Xcode project that demonstrates the bug. Run the app in the iOS simulator and then click the \"BOOM\" button to add the periodic time observer(s).\r\n\r\n28-Aug-2013 11:25 PM Erik Price:\r\n'AVPlayerPeriodicCallerCrash.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Aug-2013 11:17 AM Erik Price:\r\nI do not experience the crash if I insert a call to -pause immediately before adding the periodic observer and then insert a call to -play immediately afterward. This is a sufficient workaround for my needs, but it should be documented that periodic observers should not be added to an already-playing AVPlayer when using private serial dispatch queues."
