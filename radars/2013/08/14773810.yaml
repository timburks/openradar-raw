    description: "19-Aug-2013 06:12 PM Andrew Nicols:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you have an iframe on a page, where the iframe contains a contenteditable area, and the window has any touch event present (touchstart, touchmove, or touchend), it is impossible to edit the contenteditable area after touching the page in any way.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee attached files:\r\n* Open the index.html file in iOS Safari\r\n* touch to edit the contenteditable region\r\n* add some content to the region using the onscreen keyboard (or bluetooth)\r\n* touch anywhere on the screen (including to move to a different word)\r\n* try to continue typing (does not work)\r\n* close the keyboard\r\n* touch the screen again\r\n* try to type again (works now)\r\n* repeat if desired\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTyped letters appears on screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLetters are not displayed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is repeatable with any touch event. Try modifying the JS to only include any one of the touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend).\r\nI've tried returning false, and ev.preventDefault() to see if these have any effect (none).\r\nPlease note that this works as expected with iOS Chrome.\r\n\r\n19-Aug-2013 06:12 PM Andrew Nicols:\r\n'testcase.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n19-Aug-2013 07:31 PM Andrew Nicols:\r\nI've found a workaround:\r\niframe.contentWindow.document.addEventListener('keydown', function() {\r\n  iframe.contentWindow.focus();\r\n});\r\n\r\n19-Aug-2013 07:34 PM Andrew Nicols:\r\nAlso interesting to note is that this is not an issue if the contenteditable is not in an iframe.\r\n\r\nI should note that this affects TinyMCE *anywhere* that touch events are present so there's potentially a very large number of affected users."
