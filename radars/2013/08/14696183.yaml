    description: "09-Aug-2013 09:57 PM Kevin Chen:\r\nApple should work with law enforcement to improve the usability of AMBER Alerts on iPhone. This is a case where improved usability can save lives. \r\n\r\nExample - AMBER Alert that some Californians received recently:\r\n\r\nAMBER Alert\r\nBoulevard, CA AMBER Alert UPDATE: LIC/6WCU986 (CA) Blue Nissan Versa 4 door\r\n\r\nJudging by the reaction on Twitter, most people were confused because they didn't know what an AMBER Alert was, and annoyed because they'd apparently been interrupted for nothing.\r\n\r\n* Alert noise can be dangerous when played in a car.\r\n\r\n* Alerts are confusing:\r\nMore people will pay attention to \"Missing Child Alert\"\r\n\"License Plate\" is more readable than \"LIC\"\r\nSince AMBER Alerts follow a mostly predictable format, this rewriting could be done on the iOS device's end (if the law allows it). \r\n\r\n* Alerts should have an action that leads to a webpage with more information, like pictures of the victim or more verbose descriptions."
