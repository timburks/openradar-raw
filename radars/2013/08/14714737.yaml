    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the device changes from portrait to landscape orientation while the master view of a split view controller is visible, when the device finishes animating the rotation, the master view is not visible in landscape orientation even though it should be.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a new project using the Master-Detail project template.\r\n2. Launch the app. (This is easiest to reproduce in the simulator)\r\n3. Turn the device in portrait.\r\n4. Press the “Master” bar button item.\r\n5. Tap outside the master view to dismiss it and, very quickly, turn the device to landscape.\r\n\r\nWhen the animation completes, the master view controller will not be visible in landscape.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe master view should always be visible in landscape.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe master view is hidden.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
