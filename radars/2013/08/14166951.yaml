    description: "Summary:\r\nI currently hold an iPhone 5 (iOS 7 Beta) with a resolution of 320x568 (640x1136 retina). However when I set a startup image I have to make it 640x1096 else it gets ignored. Which is ok if you set \"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" to default or a solid black, but it's NOT ok if you set it to black-translucent. Now if I start the web application as standalone, I get a white border of 20 pixels when starting up.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a web document with the following in the header:\r\n\r\n\t<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" />\r\n\t<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black-translucent\" />\r\n\t<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" />\r\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-startup-image\" href=\"apple-touch-startup-640x1136.png\" media=\"(device-width:320px) and (device-height:568px) and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio:2) and (orientation:portrait )\">\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt will be ignored.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt should display the full image.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso it would be nice if you could hide the status bar in web application but that should be a different topic ;)\r\n\r\n02-Jul-2013 12:35 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
