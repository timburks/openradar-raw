    description: "Summary: It appears that Safari in iOS 7 prevents clicks in lower portion of screen, i.e. any links residing in the bottom ~40px of the screen are dumb to an initial click 'after scrolling'. The first click in this area now reveals the Safari nav bar, a 2nd click is now required 'after that' to any content previously residing in that area. This is a terrible change as it apparently breaks websites - especially those using position: fixed; bottom: 0; to position a nav bar in a fixed position at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a scrolling web page with a div containing links set to position: fixed; bottom: 0;\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Clicking on links in that div would initiate a click even on that link and take the user to the specified URL.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Any click on an element in this portion of the screen is ignored (without explanation) and instead causes the bottom nav bar to appear.\r\n\r\nRegression: Revert behaviour such that clicks in the bottom portion of the browser window 'are' detected by the web page (as a user would expect). Change 'reveal' behaviour for nav bar to two finger click or some other gesture.\r\n\r\nNotes: Please, please, please consider changing this before release - there are 100's and 1000's of websites out there where users will feel that links and buttons no longer work or that their iOS device is not correctly registering clicks."
