    description: "Summary:\r\nCalling UINavigationController's setViewControllers:animated: method within a UIViewController that is in the process of loading (before viewDidAppear:) will result in the new top view controller's view being shown, but the old top view controller's navigation item will remain in the nav bar. If there are any action buttons in that navigation item, tapping them will cause a crash because its associated view controller has been dealloc'd\r\n\r\nThis is for an app built against the iOS 6 toolchain, but run under iOS 7.  Simulator or device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Present a nav controller with a root view controller.  give this root view controller a title and an action button with a custom action.  Let's call it \"view1\".\r\n2) In view1's viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear, instantiate a second view controller (\"view2\", with a local variable 'vc'), which has a different title and it's own action button.  call [self.navigationController setViewControllers: @[vc] animated: NO];\r\n3) UI will show view of view2, but navigation item of view1.  Tapping action button in nav bar will cause crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNavigation Item belongs to view 2 and action button call appropriate methods in view 2\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNavigation Item belongs to view 1.  Tapping action button item causes crash.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nFunctionality works as expected in iOS 6"
