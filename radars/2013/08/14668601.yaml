    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen typing constructs like \"if (something\" or \"[NSString\", the matching closing bracket gets inserted in a gray color and only \"fully\" inserts itself when stepping over it. I'm not a huge fan of this, especially since it can't be turned off, but it would be great if that closing bracket would disappear again if I delete the text that prompted its insertion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Xcode, open an Objective-C .m file\r\n- Create a method\r\n- Within there, start typing: \"NSString *str = [NSString\"\r\n- See how a gray closing bracket \"]\" gets inserted\r\n- Delete \"[NSString\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The gray closing bracket should go away automatically\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The gray closing bracket stays there\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe gray of the bracket suggests that its only a temporary insertion awaiting confirmation. It however never removes itself, which makes me question the reason why it's gray at all. It could be black immediately and the behavior wouldn't change at all.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis has been present since at least Xcode 4.\r\n\r\n06-Aug-2013 11:52 PM:\r\nWait, I was wrong, stepwise deletion of \"[NSString\" does indeed remove the auto-inserted bracket, however highlighting \"[NSString\" and then deleting it all at once does NOT remove the closing bracket."
