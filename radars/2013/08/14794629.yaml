    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen deleting and renaming files from the Project Navigator in Xcode 4.6.3 running under Mavericks, the behaviour is inconsistent.  Sometimes files are correctly deleted and renamed, but in other instances they are not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a project in Xcode 4.3.6 running under Mavericks 10.9 (13A538g)\r\n2. Select a file\r\n3a. Right-click and select 'Delete'\r\n3b. Select the 'move to trash' or 'remove reference' option from the pop-up menu\r\nor\r\n4a. Single-click on the file to begin editing the name\r\n4b. Change the filename and hit return to save change.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nin 3: file should be removed from the project and deleted from the folder if 'move to trash' option was selected.\r\nIn 4: file name should change in Xcode, and change should be reflected in Finder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn both scenarios: no effect takes place. File remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis occurs inconsistently when running Xcode 4.3.6 under Mavericks.  It has not occurred running Xcode 4.3.6 under Mountain Lion."
