    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen there is a folder in the bottom right corner of a springboard-page, you can't drag an application from another page directly into that folder. The reason is that when you arrive at the first page while dragging the application which you like to put in that folder, that folder is already jumped to the next page leaving an empty space in the bottom right corner. If then, you go back to the second page, you won't be able to see the folder again because it is automatically jumped back to the first page. Leaving the user confused and irritated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFill your first page with icons and make sure you create a folder in the bottom right corner. Try dragging an icon from a different page into that folder directly. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you arrive at the first page with your app under your finger, the folder should be there for the user to put the app in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe folder just disappears (while as developers we know, it is not gone it is just moved to the next page).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
