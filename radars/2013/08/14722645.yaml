    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niCloud sync doesn't work on Notes app between desktop and mobile device at the first time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Edit a note on Notes app on desktop.\r\n2. Close Notes app on the desktop (simply press \"x\" button\" on the window).\r\n3. Edit a note on mobile device.\r\n4. Edit another note on desktop.\r\n5. Open Notes on mobile device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll works fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. On step 3 you will see obsolete note because it didn't synced on desktop.\r\n2. After step 5 you will see 2 duplicated notes with different edits.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI think it's a basic functionality of Notes app and iCloud system. And it's a pity that Apple allows bugs like this to be exist."
