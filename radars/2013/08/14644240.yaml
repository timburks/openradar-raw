    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode: When dragging from a button in the designer to header file in the assistant editor, the default Connection is \"Outlet\".  While this makes sense, it is too easy to mistakenly create an outlet when meaning to create an Action.  This requires both removing the generated code and manually clearing the binding in the designer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee this awesome video illustrating the issue: https://vimeo.com/71689633\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSomething more clear and/or easier/faster to revert if wrong.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFrustration.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's worth noting that dragging into the implementation file defaults to Action as it should.  I just wish there was some magical predictive sense to the header file.  For a rainy day. :)"
