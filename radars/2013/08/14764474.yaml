    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a view is scaled (using -[NSView setBoundsSize:], auto layout does not correctly position its sub views. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild and run the attached project. The window contains two nested views. Constraints are set up so the inner view fills the outer view completely (connecting all four sides with 0 distance).\r\n\r\nSelect \"Scale Outer View\" from the View menu. This calls -setBoundsSize: on the outer view with half the actual bounds value.\r\n\r\nEverything inside the outer view is now scaled down by a factor of two, as can be seen for the label in the inner view center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe inner view should still fill the outer view completely as called for by the constraints.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe inner view has only half the size of the outer view, sitting in the lower left corner. Resizing the window shows that this relation is kept.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected under Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a serious problem for us. We based our whole window and content layout on auto layout and need view scaling for zooming. This seems now broken under Mavericks, and we are not aware of any straight forward workaround."
