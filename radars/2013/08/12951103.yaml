    description: "Summary: With iTunes Match enabled, it is not possible to update the album artwork for an album already on iCloud either Matched, Purchased or Uploaded.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Enable iTunes Match\r\n2) Select and album and change the artwork to a new file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: iTunes should upload the newly updated artwork file and replace the copy already on iCloud.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes momentarily updates the artwork and is shown in album view. Within the next few iTunes Match updates, the artwork will revert back to a previous version before the change.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem has been there since iTunes Match launched."
