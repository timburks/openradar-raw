    description: "Summary: When I create a test called MYSRunTests.m, it runs all my other tests and then when it attempts to run MYSRunTests it says \"Tests Succeeded\" but has this console output: http://d.pr/i/Sw5q/19H5KUT\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: I've created these tests (minus MYSRunTests) http://d.pr/i/G2DW/IB50riap\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The tests would at least run.\r\n\r\nActual Results: I set a breakpoint in -setUp and it doesn't even hit it, it just never runs the test. The test is turned on: http://d.pr/i/lj9R/5ef4jbGo and when I set an exception breakpoint this is the stacktrace: http://d.pr/i/99tI/15fLn2yD\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
