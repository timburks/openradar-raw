        Summary:
        Depending on which color the background has the time in the statusbar is impossible to read. White on white just doesn't work very good.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Set background image to something that is white or very bright at the top
        2) Be unable to read the time

        Expected Results:
        Be able to tell how late I stayed up again.

        Actual Results:
        Wonder where the time has gone and be up until I have to go to classes again.

        Regression:
        The problem occurs every time the background is too bright at the top. Darker backgrounds make the clock readable again.

        Notes:
        The clock is one of the things that bug me about Ivy's redesign. When you use a background that is bright at the top of the screen you're not able to tell how late it is (without looking out the windows or simply up when you're outside).

        My background is very nice and matches the colors of the new icons quite well, so why do I need to change my image around when you guys could simply make the clocks's text color the contrast of the backgrounds color in that area or at a shadow or something to make the clock readable again.
