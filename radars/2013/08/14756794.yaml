    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen uploading a song to iTunes Match that has a bigger file size than your average 4 minute song but is still within Match's limitations iTunes crashes without a specific error message other than Windows typical : \"Program-name-here has stopped working and will quit now.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Get yourself a big music file e.g. a DJ mix of any sort that is shorter than one hour and has a file size of approx. 100 MB\r\n2) Add this song to your iTunes Media stuff and add it to a playlist.\r\n3) Enable iTunes Match and let it do it's thing\r\n4) Steps 1 and 2 should work, but right after Step 3 kicks in iTunes crashes with a magnificent Windows error message.\r\n5) Cry for one hour and try again\r\n6) ...\r\n7) Profit!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA nice DJ mix of my favorite music in the iTunes Cloud, accessible from every device I own at any time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes in my trash and a cancelled subscription to iTunes Match. Also Windows Media Player is my preferred player for my iTunes Media. Yay?\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis dang error occurs every time, every time I start iTunes because it auto checks with Match on start. Of course iTunes terminates itself after Step 2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nGuy on forums had same issue and he fixed it with disabling said option I don't know its name (sorry again). Didn't fix it for me though. What actually DID fix my problem was downgrading to iTunes 10.7 again. I eventually had to use a old copy of my MediaLibrary file, but it was worth it.\r\n\r\nFix that error in the next update and enjoy a day off or something.\r\n\r\nUPDATES:\r\n16-Aug-2013 11:48 PM Oliver Conzen:\r\nStrangely enough, now after shutting down the Computer for more than 5 hours the problem resolved itself. The exact same song will upload now just fine.\r\nWhile the issue was still an issue, I called Apple Support which told me that servers were under heavy load, so maybe it was a server side bug that led to the crash of the client.\r\n\r\nWell, I am happy uploading my stuff and enjoying it on mobile.\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\n18-Aug-2013 01:17 PM Oliver Conzen:\r\nError occured again today with a different mp3. There is defenatly Some Tin Wong with uploading big files to iTunes Match.\r\n\r\n18-Aug-2013 01:17 PM Oliver Conzen:\r\nEdit: Opened\r\n\r\n20-Aug-2013 01:33 PM Oliver Conzen:\r\nIt is WINDOWS for fucks sake. These folders do not exist.\r\n\r\nApple Developer Notes:\r\n\r\n16-Aug-2013 11:04 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nWhat I need to analyze the crash is the actual crash log. To generate a crash log on Windows, get iTunes into the state where the \"iTunes has stopped working, blah, blah, blah\". Then bring up the Task Manager by right clicking on the task bar and selecting \"Start Task Manager\" from the contextual menu. In the applications tab of the dialog that comes up, right click on iTunes and select \"Create Dump File\". That will churn for a while and then give you a dialog with the name and folder location of the .dmp file.\r\n\r\nYou can upload and attach your files directly to the bug report.  For uploading, file size is limited to 100 MB.  For anything larger, or if you have any problems uploading, we can provide an ftp server.  Please update your bug report with a note to let us know if you need to use ftp.\r\n\r\n19-Aug-2013 08:54 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a crash log.\r\n\r\nTo locate the crash log(s), please check the following locations (you may need to do this in a Terminal window, rather than using Finder): \r\n\r\n~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports \r\n/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports \r\n\r\nIf you are not able to locate any crash report information in either of these locations, please check the /var/log/system.log for any relevant \r\nerror messages from \"crashreporter\" or \"crashdump\".\r\n\r\nPlease provide your response or results by updating your bug report."
