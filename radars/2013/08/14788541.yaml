    description: "20-Aug-2013 02:07 PM Owen Imholte:\r\nSummary:\r\nConditional breakpoints do not work (at all?) in Xcode 5.0.\r\n\r\nFirst I thought it might be a problem with my syntax since this is a new endeavor for me (using conditionals in my breakpoints). The UI to create a conditional is very nice and straightforward, but they do not appear to work. The debugger only occasionally throws errors, for example if a nonexistent variable is used. I was trying to check if a given objective C object was NULL and it never was but the breakpoint continually paused execution regardless of syntax I tried. That led me to develop a simple test case attached where the conditional doesn't work as expected even for a simple integer value.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet a breakpoint with a condition that should evaluate as false (i.e. \"i == 3\" when \"i\" actually equals 2) and evaluate the method.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExecution flow continues unless the conditional is true.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExecution is paused. (Or the breakpoint \"triggers\" if the continue option is checked)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis feature works as expected in Xcode 4 and fails in Xcode 5 DP5.\r\n\r\nThe attached project runs in both and has breakpoints to be observed in the didFinishLaunching method in the app delegate. The breakpoints should be included, but if they are not, created the following:\r\n\r\nline 20: breakpoint with conditional \"i == 1\"\r\nline 23: breakpoint with conditional \"i == 1\"\r\n\r\nOnly the latter is expected to stop, but in Xcode 5 they both do.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
