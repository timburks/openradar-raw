    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an option \"When switching an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" in system preferences > mission control. However Finder (and also iTune, I am not sure that there is some app else) doesn't behave according to the option. It's very frustrating when I trying to staying concentrate on a certain space when there is Finder's window already open in any other space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. make sure there is no any window opened to clearly see the issue.\r\n1. go to \"system preferences > mission control\" then uncheck \"When switching an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\".\r\n2. open new finder window.\r\n3. switch to any other mission control space where there is no finder window opened.\r\n4. keep an eyes open and click Finder in the dock or try cmd+Tab to switch to Finder.\r\n5. here the strange behaviour happened, mission control switch back to a space with already opened Finder window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nwhen switching to Finder.app it shouldn't switch to any other space when the option is unchecked. it should only activate Finder so that the menu bar on top of screen shows Finder's menu so that user can continue making decision to Finder in current \"no already opened Finder's window\" space instead of trying to see where his/her current space gone.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nwhen switching to Finder.app it's always switch to a space containing Finder's window if there is one or more already opened and there is no Finder's window opened in current space.. regardless of the option. Try with TextEdit.app or Safari.app according to Step to Reproduce instead should see how Finder should expected to behave\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nStarting with Leopard 10.5.3 (and continuing into unreleased Maverick 10.9) there is an option for this where Finder and iTune will not behave according to the option.\r\nAny hardware currently running OSX with an option \"When switching an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" does have the problem occurs.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a not so satisfied hidden command-line \"user defaults system\" workaround where we may enter the following command in Terminal.app \r\n\r\n: defaults write com.apple.Dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO\r\n\r\nbut this option break some in-detail user-experience. If not using the command-line workaround, user will still be able to double tap on the dock icon in any app to make auto-switch to a space with the opened window, which is kind of wise user-experience design. And I prefer to double tap because it really convenient to control if I really want the already opened window or not.\r\n\r\nI really hope to see this issue fixed over any releasing feature to keep using OSX happily. thank you."
