    description: "After releasing a new app last week that I knew had issues with iOS 7 (that where only introduced in beta 4), I have had nothing but negative reviews on the App Store from the general public that are using iOS 7.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that iOS beta's are supposed to be for developers. I know the general public can buy their way into a developer program, but it seems that isn't even necessary and iOS 7 can be installed by anybody without any checks by Apple whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis is very damaging to developers, especially when we are not even allowed to publicly release iOS 7 versions of our apps yet.\r\nAlso, we are not allowed to say in our app descriptions that it has issues with iOS 7.\r\n\r\nFrom the first week of sales of my new app, I can see that 25-30% of users where using iOS 7 which is ridiculously high for a closed beta.\r\n\r\nI think at a very minimum, any users of iOS 7 should not be allowed to place reviews of any app onto the App Store as most of them just say 'It doesn't work' and has a long term negative effect on the app."
