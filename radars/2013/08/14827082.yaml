    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you open the Weather APP when there are no cities there, the splash screen is glitchy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Remove all cities (cells) from the Weather APP, so the (+) icon is all the way at the top under the battery icon.\r\n2. Close APP.\r\n3. Open APP.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA smooth transition from springboard to the APP.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter reopening the APP you will now quickly see the original blue splash screen (which is unlogic the begin with, because I am not viewing a blue screen afterwards) and after that you will quickly see a stretched image of a cloud and a sun (which is most definitely a bug) and then it loads.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
