        Summary:
        Xcode suppresses build log messages that go beyond the first 200 notices, stating "Showing first 200 notices only" for any build phase.

        While I know I can right click on an item and "Expand all transcripts" it would be beneficial to be able to remove this limitation in many cases.

        Ideally I would love to be able to configure this on a per build phase level. Allowing me to create a Run Script Build Phase and either set a specific limit or hit a checkbox to enable/disable the limit.
