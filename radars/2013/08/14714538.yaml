    description: "ummary: In current builds of iOS 7 it is possible to turn off wifi or turn on airplane mode from the lock screen by bringing up Control Center. However if a device is stolen or lost, this allows someone to turn off the ability to use Find My iPhone to lock or wipe the device remotely as it can no longer be contacted by the service.\r\n\r\nThis means that someone could restore the device by forcing it into restore mode and restoring it as a new device.\r\n \r\nI realize that the new activation lock feature is supposed to address this on phones, but it does not seem to address iPads or iPod devices. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add a passcode to the device, swipe up on lock screen and turn of wifi or turn on airplane mode. \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Airplane mode and WiFi switches should not work unless the device is unlocked using the passcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Device can be disconnected from all network connectivity, making it impossible to use the Find my iPhone service to lock the device, wipe it remotely or display a message.\r\n\r\nRegression: In previous iOS devices you could only change connectivity status if you knew the passcode lock for the device.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
