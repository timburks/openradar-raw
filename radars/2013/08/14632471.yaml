        I find it very convenient to move forward and back using the little arrows in the upper left of the Xcode text editing pane. However, when I quit Xcode, the entire history is gone. It only remembers the last file (which is usually a XIB that caused Xcode's buggy XIB editor to crash). It would be really nice if Xcode remembered what files were in the history and let me "go back" to them even after a quit and relaunch.

        However, please do *not* reopen all the files in the history until I view them again the first time. With Xcode's propensity for modifying XIBs that were created with a previous version, that'd be annoying because they'd always uselessly show up as modified in version control even when I don't personally touch them during a session.

        Alternately, something like Safari's "Reopen last closed window" menu item that lets me reopen the last files in the history *explicitly* (so I can do it only in the case of a crash or restart for updates or accidental quit of Xcode, and not in cases where I don't care what files I last worked on) would work for my use case as well.
