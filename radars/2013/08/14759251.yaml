        Summary:
        Changing the font size in Xcode (say, to presentation)  doesn't always change the display of all open code windows.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open a project with multiple .m files.  Open all of the files, one by one, in the same tab.  Then go to preferences and change the Font/Color scheme to "Presentation".

        Expected Results:
        All of the files that I've opened should have the same color scheme / font size.

        Actual Results:
        As I navigate back between files they retain their original font size & color.

        Notes:
        This has been a bug since Xcode 4.x, sad to see it's still not fixed.
