        Summary:
        Prior to 10.9 DP5 it was possible to change the scale and zRotation of an SKScene. Now with DP5 it's not possible anymore and I get a message on the console ("SKScene: Setting the scale of a SKScene has no effect."). What's the reason for this? Together with the anchorPoint, using these 3 properties it was easily possible to have a scene that can be panned, rotated and zoomed with scroll, rotation and pinch gestures. Now to do the same I would have to add an additional root node, which seems kind of unintuitive and unnecessary, considering that it worked nice before.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Change the scale of an SKScene

        Expected Results:
        Scene is zoomed.

        Actual Results:
        Warning on the console, no effect.
