    description: "Summary:\r\nThe fact that identierForVendor changes if all apps from the vendor are removed renders the API useless for purposes like trial periods for features.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom -identierForVendor documentation:\r\n\r\nThe value in this property remains the same while the app (or another app from the same vendor) is installed on the iOS device. The value changes when the user deletes all of that vendorâ€™s apps from the device and subsequently reinstalls one or more of them. Therefore, if your app stores the value of this property anywhere, you should gracefully handle situations where the identifier changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our use case we want to ensure that each user (or device) can try a feature (that can later be purchased via IAP) for a certain amount of time. This demo period should not be circumvented by deleting and reinstalling the app. We used to use -uniqueIdentifier for that but -identifierForVendor does not look like a suitable replacement. And I don't see any other viable solution either."
