    description: "29-Aug-2013 09:20 AM Kyle Hale:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I animate the size of the table view's tableHeaderView, the size of the header changes fine, but the layout of the rest of the table view doesn't adjust accordingly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a table view in a story board and add a UIView as a header\r\n2. In code, change the size of the table view's tableHeaderView, inside an animation block\r\n3. Observe that the size of the header changes, but the cells of the table view remain where they were before the animation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the table view cells to adjust their position to allow for the header view's size change.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe table view cells retained their old position.\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt can currently be worked around by re-assigning the tableHeaderView property inside of the animation block; this seems to trigger a layout update. setNeedsLayout does not work, which was my first try."
