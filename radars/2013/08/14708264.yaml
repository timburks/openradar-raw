        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        I have Xcode 5 DP5 installed and I still cannot download the pre-release dockets. And since all of the developer services are finally online I expect all of the docs would be available to download and this issue I have had a while would be resolved.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        Try downloading docsets with the DP5 release of Xcode 5.

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        It fails with an error stating my account does not have access.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.



        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
