        Summary:
        Ctrl-shift turns slow animations on/off in the simulator. This is unnecessary as there's now a more conventional shortcut (cmd-T) and annoying, as it's a common part of global shortcuts. I have bound OS X space switching to cmd-ctrl-shift-arrows and often accidentally toggle slow animations.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Hit ctrl-shift. It doesn't work 100% of the time, but does work often. I don't know what determines when it works.

        Expected Results:
        Nothing. The simulator shouldn't react to pressing two common modifiers.

        Actual Results:
        Slow animations are toggled on or off.
