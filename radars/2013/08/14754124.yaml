    description: "With the new unified status bar, developers are suddenly responsible for integrating the status area into the look of their application. Change is fine, but some level of control would be useful. Not every app design will have a consistently dark or consistently light status area. Some apps will even provide animations and interactions that will cause the status area to change colors (views sliding around, for example). \r\n\r\nProviding APIs to control the opacity and tint of the status bar information would be a good start. If developers are now responsible for integrating the status bar, it is reasonable to expect that they be given some control over it."
