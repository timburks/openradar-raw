    description: "Summary:\r\nDepending on your Springboard app layout, launching an app can temporarily leave a white pixelated remnant in the upper left corner of the screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Organize applications on a Springboard page so an app with a long name (Google Maps works) is the second app on the second row.\r\n2. Pull down to search for an app\r\n3. Search for any app (other than the one you positioned) and launch\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSmooth animation into the home screen of the launched app\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nToward the end of the zoom animation, the right edge of the title of the app with the long name gets temporarily \"stuck\" in the upper left corner of the screen before the animation completes.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 beta 6 (first appeared in beta 5)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nApp with long, one-line name in second position of second row in Springboard.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
