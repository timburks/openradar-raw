    description: "Summary: In Mountain Lion, you could schedule a reminder like \"Meeting at 11am,\" and Reminders would interpret that as \"Meeting\" scheduled for 11am. Great!\r\n\r\nThat works in Mavericks, too.\r\n\r\nBut in Mountain Lion, I could then go back to that reminder (\"Meeting\") and add \"at 1pm\" instead, and it would reschedule the reminder. That doesn't work in Mavericks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a scheduled reminder\r\n2. Use natural language to change the time/date\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The time/date of the reminder should change per the natural language\r\n\r\nActual Results: It doesn't; the Reminder just gets a new, dopey name: \"Meeting at 1pm\" (yet still scheduled for 11am)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: I LOVED the Mountain Lion behavior.\r\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2020716/reminders-how-to-quickly-schedule-tasks-on-your-mac.html"
