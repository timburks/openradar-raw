    description: "29-Aug-2013 02:37 PM David Robles:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe UIKeyboard show/hide notification center notifications are providing invalid animation curve values in the user info property. Specifically the UIKeyboardWillShowNotification and UIKeyboardWillHideNotification notifications give an integer value for the UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey of 7. The valid integer values for a UIViewAnimationCurve are between 0 and 3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1) Add an observer to the NSNotification UIKeyboardWillShowNotification or UIKeyboardWillHideNotification.\r\n2) Examine the userInfo property of the notification object that comes back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUsually an integer value between 0 and 3 is returned corresponding to one of the 4 UIViewAnimationCurve enums.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn integer value of 7 will be returned for the animation curve on both the iOS 7 simulator and devices running iOS 7."
