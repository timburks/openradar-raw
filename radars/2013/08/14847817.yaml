    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting UIScrollView's keyboardDismissMode property to interactive allows the user to manipulate the keyboard by dragging. However, there is no (easy) way to find out the updated frame of the keyboard. \r\n\r\nThe notifications UIKeyboardDidChangeFrameNotification and UIKeyboardWillChangeFrameNotification are only sent when the keyboard is displayed and dismissed. They are not sent as the frame of the keyboard is updated.\r\n\r\nEither these notifications should fire every frame as the keyboard is being dragged, or UIScrollViewDelegate should have a new delegate method, something like -scrollView:didChangeKeyboardFrame:, where the second parameter is the frame of the keyboard converted to the scrollview's coordinate space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
