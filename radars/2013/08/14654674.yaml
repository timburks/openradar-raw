    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen you have Xcode Server turned off for a while, then turn it back on, it queues up a bunch of builds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project and add a bot\r\n2. Set the build setting to hourly\r\n3. Let it build once or twice, to make sure the repo is setup correctly\r\n4. Turn off OS X Server\r\n5. Wait a day or two, re-open Server\r\n6. Go to the Xcode Server web portal, and see many queued up builds\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf Server is turned on after being off for a while, there should be at most one build, not tens, possibly hundreds, queued up. The only way to stop this is to delete the Bot (I had Server off for 3+ weeks, so there were hundreds of builds queued).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nServer decides to run all the builds it would have done if it had been turned off.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBots are too new to tell.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
