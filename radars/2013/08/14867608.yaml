    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nOver the past 8 months or so using iTunes for purchasing TV shows is becoming more and more of a daily pain in the ass instead of a convenience it was supposed to be. Now iTunes refuses to download new episodes on a daily basis via the Store-> \"Check For Available Downloads...\" menu item. I have to instead navigate a series of maze iTunes Store screens to reach the list of new episodes not already on my computer. It went from a quick two clicks to a maze of eight steps that I'd never tell my tech savvy friends they should do themselves.\r\n\r\nI've contacted Apple Support for this issue, they were never of any help. Actually found they are now telling people this is the \"normal behavior going forward\" for iTunes Season Passes, but was never told this myself. See: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4917538?start=90&tstart=0\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm filing this bug. I think that's wrong and absolutely short sighted and should be fixed for those of us who want the old functionality. Also why keep the menu option if it does nothing?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Select the Store Menu Bar Item\r\n3. Select \"Check For Available Downloads...\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect iTunes to \"Check For Available Downloads\" and then download all my new episodes it has waiting for me since I last used that option.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt simply says to me, every day, \"All purchases have been downloaded for this Apple ID\". That's an out right lie.\r\n\r\nTo download all the new episodes from the previous day I have to go and navigate a series of maze iTunes Store screens to reach the list of new episodes not already on my computer via the Purchases pages in iTunes. Here are the steps for that process:\r\n\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Select the iTunes Store item on the iTunes left side menu which I have enabled on ITunes 11\r\n3. Select \"Purchased\" under Quick Links on the right\r\n4. Select \"TV Shows\" on the top of the Purchased Page\r\n5. Then select \"All TV Seasons\" on the left menu.\r\n6. Then select the \"Episodes\" segment control in the middle of the screen.\r\n7. Change the \"Sort By\" control on the right of the screen to \"Most Recent\" \r\n8. Then select the Download icon for each new episode I don't have, somedays this can be 3 new episodes from the previous day requiring one click for each item. \r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot that shows the \"All purchases have been downloaded for this Apple ID\" showing over a list of two new episodes for that day being shown in my Purchases page. \r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/image/0e3i1Z463Z2E\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis never used to happen in the past, and for a while only happened with some TV Shows. Now it happens for all my content. It's quite annoying.  \r\n\r\nPeople have also said it's because I should be streaming new content on my Apple TV now, not using iTunes. I think this is the wrong solution to the problem. I have a bandwidth cap at my house, I don't want to have to download a 1GB HD TV show each time someone wants to watch it. I'd rather download it to my computer and then stream it to any computer in the house. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot that shows the \"All purchases have been downloaded for this Apple ID\" showing over a list of two new episodes for that day being shown in my Purchases page. \r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/image/0e3i1Z463Z2E"
