    description: "Summary: NSMetadataQuery returns 0 results, even when I know there are files in iCloud, and I can see there are files in the ubiquity container using NSFileManager.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Have files in iCloud in an appropriately entitled app.  Run NSMetadataQuery to look for files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I expect to see the metadata query return information about the file in iCloud.\r\n\r\nActual Results: NSMetadataQuery finishes gathering with 0 results, and never posts any did update notifications.\r\n\r\nRegression: The same code would have the NSMetadataQuery returning the appropriate results in iOS 5, 6, and iOS 7 beta 1 through 4.  Beta 5 seems to have broken it.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
