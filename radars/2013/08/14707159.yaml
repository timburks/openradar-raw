        Summary:
        I use full-screen mode heavily, especially with Xcode; each project gets made full-screen, for example. When I quit Xcode, it saves the state of each open window (as it should). When I relaunch it, it restores these windows (as it should). However, if I switch to another one of its (open, full-screen) project windows after it has launched, the window drops out of full-screen mode, which means that I have to immediately put it back into full-screen mode.

        This comes up a lot as it can be crashy sometimes, I might have to restart for system updates, and I have to switch between stable and beta Xcode versions several times a day depending on what project I might be working on at the moment.


        Steps to Reproduce:
        0. Ensure that you have the “Close windows when quitting an application” setting in System Preferences > General at the default (unchecked) state, and that you do not launch Xcode with the shift key (or whatever other chord it is that causes it to ignore the previously-opened windows).
        1. In Xcode, open several projects.
        2. Make each of them full-screen with the widget at top right or the shortcut (⌃⌘F).
        3. Quit Xcode.
        4. Relaunch Xcode.
        5. Switch to each of the project windows in Mission Control.


        Expected Results:
        I expected that the windows would remain full-screen.


        Actual Results:
        Instead, as you switch to each window, it drops out of full-screen mode altogether.


        Regression:
        This is not a regression; it has occurred in every version of Xcode that supported full-screen mode, as far as I am aware.


        Notes:
        Xcode is otherwise a pretty good citizen as far as full-screen mode is concerned. Thank you for your hard work in making that be so!
