    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n* Compile against the iOS 6 SDK\r\n* Use\r\n\r\n- (void)enumerateAttributesInRange:(NSRange)enumerationRange options:(NSAttributedStringEnumerationOptions)opts usingBlock:(void (^)(NSDictionary *attrs, NSRange range, BOOL *stop))block\r\n\r\nto parse an attributed string\r\n* If the string has newlines in it you'll start getting ranges that have incorrect starting positions\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Open the attached project in Xcode 4.6.3\r\n* Run the app on an iOS 7 device\r\n\r\nThe app has two UITextViews. The first one has text that's stored in the XIB. The second has text generated in code. Each one is parsed for white-on-black text and the resulting string in placed in the text field below it.\r\n\r\nEach method reproduces the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you add a space before the newline (and change the range) in the code-generated string you'll get the expected result.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect attributed strings to be parsed correctly wether or not they contain newlines.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAttributed string aren't parsed correctly on iOS7 devices.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI think this was introduced in iOS 7 b5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample project at http://cl.ly/QrPN"
