    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of OS X allowed the system audio to continue playing during voice recognition (Dictation). OS X 10.9 *always* mutes the system audio during dictation which breaks at least one important use-case.\r\n\r\nFor example, Dictation is useful to automatically record a textual transcript of a YouTube video as it plays.\r\n\r\nIn my scenario, I develop my own special type of voice recognition software and *need* to be able to perform Dictation while the system audio remains un-muted.\r\n\r\nI understand that, by default, muting the system audio results in much better dictation accuracy but muting should be an option (in System Preferences -> Dictation & Speech, a user defaults database, etc.).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Start playing a YouTube video in Safari\r\n2) Activate Dictation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should have the option to mute or not mute the system audio during Dictation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll system audio is muted for the duration of a Dictation session.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
