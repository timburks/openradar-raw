    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode has the option to disable auto-insertion of the closing curly bracket \"Automatically insert closing brackets (\"}\")\" and an option named \"Automatically balance brackets in Objective-C method calls\". The latter suggests that closing square brackets will not be inserted, however it doesn't work unless a second option is also unchecked. Plus it is not obvious that this same setting also disabled insertion of the closing parenthesis.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Xcode, open an Objective-C .m file\r\n- Open Xcode Preferences > Text Editing and uncheck \"Automatically balance brackets in Objective-C method calls\" and check \"Enable type-over completions\" (whatever this means)\r\n- Write an arbitrary method in the .m file\r\n- Start typing: \"NSString *str = [[NSString alloc\" OR \"if (flag\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- No auto-insertion happens\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Two closing square brackets (1) or a closing parenthesis (2) are automatically inserted\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWhen unchecking the other option, \"Enable type-over completions\", of which I have no idea what it does, the closing brackets and parenthesis do NOT get inserted, as was desired. It's not obvious why this option is dependent on the other type-over option and it's also not obvious that it also applies to parentheses."
