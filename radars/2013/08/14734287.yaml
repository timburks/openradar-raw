    description: "Summary: When I'm presenting the UINavigationController modally using UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal, the navigation bar is placed higher during this animation (I suppose at the height of the status bar) than it's expected position, thus creating the black space between the root view controller's view and the bar itself. Then, after the animation is finished it instantly hops into the right place.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Present UINavigationController modally using UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal from any view controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Top navigation bar is displayed properly during the animation.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Top navigation bar is placed too high, creating the black space between the root view controller's view and the bar itself.\r\n\r\nNotes: This is the behavior I'm getting in Simulator, haven't had a luck to test on a real device yet. I'm attaching a screenshot of animation and the source code."
