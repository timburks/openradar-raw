    description: "Summary:\r\nviewWillDisappear: method are not being fired when doing popToRootViewControllerAnimated: immediately followed by presentModalViewController in AppDelegate. applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\nWriting the code yourself:\r\n1) Create a UINavigationController and make it possible to push two view controllers on it. Implement the viewWillDisappear method in the two view controllers\r\n2) In AppDelegate.applicationDidBecomeActive: insert the following code (the functionality/kind of \"loginViewController\" does not matter):\r\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\r\n{\r\n    [(UINavigationController *)self.window.rootViewController popToRootViewControllerAnimated:NO];\r\n    [self.window.rootViewController presentModalViewController:loginViewController animated:NO];\r\n}\r\n3) Open the app. Ensure that two view controllers are pushed on the navigation controller. Press \"home\" button. Reopen the app. See that viewWillDisappear is not called on the view controllers.\r\n\r\nUsing my attached sample project:\r\n1) open the attached sample project and run the app in the simulator\r\n2) Tap the \"dismiss\" button\r\n3) Tap the \"next\" button\r\n4) Press the \"home\" button\r\n5) Open the app again in the simulator\r\n6) See that viewWillDisappear is not called\r\n\r\nRunning step 2-6 multiple times, you will see that a \"resource\" variable is incremented in viewWillAppear: without ever being decremented in viewWillDisappear:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The viewWillDisappear: and viewDidDisappear: methods to be called on ViewController2\r\n\r\nActual Results: The viewWillDisappear: and viewDidDisappear: methods are _not_ called on ViewController2\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: I filed this incident to Apple Developer Technical Support, who concluded that this was a bug. It has follow-up number 600048489. \r\n\r\n15-Aug-2013 09:27 AM Johan Vase:\r\n'ModalViewCauseMissingViewDisappearCalls.zip' was successfully uploaded"
