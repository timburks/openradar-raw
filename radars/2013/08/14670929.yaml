    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nYesterday I've been using the Twitter app, browsing my timeline when abruptly the app hang for one or two seconds and abruptly take me on the home screen.\r\nAt first I think that is because of a iOS 7.0 beta crash, but when I see the App icon on the springboard I see the blue dot for the updated App, so I think that if an app wants to autoupdate the system don't check if is in use and proceed to instal the update right away causing the app to crash.\r\n\r\nIf the app is a bank accounting app this behavior is dangerous because can compromise the user actions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse an app when an update is available and wait until the sytem finish to install it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf an app is in use (even if is performing background tasks) the system only download the update but wait to install it when the app is in an idle state.\r\nEven better, if an app is downloading or installing an autoupdate, signal it to the user with an animation like the one when the app is installing for the first time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf you are using the app when the autoupdate is available the system installs it whit out tell anything to the user and making the app to crash.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI can't really state that every time an update is available the app crash if in use because is kinda hard to using an app in the exact moment when an update is available."
