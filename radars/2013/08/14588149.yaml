    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have a webpage/webapp that links to an app URL scheme like mailto: tel: or user app URL's, the url's work fine in Safari, however if you add the page to homescreen and the page has <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /> then the URL scheme links no longer work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNavigate to http://daps-apps.com/iconical/webapp.html\r\nClick the links in safari and they work great.\r\nAdd the page to your home screen then launch it.\r\nClick the links and only the http://google.com link works, the other url scheme's don't work.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRunning a page as web-app-capable should not affect behaviour compared to running it in safari"
