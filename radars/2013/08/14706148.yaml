    description: "Summary:\nAs captured by the attached screenshot, in OS X Mavericks DP5 the Dock currently casts a shadow on windows beside it. \nI find this shadow to be extremely distracting while working: I find that I constantly look over to the side to see what is covering my document. Please do not cover the frontmost window with such a shadow, or at least consider drastically reducing its size.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n- Set the Dock's position to Left or Right by right clicking on the separator item on its right side.\n- Zoom or resize a window such that it is displayed beside the dock. E.g., zoom an Xcode project window such that it covers the screen's visible frame.\n\nExpected Results:\n- The Dock should behave like the menu bar, i.e., while it is on a higher logical layer than application windows, it should not cast a shadow on normal windows.\n\nActual Results:\n- The Dock's highly visible shadow covers window contents.\n\nRegression:\n- The Dock did not have such a shadow on 10.8.\n\nNotes:"
