    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Pages v4.3, using COMBINING ENCLOSING SQUARE doesn't actually enclose the adjacent character.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Type the character to be enclosed (in my case, it was simply the letter X).\r\n2. Using the Special Characters palette, insert a COMBINING ENCLOSING SQUARE.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe X should be enclosed in the square.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt's not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt works in TextEdit.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee the attached screen capture to see the differences between TextEdit and Pages."
