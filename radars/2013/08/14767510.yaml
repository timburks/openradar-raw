    description: "When I report a crash log, I have to:\r\n1. Plug in my device\r\n2. Find the crash logs\r\n3. Upload them into radar\r\n\r\nI would like for radar to have a crash database of crashes from my appleid, obtained by the \"Automatically send crash reports to apple\" feature, for fast lookup and I wouldn't have to get up and plug in the device.\r\n\r\nIt would enhance the bug reporting experience and more people would turn the automatic upload on, and apple would benefit from it."
