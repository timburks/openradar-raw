    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing five-fingered pinch gesture in iOS 7 release 5 makes iPad freeze/hang into unrestartable state. Once in that state, the iPad cannot be powered down. If Find My Phone is turned on, the iPad cannot be restored using iTunes. Using the remote wipe feature, then restoring from backup is the only way I have found to recover the iPad once in this state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch an application (I reproduced it using Facebook and Twitter). \r\n2) Use the five-fingered pinch gesture, but stop short of minimizing all the way, then spread fingers.\r\n3) Repeat until the iPad freezes, leaving you with a wallpaper screen that has no icons or status bar.\r\n4) Cry, then be glad you have a recent backup.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApplication is minimized and home screen is displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWallpaper is displayed (and animated), with no icons or status bar. Home button is nonresponsive. Power button is nonresponsive. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs on an iPad (A1396), running version 7.0 release 5 (11A4449a)\r\nWas not tested on other devices.\r\n \r\nNotes:\r\nAfter the initial (accidental) occurrence, I reproduced it twice. Video is attached."
