    description: "09-Aug-2013 10:07 PM Kevin Chen:\r\nWhen using the combined URL and search bar in Safari 6.x, Safari often submits the URL field when I don't press Return. It also refuses to submit the URL when I do press return.\r\n\r\nIf the two cases were averaged and applied to each URL query, the URL bar would work perfectly! :-P\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nReproducible since Safari 6's first release. Most recently tried to reproduce with Safari 6.0.5 (8536.30.1).\r\n\r\n09-Aug-2013 01:41 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nPlease provide a screen recording displaying the issue and attach the output of 'sysdiagnose' collected while the problem is occurring.Â  'sysdiagnose' can be triggered by pressing Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shift-Period, and it takes a few minutes to complete. When ready, the output will automatically be revealed in a Finder window (or it can be manually retrieved from /var/tmp)\r\n\r\n13-Aug-2013 09:21 PM Kevin Chen:\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nSince I can't reproduce the bug reliably, how important is it that sysdiagnose runs while the problem happens? Is it OK if I run sysdiagnose immediately after it happens?\r\n\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n16-Aug-2013 04:40 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
