    description: "Summary: The hidesBottomBarWhenPushed property of UIViewController doesn't work as expected for apps built with iOS 6 SDK (not beta SDKs for iOS 7). The animation is weird when hiding the bottom bar (e.g. a tab bar).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project with the TabBar template in Xcode 4. Add a UINavigationController to the FirstViewController. Add a button on the FirstViewController and set its action to push a new view controller. (please see the sample code attached)\r\n\r\n2. Run the demo on an iOS 7 beta 5 device.\r\n\r\n3. Press the button, back from the UINavigationController, pay attention to the animated view transitions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The animation works exactly the same as on an iOS 6 device.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The animation looks weird. The FirstViewController is sliding down from the bottom.\r\n\r\nSample code: http://cl.ly/QgZZ"
