    description: "28-Aug-2013 06:45 PM Jared Sinclair:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIView animation blocks triggered by UIKeyboardWillShow or Hide notifications get stuck in an infinitely-repeating animation loop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the sample project on an iOS 7 beta 6 device or simulator (the bug is more reliably reproduced on an actual test device for some reason).\r\n2. Tap the UITextView to show the keyboard and update the user interface layout.\r\n3. Tap the table view to dismiss the keyboard and revert the user interface layout to the default state.\r\n4. Observe the bizarre animation loop.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user interface animation should only run once.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation repeats infinitely.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have ensured that I am using the proper UIViewAnimationOptions, and am overriding the inherited options as well. This same code runs normally on iOS 6.1. Here is a link to a video of the behavior in case you are not sure what I am referring to: \r\n\r\nVideo: http://cl.ly/R4hd\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will attach an Xcode project in a moment. In the meantime, here is a direct link to a zipped version of the project: \r\n\r\nProject: http://cl.ly/R519"
