        Summary:

        Internet connectivity seems to drop. The Wifi menu item shows full signal strength and still appears to be connected. Other devices continue to work, so the connection hasn't actually dropped, but applications appear to lose their ability to communicate with the outside world, and report that the connection is down.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Seemingly random.

        Expected Results:

        Full connectivity (unless there is actually a problem with the router/modem).

        Actual Results:

        Occasional drop outs.

        Regression:

        This is happening on the one device where I have Mavericks installed (15" mid 2010 MBP). It doesn't seem to happen on my iOS devices, or a Mac Mini running OS X 10.7.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
