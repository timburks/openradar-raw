    description: "Summary: Apple IDs should sync custom dictionaries and autocorrect learning across all iOS devices attached to that account\r\n\r\nNotes: When someone buys a new iOS device to replace their old one, when they setup their phone with their new device, their custom dictionary learning shouldn't have to start over again."
