    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen creating new files from a template Xcode inserts the current date in the header. This date is localized according to the users system settings. This is not the preferred behavior as even non-english users tend to keep source code non-localized.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd, as this format is non-ambiguous to every user).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new source file in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNon-localized date in header.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLocalized date in header."
