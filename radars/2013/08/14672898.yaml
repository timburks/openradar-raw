    description: "Whenever I leave Xcode5 running overnight, it consumes all available memory and in the morning I find a system warning telling me I need to close all applications.  It started in DP4 and continues in DP5.\r\n\r\nSometimes Xcode is already non-responsive when I arrive at my desk.  This morning it was consuming 209% of CPU and rising (this is an 8 core system) but as soon as I tried to quit it the CPU usage dropped to 0.4% and it became non-responsive shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nI am attaching screenshots of the warning window and of Activity Monitor showing the memory usage.  And here is what I get when asked to report the error:\r\n\r\n(crash report removed for brevity)."
