    description: "14-Aug-2013 07:03 PM Nicholas Heer:\r\nSummary:\r\nSomeone at Apple must have the original PSD for the Tiger Aqua desktop picture kicking around their computer. The one bundled with Tiger (attached) has some nasty JPEG artifacts, and it would be so spectacular if a version could be released (or bundled, hidden somewhere in the darkest depths of /System/Library/) in 10.9 Mavericks.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe – just maybe – the original PSD was drawn with vector shapes, so it could be resized to a retina-friendly size.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n14-Aug-2013 07:03 PM Nicholas Heer:\r\n'Aqua Blue-439707.jpeg' was successfully uploaded"
