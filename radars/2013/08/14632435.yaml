    description: "Summary:\r\niOS 7 Music app shows the wrong album art for music. I have iTunes Match turned on on my device, I only have one album that is in the 'Various Artists' section. The album art for this row in the table is not the album that I have downloaded to the device. Instead it's of a different album I have in the 'Various Artists' section (still in the cloud).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Turn on show all music in Music settings\r\n- Open iOS 7 Music App\r\n- Download an album (from iTunes Match) to device which is 'Various Artists' It may be best to *not* download the first in the list.\r\n- Turn off show all music in Music settings\r\n- Return to iOS 7 Music App\r\n- Select 'Artists'\r\n- Scroll down to 'Various Artists' \r\n- Tap on 'Various Artists' to see the artist that you have downloaded with the correct album art. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- If you only have one album downloaded that's part of a list of many (like Artists -> Various Artists), the main artists tab should display the album art that you have downloaded. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The album art of an album that I have *not* downloaded is displayed. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is on a Verizon iPhone 5 (white) Model: MD655LL/A with music that was downloaded to iPhone from iTunes Match. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that this is pulling the first album from those in iTunes Match and displaying that. See screenshots."
