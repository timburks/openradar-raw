        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        I am trying to add in-app purchase options but only the Free Subscription type for Newsstand apps is shown. iTunes Connect is also very slow and sessions time out very quickly. It just timed out in less than 10 seconds from logging in.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        Create an app and try adding in-app purchases

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        I should have an option to add more types of purchases.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        It only shows Free Subscription as an option.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
