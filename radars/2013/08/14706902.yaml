    description: "Summary: When opening an app that has some sort of static splash screen, or in this case, one that hangs on splash screen at start and crashes back to springboard it is possible to activate icon wiggle edit mode by holding on the screen.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: The app being used to discover this bug is a finance app called Pocketbook.  \r\n1. Launch pocketbook, (or app with static splash screen)\r\n2. Tap and hold anywhere on screen.  \r\n3. The app view will back out to springboard, albeit with a black background, and icons will be in wiggle edit mode.  \r\n\r\nExpected Results: I don't believe anything should actually happen when performing these steps.  \r\n\r\nActual Results: As stated, the app will back out to springboard, albeit with a black background, and icons will be in wiggle edit mode."
