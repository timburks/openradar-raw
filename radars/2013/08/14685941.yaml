        Summary:

        While preparing for the next iOS release it is not possible to deploy these apps to the App Store, obviously because they are pre-release versions. But I think it would be extremely useful to allow developers to deploy their apps to an App Store for beta apps where other developers could install them and integrate with them. Since apps now interoperate more and more this would be most helpful.

        Steps to Reproduce:


        Expected Results:

        In iOS 7 there is a new Inter-App audio feature. If app developers could put their apps into the beta App Store they could try out how their app works with other apps which use that feature and work out issues in advance of iOS 7 being released to the general public.

        Beyond testing for compatibility it would also help with iterating on ideas and features prior to the iOS 7 release so that what is released to the regular App Store is as refined as possible on the first day.

        Apps which are ready could even be immediately transitioned to review for the regular App Store and made available immediately.

        Actual Results:

        Developers have to wait till iOS 7 is public before submitting apps to the App Store and then have to rush to test for compatibility with other apps.
