        Summary:
        iTunes 11 introduced a great iOS feature--Up Next. It would be great to be able to have Up Next from iTunes sync via iCloud to iOS, so it is easy to pick up music playing from any device. Perhaps this could be an iTunes Match only feature (as all music in your iTunes library would be available on your iOS device that way).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Add songs to Up Next in iTunes.
        2. Open the music app on iOS.

        Expected Results:
        An Up Next button should be there with your Up Next list, synced from iCloud.

        Actual Results:
        Up Next isn't there.
