    description: "Summary:\r\nNSObject needs something like a \"name\" or \"nickname\" property so while debugging you can quickly and easily see which object of type *whatever* that is being, say, passed into a method.\r\n\r\nSo you can quickly look at the debugger and know which, say, UITableView was passed in.\r\n\r\nFor example a class that is the Data Source of 2 tables.\r\nBreakpoint in say, numberOfRowsInSection, and easily know which table it is.\r\n\r\nYou can use memory addresses (dirty and have to lookup each one) or tags but then its, \"ok this is tag 5, now what was 5 again... *search*\"\r\n\r\nInstead you see: NickName = DingleBeary and know what one you are working with.\r\n\r\nThis property could be skipped in Release builds as to reduce memory and such.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n*Just one example of many*\r\nCreate 2 different UITableViews, create a class that is the DataSource of both tables.\r\nPlace a breakpoint in:\r\n-(NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section;\r\n\r\nYou dont easily know which TableView you are using.\r\n\r\nAdd a tag when creating table and then at this point you have to lookup which object was which tag.\r\nCompare memory addresses: dirty and takes time\r\nLook at other properties: Unreliable\r\nUse a Category: You have to create a category for everything as creating a category on NSObject wont be used if you create an internal object.\r\nLook at description: Objects like UITableView don't have descriptions that help:\r\n<UITableView: 0x14100e00; frame = (0 0; 0 0); clipsToBounds = YES; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x11e43c50>; layer = <CALayer: 0x11e59390>; contentOffset: {0, 0}> \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to quickly and easily see what object you are looking at.\r\nYes you would have to assign that NickName value when creating the object, but it would save SO much time in debugging\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't QUICKLY and EASILY what objects are what for internal objects such as UITableView\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nShould be the same in AppKit"
