    description: "26-Aug-2013 12:02 PM Ricardo Borelli:\r\nSummary: iOS 7 isn't respecting the appearance proxy for UIBarButtonItem. The first time you see the button, it has no background but when you tap it to go back and then return to the view controller, it show the background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse this code to set the background image when app starts:\r\n[[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonBackgroundImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"my-image\"]\r\n                                                      forState:UIControlStateNormal\r\n                                                    barMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Every back button has the desired background.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No background the first time a back button is displayed but appears after it's hit by the user.\r\n\r\nRegression: It worked until iOS 6.1 but not working since the iOS 7 Beta 1.\r\n\r\nNotes: The API isn't marked as deprecated, so it should be working.\r\n\r\n[edit: Duplicate of 14589283]"
