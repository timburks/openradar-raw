    description: "Summary:\r\nSetting scrollEnabled to NO while animating & scrolling prevents the view from receiving further touch events, even though scrollEnabled is set to YES later on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run sample project on device.\r\n2. Scroll textview & don't lift finger.\r\n3. Press \"Animate textview\" button at top left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animation block sets scrollEnabled=NO and the completion block sets scrollEnabled=YES. One expects that scrolling would work after the completion block executes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text view doesn't seem to respond to touch events. I added a target-action pair to its gesture recognizer for logging, and it stops outputting messages after the bug is triggered.\r\n\r\nDoing introspection in the debugger, the text view's scrollEnabled and userInteractionEnabled property are both set to YES. Also, the text view's pan gesture recognizer is still enabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project attached."
