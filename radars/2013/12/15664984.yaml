        Summary:
        After playing back a TV show, the "Unwatched" view still shows it as unwatched. One has to switch out to Movies and back to TV Shows to see it as watched.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Switch to TV Shows using the source list at the left of the window
        - Make sure the "Unwatched/Shows/Genres/List" selector is set to "Unwatched"
        - Select an unwatched show with the blue dot next to it.
        - Double-click it to watch it
        - As the end credits come on (~ 30s from the end) click the close box

        Expected Results:
        The episode I just watched should no longer have a blue dot next to it (it's OK if it's still visible, so I can e.g. easily find my place if I've watched one of several episodes from the same show, but strictly spoken since this is the Unwatched view, I also wouldn't be surprised if the show just disappeared). This makes it hard to find the next episode to watch when watching several episode. This is exacerbated by bug 15664965 ("next" button for TV shows doesn't work).

        Actual Results:
        The TV show's episode is still in the list, still has a blue dot next to it as if I had never watched it.

        Regression:
        This used to work in the original 2-column "Unwatched" view of iTunes 11.0

        Notes:
        Switching to "Movies" view and back to "TV Shows" exposes that the episode actually *was* marked as unwatched, but the UI just doesn't update.
