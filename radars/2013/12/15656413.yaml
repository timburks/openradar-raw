        Summary:
        Internet Accounts PrefPane can't add new Twitter Accounts despite correct credentials

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open System Preferences > Internet Accounts, try to add an existing Twitter account. Click on the Twitter Item in the right hand list. (The + button is curiously disabled in the left hand list.) Enter Twitter handle and the correct password to create the account.

        Expected Results:
        The account should be created, provided the correct password is given.

        Actual Results:
        Despite giving a correct password which works in other applications and the twitter website, Internet Accounts.PrefPane refuses the password as incorrect.

        Regression:
        Fully Restarting OS X allows the Account to be created with the same password that did not work before.

        Notes:
        The new password item is saved to Local Items.keychain instead of the user selected default keychain.
