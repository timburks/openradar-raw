    description: "Summary:\nItems on Local Keychain do not have Access Controls\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nHave any item on the Local Items Keychain. Get info, go to the Access Control Tab. \n\nExpected Results:\nAccess Controls should be available to control which applications/processes/binaries do get access to a certain keychain item.\n\nActual Results:\nAccess controls are not available for any item on the Local Items keychain. It seems that ANY application can get unlimited access to any item on this keychain.\n\nRegression:\nThis only applies to the unwanted Local Items keychain that is forced on users of Mavericks which removes a user's control over their private data stored in Keychain files.\n\nNotes:\nTrust is the OS X keychain architecture is also removed. I do not trust OS X anymore to keep my data in .keychain files secure anymore."
