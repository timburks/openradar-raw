    description: "Summary:\r\nPlayer 1 starts a new GKTurnBasedMatch and invites Player 2 to play. Player 1 sends a GKTurnBasedExchange to Player 2. Player 2 receives the GKTurnBasedExchange and views the match by tapping the push notification. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that this match is not added to Player 2's list of active games. The match does not appear in Game Center and the match is not returned via the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler:. The match only appears in Player 2's list of active games when Player 2 starts his first turn.\r\n\r\nReceiving a GKTurnBasedExchange should add the match to the players list of active games so that the match is not lost.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a GKTurnBasedMatch with 2 or more players\r\n2. Player 1 sends a GKTurnBasedExchange request to Player 2\r\n3. Player 2 taps the push notification to load the App / join the match.\r\n4. Player 2 opens Game Center and looks at the list of active games and does not see the match.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayer 2 should see the match in the list of active games. Also, the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler: should display the match when called in the app if Player 2 is authenticated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayer 2 does not see the match in the list of active games or with the GKTurnBasedMatch class method +loadMatchesWithCompletionHandler:.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7"
