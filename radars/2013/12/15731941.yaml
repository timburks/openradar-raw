    description: "Summary:\r\nTiling-based performance issues when using MKOverlayRender, in particular when allowing the user to interact with & manipulate the underlying MKOverlay instance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project on device (not simulator)\r\n2. Pan rapidly on the map view to expand/contract the radius of the overlay.\r\n3. Tap the button at the bottom of the screen to toggle between using MKOverlayViews and MKOverlayRenderers.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe redraw performance of the MKOverlayRenderer should match the MKOverlayView when panning quickly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen using the MKOverlayRenderer, there are visibly noticeable tiling-based redrawing issues, particularly when the map view is zoomed out to display larger regions.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot a regression issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue only occurs on devices, and not on the simulator. For the moment, the MKOverlayView is usable, but itâ€™s deprecated as of iOS7, and I need a solution that will be usable & supported in future versions."
