    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes downloads iOS apps, iOS system updates and iBooks content all of which can be locally cached in OS X Server 3's Caching server. However iTunes does not take advantage of a local Caching server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload an iOS app (new or update), an iOS system update, or an iBook using iTunes. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes would download iOS apps, iOS system updates and books via a local Caching server when available. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes downloads iOS apps and books directly from Apple servers even when a Caching server exists on the network."
