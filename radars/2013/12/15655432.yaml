    description: "Summary:\r\nAs documented, with iOS7 a dimming effect is applied when UIPopoverControllers are presented. But this causes confusion when passthroughViews are used, as the dimmed screen actually remains interactive. It would seem better not to dim when passthroughViews is set, or to allow the developer to decide whether dimming should occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstantiate a UIPopoverController. Set its passthroughViews to existing views. Present the UIPopoverController using any of its present methods.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe area around the popover is dimmed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen should no be dimmed as the area outside the popover is actually still interactive (due to passthroughViews being set)."
