        Summary:
        On investigating the +[NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifer:] method I found that the documentation stated that it was available in iOS 4.0 and later. In use I found that it could not be used prior to iOS 7, and indeed appears as a newly added method in the 6.1 to 7.0 API Diffs (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/iOS70APIDiffs/)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Use +[NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifer:] in code.
        2. Build code and find that it generates a "no known selector for class" error.
        3. Check documentation for API availability.

        Expected Results:
        4. Documentation should state "Available in iOS 7.0 and later."
        5. Facepalm, and use -[NSLocale initWithLocaleIdentifier:] instead.

        Actual Results:
        4. Documentation actually states "Available in iOS 4.0 and later."
        5. Scratch head for a while, before Googling for answers and discovering it's actually a new method in iOS 7.0
        6. Facepalm, and use -[NSLocale initWithLocaleIdentifier:] instead.

        Regression:
        N/A
