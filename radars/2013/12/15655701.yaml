        Summary:
        The forcing of Local Items keychain breaks the functionality of SSH Agent.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have the passwords to your SSH private keys on any keychain but the “Local Items” keychain. try to ssh with a connection that makes use of a private key whose password is on said keychain.

        Expected Results:
        SSH-agent should just take the password from any keychain, and ask the user to unlock said keychain if necessary.

        Actual Results:
        SSH prompts for the password of the keychain instead of using the one on the keychain like it used to.

        Regression:
        This is new in OS X 10.9 and likely related to keychain corruption observed in 10.9 as well as the forcing of the Local Items keychain upon users.

        Notes:
        This leads to a de-facto denial of service for SSH servers that do not allow any other login method than keys. Since the need for entering the private key password is actually what SSH-agent should prevent.
