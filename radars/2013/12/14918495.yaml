    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to read the advertised packets sent from a iOS CoreLocation iBeacon (e.g. from AirLocate source code) but CoreBluetooth doesn't give the those packets on the CB delegate method: centralManager:didDiscoverPeripheral:advertisementData:RSSI:\r\n\r\nIs this the way iBeacons are designed to be or is this a BUG?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and run AirLocate source code from Apple on a iDevice\r\n2. Set the app to run as an iBeacon\r\n3. On another device, setup a basic CB configuration to start scanning for BLE devices\r\n4. Breakpoint on the delegate centralManager:didDiscoverPeripheral:advertisementData:RSSI: and look for the contents of the advertised packets. You'll not see information about the beacon (like: encoded UUID/Major/Minor/Power).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSee on the advertisementData dictionary of the delegate something like: kCBAdvDataAppleBeaconKey = <d0ae5d86 aba444d6 869b0c3b 1c73f5ee 000c0001 c5>;\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI only see the on the dictionary information about the channel and if its connectable.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 beta 1 to 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
