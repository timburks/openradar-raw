    description: "Xcode supports basic waypoint GPX files for simulating a change in location over time. It would be great if Xcode also supported certain extra elements in the waypoint tag on GPX files. For example, supporting \"ele\" would allow easier testing of apps that need to track altitude.\r\n\r\nThe biggest value would be support for the \"time\" element. Supporting time would allow location updates to be delivered with respect to the time present in the GPX file's waypoints. That would allow for apps to simulate frequent or infrequent updates and big a better approximation for testing velocity.\r\n\r\n1. Load a GPX file into Xcode\r\n2. Set it in the scheme for location simulation\r\n3. Observe the updates delivered once per second regardless of time\r\n4. Observe the value of the altitude property on the CLLocation's being set to zero\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the updates respected the waypoint's time and elevation settings.\r\n\r\nXcode doesn't respect the waypoint's time and elevation settings."
