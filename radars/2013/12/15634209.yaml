    description: "[Note: I've redacted certain identifying information that was provided to Apple.]\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI live on [xx] avenue. I'm tired of typing things in OS X applications which have autocorrect only to have them turn into living on \"ramen\" avenue. \r\n\r\nWhen I went to look for a user setting to slow how quickly autocorrect fires, there wasn't one. I believe that there should be.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0) Have snowstorm in [xx]. \r\n1) Open Messages to IM a friend about said snowstorm.\r\n2) Type \"i saw people sliding around out on [xx]\" and then hit the spacebar. \r\n3) Notice \"[xx]\" *immediately* switches to \"ramen\", giving the user no opportunity to decline the correction. \r\n4) Open keyboard preferences.\r\n5) Notice that there is no way to adjust how quickly autocorrect triggers. Be disappointed. \r\n6) (optional) Begin to crave ramen. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither slow autocorrect's roll or give me some way to adjust how quickly autocorrect triggers myself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is just the most ridiculous example of this behavior - Autocorrect is far, far too aggressive in Mavericks for my tastes by default. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.0."
