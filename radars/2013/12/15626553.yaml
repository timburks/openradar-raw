    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the user takes a series of photos in Burst Mode, those photos are not accessible from the ALAssetsLibrary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a series of photos with Burst Mode.\r\n1. Using an ALAssetsLibrary, enumerate all ALAssetsGroups.\r\n2. In the group where you’d expect to see the Burst Mode photos—probably the Camera Roll—enumerate the assets.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe enumerated assets will include each individual Burst Mode photo.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe assets include one photo from the entire set.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBurst Mode is new in iOS 7, so N/A.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI posted a code sample on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/q/20485152/105431"
