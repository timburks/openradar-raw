    description: "In this Demo Project there is a PNG and JPEG represenation of the same PDF file (added for reference) which are Combined into a single Tiff thanks to the Combine Artwork Resolution Artwork build setting.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Lempel-Ziv and Welch encoding is not doing a great job with JPEGs, as the size of the resulting j-gruene.png file is as big as the size of the PNGs, which, obviously, defies the purpose of using a JPG.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/stuffmc/rdar-combine-highres"
