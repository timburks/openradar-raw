    description: "I run Calendar under Mavericks, and also Outlook (Mac) 2011. My recurring invitations wind up duplicated, generally when there are exceptions.\r\n\r\nI wind up with one version that shows all the invitees without an indication of whether they have accepted. The second invitation shows the same invitees with \"!\" in front of them, and acts as though I am the originator of the invite (I can add new people, and if I try to delete the invite, it wants to notify them all).\r\n\r\nI am connecting to the same Exchange server with iOS, and do not see duplicates. I also do not have duplicates in Outlook.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, non-invites get duplicated as well. Again, it seems to be when there are exceptions."
