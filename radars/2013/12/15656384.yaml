        Summary:
        Items cannot be moved between keychains in Keychain Access.app

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Select any item in Local Items keychain and drag it onto another keychain, like the once beloved and now ignored login.keychain. An Error prevents you from doing so captivating items in the unwanted Local Items keychain.

        Expected Results:
        A user should always be able to move items from any keychain to any other keychain provided they can enter the needed credentials to unlock said keychains.

        Actual Results:
        Items from Local Items.keychain cannot be moved to other keychains by dragging them to another keychain to safe them but remove them from Local Items keychain.

        Regression:
        This was not a problem in former OS X releases because luckily there was no Local Items keychain yet.

        Notes:
        Copying and item and pasting an item via the contextual menu seems to work sometimes.
