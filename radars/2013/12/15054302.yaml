    description: "Currently, <UIDynamicItem> does not know what behaviors it belongs to. This makes it very complicated to add and remove items. Specifically, it is difficult to remove a UIView because you must also keep track of all the behaviors that the UIView may be part of. Since these behaviors may be added at various places in the code, this makes it difficult to maintain separation of concerns.\r\n\r\n<UIDynamicItem> should include the following methods:\r\n\r\n@property (readonly) NSArray *behaviors;\r\n- (void)addBehavior:(UIDynamicBehavior *)behavior;\r\n- (void)removeBehavior:(UIDynamicBehavior *)behavior;\r\n- (void)removeAllBehaviors;\r\n\r\nIdeally these should be @required."
