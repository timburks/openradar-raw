    description: "Summary:\r\nConfigure a UITextView with a dark keyboard. Assign it an inputView. When the UITextView becomes first responder, the inputView shows up. However, if you then set the inputView to nil and resign/become first responder again, the light keyboard is shown.\r\n\r\nThis bug was discovered by trying to build a mechanism to switch between a custom keyboard and the standard keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a UITextView with a dark keyboard.\r\n2. Set the text view's inputView to a UIView instance.\r\n3. Call becomeFirstResponder on the text view.\r\n4. Observe the keyboard\r\n5. Call resignFirstResponder on the text view.\r\n6. Set the text view's inputView to nil.\r\n7. Call becomeFirstResponder on the text view.\r\n8. Observe the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 4 we should see our custom UIView instance.\r\nIn step 8 we should see a dark keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 4 we do see our custom UIView instance.\r\nIn step 8 we actually see a light keyboard, not a dark one.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 beta 6\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile the errant light keyboard is displayed, backgrounding the app with the Home button and then foregrounding the app will cause the dark keyboard to appear. The dark keyboard then works properly for that text view. This happens both on device and the simulator.\r\n\r\nA sample project exhibiting the problem is attached. You can use the segmented control to cause the problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis problem occurs on:\r\n- iPad 2\r\n- iPhone 4\r\n- iPad simulator\r\n- iPad Retina simulator\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur on:\r\n- iPhone 3.5\" simulator\r\n- iPhone 4\" simulator"
