    description: "Using the CARemoteLayerServer and CARemoteLayerClient API doesn't work when linking against the 10.9 SDK. The same application does work when linking against the 10.8 SDK. It may be that there is a bug, or it may be that there are different or more strict expectations by the 10.9 SDK.\r\n\r\nIt appears that passing -NSWindowHostsLayersInWindowServer=NO to the server process is enough to make things work with the 10.9 SDK. It this the supported way to solve the problem, or is there a more public API for this?"
