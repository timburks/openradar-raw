        I use behaviours to create secondary windows by opening named tabs in their own windows (e.g. a "Debugger" or "Build results" window). When I close the project, I sometimes close the actual project window first, and only then the "Debugger" window. The result is that when I re-open that project in Xcode, I get only the debugger window, which is missing the toolbar, project navigator etc.

        I would like a way to designate a window (or tab) as the one to re-open when the project is opened. E.g. by specifying "Open Tab 'Main' in new window" in a "when project opens" behaviour. This way I'd guarantee that the main window always comes back with all the toolbars and sidebars I want.

        Alternately, the concept of an actual main window that, when its close box is clicked, will first close all other "subordinate" windows would be even better. But anything to ease the pain.
