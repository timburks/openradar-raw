    description: "Kasper Munck16-Dec-2013 01:26 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn an iOS application where the UINavigationBar's backgroundImage is customised globally using [UINavigationBar appearance], an MFMessageComposeViewController presented modally will have a transparent rectangle instead of a \"To\" textfield. This will turn into a black rectangle when the modal presentation of the MFMessageComposeViewController is completed.\r\n\r\nThis has two unfortunate consequences:\r\n\r\n1) It is not possible to change or select the receiver of the message.\r\n\r\n2) A black rectangle is a huge UI flaw that confuses the user and destroys the UX.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new 'Single View Application' project for iOS.\r\n\r\n2. Link with MessageUI.framework. \r\n\r\n3. In viewDidLoad of ViewController.m, use [UINavigationBar appearance]'s setBackgroundImage:forBarMetrics: to change the global backgroundImage of the UINavigationBar class.\r\n\r\n4. In Main.storyboard drag a UIButton onto ViewController's view.\r\n\r\n5. Create an IBAction for that button. Named it presentMessage:\r\n\r\n6. In presentMessage: present an instance of MFMessageComposeViewController modally.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen presenting a MFMessageComposeViewController after changing UINavigationBar's backgroundImage using the appearance proxy it is expected that the MFMessageComposeViewController's UINavigationBar's backgroundImage will appear changed, while all other UI elements will appear as unchanged.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMFMessageComposeViewController's UINavigationBar's backgroundImage is changed, but now - instead of a \"To\" textfield - a transparent rectangle (appearing black when the modal presentation is completed) appears instead.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on an iPhone 5S with iOS version 7.0.4 (11B554a).\r\nSample app is built with iOS SDK 7.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhether the UI of OS controllers such as MFMessageComposeViewController should be modified or not is likely to be subject of discussion. However, modifying UINavigationBar's appearance should not have incidental consequences such as the one outlined here.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n-"
