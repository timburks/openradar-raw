        Summary:
        Keychain.app does not show .keychain files contained in application bundles.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have any application that contains keychain files intalled on your system. For example iStat Server.app by bjango.com. Open Keychain Access.app and scan the list of keychains on the left hand side for this item.

        Expected Results:
        These .keychain files shoud be displayed in Keychain Access.app to give the user the full information which encrypted credentials are stored on their system.

        Actual Results:
        Any .keychain files contained in application bundles are hidden from the user.

        Regression:
        This may lead to unwanted true evaluation by the system security frameworks hidden from the user.
