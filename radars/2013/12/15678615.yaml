    description: "Summary:\nGame Center is very practical to use, I do not have to set up a Game server backend myself and data gets synced, add friends system-wide and benefit between games. Everything is wonderful. But the most requested feature of my turn-based game is text-chat, and there is no chat api. So, in the end I need to create a custom backend for my game anyway. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create turn-based game\n2. Get requests for chat\n\nExpected Results:\nBeing able to implement chat with Game Center api's.\n\nActual Results:\nNo chat available in the framework.\n\nRegression:\nDoes not occur when you have your own server backend, but I believe one of the problems Game Center tried to solve is the hassle of having a server backend."
