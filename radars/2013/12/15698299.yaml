    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextField has two methods, -drawPlaceholderInRect and -drawTextInRect. The documentation for both of these methods states \"If you want to customize the drawing behavior for the text, you can override this method to do your drawing.\" However, this is not true. UITextField draws text differently internally, and these methods are in fact never called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a subclass of UITextField.\r\n2. Override -drawTextInRect, as per documentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-drawTextInRect is called, and your subclass's implementation is invoked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe method is never called. After trying to debug it, resort to Google and find both an Apple Discussions and a Stack Overflow post saying that the method is never called. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nUITextField Class Reference: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextField_Class/Reference/UITextField.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006888-CH3-SW33"
