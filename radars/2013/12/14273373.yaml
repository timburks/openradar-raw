    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niCloud Keychain can sync passwords between mac and iOS, but there's no way to automatically reuse the password of a web site on the mobile app for the same web site.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nA user logs to amazingwebsite.com on Safari on his mac. His password is saved in the Keychain, and synced on iCloud.\r\nLater, he installs and launches the amazingwebsite app on his iPhone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHis login and password should directly be available without him having to type it again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nHe has to type his login and password again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor security reasons, the credentials may not be available directly for the app, but might need a confirmation from the user, as is done currently on the mac when app B (e.g. Xcode) wants to use a password written by app A (e.g., Safari).\r\n\r\nOf course, the larger story is that we need a way to specify that the website and the app are the same entity. I'm not sure what would be the best way to match app IDs and website certificates, but aren't we doing something similar for push notifications?"
