    description: "Summary:\r\nSometimes, when controlling a remote Mac using Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.1, the cursor slows down or disappears.  Moving the cursor out of the ARD window to the computer doing the Control session does not solve the problem (though clicking will sometimes reveal menu items if the cursor is there, and hot corners do work).  The only solution seems to be to wait it out - the problem seems to resolve itself after a minute or two.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  Install Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.1 admin on your computer, and 3.7.1. on your client.\r\n2.  Start a Control session from your computer to the client computer.\r\n3.  At some point, while using the machine, the above problem might occur.  The issue is intermittent.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Control session should work without problems.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes, you temporarily lose control of both the remote computer and your own.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.0, Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI have observed this occurring on both the the admin and client computers running OS X 10.9.0 and Apple Remote Desktop 3.7 and 3.7.1.  I am using local administrator accounts on both the admin and client computers.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
