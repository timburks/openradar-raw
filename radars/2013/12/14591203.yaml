    description: If you pull up the camera icon on the lock screen most of the way up, and then quickly close it ("slamming" it shut), it can bounce so forcefully that the camera app opens. While "physics" may suggest that slamming a door closed might cause it to bounce open, this clearly is not the user's intent. The camera app should never open in response to dragging the camera sheet down, no matter how forcefully.
