        Summary:
        When in the "Unwatched" view for TV shows, the right-click menu's "Mark as Watched" and "Mark as Unwatched" menu items do not work.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Select "TV shows" in the source list at the left of the iTunes window
        - The "Unwatched/Shows/Genres/List" selector across the top is set to "Unwatched"
        - Select a TV show that is unwatched (case 2: half-watched)
        - Right-Click the selected show to bring up the contextual menu
        - Select "Mark as Watched" (case 2: Select "Mark as unwatched")

        Expected Results:
        The show should lose its blue dot (case 2: Change its half-blue-half-white dot to a full blue dot).

        Actual Results:
        Nothing happens. Even switching from TV Shows to Movies and back doesn't fix the issue.

        Regression:
        This used to work in the old two-column "Unwatched" view that came with iTunes 11.
