    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen subscribing to the keyboard notifications (e.g. UIKeyboardWillHideNotification), the notifications userInfo dictionary contains a value for the key UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey which is an integer. According to the documentation that integer is supposed to be apart of the UIViewAnimationCurve enum, but it is not. Instead, it seems to be some \"private\" curve that isn't listed in either the UIViewAnimationCurve enum or the UIViewAnimationOptions enum, which is the enum used for the options: parameter in any block-based UIView method, such as animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completions:. \r\n\r\nThe result is that, the value returned by UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey cannot be turned into a corresponding entry in the UIViewAnimationOptions enum, so to use the keyboard curve to animate a view alongside the keyboard, we must use the non-block-based UIView animation methods.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTargeting iOS 7.0, on Xcode 5.0.2.  Running in the simulator and on the device\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRelated to rdar://14872290\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
