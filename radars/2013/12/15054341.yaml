    description: "See also 15054302, 15054316.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a view to a view hierarchy, it is necessary to keep track of all of the default behaviors so that you can add the new view to each behavior. This makes it difficult to maintain separation of concerns.\r\n\r\nUIView should be able to automatically add behaviors to its new subviews (see also 15054302 for the concept of adding behaviors to items rather than items to behaviors). An implementation would be -addsBehaviorsToSubviews: which takes an NSArray of behaviors."
