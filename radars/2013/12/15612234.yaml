    description: "Summary:\nRestarting music in radio sometimes crashes iOS.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Music app. \n2. Select 'Radio' and play any station.\n3. Pause the station. \n4. (optional I think) lock the screen or possibly just go to the home screen.\n5. (optional with 4) unlock the screen and return to the Music app - or pull up notification center.\n6. Play the station some time later (most recently, I probably waited 5 or 10 minutes before starting again. I've probably tried to resume a station hours later after pausing sometimes).\n7. Immediately see white screen with Apple logo in center, then after several seconds I can unlock the screen. \n\nExpected Results:\nThe music should start playing again, or worst-case drop me back to the main Radio view.\n\nActual Results:\niOS appears to crash.\n\nRegression:\nI think this has been happening since the iOS 7 betas. I tested then on an iPod Touch. Now I'm using a new iPhone 5S. It has happened across all point releases I believe.\n\nNotes:\nIt seems to me that Radio/Music app is particularly likely to crash the OS."
