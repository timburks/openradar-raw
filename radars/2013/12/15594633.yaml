    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Core Data Programming Guide in the iOS and Mac SDKs is intended to explain the fundamentals of usage Core Data. However, it has not been updated to discuss important features introduced in iOS 5 and OS X 10.7:\r\n\r\n- concurrency patterns other than thread confinement\r\n- using another managed object context as a parent context\r\n\r\nWithout treatment of these new features, the Core Data Programming Guide is not describing the best solutions to concurrency issues. Other authors' books are required. Apple's official docs should be more complete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCore Data Programming Guide https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001200-SW1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 5.0 and higher, OS X 10.7 and higher\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
