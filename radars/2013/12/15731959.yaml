    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS - arm64, the following code:\r\n````\r\n[@YES objCType]\r\n````\r\nreturns `\"c\"`, as it does on arm32. However, `BOOL` is now typedef'd as `bool` (the C++ bool), and the signature of methods returning a `BOOL` is now `\"B\"`.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, [NSNUmber objCType] for BOOL-based NSNumbers should now return \"B\".\r\n\r\nThis is especially an issue when using NSInvocations. See for example this workaround in OCMock : https://github.com/erikdoe/ocmock/commit/77400c22b5bafd8aaaa75f90a1d997838204577a"
