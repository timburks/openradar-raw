    description: "Summary:\r\nYesterday on the page https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/ has appeared the iOS adoption statistics of the devices that are connecting to the App Store, it would be nice to see a similar take for OSX to know how to manage older versions support.\r\n\r\nP.S. I put this Bug report here because there is not a section for the developer site.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/\r\n2. Look the left column on the page\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUnder or above the iOS adoption pie chart there would be another one for the OSX adoption.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the iOS adoption pie is shown under the App Review Status for both platforms."
