    description: "Printing from iOS is a great feature, but currently there is no way to select the intended orientation of the document when sending to an Airprint-capable printer.\r\n\r\nAn intuitive solution would be to use the device orientation as the determining factor. If the user is viewing the document in device portrait orientation, print the document in portrait orientation. If in landscape, print in landscape."
