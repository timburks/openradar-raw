        Summary:
        Clicking the "Next" button in the black player overlay of a TV episode plays back the wrong episode.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Switch to the TV Shows section using the source list at the left of the window.
        - The "Unwatched/Shows/Genres/List" selector is set to "Unwatched"
        - You have several unwatched episodes of various TV shows. In my case, from top to bottom: 1 episode of Haven, 11 Episodes of Scandal, 2 Episodes of Castle, 12 Episodes of Covert Affairs, 1 Episode of The Returned, 1 Episode of Top of the Lake, 1 Episode of The Fosters, 1 Episode of The Goodwin Games, 2 Episodes of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, 1 Episode of Fairly Legal, 1 Episode of Chloe King, 1 Episode of Downton Abbey (and more, but they're not visible).
        - The shows where several episodes are unwatched are collapsed into one.
        - Uncollapse Castle (2 episodes) and play the older episode first.
        - At the end, click the next button (>|)

        Expected Results:
        The second episode of Castle should play

        Actual Results:
        It plays an episode of "Almost Human", one I've already watched, and which isn't even onscreen.

        Regression:
        This did not happen with the old two-column version of the TV Shows section (I think that was the one in iTunes 11.0)

        Notes:
        This also seems to happen with the regular "Shows" view.
