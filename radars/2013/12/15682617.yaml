    description: "Chrome uses a NSOpenGLContext drawing to an NSView to draw its content. On a Retina Macbook Pro, when using the integrated GPU, animated pages will sometimes shake and stutter.\r\n\r\nI've narrowed this down to a system synchronization issue. In particular, if I add glFinish before calling CGLFlushDrawable/flushBuffer, then the correct contents appear.\r\n\r\nThis issue is new on 10.9, and only happens when using the Intel GPU (it goes away when switched to the discrete GPU). I have only seen this on the retina Macbook Pro.\r\n\r\nThe issue reproduces more easily with lots of GL windows open. I've attached a program to help in this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Google Chrome\r\n2. Compile and run the attached lots_of_gl_windows.mm (instructions are in the source file).\r\n    - This is not strictly necessary, but make it will make the repro happen more often.\r\n3. Run Chrome from the command line with the flag --disable-gpu-driver-bug-workarounds (so, the line \"/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --disable-gpu-driver-bug-workarounds\" will do it).\r\n4. Open 5 Chrome windows, and navigate to http://www.webkit.org/blog-files/3d-transforms/poster-circle.html in each of them\r\n5. Make sure that the Chrome windows are on top of the other OpenGL windows (cycles through the windows a few times)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe animations should be smooth (if perhaps slow).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animations shudder and flicker as the front and back buffers are swapped inappropriately.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9, Build 13A603"
