    description: "Summary:\r\n1. Scenario:\r\nSetting up an Xcode bot for a project to provide nightly/daily builds using the \"Run periodically\" schedule setting.\r\n\r\n2. Problem:\r\nIt will run and (depending on the project post-archive action) possibly upload a new build every time even though there are no code changes since the last successful build. So this build is basically a waste and rather confuses.\r\n\r\n3. Feature request:\r\nAdd an option to skip the run if the the previous run was performed successfully and there are no code changes from pulling the repository compared to the previous successful run."
