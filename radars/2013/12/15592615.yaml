        Summary:
        When building a mac application and setting the app target's signing to Developer ID and choosing my individual team account (I have 2 teams) Xcode fails to sign the application with the proper cert. Instead it signs with "Mac Developer" despite it not being set to Developer ID.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open/Create a Mac application project
        2. Select app target
        3. Set signing to Developer ID
        4. Set team to one of 2 teams
        5. Build

        Expected Results:
        The application would be signed with "Developer ID: Jeremy Knope"
        CodeSign output: Using code signing identity "Developer ID Application: Jeremy Knope"

        Actual Results:
        Application is signed with "Mac Developer: Jeremy Knope"
        CodeSign output: Using code signing identity "Mac Developer: Jeremy Knope (VE97W3FZ6Z)" and provisioning profile "Mac Team Provisioning Profile: *" (5C47E900-EB9D-45F0-984B-E6718AD3DC26)

        Notes:
        I can work around this by choosing None for team and canceling the dialog that asks me to check off teams. It then signs with Developer ID which is what's in build settings in both cases. Having a team chosen seems to just ignore the build setting.
