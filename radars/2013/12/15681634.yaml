        Summary:
        TimeMachine Preference Panel does not show encryption status

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Expected Results:
        The status if the backups are encrypted or not should be readily available.

        Actual Results:
        It's not possible to find out if backups are encrypted from the PrefPanel.

        Regression:
        This hasn't been available in 10.8 either
