    description: "In Mavericks, when using hdiutil to mount a password protected sparsebundles, the prompt for password is passed from the command line to the GUI. However, if you are working without a GUI, as in through an SSH session, there is no way to pass the prompt, and hdiutil fails with an internal error.\r\n\r\n1. Create a password protected sparsebundle\r\n2. Connect via SSH\r\n2. Use the hdiutil command to attach the password protected sparsebundle\r\n\r\nThe shell should prompt for the password to be entered and then mount the sparsebundle.\r\n\r\nhdiutil does not prompt for a password and instead returns an internal error. \r\n\r\n10.9.1 build 13842"
