    description: "This is NOT _expected_ behavior. What good is the selection of a default keychain if OS X does ignore it?\r\n\r\nI, the user, does NOT WANT to sync credentials EVER via iCloud. I simply do not trust this mechanism for numerous reasons. I also have legal implications that prohibit the use of this. For these reasons I absolutely have to make sure to NEVER EVER sync ANY details via iCloud from my Keychain. OS X Mavericks makes this an unwanted risk by breaking the default keychain selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I as a user select a keychain as the default keychain than any newly created item should be added to this default keychain and this keychain only. NOT any other keychain and absolutely NEVER to a keychain that will (or potentially will) be synced to iCloud servers located or operated by a US company potentially affected by the patriot act.\r\n\r\nThis clearly IS a serious bug since a preference set by the user (the default keychain) is not respected by the software. Also, this has been working correctly since OS X 10.0.0 for each and every release of OS X. This misbehavior has been introduced with OS X Mavericks and is to be fixed.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations13-Dec-2013 11:52 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nThis is the expected behavior. We use the Local/iCloud keychain (depending if iCloud keychain sync is on), so that we can sync credentials.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with them.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nSummary:\r\nInternet Accounts.PrefPane stores Passwords on wrong keychain\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Keychain Access.app and chose any keychain as your DEFAULT keychain OTHER than Local Items.keychain.\r\nOpen System Preferences > Internet Accounts and creaty any new system wide account. Enter the necessary credentials to create the account.\r\nAfter successful creation check Keychain Access.app for the newly created password item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew Password Items should always be created in the user set default keychain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe new items gets created in Local Items keychain.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not happen before 10.9 where the setting for default keychain was respected. This is caused by the unwanted Local Items keychain.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI can't trust my credentials to a system that stores Items on a likely internet synched keychain located in the USA."
