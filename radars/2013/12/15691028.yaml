    description: "Proposed API:\r\n\r\n- (void)setRegion:(MKCoordinateRegion)region animated:(BOOL)animated completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion\r\n- (void)setCamera:(MKMapCamera *)camera animated:(BOOL)animated completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion\r\n\r\nThe API should behave similarly to the UIView animation APIs where a completion handler would be called as soon as the mapView region or camera animation has been finished. The `finished` BOOL parameter would indicate whether the region animation was finished (YES) or interrupted by some user interaction (NO).\r\n\r\nThis would be particularly useful to programmatically select annotations after a region update. This way we could make sure that the callout is always visible (and the mapView scrolled prior to displaying the callout if not)."
