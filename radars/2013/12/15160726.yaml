    description: "dispatch_io_create_with_path() accepts a cleanup block and a queue to run it on. It is legal to pass nil for the cleanup block (and this would seem to be a common behavior). But if you pass nil as the queue, it crashes, even though there is no block to dispatch.\r\n\r\nIf this queue is used for something other than the cleanup block, the documentation needs to be updated to indicate this."
