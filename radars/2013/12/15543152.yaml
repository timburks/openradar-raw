    description: "Summary:\r\niOS doesn't always download app updates from a local, available, and otherwise functional Caching server.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Automatic download of apps is off\r\n2. New app updates were detected by iOS while I was way from home  - the 2.0.1 updates for keynote, numbers and pages\r\n3. I decided to wait to download and install until I was back at my home office where I have a Caching server\r\n4. When I got back to the home office, a 4th update was detected - Dropbox 3\r\n5. I tapped Update All\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS would download all applicable software and content from a Caching server when on a network with a Caching server. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccording to logs on the Caching server, only Dropbox 3 was downloaded and stored in the Caching server"
