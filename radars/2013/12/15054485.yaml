    description: "If an item has multiple behaviors, it is difficult to control the relative strengths of the attachments and thus where the object will come to rest when influenced by other behaviors (attachment, gravity, snap, push). The -frequency property indirectly influences the strength of the attachment, which is not intuitive, and is difficult to control well.\r\n\r\nAttachment (and snap) behaviors should have a stiffness in newtons/point, and behave according to Hooke's law.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear exactly what \"frequency\" represents, but in principle it should be computable from stiffness for backward compatibility. -frequency should then be deprecated; it is a difficult property to use correctly."
