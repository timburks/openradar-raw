    description: "Summary:\r\nIt would be nice to have the possibility to delete old iOS Simulator from the download page inside Xcode Preferences... pane.\r\nI think its not an edge case because if a developer decide to stop the support for old iOS version (like drop iOS 5 support when iOS 7 came out) it's useless to retain the iOS 5 simulator downloaded with the old version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 5.0.2\r\n2. Click cmd+, to open the Preferences... pane\r\n3. Click the Downloads tab\r\n4. Download all the simulators in the Components section\r\n5. Wait till all downloads are complete\r\n6. Try to delete the iOS 6.0 Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAside the iOS 6.0 Simulator checkmark there is a Delete button to allow the developer to remove the unused Simulator\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to delete a Simulator from inside Xcode, only a wacky and unsupported system that consist to find the package inside the app bundle and delete it. (With all the proper consideration for the Mac App Store version)"
