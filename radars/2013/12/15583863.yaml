    description: "Summary:\r\nRestoring auto-renewal subscription IAP using [SKPaymentQueue restoreCompletedTransactions] returns the restored transactions via the - (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions method.\r\n\r\nThose restored transactions has the transcation.transactionState property set to SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored, hence as documented the transaction.originalTransaction property includes the original transaction made to purchase the subscription with transaction.orginalTransaction.transactionState = SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased. \r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe property transaction.originalTransaction.transactionReceipt will be set with a receipt I could validate. \r\nActual:\r\ntransaction.originalTransaction.transactionReceipt is set to NIL and the transaction.transactionReceipt is set and seems to be valid.\r\n\r\nHowever the documentation states about the transactionReceipt property that \"The contents of this property are undefined except when transactionState is set to SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased.\", and here the transactionState is set to SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored, while the receipt for the orginalTransaction which is in SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased state is set to NIL.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in iTunes Sandbox mode, with iTunes test users, not sure about production.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Setup an app with IAP capability.\r\n1. Define and purchase an Auto Renewal Subscription IAP\r\n2. Call [SKPaymentQueue restoreCompletedTransactions] \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.3\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
