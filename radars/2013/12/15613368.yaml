    description: "Andrea Govoni 09-Dec-2013 01:32 AM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nI bought a lot of apps but the Purchased section of the App Store app on my iPod touch is always blank. When I open the Purchased page I always see these lines in the Console log:\r\n\r\nDec  9 01:09:55 EVA-05 AppStore[16459] <Warning>: JS: its.sf6.Bootstrap.init: Initialize\r\nDec  9 01:09:56 EVA-05 AppStore[16459] <Warning>: JS: ERROR: ITSExceptionHandler: {message:\"TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object\", url:\"https://se.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/B64A/dv6-storefront-p6bootstrap.js\", lineNumber:\"1812\"}\r\n\r\nI can correctly see my purchased apps on other devices or with iTunes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the App Store app on the iPod touch.\r\n2. Tap the Updates tab.\r\n3. Tap the Purchased button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should see the list of apps I purchased.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see a blank page.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6.1.5 (10B400)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPod touch (4th generation) 64 GB\r\nSerial number DJ6H700PDT78\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'iPod log.log' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations 05-Mar-2014 05:04 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested the following:\r\n\r\ntested on iPod touch  4th gen with 526 apps in the purchase history and it loaded successfully. As I would scroll down the list it would load more and more apps.\r\nAndrea are you still able to reproduce?\r\n\r\nPlease provide your response or results by updating your bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Govoni 06-Mar-2014 07:34 AM\r\n\r\nYes, I'm still able to reproduce this issue with iOS 6.1.6 (10B500).\r\nI purchased way less than 500 apps, so the problem should not be related to the total number of apps to display.\r\nWhen I access the Purchased view, I see the \"Loadingâ€¦\" notice for 2 or 3 seconds, then it disappears but the view remains empty.\r\nI can perform any diagnostic test you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations 25-Mar-2014 11:17 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has provided the following:\r\n\r\nYou should just contact AppleCare about the issue.\r\n\r\nSince this is an itunes account issue (not a development issue) please please contact AppleCare for account related issues using the following link http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/\r\n\r\nThey are better equipped to troubleshoot specific account related issues and gather necessary information.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
