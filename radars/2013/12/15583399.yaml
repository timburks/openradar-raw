        Summary:
        EKEvent use readwrite property to calculate its startDate which is read/write property

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Create NSMutableSet and EKEvent
        2. Add event to that set
        3. Change the startDate of the event
        4. Check if the event is in the set. ([set containsObject:event])

        Expected Results:
        Checking return YES

        Actual Results:
        Checking return NO

        Regression:


        Notes:
        The hash value ([event hash]) is changed after I set the startDate of the event. From the NSObject's hash method documentation. The object's hash should not calculated from the mutable property.
