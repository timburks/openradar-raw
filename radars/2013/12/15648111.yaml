        Summary:
        Reachability Sample Code Incorrectly Reports WWAN connections as WiFi Connections

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Visit the sample code here:
        https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/Listings/Reachability_Reachability_m.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007324-Reachability_Reachability_m-DontLinkElementID_8

        Inspect lines 218 and 232 in Reachability.m to see the error. A NetworkStatus value is being cast to a BOOL, which causes WWAN connections to be reported as WiFi connections to the loss of integer precision.

        To fix the bug, change the lines from:

        BOOL returnValue = NotReachable;

        to instead read:

        NetworkStatus returnValue = NotReachable;
