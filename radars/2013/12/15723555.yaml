    description: |-
        Take a battery-powered Mac, unplug it from the power supply. You see a black bar filling the entire battery, indicating it is fully charged, or a bit of red bar indicating it needs charging.

        Plug in the power supply: The entire indicator is replaced with a power plug symbol.

        There is no way to tell now whether the power supply has been plugged in long enough that is fully charged. The only way to tell is to actually open the menu or turn on "Show Percentage" and waste menu bar space.

        Please add an indicator that shows that the power supply is plugged in *and* the battery fully charged. E.g. by turning the battery solid black with a white power plug icon at 99% or higher.
