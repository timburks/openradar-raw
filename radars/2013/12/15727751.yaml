    description: "Summary:\r\nI cannot load images beyond the thumbnails for ALAssets in the shared Photo Streams.\r\n\r\nIs there any documentation or API's that I can call. I see no support on forums. https://devforums.apple.com/message/929558#929558\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Iterate over the albums using ALAssetsLibrary\r\n2. Try to load a fullscreen or full-size image from the library from the photo stream shared albums.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to request images and get a notification when they are downloaded, so I can add them to my app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot request image downloads and can only disable shared Photo Stream photos, or I can load the \"aspect ratio thumbnail\" which doesn't provide full-screen viewing.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 and Xcode 5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
