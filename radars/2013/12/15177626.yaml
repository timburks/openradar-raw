    description: "We provide a product that includes an inventory of software installed on managed Macs. In order to determine the current applications installed, we use \"system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType\" to request the application list from Spotlight.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to determine whether the results of system_profiler are up-to-date. In particular, we are unable to determine whether mdworker has completed its first pass. This leads to excessively short lists when mdworker is still processing, which in turn leads our automated system to attempt to install dozens of packages that are already installed.\r\n\r\nSpotlight is able to determine this status in order to display the little dot in the magnifying glass search icon. We are trying to determine the same status. Alternatively, we would like a different way to determine the currently installed packages without undo impact on the filesystem (i.e. rescanning it as mdworker is already doing).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\nmdutil -E /\r\nsystem_profiler SPApplicationsDataType"
