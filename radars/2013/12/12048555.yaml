    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen dragging files between projects in Xcode, Xcode will almost always insert the new reference as an absolute path into the target project. This is almost never what you want, and leads to many build breaks on shared projects.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate two projects in a workspace.\r\nDrag one project into another so you can make it a dependency\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nProject should be referenced relative to group\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nProject is referenced as an absolute path\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis happens in many cases such as dragging libraries from one project to another or sharing files between projects."
