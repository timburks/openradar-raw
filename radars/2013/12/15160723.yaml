    description: "It should be possible to create an NSData from a dispatch_data without copying, even if the dispatch_data has multiple regions. The existence of -enumerateByteRangesUsingBlock: suggests that this functionality exists in some form internally, but it is not exposed in the SDK.\r\n\r\nObviously NSMutableData would need to make a copy, just like in initWithData:.\r\n\r\nThe natural name for this would be -initWithDispatchData:."
