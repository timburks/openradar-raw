    description: "David Spector23-Nov-2013 03:55 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAt present it is not possible to determine the earliest date for data available via CMStepCounter.  The best you can do it ask for \"now - 7 days\"; however any moments for which data isn't available returns zeros. \r\nHowever this could be either \"we never recorded anything for this moment\" (i.e. phone is literally brand new with <7 days of data) or \"this is a moment with a step-count of zero\" (i.e, user wasn't moving).\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem for fitness apps recording periodic step data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should be able to ask for the earliest data for which data is available and get back an NSDate; this would allow developers to optimize imports and not have to manually weed out or coalesce holes in data or magically account for a device that is either brand new or recently reset.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7.0.x\r\n\r\nNotes:"
