    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently it is possible, through the use of workarounds documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19386835/1751969, to generate .gcno and .gcda files for iOS Apps.  It is then possible to use tools such as http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php to generate a code coverage report from the .gcno and .gcda files.\r\n\r\nIdeally Xcode Server Bots would generate .gcno, .gcda and a beautiful coverage report to go along with the integration report currently available as of Server v3.0.1 (13S2015).  That is, Xcode server, as part of the integration report, should include a test code coverage report, as unit tests are valuable, but more valuable when you can actually visualize the lines of code that are not exercised by unit tests.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure Xcode Server Bot to perform continuous integration on a project with at least one unit test.\r\n\r\nA code coverage report is not visible in the integration report.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA beautiful code coverage summary report at the top level of the integration report and the ability to click into the code coverage summary and visually identify areas where code is not covered by the existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt its possible to generate .cgno and .gcda files, and it is possible to run lcov as part of a post-test script, however the resulting html report is not accessible via the Xcode Server web interface.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2, Server 3.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also the workarounds necessary just to generate .gcda files http://stackoverflow.com/a/19386835/1751969\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
