    description: "Summary:\r\nOn 10.9 (I don't have a 10.8 machine handy to test against), clicking the dock icon for an application with windows on multiple spaces does not update keyboard focus cycling between spaces.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open two TextEdit windows. (I've also reproduced this with Preview, Safari, and Terminal.)\r\n2. Place each window on a separate space.\r\n3. Focus the content area (for other applications, some widget that takes keyboard input like the address bar in Safari) in each window.\r\n4. Activate one of the windows. Keep the content area focused.\r\n5. Click the TextEdit dock icon to switch to the workspace containing the other window.\r\n6. Hit some keys.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keystrokes get sent to the newly active window (or perhaps no window at all).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keystrokes appear in the old window on the previous space. Depending on the application, this may be invisible or it may switch you back to the space containing the old window.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
