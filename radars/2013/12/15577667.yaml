    description: "Summary:\r\nCannot mount DiskStation while connected to Airplay display.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Switch on DiskStation.\r\n2) Connect to AirPlay display via Apple TV 3rd generation.\r\n3) Click on DiskStation in Finder. MBP tries to connect.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMBP connects and I should see the folders shared on DiskStation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJumps back to previously selected folder immediately after selection of DiskStation.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDoes not depend on AirPlay mode (mirror / extend).\r\nUsed MacBookPro 15\" retina (fall 2013). \r\nUsed Wi-Fi to connect MBP to network.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt works after disconnecting from AirPlay display."
