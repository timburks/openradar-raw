        Summary:

        At the bottom left of the view is a button labelled "Repeat/Repeat Song/Repeat Artist", I'd like to request that a fourth option labelled "Repeat Album" be also added to this list of options.

        Currently the only way to achieve this function is to:
        1) press the back button
        2) tap "More"
        3) tap "albums"
        4) scroll to the desired album name
        5) tap on the desired album name
        6) tap on any track to begin playing
        7) tap "Repeat Album" whilst in the "Now Playing" view.

        A single button which would achieve the same functionality is clearly preferable to this 7-step procedure.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Launch the "Music" Role of MobileMusicPlayer.app then tap the "Artist" button at the bottom of the app, then select an artist then playing any track by that artist, then finally opening the "Now Playing" view.

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
