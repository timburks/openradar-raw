    description: "Summary:\r\nThis causes the UINavigationController and its child view controller to become unresponsive and require the app to be killed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any app with a UINavigationController. My screenshot was from using the Mail app.\r\n2. Navigate so that there are 3 view controllers in the UINavigationController.\r\n3. Tap the back button then immediately swipe to go back. I had to use two hands as the swipe needs to happen immediately after the tough up on the back button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UINavigationController should pop the current view controller. It should then display the previous view controller in the stack and the UINavigationBar should have the correct title and buttons for this view controller.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UINavigationController pops the current view controller and shows the previous view controller. However, the UINavigationBar still displays title and buttons for the popped view controller (se attached screenshot). Also, the buttons in the UINavigationBar unresponsive along with any controls in the view controller.\r\n\r\nThe long on the device contains the following:\r\nDec 16 15:41:38 Craigs-iPhone MobileMail[12995] <Warning>: nested pop animation can result in corrupted navigation bar\r\nDec 16 15:41:39 Craigs-iPhone MobileMail[12995] <Warning>: Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions for <MailboxPickerController: 0x16dd89e0>.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)"
