    description: "When you select a photo in the iPad Contacts app’s photo picker, there is a redundant “Use” button at the upper right of the popover, in addition to the “Choose” button at the bottom right.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts.app.\r\n2. Tap the + button to add a contact.\r\n3. Tap the add photo button.\r\n4. Choose the “Choose Photo” option.\r\n5. Tap an album.\r\n6. Tap a photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe only thing in the nav bar is the “< Saved Photos” back button. There is no “Use” button, because the “Choose” button at the lower right serves this function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere are two extra things in the nav bar: a “Use” button that doesn’t show up on the iPhone version of this screen, and a mostly-invisible “Choose Photo” label that was reported in rdar://15656463.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\niOS simulator 7.0 (463.9.4.2)\r\nReproduced on iPad 3rd generation and the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe “Use” button does the right thing. The problem here is that it shouldn’t be there at all, since it already has the same “Choose” button as the iPhone for this screen.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/Swj0"
