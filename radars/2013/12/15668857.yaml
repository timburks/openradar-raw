        Summary:
        In the "Unwatched" view of the TV Shows section, clicking the top entry of a batch of grouped episodes plays the last one.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Navigate to "TV Shows" using the sidebar.
        - Ensure the "Unwatched/Shows/Genres/List" selector has "Unwatched" selected
        - Pick a show that has 2 or more unwatched episodes. They are displayed as a single entry (for the newest episode) with a "1 of 2 v" next to it in blue.
        - Click the blue text so you can see all episodes
        - Double-click the top entry in the list.

        Expected Results:
        I'd expect it to play the first episode.

        Actual Results:
        It plays the last (oldest) episode.

        Regression:
        This did not occur in 11.0's different-looking 2-column "unwatched" view.

        Notes:
        Why does it show the newest show? Shouldn't it show the show that will be played, which is usually the oldest show (because one would want to watch TV show episodes in chronological order. When you double-click the collapsed compound entry, it correctly plays the oldest show. When they are uncollapsed, this behaviour makes no sense either, because the oldest show is visible as a separate entry that can be double-clicked to play it. But there is no such separate entry for the newest episode.
