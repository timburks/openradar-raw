    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen searching for Q&A document inside the new documentation in Xcode 5.0.2 (5A3005) the search suggestion for the term \"Q&A\" Append the relative title on the right, but if we select show all results we are presented only whit an anonymous sequence of obscure \"Technical Q&A QAXXXX\" without other useful information until we open the relative link.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Open the Documentation and API Reference page\r\n3. Search for the term \"Q&A\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the Show more result is selected the relative lists of results presented must have the Q&A title appended somewhere to know at least the general argument of the document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs seen in the screenshots attached the results are pretty useless for try to see at a glance if there is some unknown Q&A for some general argument"
