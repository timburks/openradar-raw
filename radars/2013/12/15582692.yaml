    description: "Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Without Sandboxing (turn it off!), when at this breakpoint, you can type in the Debug Console (e.g. p result)\r\n- With Sandboxing, you can't! It seems the PowerBox or something is having \"control\" over the Keyboard Input.\r\n\r\nSome times when debugging/running is stopped, Xcode doesn't have a Keyboard anymore either, until I restart it."
