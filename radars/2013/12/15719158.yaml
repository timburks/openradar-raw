    description: "Summary:\r\nSituation:\r\nI was deploying 20+ TVs for hotel. Every hotel room has wi-fi with unique SSID. I wanted to use Apple Configurator to do following:\r\n1) skip intitial setup (set language, reporting to Apple)\r\n2) set TV name\r\n3) install unique configuration profile for one TV at the time with payload contaning single wi-fi configuration. \r\n\r\nDuring configuration TV was NOT connected to network and wi-fi configured with profile was NOT in range. We hadn't ethernet connection available during deployment nor did we wanted to install any other wi-fi configuration profiles except the one for room wi-fi.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nWhen I was configuring AppleTVs (see conf_error.png attachment) I encoutered this error: \"Unable to configure Apple TV. The Apple TV could not complete its network cofiguration\". Apple Configurator installed profiles, set TV name but it did NOT skip setup because of this error. \r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n1) Complete initial setup with  Remote (we had to connect each TV to a screen)\r\n2) Connect TV to network via ethernet cable (we did not have that option available when deploying)\r\n3) Deploy TV in range of wi-fi network configured in profile (not possible)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. connect out of the box TV to computer using micro-USB cable\r\n2. connect TV power cord\r\n3. open Apple Configurator.app -> Apple TV Assistant\r\n4. Don't enroll TV\r\n5. Erase and Install latest version\r\n6. Enter TV name, set language, set reporting\r\n7. Choose profiles to install -> one profile with wi-fi configuration payload (wi-fi is NOT in range)\r\n8. Configure\r\n9. disconnect micro-USB cable\r\n10. disconnect power cord\r\n11. connect power cord\r\n12. wait for TV to stop blinking\r\n13. disconnect power cord\r\n14. connect power cord\r\n15. wait for TV to stop blinking\r\n16. connect micro-USB cable\r\n17. wait for Apple Configurator to complete setup with an error described in Description\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to configure out of the box TV with single wi-fi configuration profile without need to connect TV to network during deployment.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nConfiguring completed with error: \"Unable to configure Apple TV. The Apple TV could not complete its network cofiguration\". Initial setup has NOT been skipped but profile was installed and TV name set.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMD199HC/7.0.4/11B554a\r\nApple Configurator 1.4.3\r\nOS X 10.8.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nError ocurred when TV was NOT in range of wi-fi network configured with configuration profile. Error does not occurs when TV is in rangle of wi-fi network configured with configuration profile or it connected to network via ethernet cable (not possible during deployment)."
