    description: "IÂ´m running iOS7 on an iPhone4. Since the phone does not support BTLE I would expect the CBCentralManager state to be \"CBCentralManagerStateUnsupported\" all the time. As the documentation states, this state is there for the following reason: \"The platform does not support Bluetooth low energy.\" \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nsee the sample project at https://github.com/deadfalkon/btLeState \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe state should be CBCentralManagerStateUnsupported\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\nthe state is CBCentralManagerStateUnknown\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/deadfalkon/btLeState"
