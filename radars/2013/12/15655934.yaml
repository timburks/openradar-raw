        Summary:
        Moving items from one keychain to Local Items keychain renames them without telling the user or asking for consent

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Have a keychain with an SSH item on it. Move that item to the Local Items keychain with Keychain Access.app.

        Expected Results:
        The Item should end up on the Local Items keychain verbatim, unedited and _EXACTLY_ as it was before.

        Actual Results:
        The Items gets renamed by Keychain Access.app without telling the user or asking for consent. This makes finding items again on the keychain very hard since the have a different name than before.

        Regression:
        This unacceptable behavior of changing a user's data is new to OS X 10.9. An app should _NEVER EVER_ edit a user's data by itself. Especially not Keychain Access.app which deals with very private data, passwords and login credentials.

        Notes:
        My trust in the OS X Keychain has dropped to almost zero since 10.9 due to way too many data threatening bugs and corruption.
