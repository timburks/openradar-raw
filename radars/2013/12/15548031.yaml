    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode makes changes to xib files when it opens them which do not reflect any user actions. Simply viewing a xib is sufficient to change the file.\r\n\r\nThese changes are in the com.apple.InterfaceKit and macosx.version keys.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this developers who use source control end up either:\r\n\r\n1. Constantly committing meaningless changes with messages like \"I don't know, Xcode changed something\", or\r\n\r\n2. Constantly rolling back meaningless changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project with at least one xib.\r\n2. View but do not change this file in a newer version of Xcode and/or Mac OS X than the version used when creating the file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the user has only viewed the file, not changed it, the file would not be changed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode makes its own changes, leading the developer to choose which of the two stupid options outlined above he/she prefers.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 / 5A3005, Mac OS X 10.9 / 13A603.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA screenshot of the file differences is attached.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'xib diff-1.png' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nFor OpenRadar: the image can be seen at http://cl.ly/image/182p372c1R3W"
