    description: "In AppleScript editor, if you modify the Info.plist of an app, it can never be saved again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch AppleScript Editor\r\n2. Create new script (any contents)\r\n3. Save as Application\r\n4. Run Application\r\n5. Open the bundle and edit the Info.plist.\r\n\tFor example, add <key>LSUIElement</key><string>1</string>\r\n\tBut any change will cause the problem.\r\n6. Modify script and try to save.\r\n7. Error: 'The document \"â€¦\" could not be saved. The file doesn't exist.\"\r\n8. Even removing change to the Info.plist does not resolve the issue. The file can never be saved in AppleScript Editor again."
