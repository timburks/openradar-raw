    description: "Currently, the calendarIdentifier property of EKCalendar is not sync-proof which makes keeping track of calendar id very hard on any ios app.  \r\n\r\nBase of discussion on apple's dev forums: https://devforums.apple.com/message/926856#926856.  It looks like that this is a problem with sync with iTunes."
