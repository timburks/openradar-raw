See attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download attached .ics file to the Desktop\r\n2. Select it and press the space bar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA preview that shows the date and time of the event appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA preview showing the time only appears.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9.1, Calendar 7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
