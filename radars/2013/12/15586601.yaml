    description: "Summary:\r\nI hate finder on Mavericks. It's a piece of shit.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't remember any settings I give it, and I have to constantly drag it bigger and smaller to get my columns to appear.\r\n\r\nPlease fix it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new finder window.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. From Safari go to a an upload page (i.e. gmail and add an attachment)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFinder should open with my previous settings, and it should show all the columns I've asked it to show me.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder opens whatever columns it feels like. It doesn't remember any settings I set. It's garbage.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMavericks 10.9\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen I open Finder I have to resize every window to get it to show my columns (size, type, date modified). See attached images in the order it appears.\r\n\r\nI expect to see the 3rd one, but instead I have to adjust it every time using steps 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacbook Pro Retina 2012\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'FinderBugs.zip' was successfully uploaded."
