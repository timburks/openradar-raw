    description: "Scenario:\r\nWhen creating an automated build and distributing it to users (either via Email, a link to the Xcode bot pages, Sparkle, 3rd party service or anything else) it is also important to inform the users about changes being implemented compared to previous builds.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThere is currently no way to automatically get a list of code changes that are being used for the new build. Hence it is not possible to automatically generate some kind of release notes.\r\n\r\nFeature Request:\r\nProvide access to the list of changes (= commit headers) from\r\na.) all commits only from the pull made before starting this build\r\nb.) all commits since the last successful build\r\nThis should work independently of the used SCM system, so it should work at least for Git and SVN.\r\n\r\nBenefit:\r\nThe developer could parse the commit header structures and create a release notes text that can be attached e.g. to an email or any other distribution mechanism mentioned above."
