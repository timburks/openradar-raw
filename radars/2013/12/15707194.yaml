    description: 'Many of us are using In-App Purchases for selling a "list of things" that have a Preview. A recurring example I''m also doing is selling "Resources" (e.g. Images in my case) with which the buyer will be able to play. Others might sell "Levels" for a game. The point is: every single of us reinvents the wheel by having a "gallery" or "In-App Store" of some kind in the app. There should be a "drop-in" solution, UICollectionView or UIPageViewController based, which takes as input simply a list of Product Identifers (or nil if one wants to display all products!) and sends back delegates/blocks when the user has purchased a product or cancelled/dismissed.'
