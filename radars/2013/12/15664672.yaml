        Summary:
        Custom keyboard shortcuts added through the Keyboard preference panel are not working in iTunes.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open System Preferences > Keyboard > [Shortcuts] > App Shortcuts
        Add a new Shortcut for iTunes, for example “Mark as Played” and assign ⇧⌘U for it. (Like in Mail.app).
        iTunes _should_ pick up the new shortcut emmideately, it does not. Quit and relaunch iTunes. Check any Song/Podcast and look for the shortcut in the contextual menu. It is displayed there (after a relaunch).


        Expected Results:
        Pressing the newly assigned shortcut should trigger the corresponding action.

        Actual Results:
        iTunes beeps at the user and does not execute the assigned action.
