    description: "Officially duping rdar://problem/15283740 from http://furbo.org/2013/10/21/mac-app-store-receipts-and-mavericks/\r\n\r\nOn my Retina MacBook Pro (Main Development machine), I can fix that by killing storeagent. On my MacBook Air and on my Partner/Illustrator's MacBook Pro (running 10.9 as well) it doesn't help."
