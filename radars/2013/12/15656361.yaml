    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you are picking a photo in the Contacts app, the photo picker nav bar starts out light gray, but if you pick a photo and go back, it switches to dark gray.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts.app.\r\n2. Tap the + button to add a contact.\r\n3. Tap the add photo button.\r\n4. Choose the “Choose Photo” option.\r\n5. Note the color of the nav bar on the popover: light gray. I measure it as #f8f8f8 in the iOS simulator using Xscope.\r\n6. Tap an album.\r\n7. Tap a photo. The nav bar goes black.\r\n8. Tap the “< Saved Photos” back button (real-world use case: you accidentally tapped the wrong photo).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe nav bar is the same light gray as it was before: #f8f8f8\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe nav bar is now a much darker gray. I measure it as #bebebe in the iOS simulator using Xscope.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\niOS simulator 7.0 (463.9.4.2)\r\nReproduced on iPad 3rd generation, iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina display, iPad simulator with iOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording that demonstrates reproducing the problem in the iOS simulator: http://cl.ly/SxYm"
