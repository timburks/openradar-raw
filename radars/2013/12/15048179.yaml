    description: "Current advice from Apple for supporting older SDKs is to build with the latest SDK while setting \"Deployment Target\" to the desired target. This is very dangerous because Xcode provides no warnings if you use unsupported calls. The only way you will know that there is a problem is that the system will crash on old releases. The only safe approach is to build using the actual target SDK; that way the compiler will prevent you from using unsupported functionality.\r\n\r\nAppCode and Deploymate both provide target SDK verification. This should be built-in functionality in Xcode."
