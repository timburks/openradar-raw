    description: "Summary:\r\nAs it is now, it seems like the status bar appearance is affected by the *topmost window* rather than the *key window*. I'm presenting a UIWindow at Status Bar level in order to overlay some stuff over my existing app without affecting it. It only contains a few pixels of information, and should not affect the status bar. Yet, when my window is presented, -[UIViewController preferredStatusBarStyle] stops being called on my app's view controllers.\r\n \r\nA few possible alternatives:\r\n1. +[UIWindow _statusBarControllingWindow] returns +[UIWindow keyWindow] instead of the top window. Maybe you wrote it this way to support non-VC windows like alerts, so perhaps this wouldn't work. (alternatively, you should make alerts be VCs).\r\n2. An API to control whether a window affects the status bar. Perhaps a -[UIWindow (BOOL)affectsStatusBar].\r\n3. #2, but being implicitly NO when userInteractionEnabled is NO for that window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Overload preferredStatusBarStyle in a VC\r\n2. Present a non-interactable UIWindow on top of your app\r\n3. Navigate to the VC in #1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4. Status bar gets the preferred style of the new VC\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4. Status bar is unaffected\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
