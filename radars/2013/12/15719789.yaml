        Some users leave reviews with complaints about apps rather than follow support channels. As an app's developer we are unable to communicate with these users. Many times we can solve the issues that a person is having but sometimes we need more information to help them. At this time we're unable to communicate with users to solve their issues, which leaves both them and us dissatisfied.

        We don't want to gain the user's contact information, only a channel of communication so we can fix any issues that might arise.
