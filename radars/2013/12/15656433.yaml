    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you tap a photo to select it in the iPad Contacts app photo picker, the system status bar disappears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts.app.\r\n2. Tap the + button to add a contact.\r\n3. Tap the add photo button.\r\n4. Choose the “Choose Photo” option.\r\n5. Tap an album.\r\n6. Tap a photo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe status bar does not change when the image picker switches to the large “Move and Scale” view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe status bar disappears when the “Move and Scale” view becomes visible. It reappears if you choose the photo or tap the back button.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\niOS simulator 7.0 (463.9.4.2)\r\nReproduced on iPad 3rd generation and the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy guess is that this is a carryover from the iPhone, where it is appropriate to hide the status bar.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreen recording of this being reproduced in the iPad simulator: http://cl.ly/Sx74"
