    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a storyboard with base localization for English, and are also localizing the app for Arabic. We are taking advantage of right-to-left layout swapping when using autolayout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITableViewController in a storyboard.\r\n2. Create a prototype cell with the default Separator Insets.\r\n3. In code, display some cells of the prototype cell type.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Separator Inset should swap left and right values for right-to-left languages, as currently happens for the layout of the default table section header views.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Separator Inset produces the same result for Arabic as for English (see attached screenshots).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would not be such a problem if the section header textLabel did not rely on the separator inset for positioning, as I could simply swap the left/right values myself in viewDidLoad. However, viewDidLoad is too late for this not to affect label positions in subsequent section header views.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could update the inspector options so that instead of specifying left/right for separator insets, you instead specified leading/trailing and updated the behaviour to reflect this?"
