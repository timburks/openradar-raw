    description: "Currently, if multiple gravity behaviors are attached to the same view hierarchy, it generates a deprecation warning indicating that this will be an assertion in the future. This makes it very hard to maintain separation of concerns. View controllers must keep special track of their gravity behavior in order to pass it along to any other object that may create a view. This is not required for any other behavior, and UIKit Dynamics does not provide any help in keeping track of this special behavior.\r\n\r\nRadar 15054341 could obviate this problem by moving the gravity to the superview (which is a better place for it)."
