    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile rapidly scrolling between pages the UIPageViewController's embedded UIPageControl can become out of sync with the displayed view controllers. i.e. page one might be displayed, yet the page control indicates page 3.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlease see attached sample project.\r\nRun on device.\r\nQuickly and repetitively swipe to and from pages in the page view controller, being sure to hit the ends from time to time. Shortly, the page control will become out of sync with the displayed content.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UIPageControl should always be representative of the content being displayed in the UIPageViewControl.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe page control will become out of sync with the displayed content.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested both on iPhone 5 6.1.2 (10B146) and iPhone 5 7.0.4 (11B554a).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI've personally seen this happen on the iPhone 5, though I have a colleague who has seen it on his iPod Touch. \r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'PageViewTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
