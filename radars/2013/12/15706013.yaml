    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari should take advantage of the new power APIs in Mavericks to keep a computer awake while a download is in progress.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari, begin a download that’s going to take a long time (like a 5GB .ISO for a virtual machine).\r\n2. Disconnect the computer from its MagSafe adapter.\r\n3. Walk away. Wait longer than it takes your computer to fall asleep but come back before the download finishes.\r\n4. Interact with the computer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe computer was not sleeping and the download is still in progress.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe computer is sleeping and the connection was interrupted, reported in Safari as an error.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is particularly frustrating when downloading files from servers that don’t support resuming the download, meaning you must start over."
