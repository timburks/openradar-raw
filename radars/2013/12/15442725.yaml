    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OS X 10.9, the behavior of the power key has changed. It now causes an immediate system sleep.\r\n\r\nThis would be fine, if the button were a physically separate button (like an iPhone's lock button).\r\n\r\nBut on new Macbooks, the Power key is a *key* right next to the Delete key. It is far too easy to overshoot the Delete key when typing and accidentally cause a Sleep.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start typing fast.\r\n2. Try to backspace a letter by hitting the \"Delete\" key\r\n3. Accidentally overshoot and hit the \"Power\" key \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOS X 10.8 gave you a \"Restart / Sleep / Cancel\" dialog when you pressed the Power key.\r\n\r\nThis was much less annoying than an immediate Sleep.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe system immediately sleeps when you accidentally press the Power key when typing.\r\n\r\nThe screen goes black. You're forced to wake your computer. \r\n\r\nDepending on your power settings, that brings you to the OS X login screen, where you must log back in.\r\n\r\nVery annoying, when you simply meant to press \"Delete\".\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks\r\n\r\nNewer Macbook Pro and Macbook Air models, with a Power key in the top-right corner of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues/14\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
