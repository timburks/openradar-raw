    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen choosing a landscape photo for a contact, the photo jumps vertically after the view controller push animation has completed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Contacts.app.\r\n2. Tap the + button to add a contact.\r\n3. Tap the add photo button.\r\n4. Choose the “Choose Photo” option.\r\n5. Tap an album.\r\n6. Tap a photo.\r\n7. The nav controller transitions to show a large view of the photo with a scaling and cropping UI.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe photo animates smoothly on to the screen and then stops.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe photo animates smoothly on to the screen, but once the animation is finished, the photo jumps by -28 UIKits points in the Y direction, as measured in the attached screen recording from the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\niOS simulator 7.0 (463.9.4.2)\r\nReproduced on iPad 3rd generation and the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screen recording that demonstrates the problem in the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis is reproducible with landscape orientation photos only. It does not occur with portrait orientation photos. I used photos that I took on a 3rd generation iPad to reproduce the bug on a device.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\nScreen recording video: http://cl.ly/Swmp"
