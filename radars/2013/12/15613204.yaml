        Summary:
        In Keychain access a keychain named “Local Items” exists which can't be deleted.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Keychain Access.app. Select “Local Items” from the list of keychains. From the File menu select “Delete Keychain”.

        Expected Results:
        It should be possible to delete unwanted and unneeded keychains.

        Actual Results:
        Deleting “Local Items” is not possible since the Delete menu item is greyed out.

        Regression:
        This item was automatically created by OS X and populated with user's personal passwords without the user's consent who did never agree to have their passwords and other items on an unknown keychain file.
