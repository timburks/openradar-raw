    description: I have a puzzle game where the free version gives you 4 cards and when people want more, they buy an In-App Purchase, with Hosted Content, where I then download a few PNGs to play with. This game is pretty much the same on iPhone, iPad & Mac. Right now I need to create the exact same In-App Purchase on Mac & iOS and then upload the same files from Xcode. It would make sense, much like Game Center Leaderboards, to be able to "share" In-App purchases.
