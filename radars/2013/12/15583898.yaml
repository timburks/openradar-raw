        Summary:
        In a managed network environment, MCX settings applied to OD groups that have AD groups nested within them fail to take effect on login.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) Bind OD Master to AD
        2) Create OD workgroup
        3) Drag an AD user group in to the OD group 'members' section
        4) Apply some MCX to the OD group
        5) Log in to a Mav machine that is bound to OD and AD as a user that is in the nested AD group
        6) Scratch head and wonder why the settings applied in step 4 do not apply

        Expected Results:
        For MCX to apply correctly.

        Actual Results:
        No group MCX settings appear to apply.

        Regression:
        Works as expected under 10.8.5 client with server.app 2.x

        Notes:
        Workaround appears to be:
        Open AD domain using workgroup manager
        Find group that you want to manage
        Export the group via WGM
        Switch to the OD within WGM
        Import the previously exported group into OD
        Change the name and group ID to avoid any possible conflicts
        There will now be an OD group present containing all of the members that are in the AD group. Any MCX applied to this 'proper' OD group will now apply to clients on login.
