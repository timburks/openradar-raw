    description: "See also radar:15054302.\r\n\r\nA UIView may be attached to various behaviors. If the view is removed from its superview without also removing the item from its behaviors, then a \"ghost\" will be created that interacts with other items, but does not exist in the view hierarchy.\r\n\r\nCalling [UIView removeFromSuperview] should automatically remove the item from all behaviors."
