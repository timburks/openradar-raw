    description: "19-Apr-2013 11:58 AM Josh Abernathy:\r\nSummary:\r\nlldb doesn't actually *do* much of anything more. Most importantly, I can't view the value of any object.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a breakpoint.\r\n2. Stop at breakpoint.\r\n3. Try to po anything which is visible.\r\n4. Try to view any variable in the Variable View.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt works.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't.\r\n\r\nRelevant output:\r\n\r\nerror: call to a function 'class_getName' that is not present in the target\r\n(lldb) po self\r\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'self'\r\nerror: 1 errors parsing expression\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUsually worked in the previous public release. gdb still works.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n19-Apr-2013 03:41 PM Josh Abernathy:\r\nAs request, I added\r\n\r\nlog enable -f /tmp/packets.txt gdb-remote packets\r\n\r\nto my ~/.lldbinit and then re-ran. After expressions failed, I ran:\r\n\r\n(lldb) continue\r\n\r\nAnd then stopped the app. Attached is the output from /tmp/packets.txt.\r\n\r\n19-Apr-2013 03:46 PM Josh Abernathy:\r\n'packets-1.txt' was successfully uploaded"
