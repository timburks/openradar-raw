        Summary:
        Provide a descriptive summary of the issue.

        Refreshing Provisioning Profiles in the Xcode Organizer is currently failing on me. I requested to be removed from 2 teams which were no longer active because they seemed to be causing a problem due to a pending request. But the error I get does not tell me which team is failing and even after I have been removed from these 2 teams and I have restarted Xcode multiple times I am still seeing one of the teams listed.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        In numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.

        1. Add iOS developer account to a team
        2. Refresh the Provisioning Profiles in the Xcode Organizer
        3. Never complete the request for new certificates generated by Xcode
        4. Try refreshing the Provisioning Profiles again

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Even if a certificate is still pending it should not break the refresh process and block Provisioning Profiles from being downloaded into the Organizer.

        Actual Results:
        Explain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.

        The process fails early without downloading the Provisioning Profiles.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.

        These problems with Provisioning Profiles have been a major problems with Xcode for a long time. A lot more attention needs to be put on this error to help developers so we can focus on writing code instead of figuring out how to get past these problems.
