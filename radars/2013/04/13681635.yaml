    description: "Summary:\r\nThe MKMapView's userTrackingMode consistently loses it's value when it is set to MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading.  When we take the app for a ride, the userTrackingMode will switch to MKUserTrackingModeFollow after 5-20 seconds of driving without any interaction from the user or the code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis is only a problem in iOS 6.x.x.\r\n1. Create a view with a MKMapView in it.\r\n2. Set the userTrackingMode to MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading.\r\n3. Go for a ride.  The mode will change on it's own after 5-20 seconds.  Usually, the car has to be moving at or above 20-25 mph before the problem shows up.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample app which reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe userTrackingMode should not change unless the user interacts with the screen or if it is changed in code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe userTrackingMode constantly changes without any user interaction and without any changes in code.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have been able to reproduce this in iOS 6.0.0, 6.1.1, 6.1.3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might be unrelated, but the Compass Interference message constantly shows up when the userTrackingMode is MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading."
