    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nThe dot syntax was introduced to use with @property declarations. It can also be used on methods without call parameters. Those methods usually have a side effect because you don't need a full-blown method when no side-effect is required. Thus the compiler should warn if you use a full-blown method with dot syntax b/c that's probably not what you want. \r\n\r\nOptionally this could be a part of the static analyzer. (Extra-bonus: the analyzer could look for said side-effect)."
