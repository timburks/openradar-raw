    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen clicking refresh on the provisioning profile section in Xcode Organizer, the app crashes hard after retrieving some data with an exception: UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION (NSInvalidArgumentException): *** setObjectForKey: object cannot be nil (key: teamId)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode\r\n2. Click Organizer button\r\n3. Click Devices tab\r\n4. Click Provisioning Profiles\r\n5. Click Refresh\r\n6. Enter credentials & hit login\r\n7. Crash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nRefreshed profiles and certificates are pulled into Xcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode crashes and generates a crash log.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has happened since Xcode 4.5.  It does not matter if I am refreshing from a single team Apple ID or a multiple team Apple ID.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI ended up deleting preference files, with no change in behavior.  I then deleted my ~/Library/Developer/Xcode folder and that caused the refresh to work as expected.  This happened both before and after the new provisioning portal was released on 4/6/2013."
