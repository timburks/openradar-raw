    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the first responder’s inputView has been set and an app resumes from backgrounding, the first responder is still first responder, still shows the cursor (if it’s a UITextField), but does not respond to key presses. Without a custom inputView it works as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1a.) Create an instance of UITextField. I’ll refer to it as \"textField\".\r\n* OR *\r\n1b.) Create an instance of a subclass of UIView that conforms to the UIKeyInput protocol, where -insertText: and -deleteBackward log their calls. I’ll refer to it as \"keyInput\".\r\n2.) Set a custom input view using the viewInput property. (In the case of keyInput this involves redeclaring the viewInput property as readwrite.)\r\n3.) Make textField or keyInput a subclass of the view controller’s view.\r\n4.) Make textField or keyInput the first responder.\r\n5.) Run the app.\r\n6.) Type with a hardware keyboard to test that key input is received.\r\n7.) Press the home button to send the app to the background.\r\n8.) Reopen the app, bringing it to the foreground.\r\n9.) Type with a hardware keyboard to test that key input is received.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKey input should be received after resuming the app, as that is how textField or keyInput act without setting a custom input view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKey input is not received after resuming the app, even though the cursor continues to blink for textField, and textField and keyInput return YES for -isFirstResponder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to affect every subclass of UIResponder.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe only current workaround is to -resignFirstResponder and -becomeFirstResponder again when the app resumes."
