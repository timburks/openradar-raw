    description: "Summary:\r\nSince the new version of the Provisioning Portal has been rolled out, it is impossible to request a new certificate for as long as there are expired Provisioning Profiles in the portal.\r\nWhile this is not a problem per se, there is no indication of what the reason for this is:\r\n\r\nThe option to request a new certificate is disabled without any warning, error message, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in to the Development Portal for a team that has at least one expired provisioning profile.\r\n2. Hit the “+”-button to request a new certificate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither one of\r\n- The option “iOS App Development” is enabled/selectable.\r\n- The option is not enabled/selectable, but a warning/error tag is attached to it, detailing why it cannot be selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe option “iOS App Development” is not enabled, and cannot be selected. No explanation is provided.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
