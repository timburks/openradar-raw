    description: "09-Apr-2013 06:03 PM Aaron Meurer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUsing emacs with certain Python libraries causes the computer to Kernal panic upon closing emacs. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFull details are at https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi/issues/37. To reproduce, use test_emacs.el from https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles/blob/master/test_emacs.el. You will need to install the various libraries that are added to the load-path (they are all clones of the repos from GitHub).\r\n\r\nThen, run \r\n\r\nemacs -Q -l test_emacs.el test.py\r\n\r\nAnd do some typing that activates the auto-completion framework. Then close emacs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe computer doesn't crash. Everything works normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMac OS X immediately panics.  This also happens if emacs is force quit, either through kill, by closing the terminal tab, or by force quitting the terminal.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis apparently does not occur in Mac OS 10.7, though I have not personally not confirmed this. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFull panic crash report is attached.\r\n\r\nIf you use M-x epc:controller in emacs, and hit K on each row to manually kill the Python process, it does not panic upon exiting emacs. \r\n\r\n09-Apr-2013 06:03 PM Aaron Meurer:\r\n'test_emacs.el' and 'Kernel_2013-03-19-171057_Aarons-Retina-MacBook-Pro.panic' were successfully uploaded"
