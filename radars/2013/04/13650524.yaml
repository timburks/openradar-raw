    description: "Summary:\r\nPresently, there is no way to safely and quickly retrieve the first object in an array/collection. `objectAtIndex:` throws an exception if you request an out of bounds object, whereas `lastObject` safely does what it says on the box.\r\n\r\nGiven how common it is to request the first object in an array, I'd love to see a simple addition to these guys:\r\n\r\n-(id)firstObject\r\n{\r\n    if ([self count] > 0) {\r\n        return [self objectAtIndex:0];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return nil;\r\n}\r\n\r\nAny chance of that happening? I'll file the same against the iOS SDK."
