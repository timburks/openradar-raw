    description: "Summary:\r\nAdd native WebP image format support to iOS and MacOS.  See (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) for more information about the library itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to open a .webp image file in iOS or MacOS. Note that both products do not understand the format. Xcode should be able to work .webp images in Storyboard and it is also unable to do this natively.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image would be loaded, decoded and presented normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError message or some indication that the binary image file is unreadable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are plenty of sites on the internet detailing the benefits of WebP. Image files smaller than JPEG and with alpha transparency found in PNGs. It is missing some of the more annotative options that PNG provides but the size savings are themselves alone worth the addition to mobile apps.\r\n\r\nI have a way working with these now in iOS but it is cumbersome. It does, however make enough savings in overall app size that it's worth the effort."
