    description: "Summary:\r\nKernel extensions signed with codesign and latest Xcode (4.6.2 with matching Command Line Tools) won't work in older kernels (my test machine: (MacOS X Server 10.6 , Darwin kernel 10.8.0)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build a 64-bit or mixed kext with latest xcode.\r\n2. sign with codesign or via xcode\r\n3. on target system, load kext\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe kext is loaded and works\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe kext is not loaded. The following error message appears in system error log: \r\nxkld[com.mycompany.kext]: The Mach-O file is malformed: Invalid segment type in MH_OBJECT kext: 29\r\n \r\nRegression:\r\n- i386-only kext do work (signed as generic).\r\n- x86_64 and mixed i386-x86_64 kexts don't work.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\ni386 kexts are signed separately, not modifying the Mach-O binary. In all other combinations of architectures the binary is modified causing the load failure.\r\nIts been discussed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15657720/codesign-and-kernel-extension-kext-in-osx-wont-load"
