    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing an APN profile which sets a proxy server you can only change those proxy settings by resetting the devices network settings. Removing the profile does not remove the proxy settings. The device still uses the proxy settings from the APN profile.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Install an APN profile with proxy settings (can be generated by the iPhone configuration utility and send to the device via email) on a device with installed SIM card and iOS > 6.0\r\n2) Verify that the proxy settings take effect after installation by monitoring network traffic on configured proxy. (or by observing that network requests fail when you configure a non existent proxy)\r\n3) Remove the APN profile.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe proxy server will no longer be used for cellular data connections.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe proxy server is still used for cellular data connections.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
