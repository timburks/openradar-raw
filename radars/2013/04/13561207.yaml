    description: "Summary:\n\nWhen working with AssetsLibrary framework, it would be beneficial to have the ALAssetsGroup sort order passed as a property. The sort order would be derived from the Photos app. \n\nThis should be a readwrite property.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nN/A\n\nExpected Results:\nN/A\n\nActual Results:\nN/A\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\n\nALAssetsLibraryChangedNotification is triggered when you change the sort order of the albums in the Photos app, but there's nothing we can do with that change in our apps. Having the sort order property would allow us to."
