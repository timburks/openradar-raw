        I have almost 50 applications in my 'Purchases' page now, and it is becoming difficult to find a particular application that I have bought while on my desktop Mac and now want on the laptop, or an application I haven't needed in a while and thus deleted to save space on the tiny SSD.

        It would alleviate these issues a lot of App Store behaved more like other Mac applications. For example, both Finder and iTunes let me click a column heading (while MAS has columns, there are no headings) to sort by that column. MAS always seems to be in some random order (date of purchase? Date of release? Something is off thereâ€¦). It would be easier to find applications if I could sort by name. Also, it'd be handy to sort by the "button" column so I can group together all installed applications, or find the ones I haven't installed yet. Finally, there is a search field in the upper right, but it searches the store, not the purchases/updates sections. Would be great if it did something useful, like filter the currently showing list.
