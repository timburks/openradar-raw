    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up a UITableViewController in IB only, the UIRefreshControl does not have any associated targets or control events.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the attached test project, using the Schemes “IB Only”, and “Add Target Manually”.\r\n2. When the app is launched, pull to refresh the view you are seeing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The text “Beginning hardcore loading action …” is printed to the console.\r\n- After a delay of about two seconds, the loading animation finishes and the table view’s only cell is populated with the contents of “Lyrics.txt” — regardless which scheme was chosen to build and run.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen using the scheme “IB Only”, nothing ever happens (except for the beginning of the loading animation).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
