    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a programmer (stupidly) try to compare a Class object to an NSString literal with the != operator, clang refuses to finish compiling the offending file and hangs, appearing to take forever to compile the file.\r\n\r\nClang should report some kind of \"type mismatch\" error and move on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload a demo Xcode project from github at URL:\r\nhttps://github.com/cpatterson/ClassStringBugDemo\r\n\r\nAttempt to build the Xcode project, which contains the offending code in the AppDelegate.m file. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe compiler should generate some kind of \"type mismatch\" error on the offending code line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode (clang) will hang while compiling that file. Reproduced with Xcode 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.\r\n\r\nUPDATED 11-Jun-2013 12:45 PM Chris Patterson:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved in Xcode 5.0 (5A11314) and can be closed."
