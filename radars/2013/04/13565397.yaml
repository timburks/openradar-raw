    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I’m from the CocoaPods team (http://cocoapods.org).\r\n\r\nCocoaPods uses the CFPropertyList APIs to read and write ‘xcodeproj’ documents. The encoder no longer supports encoding to kCFPropertyListOpenStepFormat, which means we have to encode to XML.\r\n\r\nThis works all nicely as long as all the content in the document is in MacRoman. When it’s not, the Xcode plist encoder will insert a magic-comment at the top of the plist to indicate that the encoding is UTF-8, this is then checked for by the Xcode decoder before reading the complete plist.\r\n\r\nIn our case (an XML plist), however, we can’t insert the magic-comment, because it would be invalid XML. The XML actually has the proper encoding specified in its declaration, but Xcode ignores this and reads the data as MacRoman nonetheless.\r\n\r\nWe are of course aware that this is a somewhat private implementation detail, but it would still be great if Xcode would support reading XML plists with the declared encoding, so that developers from all over the world can use Xcode and CocoaPods without worrying about encoding issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create project\r\n2. Add file with characters not found in MacRoman\r\n3. Save\r\n4. Convert project.pbxproj to XML plist (See notes [2])\r\n5. Open project in Xcode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat Xcode (or rather its plist decoder) would respect the XML encoding declaration.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTreats it as MacRoman instead.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI think this has been the case forever.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[1] CocoaPods ticket on the subject: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/926#issuecomment-15778982\r\n[2] Sample XML plist xcodeproj: http://cl.ly/2c0n2v3C022S"
