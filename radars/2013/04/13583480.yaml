    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode intermittently reports that unit tests have succeeded, even when failures occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a new Cocoa Application project in Xcode with unit tests.\r\n2) make the only test be the following:\r\n- (void)testXcodeFailure\r\n{\r\n\tSTAssertNotNil(nil, @\"nil\");\r\n}\r\n3) Keep running tests (via command-U).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should always report failure.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAround 10 to 20% of the time, Xcode will report success, even though the above test fails. This is fairly easy to catch by assigning a \"Play sound\" action to tests passing/failing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, continuing to press command-U results in this on-again, off-again behavior, even without changing or recompiling anything.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
