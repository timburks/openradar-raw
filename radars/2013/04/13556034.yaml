        Summary:
        There can exist conditions on iOS devices where a user fills the available storage of the device. Apps can also download new resources and content. If the storage on the device is full it is the responsibility of the app to handle it. There is currently no way to simulate an out of storage condition on the iOS Simulator for fast iterations during development.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. fill an iOS device with music and one app that downloads assets
        2. try to download assets in the app, the download should fail
        3. try to fill the iOS Simulator so it will give out of storage errors when trying to download
        4. never get an out of storage message unless your Mac's hard drive is full, which means you can't compile

        Expected Results:
        Like the "Simulate Memory Warning" the iOS Simulator should be able to simulate an out of storage condition to test apps in an quick iterative style.

        Actual Results:
        The iOS Simulator uses the hard drive space on the Mac and unless you want to fill your Mac's hard drive (which is not recommended) you can't test an out of storage situation on the iOS Simulator.

        Regression:
        Occurs on all iOS Simulator versions.

        Notes:
        none.
