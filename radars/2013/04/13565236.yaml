        Summary:
        Xcode's code editor draws fonts with the incorrect size or style in the code editor, when the theme is configured to use different sizes and/or styles for different syntax elements.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. To to the Fonts & Colors tab in Xcode preferences window (Cmd-,)
        2. Click the + button to duplicate one of the built-in themes
        3. Change the font size and/or style for one or more of the syntax elements
        4. Open a .h or .m file which contains code that includes the syntax element
        5. Observe that the size/style does not match the specified size/style in the preferences window
        6. Hold the Option key and mouse over a line which contains the modified syntax element
        7. Observe that the font/style changes as the mouse cursor passes over the line of code
        8. Click another line of code which is being drawn incorrectly
        9. Make any change to that line of code
        10. Observe that the font/style changes as soon as the line is changed (as in step #7)

        Expected Results:
        Expect the font size/style to always match what is defined in the theme in the Fonts & Colors tab in Xcode preferences

        Actual Results:
        Font size/style seems to be based on Plain Text, and not on the size/style defined for the specific syntax element

        Regression:
        Tested on Xcode 4.x on MacBook Air, with System 10.8.x.

        Notes:
        No workaround found so far.
