    description: "If the active display color profile was anything other than sRGB at launch, Safari displays the colors in untagged images differently between different sizes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Ensure that the display color profile is not sRGB in settings. If it is, change it, then log out and back in.\r\n2.) Open Safari.\r\n3.) Navigate to a page with smallish, untagged (no ICC color profiles) images set to the same color as the background. I created the following page as an example: http://lanausee.com/files/bug/bug.html\r\n4.) If the colors appear as they should, refresh the page once.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe colors in the untagged images would be displayed the same regardless of their sizes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSo long as the image asset is large enough (I haven’t been able to figure out the threshold), and it isn’t scaled down, the colors display correctly. Otherwise the image is rendered darker.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have tried this on multiple user accounts.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy example page renders as expected (with the images matching their backgrounds) in Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, and even Quick Look. The problem only appears in Safari and the WebKit nightly builds (under the conditions outlined above). Each line on the example page displays two image files. The original is 151 pixels wide and tall. The cropped is exact same image, cropped to 150 pixels. These should render the same color in Safari, but they do not. Also when the original image file is scaled down using CSS, it renders darker."
