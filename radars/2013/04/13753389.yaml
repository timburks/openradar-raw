    description: "Summary:  The recent change in iTunes connect that bans various special characters (emoji, checkmarks, etc.) is too restrictive, and it makes it harder to communicate about people's apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to put in some indication of a review, such as how many stars it gets from Macworld, using the obvious characters for star:  â˜…  (Unicode U+2605).  \r\n\r\nExpected Results: You should be able to use it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  You can't.\r\n\r\nRegression:  This is really annoying.  We have to figure out what characters to indicate how many stars (or boxes, hearts, mice, etc.) we got in our reviews, and it's annoying."
