    description: "12-Apr-2013 04:27 PM Phillip Jordan:\r\nSummary:\r\nNo source code has been published at http://opensource.apple.com/ for the open source components of the Xcode 4.6 developer toolchain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Navigate to http://opensource.apple.com/ in web browser.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- \"4.5\" link in the Developer Tools column\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Only sources up to Xcode 4.5 are available\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI appreciate that it takes time out of a busy developer's schedule, but it's been almost 2 months since Xcode 4.6 was released. Many of the individual open source tools received significant updates in that release, and access to the source code would make fixing build problems in our code caused by the update a lot easier."
