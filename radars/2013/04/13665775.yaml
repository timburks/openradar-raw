        Summary:
        It would be a great feature in iOS to be able to forward a voicemail as an attachment to an iMessage or Email.  When someone leaves a voicemail have a Share option available on a message, and it'll attach as an MP3 or WAV file.  Carriers could set a setting which would explicitly disallow this, if needed.
