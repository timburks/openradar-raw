    description: "15-Apr-2013 08:55 AM Ben Ford:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen performing a refactor->rename that affects only the current file, code editor is left in unusable state.  Navigating to a different file by clicking in the navigation pane will immediately fix the code editor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open project\r\n2. Create new class with a private instance variable, something that looks like this:\r\n\r\n#import \"TestClass.h\"\r\n\r\n@implementation TestClass\r\n{\r\n    NSString *testString;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Highlight instance variable text: \"testString\".\r\n\r\n4. Click Edit->Refactor->Rename\r\n\r\n5. Type testString2 into dialog.\r\n\r\n6. Click Save\r\n\r\nAt this point the code editor screen is unusable and has broken text layout (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nNOTE: This behavior will NOT occur if you perform the refactor against code that appears in multiple files.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected result is that the code editor remains useable after performing refactor->rename and text layout remains normal as well.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCode editor screen is unusable and has broken text layout (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIn XCode 4.5 this behavior happens on all refactor->renames.  In XCode 4.6, it is only happening against code that appears in single file only.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nRelated bug is rdar://11548384, which doesn't account for this behavior only happening in a single file.\r\n\r\n15-Apr-2013 08:55 AM Ben Ford:\r\n'Broken code editor.png' was successfully uploaded"
