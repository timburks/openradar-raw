    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Interface Builder 3 & previous, there was the ability to select a view, then select Parent, Child, or Sibling via menu or keyboard shortcut. This was handy for quickly and easily selecting the proper item to edit. This ability is nowhere to be found in the built-in UI editor in Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect a view in an interface. Want to select the parent, child, or sibling of that view. Search through menus. Search the help. Find nothing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA menu item with associated keyboard shortcut that allows the user to select the parent, child, or sibling of a selected view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing available.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nFeature was available in all versions of Interface Builder.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
