    description: "In my app, I want the user to be able to reply to tweets. The current Twitter sheet as part of the social framework doesn't support sending the metadata required to do this.\n\nI suggest having a new property on SLComposeViewControllerResult: \n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *twitterInReplyToStatusID;\n\nIf this property is filled in, it should send the in_reply_to_status_id parameter to Twitter when the user posts their tweet.\n\nAs well, the GUI should change to show the tweet that is being replied to, above the text input box if the user pulls to scroll it downwards."
