    description: "Summary:\r\nProfile Manager generates a profile with keys that are inconsistent with the documentation found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010206-CH1-SW25\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGenerate a profile that includes an Exchange payload. Enable SSL.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA configuration profile should be generated that is consistent with the documentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere are two Payload Type entries in the Exchange Payload. One with a key of \"payload_type\", the other with a key of \"PayloadType\". There should be only one. Also the documentation says the key for SSL is \"SSL\", but there is no such key in the profile. Only \"ExternalSSL\".\r\n\r\nBoth the documentation and Profile Manager should be corrected to list/generate the correct keys. It's ambiguous which keys are correct.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n12-Apr-2013 12:31 PM:\r\nI mistakenly said that there was no \"SSL\" key in the exchange payload generated by Profile Manager. I found that it does in fact generate an \"SSL\" key. But the documentation still doesn't account for the \"ExternalSSL\" key."
