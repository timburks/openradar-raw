        Summary:
        Often for commit messages, or chat logs, I want to refer to a method by it's selector. Consider this method:

        - (void)doSomething:(NSString *)thing withHelper:(MYHelper *)helper;

        I'd love to be able to select some portion of that code, and choose "Copy Selector" or something like that from the menus in order to get this onto the pasteboard:

        -doSomething:withHelper:

        (the leading hyphen is optional; it's not technically part of the selector and I could happily live without it)
