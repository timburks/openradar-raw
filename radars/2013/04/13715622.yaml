    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a UISegmentedControl is created with segmentedControlStyle = UISegmentedControlStyleBar and a tint color is set, then the segmented control creates images which are not cleaned up.  This is most obvious when adding segments, but it can also be seen when layoutSubviews is called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a segmented control with UISegmentedControlStyleBar and any tintColor (e.g. [UIColor purpleColor])\r\n2. Repeatedly add and remove segments\r\n3. Observe memory usage in Instruments\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/percysnoodle/SegmentedControlLeakTester for a minimal project which demonstrates the behaviour.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMemory usage should be bounded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMemory usage increases until the application is killed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes - this behaviour is not observed in iOS 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is still present in iOS 6.1."
