        Summary:
        Very often I open a storyboard or nib, then want to drag an outlet or action, and proceed with only code.  If I press âŒ˜+ Return, it closes the assistant editor, but that's the file I want to continue with.  It would be great if I could press a key combination and promote the assistant editor to be the standard editor, instead of continuing w/ whatever is on the left pane.
