    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iOS 6 introducing support for attributed strings in UILabel, etc., the number of cases where one would need to use a UIWebView or dropping down to CoreText for rich text display has been reduced significantly — yay!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, NSParagraphStyle, and its mutable cousin lack public API for tab stops :-/\r\n\r\nWhile this is not too surprising, given that NSTextTab is private on UIKit, it is a bit saddening:\r\n\r\n1. After all, NSTextTab exists at the very least since iOS 6.0, and is API compatible to what I’ve come to know, and love in AppKit.\r\n2. The methods on NS(Mutable)ParagraphStyle that feed off of NSTextTab exist in private, and appear to work fine.\r\n\r\nTab stops are key to display numerical data in a typographically pleasing way — please don’t make me resort to using private API, a UIWebView, or drop down to CoreText for that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
