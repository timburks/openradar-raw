    description: "09-Apr-2013 06:43 PM Alan Livingston:\r\nSummary:\r\n If the rootviewcontroller is a UISplitViewController, and a modal view controller is presented at app launch while in portrait, the UISplitViewController misses a round of delegate callbacks when the modal is dismissed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA UISplitViewController is the root view controller.  A separate view controller is presented modally in -[AppDelegate applicationDidBecomeActive:], with no animation. \r\n\r\nLaunch app in portrait.  After modal view controller is presented, rotate to landscape and dismiss modal view controller.\r\n\r\nIn the attached project - \r\n1. launch in portrait\r\n2. rotate to landscape\r\n3. dismiss modal\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUISplitViewController delegate receives -splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController: before the modal view controller is presented.  When the modal view controller is dismissed, after rotating to landscape, the delegate should receive -splitViewController: willShowViewController:invalidatingBarButtonItem: so the detail view can remove the invalidated bar button item.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n -splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController: before the modal view controller is presented. When the modal view controller is dismissed after rotating to landscape, the delegate does NOT receive -splitViewController: willShowViewController:invalidatingBarButtonItem:.  Rotate back to portrait and the delegate does not receive  -splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController:.  After this, rotation events are handled correctly and the correct delegate methods are called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the modal view controller is presented with animation:YES, all delegate methods are called correctly.  (but \"Unbalanced calls to begin/end appearance transitions\" is logged to console in this case).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n09-Apr-2013 06:43 PM Alan Livingston:\r\n'SVCModalLogin.zip' was successfully uploaded"
