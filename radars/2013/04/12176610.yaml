    description: "26-Aug-2012 08:24 PM Aleksander Balicki:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSiri mistakes gas stations for places the propane (or ground gas) is distributed.\r\n\r\nThis happens in Poland, Europe - probably map data is misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTell Siri \"where's the nearest gas station?\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSiri should point me to places where I can get gasoline for my car.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSiri points me to the ground gas places.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is also not a British English problem (where it would be petrol stations), because my Siri is set to US English."
