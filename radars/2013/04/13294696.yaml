    description: "26-Feb-2013 03:35 PM Francesco Frison:\r\nSummary: \r\nIf by mistake the code I am running through Xcode falls in an infinite loop. Then Xcode Freezes \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nWrite a small program that ends up on an inline loop, then run\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a breakpoint after an excessive number of cycles\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode freezes\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs far as I can remember in all the version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCould be interesting to have a configuration flag to turn this behaviour on and off, so for those code that exceptionally need to run an extensive number of operations the breakpoint doesn't trigger.\r\n\r\n09-Mar-2013 12:00 PM Francesco Frison:\r\nI tried to set up a sample project to replicate the bug, but without luck. I guess I was wrong. Sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Apr-2013 01:11 AM Francesco Frison:\r\nA simple infinite loop as I reported seams not to be enough.\r\nIn mistakes like recursing a getter it will occur. Of course here the mistake is clear, but when it happens it takes a while to get Xcode on a working state again.\r\n\r\nSee code below:\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 11013781\r\n\r\n@synthesize lastCommand = _lastCommand;\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n- (NSString *)lastCommand {\r\n    return [[self.lastCommand componentsSeparatedByString:@\" \"] objectAtIndex:0];\r\n}\r\n\r\n05-Apr-2013 01:11 AM Francesco Frison:\r\n'infinite_loop_sample.txt' was successfully uploaded"
