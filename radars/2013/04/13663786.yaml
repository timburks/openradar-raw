    description: "16-Apr-2013 09:46 AM Tim Ekl:\r\nSummary: On the detail page for a free app, clicking \"Free\" then immediately clicking \"Install App\" will visibly depress the install button, but will not actually begin the installation process.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the OS X App Store page for a free application. (I tested with Dash, a documentation viewer.)\r\n2. Click \"Free.\"\r\n3. Immediately after the button turns green and its text changes to \"Install App,\" click it again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe installation process should begin, generally by prompting for my password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happened. I had to wait a few seconds and click again before being prompted for my password to authorize installation.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
