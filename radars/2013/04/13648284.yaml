        Summary:
        When tapping on an activity from a UIActivityViewController that presents a view controller, e.g. the mail activity, rotation events don't seem to be passed the view controller presenting the UIActivityViewController. Most notably any UINavigationControllers show the default navigation bar instead of the landscape mini version when rotating to landscape and dismissing the activity.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a note in Notes.app
        2. Tap the action button
        3. Tap the mail or message activity
        3. Rotate to landscape
        4. Cancel activity

        Expected Results:
        Should return to the note and be in landscape with proper landscape navigation bar.

        Actual Results:
        Returns to the note in landscape, but with the normal size navigation bar. Oddly if the mail activity is used a small black bar over the navigation bar is also present.

        Regression:
        Occurs with the Notes.app and all versions of http://jottingsapp.com. However the black bar is only seen in Notes.app with mail activity.
        Does not occur with the Photos.app, presumably its handling its navigation bar differently.
