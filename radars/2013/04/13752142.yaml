        Summary:
        Renaming a script application saved by AppleScript Editor removes the extension on the bundle and leaves a folder which cannot be further saved or used.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open AppleScript Editor.
        2. Choose Save from the File menu and save as an application.
        3. Choose Rename from the File menu.
        4. Type a new name.
        5. Modify the script.
        6. Attempt to save the script.

        Expected Results:
        The script application is renamed, including its .app extension. The script saves successfully.

        Actual Results:
        The .app extension is removed from the script application bundle. The application icon in the title bar is replaced by a folder icon. A sheet appears indicating that the document could not be saved.

        Regression:
        This does not occur with non-application scripts, including script bundles.

        Notes:
        Workaround: Include the .app extension when renaming the script application.
