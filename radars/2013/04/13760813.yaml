    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the [i] button at the top right while viewing a picture, most of the fields (aperture, exposure time etc.) are blank for PEF files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTake any RAW picture in PEF format with a Pentax K-5 camera, import it into an iPad 2, e.g. using the camera adapter, and view it in iPhoto for iPad. Open the picture and press the i button to view information about the picture.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nData such as aperture and camera model should be shown\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll EXIF related data shows up blank.\r\n\r\nViewing the PEF's file information in OS X Finder, the data is shown, proving that the data is actually there.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached are a sample PEF file (which is just black) and a screenshot of the blank fields of the [i] display."
