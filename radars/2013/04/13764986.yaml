    description: "Summary:\nWhen resizing a UISlider, the value returned by trackRectForBounds: is out of date with the current slider value for around 2 seconds after the resizing operation happens.\n\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nN/A\n\nExpected Results:\nThe value of trackRectForBounds: should update simultaneously with the actual slider itself.\n\nActual Results:\nThere is a period where they are out of sync.\n\nRegression:\nN/A\n\nNotes:\n\nWe have a subclass of UISlider that inserts an additional minimumBuffer and maximumBuffer image views to show video buffering progress for our streaming video player. This bug causes the maximumBuffer image to stretch beyond the actual value of the slider itself for a few seconds while trackForRect: catches up. \n\nWe are currently working around it by hiding that track until it has time to update."
