        Summary:
        For developers that are on multiple development teams in the iOS developer portal, a "Select Your Team" box is presented.  If two teams/accounts have identical company names, it can be hard to distinguish which team you're logging into.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Log into Developer portal with an Apple ID belonging to multiple teams.

        Expected Results:
        Teams should have a customizable account name or at a minimum indicate which type of developer program they are.

        Actual Results:
        A company with both an App Store and Enterprise account may have identical entries in this drop-down.

        Regression:
        N/A
