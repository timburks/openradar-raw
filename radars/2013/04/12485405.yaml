    description: "Summary: Requesting access to an ACAccount of type ACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook with an options dictionary that does not contain a valid ACFacebookPermissionsKey array fails with the following message:\r\n\r\nError Domain=com.apple.accounts Code=7 \"The Facebook server could not fulfill this access request: The proxied app is not already installed.\" UserInfo=0x2089e9d0 {NSLocalizedDescription=The Facebook server could not fulfill this access request: The proxied app is not already installed.}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open the supplied Xcode project, run it on a device containing a valid Facebook account. Press the get me button and accept the permission prompt. \r\nThis should fail with the error message stated in Summary section.\r\nNow edit the code, uncomment the options dictionary containing the part with ACFacebookPermissionsKey, for this example I am asking for email as a permission, run this and now the app will be granted access to the account. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app should be granted access with basic information when no ACFacebookPermissionsKey is supplied in the access options dictionary. \r\n\r\nActual Results: If the Accounts framework is requesting permission for the Facebook app in question for the first time (the Facebook user has not yet authorised anything from this app before) and without the ACFacebookPermissionsKey being set, access is refused.\r\n\r\nNotes: This fails only if it's the first time requesting permission - once the user accepts with permissions email, subsequent permission request without ACFacebookPermissionsKey succeed. You can test this by resetting the privacy settings on your device. \r\nYou should also check Facebook's apps section and observe the test app's access status. \r\n\r\nFacebook documents this and insists the following:\r\n\r\nTo create this basic connection using the iOS 6 native Auth Dialog, apps must request access to a user's basic profile information by asking for one of email, user_birthday, or user_location permissions\r\n\r\nThis means that when the user first connects the app to their account, email, user_birthday, or user_location must be passed in as permissions. \r\n\r\nThe Apple documentation should be update to reflect this. Notably by omitting that the ACFacebookPermissionsKey is optional which is not true for first time install."
