    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a great many tracks, the songs on the iTunes Match servers seem to be corrupted. This is happening on both iOS and iTunes for OS X. The songs will occasionally stream for a short while before moving to the next track but will not download. I've come across the following affected tracks:\r\nDead Melodies / Mutations / Beck\r\nYou Can Fall / The Noise Made By People / Broadcast\r\nAlone / Hand It Over / Dinosaur Jr.\r\nToo Much Love / LCD Soundsystem / LCD Soundsystem\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Attempt to download a matched song (listed above), on iTunes or on iOS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe track should download.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn iOS—the progress circle fills up over and over again (indefinitely) until the Music app is closed, then it reverts to the iCloud download button.\r\nOn OS X—the progress circle fills up four times, then becomes an exclamation mark. iTunes gives the error, ‘There was a problem downloading “<Track Name> / <Album Name> / <Artist Name>”. The file seems to be corrupted. To redownload the file, choose “Check for Available Downloads” for the Store menu.’\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOccurs with iOS and iTunes on OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI’ve tried turning iTunes Match off and back on. I’ve tried removing the track from iCloud and adding a fresh copy to iCloud, where it is again matched. I’ve tried this on one Mac and two different iPhones. I still receive the error and am unable to download the matched track."
