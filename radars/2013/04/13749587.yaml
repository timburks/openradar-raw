    description: "Summary:\r\nTo get VoiceOver to read a minus sign as \"minus\", the unicode minus sign (U+2212) must be used. If VoiceOver is set to 6-dot braille on iOS or Mac or 8-dot braille Mac, the minus sign is sent to refreshable braille displays as \"*b\" (star b).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1a.) Set a label (or accessibility label) to an mathematical expression with a minus sign.\r\n*OR*\r\n1b.) Type a mathematical expression with a minus sign into a text field.\r\n2.) Have VoiceOver read the expression allowed, to make sure an actual minus sign was used.\r\n3.) Read the expression on a refreshable braille display.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe minus sign should display on the refreshable braille display the same as a hyphen-minus. This would make sense, as VoiceOver displays the multiplication cross (U+00D7) as a star and the division sign (U+00F7) as a slash on a refreshable braille display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe minus sign displays as \"*b\" (star b) on refreshable braille displays.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis affects both OS X and iOS."
