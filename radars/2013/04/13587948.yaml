        Summary:

        When performing Quick Look on a local HTML file, the sharing button allows you to share the file.  If you select "Email" from the sharing menu, Mail will create a new message whose content is a "file:" URL. Since the HTML file is local, sharing should attach the file. The "file:" URL will typically not work for the recipient.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1.  Create an HTML file and save it to disk.
        2.  From the Finder, select the file and press the space key to open the Quick Look window.
        3.  Click on the sharing button, and select "Email" from the drop down menu.

        Expected Results:

        I would expect Mail to open with a new message and that file as an attachment.

        Actual Results:

        Mail opens with a new message whose content is a "file:" URL.

        Regression:

        N/A

        Thanks for looking into this.
