        When I update a running application using the Mac App Store, it asks me if it's OK to quit the application. When I agree, it quits the app, then updates it. However, it does not relaunch the application. This is very annoying with applications like Fantastical, Committed or xScope, which display a menu in the upper right of the menu bar, because they just disappear, and I have to dig them out in Launch Pad.

        Given Mac OS restores all applications after a restart, surely all needed information to do this gracefully is already available to the system. It's just a matter of the MAS app actually *doing* it on completion of an update.
