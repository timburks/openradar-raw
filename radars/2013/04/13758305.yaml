    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nNotification Center provides a great way to ask a user to do something when the app is running in the background. One significant weakness, however, is that notification messages need to fit within the fixed window size allocated to notifications.\r\n\r\nTwo requests:\r\n* Make the notification window grow in size when a notification has a longer informative text message.\r\n* Make the notification window grow in size horizontally when a particularly long \"word\", such as an email address, is embedded in the informative text.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide context, I attached a screenshot of a notification I am trying to fit in a notification center window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThank you."
