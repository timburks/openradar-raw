    description: "Summary:\r\n-[NSObject<MKMapViewDelegate> mapViewDidFinishLoadingMap:] is called before the MKMapView is finished loading.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBy blocking the main thread in the delegate callback method, one exposes the fact that the map tiles have not fully displayed by the time the delegate's method is called.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app to hang in the callback method, _after_ the map tiles have fully loaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app hangs in the callback method, _before_ the map tiles have fully loaded.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSee the attached screenshot and sample code.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
