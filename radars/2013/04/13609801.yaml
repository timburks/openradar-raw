        Summary:
        As described in many places online, there is no apparent way for the publisher of an app with auto-renewing subscriptions to disable the "Share Your Information?" dialog that a customer will see after subscribing. For one example, see this:

        http://www.marco.org/2012/01/06/autorenewable-subscription-restrictions

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create and publish an auto-renewing subscription IAP. The docs do say that the dialog cannot be disabled for a free auto-renewing subscription, but do not mention a paid auto-renewing subscription. However, my company's app has several paid auto-renewing subscriptions with the "Offer a marketing opt-in incentive?" option set to No, and we are still seeing the "Share Your Information?" dialog.

        Expected Results:
        We would very much prefer to turn it off because we do not need to collect that information. Showing it to customers is bad for at least two reasons. First, it gives a false impression that we *want* that information. Second, it is unnecessarily disruptive to customers.
