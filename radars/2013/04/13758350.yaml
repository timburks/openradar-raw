    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Mail app allows the user to set a Reply To address when composing a new mail message by selecting the View > Reply-To Address Field menu item and entering a reply-to address.\r\n\r\nFollowing these steps for every outgoing email is tedious. It would be helpful if the user could specify a default Reply-To address for each user account.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe Reply-To address can be controlled for all outgoing messages by executing this command:\r\n\r\n    defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Reply-To\" = \"reply-to@address\"; }'\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not useful if one wants different Reply-To addresses for each account."
