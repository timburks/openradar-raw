    description: "21-Apr-2013 01:49 AM Alistair McMillan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nTrim a movie and save it. Play it with QuickTime and you just see the section you intended to keep. Play it in other video software like VLC or MPlayerX and you still see the unedited movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open a movie in QuickTime\r\n2) Choose Edit -> Trim... and select the sequence you want to keep.\r\n3) Hit Trim.\r\n4) Save the file.\r\n5) Open the file in QuickTime or QuickLook and you just see the sequence you want.\r\n6) Open the file in VLC or MPlayerX and you see the entire original video including the sections you thought you trimmed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI'd expect QuickTime to be removing the edited frames, resulting in a file that doesn't contain the bits I tried to edit out. So you should only see the edited video, no matter what software you use to play the video.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAble to see the unedited video in non-QuickTime software. Seems like it is just changing a start and stop value.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
