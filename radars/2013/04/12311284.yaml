    description: "Summary: I open the Maps application from my App by calling MKMapItem's openInMapsWithLaunchOptions: method. I provide the MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeKey in the launch options. The Maps application launches and if no directions are available a message alert is displayed, when this is dismissed, we have a map with no annotations (items).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Please see this post for example code to product the error: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/167178?tstart=0\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Maps application launches, user location is determined and directions are calculated. If no directions are available, an error message should alert the user that there are no directions available. Upon dismissing this message, the map should show the MKMapItem's annotation in the centre of the map.\r\n\r\nActual Results: When there are no directions information, an alert is displayed, after dismissing this alert the map is displayed wherever the last place the Maps application was viewing, and the user is unaware of the location of the desired destination.\r\n\r\nNotes: Please see this post my myself on the Apple Developer Forums: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/167178?tstart=0"
