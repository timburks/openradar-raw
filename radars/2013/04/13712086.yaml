    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsers of iCloud, iTunes, and other Apple services are required to sign up with an \"Apple ID\" to use those services. Many users now have multiple Apple IDs, especially now that iCloud requires users to create an @icloud.com Apple ID instead of using any previously existing Apple ID. So users have to remember to use one Apple ID for iCloud, another for iTunes, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, many users signed up using an email address that is no longer used by them, or which is no longer desirable (for example, an address that includes a previous spouse's last name). Users should be able to change the name of the Apple ID without losing access to all the products, services, and personal data associated with that ID.\r\n\r\nThere should be some mechanism to merge and/or rename Apple IDs so that each user may simplify their usage of Apple's services with a single ID and password.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A"
