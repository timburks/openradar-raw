        Summary:
        The method -tableView:didUnhighlightRowAtIndexPath: of UITableViewDelegate is called consistently with an incorrect index path:
        <NSIndexPath 0xdc3c530> 2 indexes [2147483647, 2147483647]
        when canceling a selection by dragging the table view.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Create a standard table view
        - implement -tableView:didUnhighlightRowAtIndexPath: in the delegate object.
        - Log the value of indexPath
        - Tap on one of the cells of the table view to see it highlight, but don't release your finger.
        - Drag your finger out of the cell so that the selection is canceled
        - The cell is unhighlighted and the delegate method is called with the incorrect value.

        Expected Results:
        - The delegate method is called with the cell that was just unhighlighted.

        Actual Results:
        - The delegate method is called with a wrong value. It looks like an overflow since this value is (NSUInteger)(-1)

        Regression:
