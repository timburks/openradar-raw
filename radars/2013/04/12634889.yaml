    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIAppearance API is pretty cool, but requires a lot of boilerplate duplication.\r\nTo consolidate global styling efforts, it would be very helpful if instances of the private _UIAppearance class responded with YES to -isKindOfClass: if the class, the appearance is a proxy for, would.\r\nI.e. basically, _UIAppearance should override -[NSObject isKindOfClass:] as:\r\n\r\n- (BOOL)isKindOfClass:(Class)class\r\n{\r\n    if ([super isKindOfClass:class])\r\n        return YES;\r\n\r\n    return [class isSubclassOfClass:[self _CustomizableClass]];\r\n}\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the tests of the attached sample project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tests pass â€” and would, if the list of UIView (sub)classes was more comprehensive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey fail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
