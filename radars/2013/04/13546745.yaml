    description: "Summary:\r\nAny app using MapKit automatically deactivates the MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading mode when driving with the device. This can be reproduced also in \"Find my Friends\" and \"Find my iPhone\".\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen \"Find my Friends\" and tap the locate-me button until the map rotates according to the compass.\r\nStart driving.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe map should continue to rotate according to the compass.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe map switches back to non-rotating mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work in older iOS versions. I believe that it worked correctly in iOS 5.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe bug does not occur in Maps app but seems to be related to MapKit only.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nrdar://12804133 (MKUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading automatically deactivates when zoomed in)"
