        In AutoLayout-land, sometimes the intrinsic content size of an object (in one or both dimensions) can be used to help compute the layout.

        I would like IB to do two things to make this easier to work with:

        1. When an object is using its intrinsic content size for layout purposes, put a green arrow across the width or height of the object (or some other colour that isn't the same as the ones currently used for layout constraints).

        2. Have an option in the popup constraints menu (i.e. the floaty button in the bottom right), that has "Pin width to intrinsic content size" and "Pin height to intrinsic content size". These should only be enabled for a view that supports the intrinsic content size.
