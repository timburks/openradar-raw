    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile trying to debug some code I'm writing in a small library, app was consuming 100% CPU prior to Xcode starting to crash. I set a breakpoint on DPSNode.m:128 and after doing so, ran again and Xcode started to crash at this point with a code signature error, but ONLY on this project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download the code in the \"apple-radar-1\" tag at: https://github.com/jeremytregunna/Swarm\r\n2. Open affected Xcode\r\n3. Open DPSNode.m and ensure there's a breakpoint set on line 128.\r\n4. Change to the swarmd scheme\r\n5. Build & Run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp to run, Xcode to stay alive, my breakpoint to be hit, so I can debug my actual problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode crashes with the attached crash report\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
