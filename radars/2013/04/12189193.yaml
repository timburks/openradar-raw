    description: "Summary: \r\nGit is a fundamental tool for programmers. Xcode's project and file system includes several areas which aren't ideally version controlled. \r\n\r\nI am always adding a .gitignore file to the root of my Xcode project to ignore the following:\r\n\r\n.DS_Store\r\n*.log\r\nxcuserdata\r\nbuild/*\r\n\r\nHowever sometimes I forget and it is a real pain to undo the added files and put everything in order. This means my repo is now over 20MB in size with a simple template Master-Detail Xcode template project despite having no resources such as artwork or other media.\r\n\r\nThis size consists mainly of the contents of the build folder including the app and all it's run logs.\r\n\r\nI am asking for a .gitignore file to be created automatically or by checkbox opt-in with these standard and widely accepted (from the iOS dev community) gitignore targets."
