        Summary:
        It's not possible to reuse an App with a name, that was formerly created and deleted later on. There is no comprehensible reason why I shouldn't be able to use a name for an App, that was chosen by myself.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        * Chose an App name and create a new App with it
        * Enter all needed informations and finish this process
        * For any reason (and there could be some of them) delete this App on iTC
        * Do your stuff (coding, debugging, fixing errors...)
        * if you're done, go to iTC and try to create an App with the exact name you deleted before
        => You will fail.

        Expected Results:
        Possibility to create a new App with the exact name that was deleted before.

        Actual Results:
        I have to chose a completely new App name, must change the bundle ID. It's beyond the pale...
