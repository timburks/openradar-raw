    description: "Summary:\nI am not able to upload voice memo recordings in a similar manner to how camera roll content can be uploaded as a file in Mobile Safari\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nMake some nice field recordings - especially longer ones\nWant to upload them elsewhere without having to go to worry if iMessage or Mail will find the attachment too long\nGo to a webdav file uploading site (dropbox, share point, amazons3, OS X Server wiki, whatever) and attempt to upload the day's recordings.\nWhen I tap the upload button, I see the \"Take Photo or Video\" and \"Choose Existing\"\nI tap \"Choose Existing\"\nIt shows Photos only\n\nExpected Results:\nI would like to be able to upload a voice recording similar to how I presently upload a video from the camera roll using Mobile Safari.\nWhen I tap Choose Existing, it would be fabulous if voice memos showed as a category under Photos if there were any voice memos.\n\nActual Results:\nI am unable to \n\nRegression:\nnone - this is clearly a feature request\n\nNotes:\nAt present, I iMessage or email myself the m4a file which then after a round trip through the network (assuming it's not too large) results in a file that iOS will send to Dropbox app (or evernote or other app that knows how to ingest sound like iMovie). Why I can't send these directly to iCloud or better, directly to another app seems odd. Voice Memo is a very useful app for field recordings but it's not well integrated with anything else on iOS other than Mail and iMessage."
