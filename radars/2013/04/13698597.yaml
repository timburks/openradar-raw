    description: "Summary: All Macs except the Retina MacBook Pro support HiDPI on an external display. That one should too. Its failure is an regression.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect an external monitor to any Mac BESIDES the Retina MacBook Pro, running Mac OS X 10.8.\r\n2. Open Display Preferences and look at the Display Prefs on the second display.\r\n3. Click “Scaled.”\r\n4. Scroll down the resolution list and see all the HiDPI resolutions. EXCELLENT!\r\n5. Now try steps 1-4 on the Retina MBP. There are no HiDPI resolutions. BOGUS!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to have HiDPI supported on the R-MBP.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not supported.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been working great on the other computers. It is only broken on the R-MBP.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is really important for Apple's customers who use the $10 Air Display app to extend their Retina MBP's desktop onto a Retina iPad. They spent good money to get wonderful high-resolution displays. They expect and deserve to see full-quality Retina on both screens. But they can only see it on the built-in display. This disappoints them.\r\n\r\n“Surprise users with delightful discoveries, not with unexpected omissions.” — SJ"
