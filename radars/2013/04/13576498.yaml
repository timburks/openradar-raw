    description: "Setting the presentation option to NSApplicationPresentationDefault is documented to reset to \"default\" the behavior of the menu bar and dock. When a window is fullscreen, and the presentation options are set to NSApplicationPresentationHideDock | NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar, setting the presentation options to NSApplicationPresentationDefault fails to reset them.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample project. It contains a window that can be fullscreened, and two buttons. One button (\"Hide menubar and dock\") sets the presentation options to NSApplicationPresentationHideDock | NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar. The other (\"Reset to default\") sets them to NSApplicationPresentationDefault.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Build and run the sample app.\r\n2. Do not yet fullscreen the window. Click the \"Hide menubar and dock\" button.\r\nCORRECT: The menu bar and dock disappear.\r\n3. Click the \"Reset to default\" button.\r\nCORRECT: The menu bar and dock re-appear; this is the default behavior for a non-fullscreen window.\r\n4. Click the arrows in the upper right of the window to fullscreen it.\r\n5. Move the mouse pointer to the top of the screen to attempt to access the menu bar.\r\nCORRECT: The menu bar appears; this is the default behavior for a fullscreen window.\r\n5. Click the \"Hide menubar and dock\" button. Move the mouse pointer to the top of the screen to attempt to access the menu bar.\r\nCORRECT: The menu bar refuses to appear.\r\n3. Click the \"Reset to default\" button.\r\nBUG: The menu bar refuses to appear, despite this being the default behavior for a fullscreen window.\r\n\r\nThis is broken in 10.7 and 10.8, and from my investigation has never worked correctly.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround, querying the NSApplicationPresentationFullScreen bit, but an app should be able to ignore that and trust that NSApplicationPresentationDefault resets things to be default."
