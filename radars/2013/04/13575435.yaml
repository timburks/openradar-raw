    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to customize the clear button in a UITextField. There are some tricks like using the rightView property. But this is not the way to go and results in slightly different behavior too.\r\n\r\nThe default clear image is in a dim grey tone. It works fine for black or white backgrounds but it is hard to see on grey ones. Also you might want to follow a custom appearance and therefore you want to style the clear image.\r\n\r\nIt would be pretty easy to customize the clear button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be nice if there are methods like this in a UITextField.\r\n\r\n- (UIImage*)clearButtonImageForState:(UIControlState)state UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR;\r\n- (void)setClearButtonImage:(UIImage*)image forState:(UIControlState)state UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR;\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRight now there is a private method:\r\n\r\n- (UIImage*)_clearButtonImageForState:(UIControlState)state;\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't want to use private API. So I'm hoping you might solve this issue with iOS 7.\r\n\r\nfiles.mczonk.de/TextfieldClearButtonApperance.uip"
