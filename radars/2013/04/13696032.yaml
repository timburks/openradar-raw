    description: "Summary:\r\nGit supports following renamed files. Xcode doesn’t take advantage of this and doesn’t show revision history for renamed files. To view the full history in Git via the command line one types \"git log --follow\". If one only wants a partial history they can type \"git log\" without the follow flag. Xcode seems to do the latter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.) Commit modifications to a file in Git using Xcode.\r\n2a.) Rename the file in Xcode.\r\nor\r\n2b.) Rename the file using \"git mv\", then re-associate the file in Xcode\r\n3.) View the Version editor in Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould display all the past revisions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly displays the revisions since the file rename.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem seems to exist in all version of Xcode that contain the Version editor, 4.0 and up."
