    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Contacts.app on my iPhone 5s, when entering an address for a contact entry, pressing the return key in any address field, it always slides up the Country selection screen.\r\n\r\nOn my iPad Mini, pressing the return key crashes the application\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the Contacts app\r\nSelect a contact\r\nClick Edit\r\nScroll down to the Addresses section\r\nEdit the street field of an entry (add new address entry if none currently exist)\r\nPress the return key on the keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe edit cursor should move to the next address field, i.e. street #2 field, and allow me to continue to enter the address information.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhone: I can see that cursor does move to the next field but then the Country selection screen slides up from the bottom.  Pressing the Cancel or Done button returns to the contact entry screen but it is no longer in text entry mode (cursor and keyboard is gone).\r\n\r\niPad: Contacts.app crashes and returns to home screen\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2 (11A501) on both devices\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnother minor UI issue.  The entry has a country entered, in my case it defaults to United Stated, but when the Country selection screen appears, it is at the top of the list.  One would expect it to scroll to the currently selected value.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s, 32GB, AT&T (ME308LL/A)\r\niPad Mini, 32GB, Verizon (MD541LL/A)"
