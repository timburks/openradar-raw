    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you black out the back button in Guided Access in an app, you can still use iOS 7's new back gesture to navigate back in the app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on Guided Access.\r\n2. Open Mail and go to your inbox.\r\n3. Enable Guided Access for Mail and circle the back button to prevent it from being tapped. \r\n4. Swipe from the left edge to the right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince Guided Access disabled the back button, it shouldn't allow you to go back.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGuided Access allows you to go back in the app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n5th generation iPod touch running the final release of iOS 7.0."
