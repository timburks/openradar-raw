    description: "Please add the ability to set a custom date/time for the iOS simulator. This would allow for easier testing and documentation of time-sensitive events in an app running in the simulator.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I am currently recording documentation for an app which changes the display based on due dates and times relative to the system clock of the iOS device. Currently, to reproduce this behavior for tests or documentation, I have to change the system clock on my Mac, leading to unintended consequences for other apps running on my system that expect the system clock to be generally correct.\r\n\r\nIf setting a custom date/time in the simulator were allowed, I could test and document this iOS app behavior without adversely affecting the rest of my Mac."
