    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I offer an update to an app I would like to be able to make that a PAID UPDATE (usually called UPGRADE).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Search the iTunes Connect Backend for Pricing Options on Apps.\r\n2. Search for an option of PAID UPDATES\r\n3. See that no such option is available to the developer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to be able to attach a price tag to an update. Especially if the update adds lots of new functionality.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI cannot make customers pay for an update. I have all the work with the updated app, but no return in exchange. That's not fair! And it will in the long run not be very healthy for the Ecosystem of the AppStore.\r\n\r\nYes, I can use IAP for this, but customers hate IAP and it is pretty complicated to setup and manage if you want to do it the right way. It adds even more costs to the overall bill on the app development costs.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nLatest version of iTC.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nLatest version of iTC. Any Browser."
