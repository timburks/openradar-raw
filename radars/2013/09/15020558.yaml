    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using PKAddPassesViewController to add a Pass, VoiceOver reads the titles of other passes previously added to Passbook.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure you have a few passes added to Passbook\r\n2. Create a simple app that uses PKAddPassesViewController to add a pass (I'd love to add a sample project, but signing passes, etc, make it impractical.)\r\n3. Activate VoiceOver\r\n4. Run the app. When you get to the \"Add Pass\" view (something like http://img.my.csdn.net/uploads/201301/17/1358402574_8759.png) swipe down with two fingers.\r\n5. VoiceOver will start reading the UI. In this example, it will read \"Cancel, button - Card, heading ......... More Info, button\" \r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoice over should stop at \"More Info, button\".\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter \"More Info, button\", VoiceOver reads the titles of the other passes previously added to Passbook, in my case \"Lufthansa, Glyder, Starbucks\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6.1.3"
