    description: "I'm attaching two sample projects, one that works correctly and one that does not.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the search bar from a UISearchDisplayController is positioned over an MKMapView.  The difference between working and not is 1) embedding the view controller in a navigation controller and 2) moving the search bar down from 20 to 64 so that it's no longer under the nav bar.\r\n\r\nIn the working case you can click in the search bar, type some text, and it will display in the search results table, with the search bar still visible.\r\n\r\nIn the non-working case there's a shadow covering the search bar as soon as you click in it and when results start displaying the table covers the search bar (though it still accepts input).\r\n\r\nYou can see screenshots and discussion here:\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/864379#864379\r\n\r\nOf note is that both sample apps work correctly in iOS6 - it only fails in iOS7.\r\n\r\nApple Response:\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to address this based on the following:\r\n\r\nUISearchDisplayController is no longer supported. The desired functionality should be available with UISearchController and if not (or is not behaving correctly), please file a new bug report.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this report.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
