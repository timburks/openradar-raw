    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter a map annotation is dragged, it no longer moves with the map view and is instead locked into the current position on the UI.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (see attached sample project):\r\n\r\n1. Create a map view and add some custom annotations, with a custom annotation view.\r\n\r\n2. Make sure that the annotations are draggable.\r\n\r\n3. Drag an annotation to a different location and drop.\r\n\r\n4. Pan/scroll the map view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe dropped annotation should move with the map, maintaining its correct position on the map.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe dropped annotation does not move at all, and is fixed on-screen, even if the coordinate it was dropped to moves off-screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample project attached: http://appsandwich.com/openradar/MapAnnotations.zip\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigating further, it seems that allocing a new MKAnnotationView subclass in mapView:viewForAnnotation: instead of using the dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier: method fixes the issue. Not ideal, but it'll provide a workaround for the moment."
