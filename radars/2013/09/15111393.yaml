    description: "Summary:\r\nThe date posted is no longer shown for any review on an app. Reviews that are several years old and for versions no longer even available are given the same weight as current and more applicable reviews.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open an app's App Store record.\r\n2. Click over to the Reviews tab.\r\n3. Notice the lack of a date on any review.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach review should be dated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo review has a date and a review from version 1.0 in 2010 has the same weight as one from a recent version, especially in the All Versions tab."
