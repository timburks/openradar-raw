    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a UIView which conforms to the UITextInput protocol.  I have a subclass of UITextRange (NBTextRange) and UITextPosition (NBTextPosition) which I use with it.\r\nIf I press the up key 4 times, then the down key 3 times, then tap in a UITextField and press the down key Apple's SDK seems to be hanging on to one of my NBTextPosition objects and sending it a message it can't respond to - webVisiblePosition in iOS 6, offset in iOS 7.  Logs attached\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI haven't tested this so simplistically, but basically:\r\n1. Create a UIView subclass which conforms to the UITextInput Protocol and uses custom UITextPosition and UITextRange classes\r\n2. Make it first responder\r\n3. Up 4 times, down 3 times\r\n4. Make a UITextField first responder\r\n5. Hit down\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNot crash\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6, 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niOS 6 and 7 simulator (tested)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'logs.txt' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\n17-Sep-2013\r\nI said 4 and 3, but if I go up once, tap the UITextField and use the down key it crashes the same.\r\n\r\n31-Oct-2013\r\nPlease could I have a status update on this bug report as it has been nearly 2 months since opening with no response\r\n\r\n22-Nov-2013\r\nThank you for contacting us.
