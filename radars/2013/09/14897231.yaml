    description: "Summary:\r\nI want to make the view of a UIViewController (VCB) the titleView of another UIViewController's (VCA) navigationItem. Adding VCB to VCA's navigationController in -viewWillAppear: seems best. If I do this (or add VCB during VCA's viewDidAppear, the navigationController makes VCA disappear (confirmed by VCA's viewDidDisappear method).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached project.\r\n2. Observe that it properly adds the child view controller when view controller containment is not used.\r\n3. Observe that it doesn't properly add the child view controller when view controller containment is used in viewWillAppear:\r\n4. Observe that it doesn't properly add the child view controller when view controller containment is used in viewDidAppear:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nView Controller Containment should work for UIViewControllers in UINavigationController's navigationBar.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nView Controller Containment don't work for UIViewControllers in UINavigationController's navigationBar.\r\n\r\nProject:\r\nhttps://github.com/hborders/14897231_UINavigationController_addChild_loop"
