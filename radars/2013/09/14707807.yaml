    description: "If you run the attached sample project you will see that the frame of the map view is (0, 0, 0, 0) in viewWillAppear, and (0, 0, 320, 460) in viewDidAppear (depending on screen size, of course).  This seems wrong and messes with my ability to use regionThatFits in viewWillAppear as one would normally want to do.\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/865422#865422\r\n\r\nApple Response:\r\n\r\nNone - ticket was archived with state set to Insufficient Information and I was never notified about it."
