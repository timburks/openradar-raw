    description: "Summary: When using iTunes Match on iOS, if you initiate a download queue when connected to wi-fi, the downloads continue over the mobile network even if \"use mobile data\" is switched off. \r\nThis is particularly frustrating for users who want to download lots of tracks and have low mobile data download quotas.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1) Enable iTunes Match on iOS. \r\n2) Under Settings > iTunes & App Store, ensure \"Use mobile data\" is disabled and \"Show all music\" is enabled. \r\n3) Connect to wifi\r\n4) Initiate a download of many tracks in the music app (e.g. download all tracks for one artist)\r\n5) Disconnect from wifi\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The device should finish downloading any tracks that are currently being transferred, and then pause the download queue until the user has connected wifi again. \r\nThe other option: perhaps the device should notify the user of active transfers and give them the option to continue or cancel downloads. \r\n\r\nActual Results: All downloads continue regardless of the fact that \"use mobile data\" has been disabled. \r\nThe \"Use mobile data\" setting gives the user the impression that their data usage won't be eaten into by iTunes Match. I have encounted this issue many times which has pushed me over my mobile data usage quota and caused me to need to buy additional (and very expensive) data packs. \r\nIn countries such has Australia, mobile data is incredibly expensive. Settings under iOS should do what they say on the tin. \r\n\r\nVersion: iOS 7 (this also occurred on iOS 6)\r\n\r\nNotes: iTunes Match is a wonderful, convenient product, but this issue has caused myself and many colleagues great frustration when these settings have not performed the way they are expected to. In Australia mobile data is extremely expensive, and when something like this happens it makes iTunes Match seem more of an inconvenience than a usdul feature. \r\n\r\nConfiguration: iTunes Match enabled, \"show all music\" enabled, \"use mobile data\" disabled. Test starts connected to wifi, then wifi disabled during transfer."
