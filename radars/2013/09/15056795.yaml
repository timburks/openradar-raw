    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a podcast is set to automatically download and keep episodes, deleting a podcast episode from the iTunes library from within a playlist results in the episode being re-downloaded on the next refresh. This happens regardless of whether the episode is marked as Played.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subscribe to a podcast, and set it (or the defaults) to keep all episodes. The latest episode should automatically download.\r\n2. Ensure that the episode appears in a playlist.\r\n3. (optional) Listen to the episode to the end, or right-click and select \"Mark as Played\".\r\n4. In the playlist, delete the episode from iTunes with option-delete.\r\n5. Refresh the podcast.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNone. The deleted episode should remain deleted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe latest episode is re-downloaded.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niTunes 11.1 (126), OS X\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis bug was introduced in the current version of iTunes. In previous versions, it behaved as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny and all, to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
