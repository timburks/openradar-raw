    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using custom section headers with a UITableView, reloading the table view can cause the headers to not be removed, while the new ones are still added.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee example project.\r\n\r\n1. Load the table with data.\r\n2. Animate a change to the data.\r\n3. Before the animation finishes, call reloadData.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter if the data changes between 2 and 3, but changing the data makes the effect more obvious, especially for non opaque views.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tableView should handle this situation without buggy behavior, either by waiting for the animation to complete before reloading, stopping the animation in flight, or some other method. In particular, this is a regression from iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome headers will remain visible in addition to the new headers."
