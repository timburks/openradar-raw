    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, I have to look at my phone when trying to unlock it with Touch ID to confirm that I've been successful. The scanning process takes a variable amount of time, and if I'm in a hurry and try to unlock my phone, I have to focus on the phone to make sure I've left my finger on the button for long enough.\r\n\r\nI suggest instead that there be an option (or a default) that when the scanning is successful a sound be played or the phone vibrates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock the iPhone 5s\r\n2. With your left hand, take a drink of coffee\r\n3. With your right hand, try to unlock the phone by pressing down the home button with your thumb, then leaving your finger on the home button to scan a fingerprint\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI want to be certain I've unlocked my phone without looking at it. Alternatively, if I've failed to unlock my phone (bad finger position) I want to be alerted as such.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI am uncertain if I have unlocked my phone successfully. Have I been successful, or have I failed due to not holding my thumb down long enough or having my thumb in the wrong position?\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5s, iOS 7.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUsing Touch ID is a different enough flow from swipe to unlock & enter passcode that I'm finding it hard to get myself to consistently use Touch ID. This is made worse by the fact that I don't have the confidence (due to unfamiliarity) in Touch ID unlocking my phone that I used to have in swipe to unlock/passcode.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s"
