    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you add a UIRefreshControl to a table view controller that has a background view, no matter when that background view is added, the UIRefreshControl will be hidden, presumably behind the background view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee the example project.\r\n\r\nBasically, set a background view. Fully opaque views will completely block the control, semi transparent ones will be over it.\r\n\r\nThis is on iOS 7 only, not iOS 6. It does not matter if the app was built with a base SDK of 6 or 7.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe refresh control should be visible above the background view."
