    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPhone currently has the ability to make emergency calls when locked.\r\nIf there is an emergency where a personal contact (spouse, family, friend) should be contacted, the person giving assistance to the owner is not going to be able to call the ICE contact\r\n\r\nI request a feature be added to the Emergency Call screen to display the owner's ICE contacts and important medical condition information.\r\n\r\nThe owner would have to set up their personal Contact Card with relationship associations (Spouse, Father, Mother, etc) then specify which association is to be listed on the ICE screen.\r\n\r\nFor privacy, the buttons on the Emergency Call screen can simply list Spouse, Father, Mother, etc, instead of the name/number of that person.  When one is selected, it would show buttons to call any of the contact's numbers (home, mobile, work, etc)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Lock the iPhone\r\n2. Tap Emergency Call button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA button to view owner-specified contacts that should be called in an emergency and important medical condition information\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. Be unable to contact the owner's emergency contact\r\n2. The user can only dial 911 or leave the screen"
