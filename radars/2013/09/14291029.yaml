    description: "I have Mavericks installed under VMWare.  In that configuration, I'm seeing some flakiness with communication between DP2 and the simulator.  Sometimes I get \"unknown error\" and other times the simulator just sits there with a black screen.  Other times it works fine, but in those cases sometimes hitting the stop button in Xcode has no effect and both have to be force quitted.  I have a feeling it's a speed issue;  even though this is a Mac Pro, the install under VMWare is slow and occasionally a little herky-jerky and I think maybe Xcode isn't waiting long enough for a response.  I haven't had any issues with DP2 under Mountain Lion on the same machine.\r\n\r\nI don't use VMWare anymore so I don't know whether it was ever fixed."
