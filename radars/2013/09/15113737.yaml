    description: "Summary:\r\nThe kerning of app bundle display names on the home screen differs for identical software versions (7.0.2) running on 32-bit versus 64-bit hardware. This leads to the undesirable behavior of inconsistent bundle display name truncation between devices running the same software.\r\n\r\nSee this screenshot: https://twitter.com/timothyarnold/status/384760614822088704/photo/1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n+ Install an app on 32-bit hardware running 7.0.2, observe bundle display name kerning.\r\n+ Install an app on 64-bit hardware running 7.0.2, observe bundle display name kerning.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nKerning is the same on 32-bit and 64-bit devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nKerning is different on 32-bit and 64-bit devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2"
