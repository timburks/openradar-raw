    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using TableView row animations in combination with a tableHeaderView, the tableHeaderView is slightly (1-2 pt) shifted to the right and back to the left while the row animation is in flight.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the QuickContacts app in Xcode 4.6 (in order to compile it under the 6.1 SDK) and install it on an iPhone running iOS 7 beta.\r\nTap \"Display and Edit Contact\" (requires a contact named \"John Appleseed\")\r\nTap \"Edit\" and \"Done\"\r\nWatch the tableHeaderView closely, in particular vertical lines such as from the Name labels or the photo frame.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhile animating between Edit and normal mode the elements of the tableHeaderView should not move horizontally.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey do move 1-2 pt to the right and back to the left.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works fine on iOS 6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis does not only affect AddressBookUI view controllers but all tableViews doing similar row animations. I just used ABUI as a canonical and easily reproducible test case.\r\n\r\nSee also this screen movie where you can better see the issue by stepping through the single frames of the animation:\r\nhttp://d.pr/v/86PB\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations, 18-Sep-2013 10:38 PM:\r\nThis problem goes away if you build with the iOS 7 SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrtwin Gentz, 19-Sep-2013 10:48 PM:\r\nThat's true but I filed the bug specifically for the case where it's built with the iOS 6 SDK."
