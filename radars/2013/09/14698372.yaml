    description: "In Interface Builder it is difficult to drop a search bar above the prototype cell in a table view.  It wants to go in the cell, which is not usually what one wants.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you drop it below the prototype cell, which the aforementioned difficulty encourages, it initially behaves correctly, but it's actually in the table footer so after the search text field has been entered and then cancelled the search bar disappears.  This is unexpected to say the least, and because there's nothing to indicate that the search bar has ended up in the table footer it's difficult to track down.\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of rdar://14692427, which reports that when you have accidentally placed the search bar in the table footer it behaves exactly as you would want it to on iOS6, but does this disappearing act in iOS7.  Both of these reports are coming out of this discussion:\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/864212#864212"
