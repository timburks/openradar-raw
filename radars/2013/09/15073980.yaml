    description: "Summary:\r\nUITextViews do not respond to the up and down arrows keys on external Bluetooth keyboards connected to the device, nor when using the simulator targeting iOS7 and turning on hardware simulation.  Other keyboard keys function as expected, including left and right arrow keys.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUsing Xcode 5\r\n\r\n1. Drag UITextView onto a storyboard in a blank project\r\n2. Run on device connected to external keyboard OR in the simulator targeting iOS 7 with hardware simulation on.\r\n3. Select UITextView for editing with multi-line text present in control.\r\n4. Hit up and down arrow keys.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe editing cursor should move within the text as it has in previous versions on iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCursor does not move\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 Xcode 5 (5A1413)"
