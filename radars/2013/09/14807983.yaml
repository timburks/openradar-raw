    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UISearchDisplayController, a black dimming view is displayed first and when any text in the search bar is deleted. Tapping on the dimming view should always cancel search mode.\r\n\r\nThis works fine when the search display controller is initially shown. But when typing anything in the search bar and subsequently deleting it, tapping on the dimming view does not cancel the search mode but forwards the tap event to the underlying view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse any app (compiled for iOS 6) with a search display controller and enter the search mode. Type a letter. Delete the letter. Now tap on the dimming view.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch mode should be canceled and the search display controller dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSearch mode is not canceled but the tap event is received by the view behind the dimming view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works fine in iOS 6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee also this video: http://d.pr/v/zufr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations, 27-Aug-2013 05:49 PM\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested a test case/sample app in order to further investigate this issue.\r\n\r\nTest Case/Sample App Requirements:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ios/test-case/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrtwin Gentz, 28-Aug-2013 01:04 AM\r\n\r\nPleae use the AdvancedTableSearch sample project. As described the problem occurs with every app using UIAearchDisplayController built on Xcode 4.6 and run on an iOS 7 device."
