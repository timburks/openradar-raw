    description: "Summary:\r\nBeing able to incorporate the compiler as an object in applications leads to some interesting metaobject programming possibilities (see notes). While we can build the clang and llvm libraries from the upstream sources, it'd be useful to have the versions of the libraries that correspond to the compiler that's really in use to reduce incompatibility problems.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. try to write code that uses features from the clang-c/ headers and links to libclang\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can use the libclang interfaces and libraries corresponding to my current version of Xcode (as determined by xcode-select).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no first-party provision for these headers and libraries - I can build versions from llvm.org's svn but cannot readily tell which version of their sources corresponds to the version in an Xcode build. The specific source drops at www.opensource.apple.com do not always arrive in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe specific use cases I have in mind for the libraries include syntax-aware automation tools like lints and documentation generators that should be aware of the same syntax as the compiler used in Xcode/xcodebuild. Additionally there are metaobject programming uses; a Smalltalk-style object browser in Cocoa could let you write Objective-C and reprogram the browser (unlike existing solutions like F-Script that interpret another language).\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
