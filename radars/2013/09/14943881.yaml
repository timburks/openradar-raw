    description: "NSFilesPromisePboardType has a note in the documentation:\r\n\r\n> On OS X v10.6 and later, use (NSString *)kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise instead.\r\n\r\nIn Google Chrome 29 I switched from NSFilesPromisePboardType to kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise. The complaints about how drag-and-drop broke came pouring in, and I had to revert.\r\n\r\nThere are four issues I am reporting; this is one of them. I will update this radar with links to the other three when I am done filing them all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise is used to do drag-and-drop, dropped files do not get the location of the drop\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n- Drag a promised file to the desktop in the lower-left corner and drop it there\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- The newly created file gets the drop location applied to it and is positioned in the lower-left corner, like it was when NSFilesPromisePboardType was used\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- The newly created file is positioned in the upper right of the desktop\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\nI suppose it is possible to use an AppleEvent to position the file after the fact. This was my third user-reported bug caused by my use of kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise that I just didn't bother trying to fix it and reverted to using NSFilesPromisePboardType."
