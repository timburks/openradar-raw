    description: "If you have a UITextView and you set both the editable and selectable properties to NO, if you then access any of the properties defined on the UITextInputTraits protocol your app will crash with an \"unrecognized selector sent to instance\" exception.\r\n\r\nThe selectable property is new in iOS 7.  But in iOS 6 if the editable property was NO you could still access the UITextInputTraits properties without a problem.\r\n\r\nCalling respondsToSelector: on a UITextView for any of the UITextInputTraits properties returns YES.  One would expect to be able to call the methods if the instance reports that it responds to those selectors.\r\n\r\nNote that this bug only seems to express when the UITextView is created in a Storyboard or XIB. UITextView's created in code (with minimal setup, basically just setting text, frame, selectable and editable) work as expected (ie, don't crash)."
