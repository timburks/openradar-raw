    description: "The FaceTime HD camera on 2013 MacBook Airs doesn't work in certain applications like iMovie 9.0.9, or ScreenFlow 4.0.5. It works as expected in Photo Booth and FaceTime.  The camera does not show up as available in iMovie and ScreenFlow.  This problem does not exist in 10.8.4, and copying the /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin from 10.8.4 fixes it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install iMovie 9.0.9 on a MacBook Air 2013 running 10.8.5.\r\n2. Launch iMovie.\r\n3. Press the \"Camera\" button to use the iSight camera built into the MacBook Air 2013.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe window should open up with the camera activated, allowing you to record yourself in iMovie with the MBA's built in iSight camera.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message comes up saying \"No camera detected.\"  Checking the System Profiler shows a FaceTime HD camera in the Camera section, and Photo Booth and FaceTime apps both work as expected.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.8.5 (12F37)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConfirmed here - http://www.imore.com/os-x-1085-breaks-facetime-camera-compatibility-some-third-party-apps-mid-2013-macbook-airs\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nMacBookAir6,2 running 10.8.5 (12F37) has the problem occur.  Same MacBook Air running 10.8.4 does not experience the problem."
