    description: "This year at WWDC, session 227 (Solutions to Common Date and Time Challenges) brought up a lot of nice calendar additions (really great stuff) that were said to be \"not yet available for iOS\". These are the methods tagged __NSCALENDAR_COND_IOS_7_0 in NSCalendar.h.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if these were available for iOS as well."
