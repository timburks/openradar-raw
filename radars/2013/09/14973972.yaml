    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen scrolling through a UICollectionView each cell is being initialised each time and no cell is being resued. I have been able to confirm this by overriding the prepareForReuse method and checking if it is called, but it's not. initWithReuseIdentifier: style: is always called though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate UICollectionView and a custom UICollectionViewCell programatically. Obviously register the class with the collection view and with an appropriate reuseIdentifier. In cellForRow retrieve a cell using the identifier and indexPath.\r\nOverride the prepareForReuse method to check if the cells are reused. If the same problem has arisen for you, then they will be being initialised each time.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe UICollectionViewCell subclasses should be being reused. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UICollectionViewCell subclass is being initialised each time.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 and iOS 7 GM. It has been a problem since Beta 5 and DP5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMassive problem, please sort this out because I was surprised to see it still broken in the GM.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on both my iPod Touch 5th Gen as well as each iPhone simulator."
