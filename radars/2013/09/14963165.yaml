    description: "Summary:\r\nI 'clean' my screen with my finger all the time while launching apps. On iOS7 GM this results in seeing the homescreen in 'edit' mode, or being able to drag the default.png across the screen + when the app is finished launching it will 'wiggle' for a few seconds just like a homescreen icon.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take a not so fast iPhone; say iPhone 4.\r\n2. Launch an app (cold-launch, not one that is already in memory)\r\n3. While launching tap and hold on the screen.\r\n4. Outcome varies: sometimes you get to see the homescreen in 'edit' mode, sometimes you get to drag the Default.png across the screen. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing should happen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes you get to see the homescreen in 'edit' mode, sometimes you get to drag the Default.png across the screen + when the app is finished launching it will 'wiggle' for a few seconds just like a homescreen icon.\r\n\r\nAfter launching the app will work fine. It will return from homescreen to the app.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7 GM (11A465)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are some screenshot of the scenarios.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'wiggling.PNG', 'dragging default.PNG' and 'back to homescreen.PNG' were successfully uploaded."
