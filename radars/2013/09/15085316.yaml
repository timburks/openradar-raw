    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an Xcode project with a UnitTest target for iOS and a MacUnitTest  for OSX. The unit tests work on the respective platforms when run via Test. But the new inline checks where you can run individual tests only work for one platform at a time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Look at the provided sample app\r\n2. for each of the 3 schemes run Test (CMD-U) - works.\r\n3. open MacUnitTest.m while having the MacUnitTest scheme selected\r\n4. click on the red x next to -(void)testExample\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe individual test case should be executed based on the currently selected scheme.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou get the message \"The run destination My Mac 64-bit is not valid for tests you have chosen to perform. Please select a run destination which supports the tests that you wish to perform\".\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 5.0 (5A1413)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nif instead of the source browser look at the test case navigator you see that the tests from the currently selected scheme are black and the others are gray. If you switch between the UnitTest and MacUnitTest schemes these adapt and you are always able to execute the tests via the small play buttons.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that here is a bug, since the inline test launch buttons should always match the currently selected scheme, like in the test navigator.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n10.8.5 iMac 27\""
