    description: "NSFilesPromisePboardType has a note in the documentation:\r\n\r\n> On OS X v10.6 and later, use (NSString *)kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise instead.\r\n\r\nIn Google Chrome 29 I switched from NSFilesPromisePboardType to kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise. The complaints about how drag-and-drop broke came pouring in, and I had to revert.\r\n\r\nThere are four issues I am reporting; this is one of them. I will update this radar with links to the other three when I am done filing them all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise is used to do drag-and-drop, dropped files aren't selected.\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n- Drag a promised file to a Finder window and drop it there\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- The newly created file is selected, like it was when NSFilesPromisePboardType was used\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- The newly created file is not selected\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use an AppleEvent to select the new file. The function that I wrote took 80 lines of code. The problem is that the workaround isn't perfect; it brings the window to the front of the Finder's window list, whereas using NSFilesPromisePboardType selected the item but didn't touch the window list order.\r\n\r\nkPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise needs to have exactly the same file selection behavior as NSFilesPromisePboardType."
