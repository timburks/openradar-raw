    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the dictionary you pass for discoveryInfo in  \r\n-[MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser initWithPeer:discoveryInfo:serviceType:]\r\nor\r\n-[MCAdvertiserAssistant initWithServiceType:discoveryInfo:session:]\r\nNOTHING happens.\r\n\r\nNo warnings or errors and nothing happens on the device advertising as well as nothing on the browsing device.\r\nIt acts like it just never ran.\r\n\r\nThis leads to not knowing what is happening.\r\nAt very least a warning should be logged.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser or MCAdvertiserAssistant and pass in a large dictionary (such as one containing NSData for a small image) for the discoveryInfo and create the rest of a MC NearBy project normally.\r\n2. Run and notice nothing happens with advertising, and there is no logging of any sorts.\r\n3. Change the discoveryInfo to nil or a small dictionary and try again, and see that it works.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEither a warning or error should be logged.\r\nPerhaps if the discoveryInfo is too large the object is not created and instead returns nil.\r\nPerhaps is its too large it just ignores the discoveryInfo and works as if the discoveryInfo had been set as nil. This with an warning/error logged to the console would make it so things still somewhat work, while at the same time letting the developer know what the problem is.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo warnings or errors and nothing happens on the device advertising as well as nothing on the browsing device.\r\nIt acts like it just never ran.\r\n\r\nThis leads to not knowing what is happening.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 and iOS 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens when the discoveryInfo is larger then is allowed (as listed in docs)\r\n\r\nHappens in attached sample code.\r\nAlso happens in Apple's own sample code \"MultipeerGroupChat\" if you pass a large dictionary to the discoveryInfo \r\n(https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MultipeerGroupChat/)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MultipeerConnectivity.zip' was successfully uploaded."
