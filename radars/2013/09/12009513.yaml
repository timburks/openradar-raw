    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen providing Apps to Customers I always struggle to give them the best user experience possible. There are situations where this is crucial, e.g. in very bright sunlight, the display of the iDevice is only very hard to read. I recognized that using BLACK & WHITE only colors with strong contrast improves readability in these situations a LOT!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse an iDevice in ver bright sunlight, e.g. when you are on a boat sailing on the sea, checking for direction on a map e.g.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI get a UIDeviceNotification about lighting conditions of the environment which allows my app to optimize colorschemes and display elements to be better readable in sunlight.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no access to the environmental brightness sensor or a notification mechanism which allows for monitoring this stuff.\r\n\r\nIt would help a lot of people to improve their apps to make them much more usable in bright sunlight conditions. Also adjusting the app to darkness would allow a LOT better user experience in low light conditions."
