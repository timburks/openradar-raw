    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a method returns a GLKMatrix4 or similar type, creating an NSMethodSignature for it throws an exception.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In an Objective-C class, write an instance method with the return type GLKMatrix4. For this example weâ€™ll call it -testMethod.\r\n2. In another method in this class, try to make a method signature for -testMethod by calling +instanceMethodSignatureForSelector: on its class.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n+instanceMethodSignatureForSelector: will return a method signature or nil.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt throws an exception.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been a problem for all versions of iOS I have tested.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhere this really causes a problem for me is in using the open-source BDD framework Kiwi with a GLKit game."
