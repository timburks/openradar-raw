    description: "Summary:\r\nMy projects on Xcode server were refusing to build due to an inability to find headers. Turns out I was using an absolute path in Framework Search Paths. It would be very helpful for Xcode to issue this as a configuration warning (it's bad practice to use absolute paths that aren't POSIX ones like /usr/bin) or as a warning when initializing Xcode CI.\r\n\r\n(not that it would have helped, since I use the web interface).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have since run a basic regular expression on all my .pbxproj files. I find this works well."
