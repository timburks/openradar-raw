    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS6 and until iOS7 beta 5, when an update is released for an app, when you look at the app page, you see the total ratings for all versions (especially in case not enough ratings received yet).\r\n\r\nNow, since iOS7 beta 6, the current version's ratings are shown, no matter what.\r\n\r\nThis is very discouraging and will cause releasing versions very cautiously, which we think is a very bad thing for developers, users and Apple.\r\n\r\nAttached screenshots of the App Store showing latest version of Piano Dust Buster in both iOS6 and iOS7. Notice\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nJust look at the App Store modal pop-up for a newly updated app with less than 5 ratings in iOS6 vs iOS7\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe ratings should show the total number, not just for the newly released version\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo ratings are actually shown, which causes a drop in downloads for the new version\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.2"
