    description: "Example project available at https://github.com/benoberkfell/radar_15090681\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nDismissing a UIDocumentInteractionController in some cases will remove the presenting view controller's views.  This happens when the UIDocumentInteractionController's presenting view controller was wrapped in a UINavigationController presented with the UIModalPresentationPageSheet or UIModalPresentationFormSheet style. \r\n\r\nWhen the UIDocumentInteractionController is dismissed, the presenting view controller's views are removed, including elements from the UINavigationController.  What remains are a UIDimmingView, UIDropShadowView, and a UIImageView.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRefer to sample project, or do the following\r\n\r\n1. Create a new empty iOS application in Xcode 5\r\n2. Define a root view controller, with a button\r\n3. That button's target is a function which instantiates another view controller (\"Presenting View Controller\"), wrapped in a UINavigationController\r\n4.  Define the \"Presenting View Controller\" to be a UIDocumentInteractionControllerDelegate; documentInteractionControllerViewControllerForPreview should return \"self\"\r\n5. \"Presenting View Controller\" has a button which presents a UIDocumentInteractionController with a local file URL\r\n6. Observe that the UIDocumentInteractionController appears correctly\r\n7. Observe when dismissing the UIDocumentInteractionController that \"Presenting View Controller's\" UI elements are gone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the UIDocumentInteractionController to dismiss and the presenting view controller's views to remain\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UIDocumentInteractionController dismisses and the presenting view controller's views are removed, leaving a plain white/gray box where the presenting view controller formerly existed.  The app no longer responds to any touch events after this point.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7/11A465\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on iPad Simulator (iOS 7.0) and iPad 3 (Wifi) running iOS 7 11A465\r\n\r\nDoes not matter whether the application was compiled against the iOS 6.1 or iOS 7 SDK"
