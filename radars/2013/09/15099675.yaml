    description: "Summary:\r\nWould you please consider making an ergonomic keyboard?\r\n\r\nI absolutely love the feel of the current keyboard design and especially how quiet it is but unfortunately I have to use an ergonomic desktop keyboard.  Using a standard angle straight keyboard on my the MacBook Pro keyboard or an external Apple keyboard causes too much wrist pain.\r\n\r\nI've tried so many ergo keyboards over the years but although they felt better than a standard keyboard, the quality was always sub-par.\r\nI'm currently using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, which is a good keyboard but has a few annoying issues.  The key layouts are comfortable and the back angle tilt is wonderful.   However, it is so loud!  When I'm typing fast, the clacks of the keys annoys everyone in the room so much that they turn and glare.  I have to slow down my typing just to keep it quiet.\r\n\r\nI know that Apple has always prided themselves on quality products with wonderful user experiences.  I think a high quality ergo keyboard\r\nbased on the current keyboard design would be a wonderful addition to not only Apple's product line but also the ergo keyboard market in\r\ngeneral.  The current ergo keyboard options out there are disappointing.\r\n\r\nObviously the simplest design would be for the desktop keyboard but an ergo split keyboard on a MacBook Pro would be just over the top\r\nawesome.  I think there is plenty of space on the 15\" and 17\" models for a split keyboard.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy any Apple computer that comes with a keyboard\r\nor\r\nvisit an Apple Retail store and see the normal straight keyboards for sale on the shelves.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOpen the box\r\nBe pleasantly surprised to see an ergonomic split keyboard\r\nDance a little jig around the room waving my hands in the air knowing that I won't be in pain when using my new computer\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOpen the box.\r\nBe excited to get a new computer but slightly disappointed that it won't be a comfortable experience.\r\nSit down at the keyboard and depressingly slip on my wrist braces.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMacBookPro8,2\r\nOSX 10.8.5\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt always occurs because you haven't made an awesome ergonomic keyboard, yet."
