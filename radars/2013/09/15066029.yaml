    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the UIAppearance API:\r\n1. NavBar's barTintColor is set to blue\r\n2. NavBar's tintColor is set to white\r\n\r\nAlso the application's window tintColor is set to white.\r\n\r\nWhen presenting the MFMailComposeViewController, the navigation buttons are barely visible because they are still shown in the default blue.\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, setting the navBar's tint color to white should change the button titles to white:\r\n\r\n\"In iOS 7, a navigation barâ€™s tintColor affects the color of the back indicator image, button titles, and button images. The barTintColor property affects the color of the bar itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe presented MailComposerViewController does correctly change the background color of the navigation bar to blue, however fails to change the bar button titles color.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've attached a modified version of the MailComposer sample.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBesides of the navigation bar's background color, the navigation buttons should also update their color to white.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe navBar's background color is updated (to blue), however the button's titles remain turquoise (default tint color) \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MessageComposer.zip' was successfully uploaded."
