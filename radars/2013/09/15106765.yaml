    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Auto Layout system fails to throw an exception when a view:\r\n• Has a constant intrinsic width\r\n• Has a content hugging priority of 1000 (\"required\")\r\n• Has an explicit width constraint different from its intrinsic width, also required\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new application from the Empty Application template\r\n2. Add a subclass of UIView that returns a constant CGSize as its intrinsicContentSize (e.g. 50x50)\r\n3. Add an instance of this subclass as a subview of the app's window\r\n4. Set the view's content hugging priority to required along the horizontal axis\r\n5. Add a required constraint to the view setting its width to a value different from its intrinsic content width\r\n6. Run the app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAuto Layout should determine that the required content hugging & width constraints conflict and throw an exception.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app runs without throwing an exception. The view respects the explicit width constraint, ignoring its required content hugging."
