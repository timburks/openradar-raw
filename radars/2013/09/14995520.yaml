    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a user taps on a home screen folder, there are two ways to dismiss it and go back to the home screen: tap outside of the folder or click the home button. But my muscle memory learned that \"5-finger pinch in\" gesture means \"home screen\" and I found myself instinctively trying to pinch the screen instead of tapping outside. This is especially because in iOS 7 a folder doesn't just \"roll out\", but covers the whole screen (like an app).\r\n\r\nI've had a family member play around with my dev iPad and I noticed that they too had a \"5-finger pinch in reflex\" when they tapped on a folder\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap on any folder on the home screen\r\n2. Try to do the 4/5-finger pinch-in gesture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder follows the fingers pinching in, closes, and reveals the home screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM on iPad 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is closely related to rdar://14995487\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
