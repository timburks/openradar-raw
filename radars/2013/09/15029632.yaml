    description: "When you use 3 finger swipe to close apps in the multitasking view when more than 6 apps are opened, on certain occasions the icon doesn't seem to disappear. We've replicated the issue on the iPhone 5 as well as the 5th gen iPod Touch running iOS7 as of 19th September\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open >6 apps\r\n2. Switch to the multitasking view\r\n3. With the 3 finger swipe gesture, try & close 3 apps at the same time, either from the middle of the stack (or) from the end of the stack\r\n4. If you're not able to view the issue, try again with the second set of 3 apps\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe expected result would be to only see the screens & icons of the apps which are running in the background & not of those which have been dismissed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual result is that we're able to see the icon even after dismissing the screen from the multitasking view"
