    description: "Summary:\r\nI have a storyboard with a table view that currently has static cells in several sections. I have a new requirement that means I need to dynamically hide/show cells based upon application state, so the logical thing to do would be to change the table view to use dynamic cell prototypes instead of a static cell layout.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I change the table view's Content property from \"Static Cells\" to \"Dynamic Prototypes\", all of the cell prototypes outside of the first section disappear, and I have to recreate them as new cell prototypes, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if switching between Static Cells and Dynamic Prototypes would retain the existing cells.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new project that uses storyboards\r\n2. Create a table view controller, set the content type to \"Static Cells\", set the number of sections to a value greater than 1, and add cells to the sections.\r\n3. Change the content type to \"Dynamic Prototypes\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that all the cells I created will still be present as cell prototypes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll cells outside of the first section are deleted and cannot be recovered.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 4.6.3"
