    description: "Please allow apps to have a defined Icon-Set of Icons to to be displayed as an App-Icon depending on different states of the App (The Icons should be recognizably from the same look and feel and fit to the main icon). This way the App could easily communicate its inner state (e.g also background enabled apps) without me to open the app. Apps like \"Celsius\" which \"misuse\" notifications MUST tell you that this is something users want to have. You are even doing this with the Calendar app.\r\n\r\nrefers to radar with id: 11390641"
