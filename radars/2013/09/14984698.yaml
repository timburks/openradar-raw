    description: "Summary:\r\nAs I learned from the developer forum, there is a handy feature within the Info.plist of an app called UIBackgroundStyle, which apparently can be set to UIBackgroundStyleDarkBlur and UIBackgroundStyleLightBlur. This feature seems to be private API, but it would be very much appreciated if this would be public.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set UIBackgroundStyle in Info.plist of an app to UIBackgroundStyleDarkBlur\r\n2. Set background of app window and main view controller to clear color and not opaque\r\n3. Have a nice blurred version of the home screen backround on the main view of your app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUIBackgroundStyle should be a public API\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApps fail validation on submission."
