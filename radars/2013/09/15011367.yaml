    description: "Summary:\r\nDevelopers have no control over older versions of their apps that are now being offered to customers whose devices are not able to run the latest version.\r\n\r\nBecause developers cannot fix old bugs, ensure that old features continue working, nor manage feature expectations properly, this feature is rife with customer support problems that developers have absolutely no control over.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n1) You release a 6.1.6 version of your app. It has a few new features and fixes some bugs. Works on iOS 6.0+\r\n\r\n2) You decide you want to go iOS 7 only with your next release. You create version 7.0 of your app and drop iOS 6 support.\r\n\r\n3) Customers who have not yet updated to iOS 7 are still downloading 6.1.6 because it's the last version supported on their OS.\r\n\r\n4) Things are great, version 7.0 is well received, people can still use 6.1.6.\r\n\r\n5) A major security bug is found in 6.1.6\r\n\r\nNow, new users are still buying 6.1.6, but there is no way to update that version, or even to warn users that they should upgrade to iOS 7 to get the latest version.\r\n\r\nDevelopers need to be able to know which old versions are being made available so that they can set expectations appropriately.\r\n\r\nDevelopers need to be able to update old versions of apps to fix security problems, etc. if they arise.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Release an app for iOS 6.0+\r\n2. Release an update that only supports iOS 7.0+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt is expected that the old version of the app that supported iOS 6 would no longer be available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUsers can now download the old version on iOS 6, even though developer intention was that it would no longer be available on iOS 6."
