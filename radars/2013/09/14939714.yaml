    description: "State: Duplicate                   Product: OS X\r\nRank: 3 - Medium\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDuplicate of 10535951 (Open)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn previous versions of OS X (<10.9), Mission Control's gesture (swipe up 3 or 4 fingers) allowed the user to be a continuous gesture, this means that at the time of swiping-up you could cancel the swipe by quickly swiping down, and the user could play with this swipe back-and-forth without any limitation.\r\n\r\nIn Mavericks, this changed. Now Mission Control's gestures (at least the first one to revelate the desktops) is one-way only. You can only swipe one at a time. If you swipe-up you have to lift your hand and swipe-down. \r\n\r\nI think the User Experience loss for people that were use to this gesture is a big one. It is really frustrating, you kind of feel a loss of freedom. A limitation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mavericks (any DP up to 7)\r\n2. Enable Mission Control touchpad swipe gesture.\r\n3. Swipe-up (3 or 4 fingers as configured previously)\r\n4. Without lifting nor moving your hand/fingers, try to swipe-down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMission control would close and go back to actual desktop.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwipe-down doesn't perform. You have to lift fingers/hand.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.9 Mavericks (up to dp 7)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo workaround found.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nIt occurs in mavericks (up to dp 7). Previous OSX releases UX was ok.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
