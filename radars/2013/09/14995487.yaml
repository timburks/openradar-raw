    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a user opens Newsstand, the only way to get out of it is to use the home button. This is confusing, because it looks and works a lot like an app — it opens like an app and covers the whole screen — but a gesture that works in all apps (5-finger pinch to reveal Home Screen) doesn't work here.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap on Newsstand icon on the home screen\r\n2. Try to do the 4/5-finger pinch in gesture\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNewsstand follows the fingers pinching in, closes, and reveals the home screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM on iPad 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nthis is closely related to rdar://14995520\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
