    description: "Summary:\r\nPre iOS7 beta 5, a background view of a UITableView would receive touch events if a user touched where there was no cell covering it up (for example, if you used contentInset to make some empty space at the top). Now the touches are always intercepted by the undocumented UITableViewWrapperView class (discovered by printing out UITouch began events to the console in Xcode). This breaks previous functionality.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UITableView with a vertical contentInset (example {100, 0, 0, 0})\r\n2. Add a backgroundView to the tableview with a UIGestureRecognizer attached to it.\r\n3. Add a few dummy cells to the UITableView's data source\r\n4. Observe that tapping the portion of the table without cells does not trigger the backgroundView's gesture recognizer (in this example, the top 100 pts when scrolled to the top)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping the uncovered backgroundView should cause the hitTest to fall through to that backgroundView\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe touch is intercepted by UITableViewWrapperView\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS7 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nDoes not seem to occur prior to iOS7 Beta 5. Works as expected in iOS 6.1.4\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
