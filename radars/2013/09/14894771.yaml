    description: "Summary:\r\nCode folding when an individual method or a selection of methods in Xcode 5 does not work.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fold all methods/functions within an implementation file (*.m)\r\n2. Select a line or multiple lines of text containing an entire folded function or range of folded functions (e.g.: - (void)viewDidLoad{…})\r\n3. Select Editor / Code Folding /  Unfold from the menu, or the relevant keyboard shortcut (⎇⌘→)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll functions/methods contained within the selected line(s) should unfold, as per Xcode 4 behaviour. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe methods/functions fail to unfold.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 Version 5.0 (5A11386k)\r\nOS X 10.8.4 (Build 12E55)\r\n\r\nOccurs every time when attempting to unfold methods or functions.\r\n\r\nIt will work if the keyboard focus is within the range contained by the bracketed ellipsis representing the folded content (\"{…}\"), but not if the selected text range is larger than this."
