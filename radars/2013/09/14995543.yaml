    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you tap on an app icon, its screenshot scales up from the icon to cover the whole screen — looks great! When you tap on the home button, it scales back to its icon — awesome.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you close the app using the 5-finger pinch instead of the home button, it just scales back to the center of the screen instead of to its icon (like in iOS 6). Inconsistent and arguably not as cool-looking.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to the home screen.\r\n2. Tap on an app icon\r\n3. Pinch in with 4/5 fingers\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe screen nicely scales back to the app's icon the same way as if you used the home button to close the app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screen scales back to the center of the screen.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM on iPad 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOf course, when the current home screen state is different from when the app was launched (the page/folder is different), app's screen can't scale back to its icon and will just scale back to the center of the screen — this is how using home button works now. But when the home screen _is_ in the same state, 5-finger pinch should IMHO work the same way.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related are 14995520 and 14995487\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
