    description: "NSFilesPromisePboardType has a note in the documentation:\r\n\r\n> On OS X v10.6 and later, use (NSString *)kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise instead.\r\n\r\nIn Google Chrome 29 I switched from NSFilesPromisePboardType to kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise. The complaints about how drag-and-drop broke came pouring in, and I had to revert.\r\n\r\nThere are four issues I am reporting; this is one of them. I will update this radar with links to the other three when I am done filing them all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise is used to do drag-and-drop, dock icons do not highlight when files are dragged across them.\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n- Drag a promised image file over the Preview or Photoshop dock icons\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- The Preview or Photoshop dock icons will highlight, and will accept the drop if it is dropped, like it was when NSFilesPromisePboardType was used\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n- The Preview or Photoshop dock icons do not highlight and do not accept any drops\r\n\r\nWorkaround: none"
