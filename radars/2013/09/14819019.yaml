    description: "Summary:\r\nThe animation from normal to edit mode in an ABPersonViewController looks ugly for iOS 6 apps running on iOS 7. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse any app build for iOS 6 that includes an ABPersonViewController. For instance, open the QuickContacts sample app in Xcode 4.6 (in order to compile it under the 6.1 SDK) and install it on an iPhone running iOS 7 beta.\r\nTap \"Display and Edit Contact\" (requires a contact named \"John Appleseed\")\r\nTap \"Edit\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cell animations should look \"right\", like on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter the animation to Edit mode is already finished, the cells are halfway hidden for a short period of time. It looks like a jalousette effect.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works fine on iOS 6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee screenshot: http://d.pr/i/GJci and movie: http://d.pr/v/zvDS\r\nsee also: rdar://14818957 TableView row animation slightly shifts tableHeaderView while animating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations, 18-Sep-2013 10:38 PM:\r\nThe problem seems to go away if you build with the iOS 7 SDK.  Please verify and let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrtwin Gentz, 19-Sep-2013 10:46 PM:\r\nThat's true but I filed the bug specifically for the case where it's built with the iOS 6 SDK."
