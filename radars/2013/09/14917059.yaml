    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up a scheme which uses a different build configuration which has a different info.plist assigned, this is not respected by the Xcode 5 project editor Info tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsteps 1-5 can be skipped if you open the attached demo-project\r\n1. create a new [empty iOS-] project \r\n2. duplicate the Debug build configuration as Debug2\r\n3. duplicate Info.plist file as Info2.plist and set is as info-plist of the Debug2 build configuration\r\n4. change the bundle-id in the Info2.plist\r\n5. duplicate the existing scheme and set the build configuration to use in it to Debug2 at all instances\r\n\r\n6. open the project inspector by clicking the project file in Xcode 5\r\n7. open the info Tab\r\n8. switch back and forth between the two schemes, which reflect the two build configs and observe the bundle id in the \"Info\" or \"General\" tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe shown bundle id should change each time one switches between the schemes/build configs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe shown bundle id remains the same and isn't deterministically influenced by switching scheme.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 preview 6"
