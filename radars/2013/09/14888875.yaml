    description: "Summary:\r\nUISegmentedControls do not allow to put AccessibilityLabels/-Hints on the Control itself and int is even trickier to make single segments accessible. Only AccessibilityLabels on NSString and UIImage (as an undocumented workaround work) actually. But especially for String titels it is important to have also AccessibilityHints available.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Try to use Accessibilty enhancements on UISegmentedControl and its segements\r\n\r\n2. See how it fails when turning on VoiceOver mode\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can set Labels & Hints for Accessibility on the Control itself an on the segments.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly partial support is given at the moment.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6.1.3/10B329\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
