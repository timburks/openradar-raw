    description: "Summary:\r\nBeginning in iOS 7, canOpenURL: takes 10-20x as long to execute than in all previous iOS versions.  Interestingly, it appears to only slow down on devices with a SIM.  This is detrimental to my app (Launch Center Pro) which provides the user with URL scheme actions usable on their system.  Scanning our list of ~1700 known URL schemes previously took ~1-2 seconds on an iPhone 5.  It now takes ~20+ seconds.  On an iPad or iPod Touch, it remains fast.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Launch Xcode 5\r\n\r\n2) Set up some basic time logging or watch instruments\r\n\r\n3) Make call(s) to canOpenURL like so:\r\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] canOpenURL:url];\r\n\r\n4) Observe time variation on different devices, include those with and without a SIM.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe expect performance on par with previous iOS versions, or iOS 7 on devices without a SIM.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOn devices with a SIM, the processing time is 10-20x longer than those without, or on all devices in iOS 6.x and earlier.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, memory allocations within the related private framework seem to grow on problem-devices.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 GM (And previous betas)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe attached test project iterates through a large sample array of URL schemes.  Total elapsed time is measured.  In my testing, when run on an iPad Mini with iOS 7 GM, it completes in ~2 seconds.  Running on an iPhone 5 with iOS 7 GM, it completes in ~22 seconds.  (And almost instantly (0.2 seconds) in the Simulator.)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThrough our testing and testing of others, the problem appears on devices running iOS 7.0 (all betas and GM) which also have a SIM installed.  \r\n\r\nSome users report that removing the SIM and resetting all settings (in Settings.app) causes the problem to go away.  Re-inserting the SIM causes the problem to return.  (I've not independently confirmed this.)\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'CanOpenUrlTest.zip' was successfully uploaded."
