    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using UISearchDisplayController, the search results table can be scrolled too far so that no results are visible anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the AdvancedTableSearch sample project, build it under Xcode 4.6 and run it on an iOS 7 beta device.\r\nEnter the search bar and type \"i\".\r\nScroll all the way to the bottom.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScrolling should bounce since the content (7 cells) is not large enough.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe tableView can be scrolled so far that all results are invisible.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works fine on iOS 6.1.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nrdar://14807983 UISearchDisplayController lets tap on black dimming view go through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently, the bug is triggered when typing and deleting the search word:\r\n\r\nType \"i\", delete it and type \"i\" again => When scrolling all the way down, \"MacBook Air\" is still shown.\r\n\r\nRepeat that and it can be scrolled even further so that no results are visible when scrolling all the way down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple Developer Relations, 27-Aug-2013 06:06 PM:\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested a test case/sample app in order to further investigate this issue.\r\n\r\nTest Case/Sample App Requirements:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ios/test-case/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrtwin Gentz, 28-Aug-2013 01:07 AM:\r\n\r\nPlease use the AdvancedTableSearch Apple sample project. As described the problem occurs with every app using UISearchDisplayController built on Xcode 4.6 and run on an iOS 7 device."
