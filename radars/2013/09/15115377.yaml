    description: "Summary:\r\nThe behavior of -[AVAssetWriter finishWritingWithCompletionHandler:] is different between iOS 6 and iOS 7 with regards to whether the calling object needs to retain a reference to the AVAssetWriter.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 6, if you retain a reference, the completion handler is never called; if you do not retain the reference, the completion handler gets called.\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7, the situation is the exact opposite. Retaining the AVAssetWriter results in the completion handler getting called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild and run the attached project. There is a single view controller; the switch controls whether the AVAssetWriter is retained or not. The \"Go!\" button kicks off the build of the movie. On success, the movie is shown; on failure, the spinner just spins.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the behavior to be consistent between versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI see different behavior between ios6 and 7 builds.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nSee above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWorkaround is to add a check based on the iOS version\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nVersions I have tested where retaining the AVAssetWriter is required:\r\n\r\nSimulator running iOS7 32-bit\r\nSimulator running iOS 7 64-bit\r\niPod Touch (ME643LL/A) running iOS 7.0 (11A465)\r\niPhone 4S (MD278LL/A) running iOS 7.0.2 (11A501)\r\n\r\nVersions where the AVAssetWriter must not be retained:\r\n\r\nSimulator running iOS 6.0\r\nSimulator running iOS 6.1\r\niPod Touch (MC540LL/A) running iOS 6.1.3 (10B329)\r\n\r\n(When submitting to Apple, I included repro source; cannot include here for NDA reasons.)"
