    description: "Summary:\r\nWe have a webclip delivered via MDM to our customers.  This webclip contains links to work apps they can install.  When the users upgrade to iOS 7 and click on the install link the webclip transitions to a white screen and hangs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install webclip with fullscreen mode on iOS 6 over MDM.  Webclip should have links to apps to install from AppStore.\r\n2. Open webclip on iOS 6 and choose an app link to install it.  Webclip should minimize and send you to springboard where the app is now installing.\r\n3. Upgrade device to iOS 7.\r\n4. Open webclip, now on iOS 7, and select an app link to install it.  Webclip transitions to white screen and hangs here.  Does not transition to springboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected fullscreen mode with webclips to work on iOS 7 like they did on iOS 6.  Expected webclip to not hang at white screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWebclip transitions to white screen and hangs there when link is choosen and webclip is running in fullscreen mode.  Does not transition to springboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a duplicate of 14689345, 14603982, and others.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 4s"
