    description: We should be able to see a list of all previous (approved) versions of an app and indicate whether it should be made available to older devices or not. This should be a toggle that we can change back and forth as needed. Since an app may rely on server functionality that may be removed etc so we'll disallow that version from being downloaded again. But user demand may indicate that we need to re-enable such a feature and then can allow that app to be downloaded again etc.

    title: The App Store now allows users to install older versions of apps on older devices, but devs have no way to remove an older version if it's broken
