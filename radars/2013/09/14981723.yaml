    description: "Our app icons have a white border (similar to traffic signs). Due to the new border radius in iOS 7, we need to specify different icons for iOS 6 and 7. However, the 58x58 icon is used both on iOS 7 (Settings) and iOS 6 (spotlight, settings).\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the question to design for only one OS release and have an ugly icon with a non-matching border radius on the other OS release."
