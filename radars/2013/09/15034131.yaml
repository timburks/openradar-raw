    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode 5 production build.\r\n\r\nIf a Test scheme causes two test targets to execute where both targets have an empty Test Target setting, the last test causes a Simulator In Use error.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Xcode 5 on OS X 10.8.4.\r\n2. Create an iOS application.\r\n3. Create two test targets using OCUnit.\r\n4. In build settings for both targets, clear out the Test Host setting.\r\n5. Cmd+U to run tests.\r\n\r\nThe attached project exhibits this case.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTests all run and pass/fail\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter some test targets run, Xcode displays a Simulator In Use error.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.8.4, Xcode 5 production.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSetting the debugger to None instead of LLDB also does not trigger this problem. This style of test target worked in Xcode 4.6.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI see it on 10.8.4, others at Facebook see it in Mavericks. Using a Test Host does not trigger this problem, but that is not an acceptable workaround.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'SimulatorInUseBug.zip' was successfully uploaded."
