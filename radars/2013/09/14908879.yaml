    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to launch an iOS app in the Simulator from Xcode, the developer receives an unhelpful \"The Simulator can't be launched because it is already in use.\" alert view. This is almost acceptable when only two projects are open, but when more are open it results in the developer searching through project windows, looking for the one that has the full-black Stop icon.\r\n\r\nPlease provide better ways of identifying and navigating to the project in question. Possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Provide the name of the project using Simulator in the alert. Better yet, provide \"show project\" and/or \"stop simulator\" buttons right on the alert.\r\n\r\n2. YouTube has started a commendable practice of prefixing the window title with a Play icon when playing, so you can identify which windows/tabs have an active video. A similar indicator for projects in the Window menu would be a great help, especially when trying to find the Simulator project without having run into the alert view."
