    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you propare your app to make full use of VoiceOver's accessibility features you are often stuck by a rather annoying thing:\r\n\r\nVoiceOver picks after e.g. a new pushed ViewController in an UINavigationController as the first element everytime the TOP-LEFT element which is often the leftBarButtonItem.\r\n\r\nNot always is his the best choice for perfect UXP. Especially on modal viewcontrollers it would be a great help to give developers control over following things to improve the overall UXP in VoiceOver:\r\n\r\n- Pick the element which will be selected by VoiceOver as the FIRST spoken element\r\n- Give some hints on the order of elements (e.g using some additional accessibilityOrderId's)\r\n- Allow developers to present or override the first spoken message and do NOT force speaking of the first element at all immediately, because often a custom message can improve the UXP significantly and the ALWAYS spoken first element label conflicts with other accessibility messages which are better suited\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. try to customize accessibility beyond just automatically spoken labels & hints\r\n\r\n2. see that you have nearly no control on order, timing and choice of startelements\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to have control over:\r\n1. Determination of the default first element to be spoken\r\n2. Control over the timing & occurrence WHEN first message is spoken if AT ALL\r\n3. A way to give VoiceOver some hints like an accessibilityElementOrderId to optimize swipe-flow of elements\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNone of the above is possible at the moment which leads to following problems:\r\n\r\n1. Spoken first messages often interrupt the workwflow and are wrong for the context\r\n2. Timing of first spoken message often interferes with custom defined messages and is NOT overridable/replaceable\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 6.1.3"
