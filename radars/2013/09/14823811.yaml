    description: "I'm missing the contentView property for UIAlertView as announced in the WWDC session https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/videos/#201\r\n\r\nThis seemed like a very useful addition!\r\n\r\nWithout this, we've to roll our own custom made UI elements which is a) a lot of work and b) leads to an inconsistent UI across apps."
