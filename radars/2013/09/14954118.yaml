    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the application starts up for the first time on a device (or after a reset on the simulator), -[NSFileManager fileExistsAtPath:path] for a path within the application's iCloud container returns NO even for ubiquitous files that do exist.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a guaranteed method of determining whether or not a file exists in the iCloud container, even if at the time of invocation the container is not yet fully set up or initialized locally.  I would prefer a blocking call, but I'll take solace with a call that returns a status indicating the container isn't ready yet to guarantee a response to that call.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this bug causes my app to recreate the file (seeing as it's apparently missing), which leads to data loss of the file's original contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Reset the simulator\r\n2. Enable iCloud in Settings\r\n3. Install and start the app\r\n4. On application launch, invoke [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:path] where path is the path to an existing ubiquitous file in the application's ubiquity container.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYES\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNO"
