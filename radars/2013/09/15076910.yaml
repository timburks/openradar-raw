    description: "DTrace is a great tool.  We can use it on the Mac and the iOS simulator to track down bugs and identify some performance issues.  It'd be great to be able to run DTrace on an iOS device directly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write a DTrace script, say to look for NSUndoManager creation and usage, to track down an undo-related bug (is it CoreData's undo manager being used by this text field or the app's? or the window's?)\r\n2. Discover the app only works on the device (say it plays music from the itunes library)\r\n3. Read the dtrace man page to see if I can run stuff on the device\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe man page has a wonderful dtrace flag to run a script on a remote device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing.  Just sadness and despair,"
