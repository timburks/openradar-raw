Go walk the dog and surf the internet over shoddy 3G\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- see a battery warning \r\n- be able to continue to use it\r\n- the device should shut down only when the battery is empty\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- no warning is shown\r\n- the device simply shuts down (you see the spinner)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0 (11A4449d)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther users report the same issue: e.g. rdar://15056120\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5 (A1429)"
