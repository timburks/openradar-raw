    description: "Summary:\r\nUnder certain circumstances, the audio session's hardware output latency is reported to be zero, incorrectly. This can be reproduced with headphones and the Apogee Jam, and possibly other devices. This may cause issues in some apps that expect a nonzero response, and may result in latency compensation discrepancy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch an audio app that queries the hardware output latency\r\n2. Plug in headphones and an Apogee Jam (for instance)\r\n3. Query the hardware output latency\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLatency is returned (e.g. 0.002268)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nZero is returned\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0 (11A465)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached sample app demonstrating the issue: http://cl.ly/0p2D2X061Y0I\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis can be reproduced on an iPad 3 running iOS 7.0, with headphones plugged in and an Apogee Jam.\r\n\r\nLatency is correctly reported when no headphones are connected. The problem also does not arise when using Native Instruments' Komplete Audio 6 hardware via the Camera Connection Kit.\r\n\r\nThe problem does not arise on iOS 6."
