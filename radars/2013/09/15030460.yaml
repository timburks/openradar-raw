    description: "Summary:\r\nA UIWebView created for an iPhone app renders VERY differently on iPad under iOS7 compared iOS6. If a UIWebView containing a HTML page with 320 pixels is loaded (with AND without @2x retina assets), the page is rendered as a 320 frame, but the content is zoomed in at 2x resolution, and horizontal scrolling occurs with half the content offscreen. This is very problematic for any iPhone apps relying on UIWebViews as part of their view layout. Reproducible on a number of iPhone apps using UIWebViews, rendering on both a non-retina iPad 2 as well as a retina iPad 4.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a UIWebView for an iPhone application.\r\n2. Load a local HTML page with the following content.\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\r\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0\">\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\nThis is a test with a very long string to show that UIWebView has incorrect rendering when running as an iPhone app on an iPad under iOS7.\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n3. Build and deploy a binary to iPhone under iOS7. Note the rendering behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n4. Load the binary on an iPad under iOS7. Note that the rendering is occurring at twice the width expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe rendered layout should be identical under iOS7 as iOS6, with the improved crisp retina text rendering, but respecting the logical pixel dimensions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layout shows that the text is rendered into a 640 logical pixel buffer even if the frame of the UIWebView is specified as 320 pixels. Half of the layout is rendered offscreen, and horizontal scrolling can occur.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS6.1.3 and iOS7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNo workaround discovered as yet. Altering the frame of the UIWebView or altering the HTML has no effect."
