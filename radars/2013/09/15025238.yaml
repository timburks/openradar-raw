    description: "Summary:\r\nIn previous versions of iOS, if you made a text field the first responder inside of -viewWillAppear:, the keyboard would animate nicely with the view controller. If it was presented modally, it would animate from the bottom, if it was pushed on a navigation stack, it would slide in from the right etc. In iOS 7 however, it appears immediately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In -viewWillAppear: call becomeFirstResponder.\r\n2. Push that view controller onto a navigation controller.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe keyboard should animated in with the view controller similar to previous versions (as if the keyboard was already up in that view). At the very least, it should animate in some way.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe keyboard appears immediately and the view controller animates separately.\r\n\r\nExample project: http://cl.ly/2k0J0E2L351J"
