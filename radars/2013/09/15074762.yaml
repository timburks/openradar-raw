    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSince iOS 6, we can reordered main mailboxes in the root view.\r\nWe can see this Mailboxes (and account mailboxes) view in an other place in the app, when you want to move a mail.\r\nWhen moving a mail, a list of mailboxes appeared. By poping the navigation controller, we have the root mailboxes again. In iOS 7 on iPad 2, the ordered is the default one, not the reordered one.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Mail.app on iOS 7.\r\n2. Edit the tableview. change account mailboxes order.\r\n3. save it.\r\n4. Open a mail.\r\n5. Select \"move\" button, in the mailboxes list, pop to the account mailboxes list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected the new account mailboxes order, as I have on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAccount mailboxes list doesn't have the new order, but the \"default\" one, the one I see in the Settings.app.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nLooks work on iOS 6.1.3, not on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI can't test right now on others devices. I create the bug in \"iOS SDK\", even if I think \"iOS\" would be correct. I didn't find it."
