    description: "The first time I launch Mail, my Gmail account will update correctly. New mail appears. Deleted mail disappears, etc. From that point on, although other accounts refresh correctly, Gmail will not. I have to quit Mail and relaunch it to see new/changed mail.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Launch Mail.\r\n2. Either wait for Mail to attempt to retrieve new mail for the Gmail account, or ask Mail to retrieve new mail for the Gmail account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: New mail for Gmail should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results: New mail for Gmail does not appear."
