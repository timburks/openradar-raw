    description: "Summary:\r\nThis bug will lock out users from activating their iOS device if they have\r\na) Activation Lock / Find My iPhone enabled on an iOS 7 device\r\nb) Try to rename their Apple-ID (on appleid.apple.com)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Setup an iOS with an iCloud account and activate Find My iPhone in the Settings.app\r\n2) Then go to appleid.apple.com and choose to change your Apple-ID by setting up another primary email address.\r\n3) When having completed that, try to use the iOS device: You will see two major bugs.\r\n3.1) It will prompt you for entering a password to the preset, non-changeable and old Apple-ID in every place for every system-integrated Apple service that is tied to an Apple-ID.\r\n3.2) When attempting to delete the iCloud-Account from the phone to reenter credentials, Activation Lock prompts you with the same useless dialog as in 1) --> the user is not able to re-setup the new Apple-ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanging the Apple-ID on appleid.apple.com should not influence how the devices access the Apple-ID. The device should be informed the \"username\" has changed and just update the string while accessing the store through a User-ID or an access token.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee \"Steps to Reproduce\", section 3.1 and 3.2."
