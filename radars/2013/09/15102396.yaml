    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niOS 7 is a layered UI. People expect what’s-behind — the user’s wallpaper, in some cases — to show through.\r\n\r\nApple reinforces that expectation by showing the wallpaper in Apple apps.\r\n\r\nBut developers can’t use this same feature, which means they can’t use one of the expected techniques to make their apps iOS-7-like.\r\n\r\nI could understand were it a security issue, but transparent apps do not have a way of taking a screenshot of the wallpaper. They can show it, but they can’t get it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an iOS app project.\r\n\r\n2. Set UIApplicationIsOpaque to NO in Info.plist.\r\n\r\n3. Try to upload it from a non-Apple developer account.\r\n\r\n4. The validator will reject the app for using the UIApplicationIsOpaque key.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThat UIApplicationIsOpaque is public and allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNot allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\niOS 7, Xcode 5"
