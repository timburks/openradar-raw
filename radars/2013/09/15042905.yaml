    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using ld -r to produce a MH_OBJECT library from which symbols are stripped, the resulting LINKEDIT segment's vmsize does not appear to be adjusted to round_page(filesize) when linking the final executable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAn example project is attached that will crash in -[PLCrashAsyncMachOImageTests testMapSegment] when the Tests-iOS-Device target is built and run with Xcode 5 5A1413 for an arm64 target.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe tests pass successfully (as they do on Mac OS X x86/x86-64 and iOS armv7/armv7s).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe call to getsegmentdata() returns an invalid size value that extends beyond the pages mapped for the segment; the test crashes when memcmp() reads past the end of the mapped pages in the buffer returned by getsegmentdata().\r\n\r\nIf I disable the EXPORTED_SYMBOLS_FILE (-exported_symbols_list) option, the tests pass successfully. (Note that other tests in the sample project will fail)\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5 (5A1413)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5S 7.0.1\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
