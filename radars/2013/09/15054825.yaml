    description: "Summary:\r\nIn iOS versions lower than 7.0, the value for UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey would report an accurate screen frame on navigation push and pop. The x value would be equal to the screen width for a pop and minus the screen width for a push. In iOS 7 the x value of the frame is always 0, making it difficult for animations to appear consistent with the system animation on such a transition.\r\n\r\nIn the results sections below, note that the value of UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey reports an offscreen-to-the-right frame, instead of an offscreen-to-the-bottom frame.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Push a view controller onto a UINavigationController stack\r\n2. Register for UIKeyboardWillShowNotification in that view controller\r\n3. Make the keyboard appear by inserting a UITextField into the view controller's view and cause it to become first responder\r\n4. Pop the view controller from the navigation stack\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n(lldb) po notification\r\nNSConcreteNotification 0xb446110 {name = UIKeyboardWillHideNotification; userInfo = {\r\n    UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey = 0;\r\n    UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey = \"0.35\";\r\n    UIKeyboardBoundsUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{0, 0}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardCenterBeginUserInfoKey = \"NSPoint: {160, 460}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardCenterEndUserInfoKey = \"NSPoint: {160, 460}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{0, 352}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameChangedByUserInteraction = 0;\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{320, 352}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n}}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(lldb) po notification\r\nNSConcreteNotification 0xc100ce0 {name = UIKeyboardWillHideNotification; userInfo = {\r\n    UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey = 7;\r\n    UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey = \"0.25\";\r\n    UIKeyboardBoundsUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{0, 0}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardCenterBeginUserInfoKey = \"NSPoint: {160, 460}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardCenterEndUserInfoKey = \"NSPoint: {160, 676}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{0, 352}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameChangedByUserInteraction = 0;\r\n    UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey = \"NSRect: {{0, 568}, {320, 216}}\";\r\n}}\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 GM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
