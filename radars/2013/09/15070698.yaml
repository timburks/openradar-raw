    description: "Summary:\r\nIf data detectors are enabled on a UITextView, and an URL triggered by tapping on a data detector link, that URL can get cached and stuck, then when the text is changed or other links tapped the cached URL is opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch attached project (simulator or device).\r\n2. Tap \"Text1\" button. A URL will be placed in the text view, and should get identified by data detectors as a link.\r\n3. Tap the link...it will open in Safari.\r\n4. Return to example app, tap \"Text2\" button.\r\n5. New text will appear, and it erroneously highlighted.  Tap on links in that text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe link tapped should open the URL corresponding to the text tapped.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter step 5, you will go to Safari with the URL tapped in step #3, not the one tapped in step #5.  Also, UITextViewDelegate's shouldInteractWithURL:inRange method is called with the wrong URL.  The characterRange is correct and match the new link range, however.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7 SDK 5A1413\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TEST_DataDetectorLinkCaching.zip' was successfully uploaded."
