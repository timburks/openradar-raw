    description: "Description:\r\nPermissions are required for push notifications but not local notifications. With the advent of background refresh, apps are now taking advantage of this and are sending local notifications instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nCreate new app, do not request permissions for notifications. Create a local notification.\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\nUpon opening the app the user should be prompted with the notifications permission allowing the user to decline notifications.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nNothing happens and the app is free to spam the user with local notifications.  It should be noted that this is usually for marketing reason and the alerts don't notify the user of anything important."
