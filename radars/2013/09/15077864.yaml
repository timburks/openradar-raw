    description: "Summary:\r\nMultipeer connectivity has stopped working since iOS 7 Beta 5 and is still not working for MANY people in 7.0.1 (see dev thread https://devforums.apple.com/message/866356#866356)\r\n\r\nCode that was working has stopped working and no one can get it to work.\r\n\r\nSample project attached!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1: Create a project that uses MultipeerConnectivity\r\n2: No  device is seen by either device, even when right next to each other and on the same network (both with simulator and device, and 2 actual devices) \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe framework should work as expected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMultipeerConnectivity is completely worthless and completely halting work on projects that are trying to use it\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5s\r\niPhone 5\r\niOS 7.0\r\niOS 7.0.1\r\nXcode 5 final\r\nXcode 5 Betas (after 4)\r\nMacOS X 10.8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see dev forum https://devforums.apple.com/message/866356#866356)\r\n\r\nI have emailed Core OS Evangelist Paul Danbold <danbold@apple.com> who told me he would not be able to even look at the problem until at least Christmas, however as you can expect this is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s\r\niPhone 5\r\niOS 7.0\r\niOS 7.0.1\r\nXcode 5 final\r\nXcode 5 Betas (after 4)\r\nMacOS X 10.8\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'MultipeerConnectivity.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\n\r\nhttp://files.hashbangind.com/dallas/MultipeerConnectivity.zip"
