    description: "Summary:\r\nThe touch screen of my iPhone 4S becomes inactive when the battery is too low, in my case at under 5%.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDrain the battery to under 5%, then switch off the screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen you switch on the screen you should be able to interact with the touch screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe touch screen is inactive, motion control and the parallax work, though.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappens on iPhone 4S, a soft reset doesn't fix the issue, the issue is fixed when you charge your phone above 10% percent after which you soft reset it.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
