        Summary:
        In Safari on the iPhone, you can swipe a tab off the left to close it, but if you try swiping it off the right then it just bounces back. It should allow swiping either way.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open a number of tabs in Safari
        2. Switch to the tab view
        3. Swipe left to right across one of the tabs

        Expected Results:
        The tab closes

        Actual Results:
        The tab just bounces back to where it was
