    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter unlocking the phone the app icons fly in in a staggered fashion. As long as this animation has not \r\ncompleted the user is blocked from swiping left/right or opening an app. In this situation I find myself \r\nregularly tapping an app icon twice before it reacts, because the animation hasn't finished yet.\r\nUsers develop strong muscle memory for often used apps and therefore can tap on the right spot\r\nquickly. The duration of the animation could get in their way when trying to quickly unlock the phone and\r\nlaunch an app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to the home screen\r\n2. Put the phone to sleep\r\n3. Wake the phone\r\n4. Slide to unlock\r\n5. Tap an app icon right away before the animation has finished\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should launch on the first tap.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe home screen is unresponsive until the animation is finished\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
