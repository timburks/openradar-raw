    description: "When you change the language at the system level in iOS, the screen goes black and displays text that says \"Setting Language...\"\r\n\r\nHowever, this text is not vertically centered on the screen. It's off by quite a few pixels, making it very strange looking on the screen. The same is true for both 4\" and 3.5\" screens, and on iOS 6 as well as the new iOS 7 beta 3.\r\n\r\nThis has been bugging me for a long time!!! :-)"
