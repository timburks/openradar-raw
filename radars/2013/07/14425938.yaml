    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAs a developer I have a ton of iOS devices around for testing purposes. To avoid hassles I bought most of them directly from Apple or paid a fee to have the SIM lock removed.\r\n\r\nHowever when restoring an iPhone you still are required to put a SIM card into a phone or otherwise you get an \"Activation Failed\" message. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Remove the SIM card from a sim-unlocked iPhone\r\n- Restore iOS (e.g. any 7 seed)\r\n- After choosing your country and WiFi, try to activate\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- A SIM-unlocked iPhone should activate over WiFi without requiring a SIM card\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Activation Fails with an \"Activation Failed\" error message\r\n- You have to start over after placing any SIM card into the phone to activate it\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis problem existed since forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a big hassle and worry for me because I don't have as many contracts as I have iPhones. Also for most testing purposes you don't need any cellular data in iPhones, but just WiFi. Also some day I might have only Nano SIMs left if everybody is on an iPhone 5 and then I wouldn't have any SIM card available to activate older iPhones.\r\n\r\nIf I buy a SIM-unlocked iPhone from Apple or pay to unlock any iPhone after contract I should never again be forced to put a SIM card into this phone."
