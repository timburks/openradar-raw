    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7 is introduced the firstObject in the NSArray class. On the same wave in the NSMutableArray it would be nice if is going to be added a removeFirstObject that works similar to removeLastObject.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIf I want to remove the first object in a NSMutableArray now I have to type [mutableArray removeObjectAtIndex:0] or a much verbose and secure mode (if firstObject not return nil) [mutableArray removeObject:[mutableArray firstObject]].\r\n\r\nIts a small addition but make the code easier to read and Obj-C is the nicest code to read so, why not?"
