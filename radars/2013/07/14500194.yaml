    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://12607969\r\n\r\nNSJSONSerialization's JSONObjectWithData:options:error: can produce NSArray/NSDictionary objects that contain NSNull instances.  That's reasonable, since JSON can encode these.  But, there are cases were that's not desirable behavior.\r\n\r\nI'd love to have an additional NSJSONReadingOptions value that does not add NSNulls, and just treats those values as not present."
