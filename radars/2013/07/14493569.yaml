        Summary:

        If you have a method like this:

        + (void)foo
        {
            static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
            dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
                    [NSException raise:@"MyException" format:@"Something went wrong"];
            });
        }

        and a unit test like this:

        - (void)testRaiseException
        {
            XCTAssertThrows([MyClass foo], @"Test Failed");
        }

        the test will never pass because the execution is interrupted before the assertion is evaluated.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a project with the sample code above and run the Test configuration.

        Expected Results:
        The test should succeed and the 'unit test status mark' should show the green checkmark.

        Actual Results:
        The execution of the test is interrupted when the exception is encountered. Tests are said to be succeeded but that's simply because the assertion was never executed.
