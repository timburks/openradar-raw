    description: "09-Jul-2013 01:40 PM Matthew Burke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI cannot increase the font size of Xcode's GUI. Note I am NOT referring to the size of the contents of the editor panel or the debug log---those can be changed fine. But all the other panels such as the various navigators, the jump bars, etc. are too small to see on my new 27\" monitor.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Launch Xcode\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA preference, menu choice, or something that lets you adjust the font sizes of the GUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo means of solving this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't know for sure, but judging from the results of a web search on this issue, it's been present in all versions of Xcode.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nVersion 4.6.3 (4H1503)\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Jul-2013 09:11 AM Matthew Burke:\r\nChecked out Xcode5, preview 3.  Issue still exists."
