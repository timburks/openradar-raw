    description: "Currently the shortest fetch interval allowed by iOS is 15 minutes.\r\nThis makes sense for mobile devices that need to conserve data/battery.\r\n\r\nWe have an app, EventBoard Pro, that is installed in offices as an appliance.\r\nFor example, [REDACTED] is working on installing 200 iPads running our app on it.\r\nThe problem is that a 15 minute fetch interval is far too long for real-time events/scheduling on calendars.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nAllow us via a configuration profile to select the fetch interval that would work best for our customers ( 3 - 7 minutes )."
