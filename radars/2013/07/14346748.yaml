    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter downloading a Java application, and Gatekeeper is set to only allow applications from either the Mac App Store or identified developers, trying to run the application results in the Finder reporting that the application is damaged \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Download a Java-based application, for instance, the Aladin Sky Atlas:\r\nhttp://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/java/Aladin.dmg\r\n2) Open the .dmg and move Aladin.app to the /Applications folder\r\n3) Double click on Aladin.app in the /Applications folder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Finder should show an alert that the file is not signed, and disallow execution. After that, control-clic on the application icon and then clicking Open in the pop-up menu should show an alert that the file is not signed, and after accepting it, the application should start.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Finder shows an alert that the file is damaged (see attached screenshot), and offers to move it to the Trash. Control-clic on the application icon, and then clicking Open in the pop-up menu shows the same dialog.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappens in all versions of Mac OS X 10.8.x. Not tested in 10.9 yet.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are two workarounds:\r\n1) erasing the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute with xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Aladin.app\r\n2) deactivate Gatekeeper before trying to open the application, and possibly reactivate it after the application has run for the first time."
