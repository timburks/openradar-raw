    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe main unified toolbar/frame bar in Xcode5 has a central 'window' and controls on either side. \r\n\r\n On the right hand side, moving toward the centre, there's controls for the various sidebars and assistant navigator, then a big grey space, then the window.\r\n\r\nOn the left hand side, there's the Play/Stop controls, the device chooser, a big grey space and the the window.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm working on a laptop without an attached screen, I often have to drag windows around the screen as I work.  Because the top bar is unified, I can drag anywhere.  Except I can't.  I can use the big grey space on the RIGHT hand side, but the big grey space on the LEFT hand side is actually still the device chooser, which I trigger accidentally several times an hour.\r\n\r\nEither the device choose control should obviously show it;s bounds, or it should resize to fit the displayed text so that apparently empty  space really is empty.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAttempt to move the Xcode window by clicking in any grey \"space\" on the unified toolbar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe window moves.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window moves if I click on any grey space *apart* from the one thats really the device chooser."
