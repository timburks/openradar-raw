Report a bug in a product.  Include Version/Build Number.\r\n2. Receive a request from an Apple Engineer for more information.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSee the Version/Build Number of the project from the original bug report.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCannot find Version/Build Number.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI submitted a bug report concerning Xcode last September.  I just recently received a request for further information.  I can't remember if I have upgraded Xcode since September or not and I cannot see the Version/Build Number I supplied when I originally filed the bug report."
