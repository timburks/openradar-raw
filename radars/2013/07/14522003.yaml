    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Connect app metadata no longer allows newlines, making app description and \"What's New\" sections contain one very long block of text\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Edit version info for an app.  In my case I'm using Qur'an Memorizer (Apple ID ********) which is in \"Waiting for Review\".  (It also exhibited this behavior when in \"Waiting for binary\" mode).  \r\n2) Edit the description to contain 2 lines, \"Line1\\nLine2\"\r\n3) Click outside the description field to cause it to lose focus\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe description field will continue to contain two lines: \r\nLine1\r\nLine2\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe description contains one line: \"Line1 Line2\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI am too scared to try this out on other live versions of apps and risk messing up the currently correct app descriptions.  Unfortunately this is affecting my flagship app (currently waiting for review) and my fear is that when it's released the description will be one large wall of text. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI tried inserting HTML <br> tags and disabling Javascript, but neither helped."
