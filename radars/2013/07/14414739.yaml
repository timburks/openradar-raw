    description: "Summary: When I get a Game Center challenge I should have an option to make it clear that I don't care.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive a Game Center challenge from someone.\r\n2. Decline it.\r\n3. Receive another Game Center challenge for the same game.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I should have an option to make it clear that I do not care. When I choose this option I should not receive any more challenges for that game, because I don't care.\r\n\r\nActual Results: All I can do is decline the challenge. I may continue to receive challenges from the same game over and over, whether it's from the same friend or different friends.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: Please see the attached illustration by my wife."
