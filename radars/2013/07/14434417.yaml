    description: "Summary: UIRefreshControl was introduced on iOS 6 and requires an UITableViewController. We should be able to add an UIRefreshControl to a collection view (via an UICollectionViewController - to be consistent). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open UICollectionViewController documentation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A refreshControl property, which we could set to an UIRefreshControl instance, that would be added to the collection view.\r\n\r\nActual Results: There's no refreshControl property there.\r\n\r\nRegression: Since iOS 6, which added UIRefreshControl.\r\n\r\nNotes: I'd like to understand too why UIRefreshControl needs an UITableViewController (and not just a UITableView). It'd be great if UIRefreshControl supported scrollviews in general, not only table views (rdar://12365983)."
