        Summary:
        It is difficult to get the object for the instantiated Storyboard file in the App Delegate

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Start with Single View Application
        Note that main view controller is created by the OS, using the storyboard file specified in info.plist
        Try to add some code in the App Delegate that accesses the Storyboard file

        Expected Results:
        The app delegate should have some object for the created Storyboard file, or perhaps a way to get it as a class method of UIStoryboard

        Actual Results:
        You have to go through the window to get its view controller and then get the storyboard object

        Regression:
        Has always been this way

        Notes:
        Seems like there should be some class method on UIStoryboard to get the default storyboard object that the OS finds and instantiates. Perhaps something similar to [NSBundle mainBundle] it could be [UIStoryboard mainStoryboard].
