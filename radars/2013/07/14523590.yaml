    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Description and What's New fields are being stripped of carriage returns after losing focus when editing an app's metadata.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Edit Metadata for an app\r\n\r\n2. Type or paste in a description with carriage returns (or just make a small change to an existing description with carriage returns)\r\n\r\n3. Change to What's New field (or click Save)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDescription text stays as it was typed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDescription text is stripped of all carriage returns.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis was working previously to today (July 23, 2013).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYou can also see this happen by using the same steps above with the What's New field. Changing to another field or clicking save will strip the carriage returns."
