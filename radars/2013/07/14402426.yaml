    description: "Summary:\nIn order to develop applications for the iOS or Mac App Stores a developer must have a valid certificate and profile. Both the certificates and profiles will expire within one year from the creation date. When either is expired no further development can occur until it is renewed. On iOS devices when a profile is nearing its expiration date an alert view will be displayed by the system to notify the device user. This gives them a chance to update or renew the profile to avoid interruptions. When building from Xcode the users needs both an unexpired certificate and profile. If the certificate is close to expired there is no warning to the user.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n(please substitute your current date with the date listed below unless you have time travel capabilities)\n1. Generate an iOS development certificate that will expire on 2013-07-09 12:45 PDT\n2. Generate a development profile that will expire after the certificate\n3. At 12:32 PDT on 2013-07-09 begin building and running on an attached iOS device, the build runs as expected.\n4. at 12:56 PDT on 2013-07-09 begin a build, it will fail with a message telling the user there is not a valid profile to sign the build with\n5. realize that the certificate expired between when you started at 12:32 PDT and the error at 12:56 PDT \n\nExpected Results:\nLike on iOS a warning that a certificate or profile that Xcode uses is about to expire would be a welcome addition. This would mean a developer wouldn't need to break their flow to stop to renew the certificate and profile.\n\nActual Results:\nThe flow of development was broken in the updating process. Had I known days or hours or even when I first started in Xcode that day the certificate would expire I would have renewed it before getting started to avoid interruption.\n\nRegression:\nThis currently occurs with all released versions of Xcode on OS X 10.7.x and 10.8.x.\n\nNotes:\nn/a"
