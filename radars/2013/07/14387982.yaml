    description: "When creating a label in Interface Builder using Xcode 5, the label height is reduced when ran with iOS 6.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new \"Empty view\" project in Xcode\r\n2. Add a label with some text to Main.storyboard\r\n3. Make the label just tall enough to see the text entirely\r\n4. Open the \"Preview\" assistant editor in \"iOS 6.1 and earlier\" mode\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe label has the same height than in Interface Builder; the text is readable.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\nThe label height is reduced; the text is vertically truncated and illegible (see the \"Actual results.png\" screenshot).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe label dimensions also change when running the project using the iOS 6.1 simulator (it is not just the preview pane)."
