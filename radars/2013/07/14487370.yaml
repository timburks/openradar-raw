    description: "18-Jul-2013 04:23 PM Zach Drayer:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt would be excellent if NSJSONSerialization had an option to deserialize JSON into NSMapTable/NSPointerArray. Something like NSJSONReadingPointerContainers.\r\n\r\nDifferences vs current behavior:\r\nThe primary difference in this versus NSArray/NSDictionary would be that when deserializing to NSMapTable or NSPointerArray and there is a `null` entry in the JSON, the key/index would have nil in it, instead of `[NSNull null]`.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for transforming a Foundation object into JSON data, in reverse. If given NSMapTable or NSPointerArray and there is a nil entry, it would produce the `null` value for JSON.\r\n\r\nPrimary use cases:\r\nThis feels like it would allow for more idiomatic Objective-C to be written when dealing with JSON parsing. It would allow for nil-messaging when accessing collections (as opposed to having to special-case and check for NSNull)."
