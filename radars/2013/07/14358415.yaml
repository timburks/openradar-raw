    description: "05-Jul-2013 01:00 PM Stan Chang Khin Boon:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nNested Scroll View (Zoomable in Paging, like in Photos.app) shows contents of next/previous page while in zooming mode.\r\n\r\nThis happen in my own app and in Apple's Photos.app running iOS 7. Though some other apps available in App Store with a similar UI aren't affected. I suspect they are using then newer UIPageViewController.\r\n\r\nIn my implementation I had a Nested Scroll View (Zoomable in Paging), heavily referencing the older version of Apple's Photo Scroller sample code.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Photos.app\r\n2. Select any photo\r\n3. Zoom in the photo\r\n4. Pan the zoomed content so that its near the edge close to the next or previous page. Make sure you are NOT at the edge, just near it. (Preferably previous page as I can get more consistent result that way)\r\n5. Try to pan the zoomed content beyond the edge, you should see the next or previous page content.\r\n6. Release the pan gesture while you are in the area where you see the next or previous page but you would still remain in the current page upon releasing.\r\n7. Bug encountered.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou will only see the current page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou will see the next or previous page overlapping the current page. The paging view content offset seems to have been affected as well as it's position is somewhere in the middle of the page. A tap on it will return it back to normal.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n05-Jul-2013 01:00 PM Stan Chang Khin Boon:\r\n'2013-07-05 12.56.56.png' was successfully uploaded"
