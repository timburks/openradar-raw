    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Calendar app OS X Mountain Lion is missing the advanced preferences to \"Delete Events X days after passing\" and \"Delete Reminders X days after passing\". This is a regression - the preferences have been removed in Mountain Lion but were present in OS X Lion 10.7.5 versions of iCal and earlier.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch Calendar app\r\n2. Go to Calendar, Preferences, Advanced\r\n3. The preferences to \"Delete Events X days after passing\" and \"Delete Reminders X days after passing\" are no longer present\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe advanced preferences to \"Delete Events X days after passing\" and \"Delete Reminders X days after passing\" should be available in order to enable users to manage the size of their calendar and to automatically delete calendar entries that are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe advanced preferences to \"Delete Events X days after passing\" and \"Delete Reminders X days after passing\" are no longer available and there is no easy way to delete passed calendar events without having to scroll through each event and manually delete it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a regression - the preferences have been removed in Mountain Lion but were present in OS X Lion 10.7.5 and earlier."
