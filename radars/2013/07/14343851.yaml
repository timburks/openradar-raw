    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 5.0 introduced the possibility to control drag from one view to another to make a constraint and smartly propose only the ones based on the direction of the drag.\r\nBut if a sibling completely overlapped the superview if I want to control drag a leading space from the smaller sibling to the superview I must drag on the outline sidebar.\r\nEven in this case thou IB try to detect the direction of the drag and present only a subset of constraint.\r\nIn this case is much better present a complete list of constraints that is applicable between the two views because not always is possible to make the right direction for the control drag.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nin an empty view controller put an UIImageView that overlapped completely the view.\r\nThen add a small view inside of it but making its sibling and try to control drag some constraints between the smaller view and the superview via the document outline sidebar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe list of constraints is the complete one (minus the width and height ones).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe list is the subset based on the direction of the control drag gesture."
