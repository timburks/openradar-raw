        Summary:
        When using the keyboard shortcut "cmd+alt+esc", the "Force Quit" dialog doesn't come up

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1.type "Cmd+Alt+Esc" on a Mac with Mavericks Developer Preview 2

        Expected Results:
        The "Force Quit" dialog should open

        Actual Results:
        No dialog shows up

        Regression:
        The shortcut worked up until Mavericls

        Notes:
        Even though the shortcut doesn't bring the dialog up, clicking on "Apple menu > Force Quit" seems to work correctly. The keyboard shortcut is shown aside the menu item, and the default shortcuts weren't changed.
