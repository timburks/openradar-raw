    description: "15-Jul-2013 11:57 AM Ryan Grier:\r\nSummary:\r\nI have a few test devices that I use to run new(er) OSes. I do not keep SIM cards for them. When i updated one of these devices to iOS 7, activation failed because I didn't have a SIM card installed. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Remove the SIM card from a sim-unlocked iPhone\r\n- Restore iOS (e.g. any 7 seed)\r\n- After choosing your country and WiFi, try to activate\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- A SIM-unlocked iPhone should activate over WiFi without requiring a SIM card\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Activation Fails with an \"Activation Failed\" error message\r\n- You have to start over after placing any SIM card into the phone to activate it\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem existed since forever. I even got this when rolling back to iOS 6. \r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
