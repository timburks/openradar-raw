    description: "I'm setting NSApplicationPresentationDisableProcessSwitching to my NSApp's presentationOptions. The user can't switch (this is a Kiosk App). When the user goes into full screen in a video (with an HTML 5 <video> tag) however, he's able to switch.\r\n\r\nWorst yet, when he's back from full screen, the app has \"lost\" it's presentationOption and he can switch."
