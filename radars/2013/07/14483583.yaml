    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you send a picture to someone in Messages, any important details at the edges are invisible unless you know to Quick Look the image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Messages.app.\r\n2. Start a chat with someone.\r\n3. Drag an image into the text entry box.\r\n4. Press Return to send the image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny information contained in the edges of the image is visible to the sender (and to the recipient, if they have Messages configured the same way).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe image is displayed in a chat bubble, which crops off details from the edges.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou can see the full image when you switch from Bubbles to Boxes, but most users probably do not know you can switch. The default and, I assume, most popular view should not (apparently) remove information from images. I know you can double-click the image to Quick Look it, but again, I don't know how many people know about that. If a designer is sending me several versions of something to compare, it's a drag to have to keep using Quick Look to get an idea what they look like.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, if you send text along with the image, it puts the text and image in one bubble, and consequently shows the entire image.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://cl.ly/QJyk"
