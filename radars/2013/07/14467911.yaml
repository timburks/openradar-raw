    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIScrollView -[zoomToRect: animated:] method is broken. If scrollView is already at zoomScale that -[zoomToRect: animated:] will result, block based animation is broken - i.e. not called.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Zoom UIScrollView to maximumScaleFactor.\r\n2. Call zoomToRect wrapped in UIView block based animation with such CGRect that it will zoom to maximumScaleFactor.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf call to zoomToRect is wrapped in animation block (e.g. [UIView animateWithDuration:0.85 animations:^{ [self.scrollView zoomToRect: rect animated: NO];}], I expect the animation to take 0.85 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAnimation block is disregarded and animation takes usual amount of time (which is WAY TO SHORT to be useful in many cases).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere's quite simple workaround, just change zoomScaleFactor to something teeny tiny bit smaller, i.e decrease it by 0.00001f, but that's obviously not TheRightWay."
