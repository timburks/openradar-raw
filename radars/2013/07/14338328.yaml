    description: "Summary:\niOS users can use the Accessibility features of the OS to navigate the interface of every app. Sometimes there are words which are either not in the voice over library for pronunciation or are written in such a way as to confuse the VoiceOver system's pronunciation rules. The incorrect pronunciation is jarring to users and developers.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Download the Madefire app from the iOS App Store\n2. Tap on the Settings.app to open it\n3. Tap on the General table entry\n4. In the General view that appears scroll to the bottom and tap on Accessibility\n5. Tap the VoiceOver cell\n6. In the VoiceOver view turn VoiceOver to On\n7. Tap the Home button \n8. Swipe using three fingers to the Springboard page with the Madefire app located on it\n9. Tap on the Madefire app, VoiceOver reads it not as Made-fire but ma-de-fire.\n\nExpected Results:\nVoiceOver will read words as they are intended to be pronounced.\n\nActual Results:\nThe word \"Madefire\" is pronounced with three syllables as ma-de-fire. There is no way to provide a pronunciation key to the iOS VoiceOver system either in the Info.plist or an API that will allow developers to hint at word pronunciations without having to resort to tricks like spaces and unpronounceable/undisplayable unicode characters.\n\nRegression:\nThis occurs on iOS 5, 6, and 7.\n\nNotes:\nThere should be a way to hint at pronunciations in the Info.plist and app so that words which are not in the VoiceOver pronunciation library won't be confusing to users."
