        As shown in the WWDC 2013 keynote, file system tags (new in Mavericks) let users tag files with user created tags.

        I would like to suggest that these tags be used on iOS as well as MacOS, and sync over iCloud for any cloud-based documents that are tagged. Furthermore, there should be a document browser app on iOS, that lets users browse all their cloud-based documents (regardless of which app they were created in), grouped by tag. Tapping on a document in this browser app would open the app which owns that document.
