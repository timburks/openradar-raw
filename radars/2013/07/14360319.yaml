    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFor IB in Xcode there is the IBOutletCollection that specify for a NSArray that contains graphics elements of the specified type.\r\nIt would be nice if in the future will be introduced a macro that states for every property or instance of NSArray that this would be an array of only one type of object. It would be a lousy control, only for aid the developer during the coding, easily avoided by casting the object to id, but for distract people that would avoid some distracting type errors."
