        Summary:
        I can't find any way to browse or see the full doc tree. So there is very poor class/guide discoverability in the documentation browser.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Search for UITableView. Select the class reference. Look through it. Ask yourself what the superclass is, or if there are any reference guides or sample projects. Ask if there are any related classes you might not be aware of.

        Expected Results:
        You should be able to view the doc hierarchy and see related classes. You should also see a nice summary at the top of the class reference that tells you crucial facts about the class, like where the .h is, what superclass is, if there is a guide or sample project.

        Actual Results:
        Some pieces of this information are buried in paragraphs of text. Suitable for first learning about a class - *maybe* - but not for quickly refreshing your memory or serendipitously exploring new classes.

        Regression:
        Search is much faster in Xcode 5's doc browser, but Xcode 4 had both a breadcrumb trail and the ability to view the whole docset in the library sidebar. Something like these functions *need* to return, or else it is largely unusable.
