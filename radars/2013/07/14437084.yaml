    description: "Summary: When creating an ABAddressBookRef reference and enumerating through it, you should be able to access the emails of all contacts. However, under iOS 7, copying the email property via ABRecordCopyValue and passing in the key kABPersonEmailProperty returns a nil value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1) Create an instance of ABAddressBookRef\r\n2) Create an array of records from the address book via ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople()\r\n3) Enumerate through the records and try to print the emails of each person\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should return a ABMultiValueRef for each record, with which you can enumerate through to get all emails.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Returned ABMultiValueRef is nil\r\n\r\nRegression: Works just fine in iOS 6\r\n\r\nNotes: Attached is an example app to demonstrate the issue."
