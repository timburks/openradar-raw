        Summary:
        In UIStoryboard's documentation, it clearly states that creating a UIStoryboard with a storyboard name that doesn't exist, will fail gracefully and return nil.

            storyboardWithName:bundle:
            â€¦
            Return Value
            A storyboard object for the specified file or nil if no such object exists.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"NoName" bundle:nil];

        Expected Results:
        The method should return nil and not throw an exception.

        Actual Results:
        An exception is thrown and the app crashes.

        Notes:
        I have tested this on iOS 6.1 and iOS 7 beta. Exact same result.
