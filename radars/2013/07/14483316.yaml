    description: "Summary: I would like to request an API that can encrypt and decrypt arbitrary data under the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Given |plainText|, an encrypted |cypherText| is produced.\r\n2. Given |cypherText|, |plainText| can only be returned if the code is run by the same user, on the same machine, under the same Mach Namespace / Security Context / etc...\r\n\r\nSo, in pseudocode, something simple like\r\n\r\ncyphertext = EncryptForCurrentUser(plainText)\r\nplainText = DecryptForCurrentUser(cypherText)\r\n\r\nI do not see anything in CommonCrypto that can do something like this. Note: I do not want to store any data in Keychain. I just want to encrypt/decrypt.\r\n\r\nWindowz offers something along these lines... this is basically what I'm after: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380261(v=vs.85).aspx"
