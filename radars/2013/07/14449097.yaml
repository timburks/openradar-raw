    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn iOS 7, we can present a modal view controller with transparency, so that the previous view controller is still visible behind it. However, rotation events are not delivered to the back view controller, only the front-most (modal) view controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Present a modal view controller with transparent background by specifying modalPresentationStyle of UIModalPresentationCustom and using a transitioningDelegate to specify a custom UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning object.\r\n* Don't remove the source view controller so it remains visible behind the modal view controller\r\n* Rotate the device\r\n* The front-most (modal) view controller rotates as expected\r\n* The back view-controller (still visible behind the transparent modal) does not rotate and does not receive any rotation event callbacks (such as -willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAny view controllers containing views that are still on screen and visible should receive rotation events.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOnly the front most view controller appears to receive rotation events. A view controller with a view that is still on screen and visible behind a transparent modal view controller does not receive any rotation events.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA sample project to demonstrate this behaviour is attached.\r\n\r\nScreen shots to help explain this behaviour are attached."
