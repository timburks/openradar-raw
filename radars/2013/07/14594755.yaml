    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSiri misunderstands my queries a lot. This also happens when I'm driving my car and have my earphones on and can't always press the button on the earphones.\r\n\r\nThe conversation sometimes looks like this:\r\n\r\n<having two people in my address book, mike and micky>\r\n\r\nme: \"Call Micky\"\r\nSiri: \"Calling Mike Doe\"\r\nme: \"No, no wait, stop\"\r\nMike: \"Hello?\"\r\n<explaining>\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSiri should enable some failsafe, for misunderstandings (no matter how good Siri will get, even people sometimes misunderstand each other).\r\n\r\nMainly when someone shouts \"NO, NO! Stop\", Siri should get that and say \"OK\" or \"Stopped\". And not continue with what she's doing."
