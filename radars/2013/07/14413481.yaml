    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFar too many emitter cells are being emitted when the emitterMode is set to kCAEmitterLayerOutline in iOS 7.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate an CAEmitterLayer / CAEmitterCell with the emitterMode set to kCAEmitterLayerOutline and note the difference in the number of particles emitted on iOS 7 versus iOS 6.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpect the number of particles emitted to be the same or nearly the same on iOS 7 as on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLots more particles are emitted on iOS 7. Really a lot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem does not occur on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNote that I am also using an emitter layer elsewhere in the same application with the emitterMode left at the default value and the birthrate in that case seems correct. \r\n\r\nSee also attached screenshots comparing explosions on iOS 6 versus iOS 7."
