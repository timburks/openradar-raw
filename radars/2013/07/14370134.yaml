    description: "Summary:\r\nNow that the status bar in ios 7 doesn't have any border / obstacles anymore, we need more control on where to position the status bar. Common non standard navigation concepts like side panels need some way to translate the status bar for the best UX (which is what apple stands for). The first attached image file demonstrates the existing problem and the second one an optimal UX when translating the status bar.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n-\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBy more control, I don't mean positioning the status bar anywhere on the screen but rather allowing slightly modification like translating the status bar or making UIStatusBarHideAnimationParameters public."
