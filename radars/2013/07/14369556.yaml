    description: "Summary:\r\nWith the removal of the Slide to Unlock frame and Slide to Unlock arrow slider, the new implementation has a flawed user experience. The new design displays \"Slide to Unlock\" text with a slight glimmer in the text that animates to the right. Since the arrow slider was removed and the new Control Center arrow up icon was added, it makes it seem that the new direction to Slide to Unlock is to slide up. This is unfortunately not the case. \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nClick lock/home button on iPhone, notice the arrow at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, slide up to get either 1. Control Center or 2. Nothing.\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen unlocking iPhone, show an arrow either 1. Pointing right: the direction you must slide to unlock the phone or 2. Design a new implementation that avoids confusion with the Control Center arrow up icon.\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen unlocking iPhone, the arrow up icon at the bottom of the screen, which is displayed below the \"Slide to Unlock\" text, makes it seem like you must slide up to unlock. This is not the case, in which you either slide up to 1. Open Control Center or 2. Gesture nothing.\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIh8qshSliA"
