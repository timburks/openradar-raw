    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen on certain tabs in the App Store app, clicking the search box, then typing, then hitting search will cause the app to crash\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start on Featured, Near Me, or Updates tab\r\n2) Tab on search box\r\n3) Optional: Clear any existing text by hitting the 'x'\r\n4) Type search query\r\n5) Hit Search on keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA search to be executed and the search results view to be displayed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App crashes\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe other two tabs not listed in the steps (Top Charts and Purchased) seem to be ok.  After the app comes back from a crash, the search works fine if you immediately tap the search box and hit search (my query was already in there from last time).  I got this to happen every time by manually killing the app and trying again.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is on an iPad 2"
