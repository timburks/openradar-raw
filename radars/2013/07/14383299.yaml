    description: "Summary: When you use a UICollectionViewCell from a xib, UICollectionView items will disappear occasionally on rotation and when you update the frame of the collection view.  If you use a cell from within a storyboard, the problem does not occur.  See attached for a sample project as well as a video of the issue occurring.  In collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath: in the sample project if you uncomment out the commented line and then comment out the other line, the issue does not occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a project similar to the sample project.  Run the project.  When the frame of the collection view gets updated, a row gets visually removed from the collection view.  If you scroll and rotate, it is possible for several items to be removed as well.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All items remain in the collection view.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Items are removed."
