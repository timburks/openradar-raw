    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the Automation Instrument with UIAutomation it is very common to edit one of the javascript files that will be used by the Automation Instrument. Using a text editor separate from the one available as part of Instruments (e.g. TextMate) to edit the .js file results in Instruments annoyingly prompting the user with the following warning.\r\n\r\nWarning \r\n\r\nThe file for the document at '/Users/path/AutomationTest.js' has been modified by another application.  Do you want to keep the Instruments version and overwrite or revert to the version on disk?\r\n[Revert] [Overwrite with Instruments Version]\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruments should not assume that it is the sole mechanism for editing a javascript file.  Like Xcode and myriad other tools, it should automatically detect and reload the changes made by other applications without disturbing the development process with this annoying, unnecessary warning.  Not once have I *intentionally* clicked \"Overwrite with Instruments Version\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLaunch Instruments from Xcode\r\nPick the Automation Instrument\r\nToggle the record button to stop recording\r\nAdd a script to the automation instrument (e.g. Automation.js)\r\nToggle the record button to start recording (seems to fail without running any tests every time)\r\nToggle the record button to start recording (tests will now run and pass/fail)\r\nOpen the Automation.js file in Xcode, TextMate, or similar\r\nMake changes to Automation.js and save the file.\r\nSwitch back to Instruments\r\nToggle the record button to stop/start recording\r\n\r\nInstruments will now prompt you to Overwrite the changes made in Xcode/TextMate with the cached, out of date copy that Instruments last used...\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nChanges made to Automation.js outside of Instruments will be automatically reloaded by Instruments on the next \"start recording\" action.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanges made to Automation.js outside of Instruments are only reloaded if the user ignores the (dominant) button \"Overwrite with Instruments Version\" and instead clicks \"Revert\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known\r\n\r\nNotes:"
