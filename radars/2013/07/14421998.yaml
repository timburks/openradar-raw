        Summary:
        I've seen this multiple times in the wild where -[UIApplicationDelegate application:didReceiveLocalNotification:] is called with a nil UILocalNotification (I have an NSParameterAssert inside of the method).

        Steps to Reproduce:
        ?

        Expected Results:
        Method is always called with UILocalNotification object

        Actual Results:
        Method is sometimes called with a nil UILocalNotification object for some users.

        Regression:
