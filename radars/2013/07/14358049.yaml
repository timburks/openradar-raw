        Summary:

        Presently, NSFileWrapper makes it very difficult to work with media files stored within a document package. To generate a thumbnail for a media file within a document package, I first have to copy the NSFileWrappers NSData to a temporary file outside my document package, and then use that temporary file to generate the thumbnail images. If the media file in question is a 1Gb movie, the operation takes far too long. As it stands, I need to choose between NSFileWrapper and doing any real interaction with media files stored inside a document package.

        Please add a method for classes like AVAsset, NSImage, etc to do their work upon an NSFileWrapper, or provide a way to safely retrieve the current URL of an NSFileWrapper so that it's possible to interact with the files without having to load them entirely into memory, or copy them elsewhere.
