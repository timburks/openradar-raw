        Apps can communicate on iOS using Mach IPC. This is used in systems like Audiobus to send data between multiple running apps.

        I would like to request a way for my app to request that another app is woken in the background, so that my app can talk with it. This could be through a new API that takes a bundle identifier. When an app is woken in this manner, it should remain awake until my app has finished communicating with it.
