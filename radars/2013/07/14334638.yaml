        I installed Mavericks DP1 and noticed, that in my Gmail accounts, no emails were listed that I received before installing Mavericks. I tried the following steps to resolve this issue (with no success):
        - Restart Mail
        - Reboot Mavericks
        - Delete the Envelope Index files in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData. This resulted in Mail not being able to start at all (freeze on launch). Putting the files back allowed it to start, but the issue remained.
        - Removing the account from the Accounts.plist file and the corresponding email folder in ~/Library/Mail/V2. Launching Mail. Terminating Mail. Re-adding the account to the Accounts.plist file and the email folder in V2. Launching Mail. This seemed to solve the issue (all the older emails were displayed in the inbox too), but after selecting an other account's inbox and going back to the gmail account's inbox, the older emails disappeared again. Selecting Account > Restore (Not sure about the exact wording, as I'm using the German localization) from the Menu made the older emails appear again. Put changing inbox lists and coming back again made them disappear.
        - Removing the whole V2 folder and replacing it with a backup from before installing Mavericks. Launching Mail started the import process and finished successfully. All my emails are now listed in the inbox for all accounts, but the bodies of the emails I received before installing Mavericks are gone. Selecting such an email displays and empty email on the right side. Newer emails work. I will file a separate bug with this.
        - Removing the whole V2 folder and replacing it with a more recent backup (since installing Mavericks). This made Mail not being able to start (freeze on launch).
        Mail didn't log any errors to the Console when freezing.
