    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen dropping a clipping from an app onto the Finder's desktop, and if there is more than one monitor attached, the dropped item's file is created in the wrong location on the desktop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up a Mac with two screens, placing left to right. Make the right screen the main screen (i.e. it has the menu bar). In my case, they are two monitors of the same size (1920x1200), arranged as in the attached screenshot.\r\nOpen TextEdit, make new document, type some text into it.\r\nSelect some text in the document, then drag it onto the left screen's desktop.\r\nOnce the text clipping is dropped, it will be created on the right screen's desktop and not on the screen where it was dropped.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe textclipping file should be created in the area where it was dropped on the desktop.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis still worked right in 10.7.5"
