    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDevelopers from my team often find and report Apple bugs.\r\n\r\nBeing able to file such bug reports on tools like Jira (as a comment to a story they worked on) would be very interesting, not only for tracking purposes but for validation as well.\r\n\r\nHaving an open bug report filed is very useful to know if the filed bug is actually a bug (since Apple didn't close it) as well as provides support for dealing with customers.\r\n\r\nPeople have then to duplicate the bug report on systems such as Open Radar to be able to share that information with stackholders. Besides having to duplicate the bug report, we are tied to that developer's will to keep track if that bug (since there is a lot of additional overhead) and it doesn't have the same credibitily since Open Radar isn't maintained by Apple.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a bug filed and try to share that information with someone in your own team.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBeing able to see and track changes to the bug report.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAccess denied. Can't see the actual bug report. Sign in screen is displayed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is very frustating."
