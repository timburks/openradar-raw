    description: "01-Jul-2013 11:44 AM Brad Dougherty:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a max-width style is applied to an iframe, the constraint persists in full screen\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to http://brad.is/reportingbugs/maxwidth/\r\n2. Click on the full screen button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iframe should expand to fill the full screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iframe is restricted to 700px wide in full screen because of the max-width defined. Also, the rest of the page shows through in the remaining space.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSeems to happen in 5.1 and 6 as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFirefox 22 has the correct behavior."
