Open a project in Xcode\r\n2. Open several tabs\r\n3. Switch file views by selecting tabs.\r\n4. The file name selected in the file navigator will not change, or if it does change it may change to a random file in the navigator's list.\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen selecting a tab, the file navigator should reflect the currently selected tab\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached as follow-ups (so i could label them with the radar #) are qt movies showing the behavior with Xcode 4.6.3 and Xcode 5.0 DP4, as well as the sample project\r\n\r\n15-Jul-2013 02:45 PM David Spector:\r\n'radar-14447706-tabs-error-Xcode463.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n15-Jul-2013 02:49 PM David Spector:\r\n'radar-14447706-tabs-error-Xcode5DP3.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n15-Jul-2013 02:50 PM David Spector:\r\nMovies shown the effect using both Xcode 4.6.3 and Xcode 5 DP3 are attached."
