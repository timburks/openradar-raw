    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\niOS 7's unified status bar takes what used to be an OS-level design challenge and makes it an app-level design challenge, forcing app designers to account for things beyond their control or interest, and imposing OS and hardware concerns upon the user at the highest level of visual priority in unrelated apps. The previous black status bar did an admirable job of separating this visual information in a way that made it easily accessible without being visually or cognitively imposing. While it is still possible for developers to force a black status bar in individual apps, the results look outdated next to the stock apps, which are—individually—harder to use because of this unification."
