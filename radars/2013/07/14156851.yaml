    description: "14-Jun-2013 12:34 PM Gregory Combs:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nCLLocationGeocoder currently only returns 5 digit zip codes, even though the coordinates are accurate enough to determine a 9 digit zip code (zip+4). \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n    CLLocation *location = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:37.331742 longitude:-122.030334];\r\n    CLGeocoder *geocoder = [[CLGeocoder alloc] init];\r\n    [geocoder reverseGeocodeLocation:location completionHandler:^(NSArray *placemarks, NSError *error) {\r\n        if (placemarks && [placemarks count]) {\r\n            CLPlacemark *place = placemarks[0];\r\n            NSLog(@\"Zip = %@\", place.postalCode);  // result = \"95014\"  instead of \"95014-2083\"\r\n        }\r\n    }];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n   geocoder should return \"95014-2083\" for postalCode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n   geocoder instead returns \"95014\" for postalCode\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n   Many REST APIs that deal with political boundaries, voting districts, legislative representation, and demographics often require a zip+4 postal code.  Without a zip+4, you cannot determine with accuracy which precinct or district an address falls into.  Zip+4 is an indication of a specific neighborhood sometimes a specific street block that would otherwise be bifurcated by two different political boundaries.\r\n\r\n   In order to overcome this, one must maintain (or subscribe to a service that maintains) a very large database for zip code lookups, increasing the expense (for user's time, or subscription fees) for the overall operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n14-Jun-2013 12:34 PM Gregory Combs:\r\n'ZipPlus4.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n20-Jun-2013 11:24 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
