    description: "Summary: When the Xcode project window is in full-screen mode, opening the documentation (help) viewer causes it to also open into its own full-screen space.  This is an irritating pain in the ass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Open a project; 2. make the project window full screen; 3. invoke the documentation viewer (cmd-option-?).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Documentation viewer opens in a window in the current space.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The slow and tedious \"full screen animation\" is displayed as the user waits for the documentation viewer to become available, and then it is shown in its own full-screen space.  An extra step (exit full screen) is required to restore it to a regular window.\r\n\r\nRegression: I believe this began happening in a version of Xcode 4.x as well.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOn subsequent invocations of the doc viewer (once manually removed from full-screen mode), the regular-window state is respected.\r\n\r\nIf I want a window to occupy a full-screen space, I will ask it to.  Otherwise, it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nThe bug does not manifest if the current project window is not already full-screen."
