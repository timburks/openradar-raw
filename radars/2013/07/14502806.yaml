        Dear Apple,

        As of 20 July 2013 at 3:45 EST, the developer centers has been down for well over a day for "maintenance." While many developers including myself appreciate it when you improve the site, it is an incredibly important resource that I use every single day. When it is down, my day can sometimes be halted in certain areas of my work, and I go to bed praying that whatever the reason it went down for is going to be worth it.

        Yet it doesn't have to be that way. Like many companies do, I highly recommend that you redirect your domain to a mirrored server while you are preforming maintenance on the primary device(s). This way you get less complaints, more money, and happier developers. This can also be true for the online Apple Store. It makes no sense for you to randomly take it down while making fixes, and when you do, it is not a positive thing for anyone. Hopefully you understand where I'm coming from.

        Thank for listening!

        - Paul Dunahoo
