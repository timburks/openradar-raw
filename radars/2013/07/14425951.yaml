    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode 5 introduced a new view for the SDK documentations. In this new view we can open multiple tabs and perform multiple searches. When a tab is closed all the history of views and searches made are lost.\r\nIt would be nice if we can access a permanent list of the last item searched in all the tab opened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the documentation view.\r\nOpen a new tab.\r\nMake a few searches.\r\nClose the tab.\r\nYou can't access at the history of the searches you made and there is no list for recent items.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIf i activate the search box without insert anything the search box suggest me, google like, a few last search I've made. Even if there are made in other tab or in closed ones."
