Build an extension/widget app that expects session that is shared by page document and XmlHttpRequests. Example test extension is my AutoSMS tool (currently in Safari extension gallery, to which the extension used to work but stopped working for some reason), as well as my Mac OS X widget, both of which also hosted here:\r\n\r\nhttp://autosmsclients.googlecode.com/files/autosms.safariextz\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/autosmsclients/downloads/detail?name=autosms.wdgt.zip\r\n\r\nFor this exmaple app, sending SMS fails when providing all valid input. Because PHPSESSID cookie is not passed from document.cookie to the XmlHttpRequest POST request that sends the SMS.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\n\r\nsession cookie should be shared between page document & XmlHttpRequest. SMS should be sent successfully for my AutoSMS app.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\n\r\nappears there is no session sharing and sending SMS from AutoSMS fails.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\r\npossibly, since it used to work when I first built the Safari 5 extension. Can't get it to work anymore.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nposted to Safari developer forum with no help. Got some insight from stack overflow post.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11272418/session-state-persistence-between-web-page-content-and-xmlhttprequest-for-mac-da\r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/thread/152323?tstart=120"
