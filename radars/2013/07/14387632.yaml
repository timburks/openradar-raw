    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen changing a build setting Xcode does not update dependent Info.plist files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a simple Xcode project, for example an iOS single view app.\r\n2. Create a new xcconfig file in the project.\r\n3. Set the project configurations to be based on that xcconfig file.\r\n4. Add a custom setting to that file, like MY_SETTING = foo\r\n5. Add a custom key to the project's Info.plist file, like <key>foo</key><string>${MY_SETTING}</string>\r\n6. Build and check the Info.plist file in the build product. The contained value will be \"foo\", as expected.\r\n7. Change the xcconfig file to MY_SETTING = bar\r\n8. Build again. The setting will not be updated to \"bar\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Info.plist file should reflect the current build setting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Info.plist file is not updated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis does not depend on a custom build setting, the same error occurs with built-in build settings."
