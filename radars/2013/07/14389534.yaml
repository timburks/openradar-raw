    description: "UPDATE 2/25/2014\r\nSecurity Update 2014-001 appends Lion to the 10.7 version, so it has unique names for both the filename and the softwareupdate command line output as well.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nSince mid 2012, all security updates and Java update package names have been stripped of platform name suffixes and in the case of Java, release numbers\r\n \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload Security Update 2013-003 for all three platforms: Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion\r\nOpen all the disk images\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPackages are uniquely named with the platform name in the suffix.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPackages and Volume names are all the same resulting in confusion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior to Security Update 2012-004 for Snow Leopard naming was unique, after this suffixes were removed.\r\nPrior to Java Updates for 10.7/10.8 release names were unique and denoted the release number."
