    description: Many modern apps, such as Xcode, use a single window that contains multiple open documents. I would like to request documentation on how to use NSDocument/NSDocumentController to accomplish this effect. Rather than one window controller per document, there should be one view controller per document, which could be dropped into an arbitrary view hierarchy. Is there a way to coax NSDocument to behave thusly?
