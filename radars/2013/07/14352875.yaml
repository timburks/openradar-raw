    description: "04-Jul-2013 03:17 PM Matthew Cengia:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe FileVault 2 \"Enable Users...\" option doesn't allow removal of users who you don't want decrypting your disk, and new users created *after* FileVault is enabled are automatically given decrypt permission.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Turn on FileVault 2.\r\n\r\n2.  Create a new user.\r\n\r\n3.  Go to FileVault tab in Security & Privacy and click \"Enable Users...\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNewly created user should be listed as enabled so that it can be disabled if desired\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOnly currently disabled users are listed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe \"Enable Users...\" option should list *all* users, and allow enabling and disabling of any of them.\r\n\r\nWhen a new user is created, the creator should be asked at that point whether this user should be allowed to decrypt the disk."
