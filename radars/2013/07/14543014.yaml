    description: "Summary: An MKMapView that is showing satellite imagery (Hybrid or Satellite) will show the \"no data\" grid when zoomed in to the highest level (level 20). This happens universally, not just in locations where limited imagery exists. If you pinch to zoom just by one pixel (thereby reducing the zoom level to 19.xx imagery will appear. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an MKMapView.\r\n2. Set mapType to MKMapTypeSatellite or MKMapTypeHybrid\r\n3. Either Zoom all the way out with a gesture, or explicitly set the region to a very small area, like:\r\n            MKCoordinateRegion smallRegion =  MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(coordinate, 1.0, 1.0);\r\n            [self setRegion:smallRegion animated:YES];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn most areas, you should see satellite imagery at the highest zoomlevel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo satellite imagery occurs. Instead the gridded \"no-data\" view is displayed. Additionally, the MKMapViewDelegate method â€“mapViewDidFailLoadingMap:withError: is not called. The response happens immediately. (It does not seem like any attempt is made to get images from the network.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI cannot place a date on this behavior, but the map was functioning properly when we release version 2.1 of the Homesnap app in March or April. Subsequent to that, all maps seemed to stop working some time (possibly in late April or May. It did not seem to be related to an OS release, but possibly a map data release.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen in iOS 6, but that is more likely due to the fact that in iOS six, maps could not zoom beyond level 18.\r\n\r\nThis happens in a number of popular app including Find My Phone, Zillow, Glympse, Parkmobile. (I have attached screenshots of all the apps.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a sample project that illustrates the bug. However, any app that uses an MKMapView and Hybrid or Satellite modes will illustrate the issue. Additionally, the project can be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/DeepFriedTwinkie/iOS6MapZoomIssue\r\n\r\nWhen I was at WWDC, I showed this issue to a MapKit engineer and a MapKit QA person. Both agreed that it was an issue."
