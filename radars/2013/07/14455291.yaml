        A lot of apps wish to respond to a single user-chosen key combination. For example, a calendar app may use such a key combination to open a window to allow the user to enter a new event.

        Currently, one can use Carbon to do this (or a third party library that wraps Carbon). Alternatively, one could use addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:handler: on NSEvent, but that has security implications and is only allowed if accessibility is enabled.

        I would like an API where the app can hand it a key combination (that must contain at least one modifier key), and then a callback to that app is made whenever that key combo is pressed.
