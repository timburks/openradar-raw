    description: "Summary:\nImagine the following scenario. In Xcode 5, a workspace contains multiple projects from multiple different repositories. One of them is the main project's repository. An other one is a separate utilities library. The library project is then extended with a new class and this new class is used in the main project. When everything works as expected, the changes have to be commited to the respective repositories. \nInvoking the Commit command from the Source Control will bring up the commit sheet and list all the files changed from all the working copies. It is only possible to specify a single commit message for all the working copies. I think it would make more sense to allow different commit messages for each of the working copies. The commit message for the library project might be \"Added a new class X\" while the main project's commit message could be \"Fixed bug Y using class X\". A joint commit message for all the repositories is rarely if ever appropriate. While it is currently possible to select or deselect the files to be commited, it is very easy to mess things up in a more complex workspace.\nAlternatively Commit menu items could be added to each of the separate working copy menu items in the Source Control menu. Using those Commit menu items Xcode could automatically only mark the files from that working copy to be commited. This way one could first separately commit the new class to the library repository, using an appropriate commit message. And then the main project could be commited, including any changes and the updated revision reference to the library."
