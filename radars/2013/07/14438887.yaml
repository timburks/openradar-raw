    description: "14-Jul-2013 02:09 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe most recent OS X Mountain Lion update, 10.8.4 (12E55) breaks the functionality of the Apple DVI to video adapter. This is a software regression bug caused by changes in this latest minor release. The adapter works on OS X 10.8.3 and prior, as well as in Microsoft Windows 7 via Bootcamp.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUpgrade your OS X install from 10.8.3 or previous to 10.8.4 and attempt to use an Apple DVI to video adapter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect OS X to detect the new display and start pumping video out to the television as it did in previous versions of OS X and and as it does in Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe adapter is not detected, or is not properly configured resulting in either no or incorrect output being sent to the television.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem occurred after of the OS X 10.8.3 to 10.8.4 upgrade. This is not a hardware problem. The adapter continues to work in previous versions of OS X as well as when booted into Microsoft Windows via Bootcamp.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is on a mid-2007 MacBook Pro 17\" with the 2.4GHz processor and the Nvidia GeForce 8600M GT.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this regression as this feature has worked for 6 years and only broke as part of a software regression introduced in this latest OS Mountain Lion minor release. Sure this is antiquated technology, but it broke due to a software problem rather than a hardware problem."
