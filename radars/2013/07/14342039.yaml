    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSet up a UIScrollView using autolayout. Content size is calculated automatically based on the contents.\r\nIf you push and then pop a view controller when the scroll view has an offset then you can no longer scroll to see all the contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached XCode project.\r\n\r\nUINavigationController with root view controller that contains UIScrollView.\r\nThere are two buttons that will push to a new view controller.\r\n\r\nIf you use the top button (with scroll view contents not scrolled) and then pop the view controller then everything is OK.\r\n\r\nIf you use the bottom button (with scroll view contents scrolled) and then pop the view controller then it is no longer possible to view the whole contents.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScroll view scrolls to all of content\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScroll view does not allow you to see all of contents\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe contentSize for the scroll view is calculated the same. It appears that there is something a bit like a contentInset being applied that is half the distance of the contentOffset when you push to the child view controller.\r\n\r\nIf you cache the contentOffset before pushing and then apply it back in viewDidAppear then everything works OK. Applying the cached value back in viewWillAppear does not fix the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFixed in iOS 7 beta 2"
