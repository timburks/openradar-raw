    description: "23-Jul-2013 06:46 PM Ben Syverson:\r\nSummary:\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any way to view your search history in Safari anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Tap the URL/Search bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the past, a search history would appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo search historyâ€”instead, a list of top sites.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is new to iOS 7.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's often faster to bring up a past search than to sift through your entire browser history. A search may lead you down a convoluted path as you browse for more information, so your visited history can grow to be quite long. In contrast, the search history tends to highlight general topics.\r\n\r\nAs such, search history is much more concise, and faster to parse and browse. This can be a great help on a mobile device where space is at a premium."
