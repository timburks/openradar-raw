    description: "18-Jul-2013 03:37 PM Josh Avant:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a UIReturnKeySearch is clicked, a newline character is sent to`searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:` (when using UISearchBar, for example).\r\n\r\nThis is a poor design because the key is presented to the user as a blue, action-type key labelled 'Search', which doesn't suggest that it would be used to insert a newline into the text field.\r\n\r\nFurther, if NO is returned from `searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:` when the UIReturnKeySearch button is clicked, `searchBarSearchButtonClicked:` will not be called by the framework.\r\n\r\nThis forces the developer to accept the newline character in `searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:`, then sanitize the UISearchBar's text in `searchBarSearchButtonClicked` for this specific scenario, which is a bad design.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached code\r\n2. Touch the UISearchBar text field to activate the keyboard\r\n3. Press Search key\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-No newline character is sent to `searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:`.\r\n-`searchBarSearchButtonClicked:` is called, independent of the return result for `searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:`.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n`searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:` returns NO, causing `searchBarSearchButtonClicked:` not to be called.\r\n\r\n18-Jul-2013 03:37 PM Josh Avant:\r\n'UIReturnKeySearchNewline.zip' was successfully uploaded"
