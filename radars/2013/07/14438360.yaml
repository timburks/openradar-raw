    description: "Summary: The information button on the bottom right corner of the stocks app is not consistent with other Apple apps that result in similar list editing views (i.e. Weather). Furthermore, this button type is visually indicative of iOS 6-style UIButton of type Info Light. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Stocks app from home screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Either a UIButton in the list style similarly found in Weather app or a UIButton of type Info Light for a proper detail disclosure view.\r\n\r\nActual Results: A UIButton similar to that found in iOS 6\r\n\r\nRegression: Problem occurs in portrait mode on devices running iOS 7 (11A4414e)\r\n\r\nNotes: The purpose of this radar report is to help provide consistency and uniformity across default apps so that a person may not misinterpret purpose of actions."
