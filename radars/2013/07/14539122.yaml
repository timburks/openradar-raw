    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niMessage messages in the Messages app still shuffles messages in some seemingly random order between the time a computer goes to sleep and wakes up, especially if messages are sent/received on another device at the same time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start an iMessage-based conversation with someone on the Mac. It helps if there is already a lengthy discussion history.\r\n2. Put the Mac to sleep, then continue the conversation on an iPhone or iPad.\r\n3. Wake the computer and observe a very non-chronological-based order suddenly kick in for messages that were sorted fine before the computer went to sleep.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMessages should remain in a chronological order at all times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMessages are displayed in a pseudo-random order. If there is any logic to the order the messages appear in, I cannot see it. And I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out in what order they might possibly be in.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n10.8.4 release notes stated \"A fix for an issue that may cause iMessages to display out of order in Messages\"; however, this appears to be written in a fictional manner.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease, please, please fix this once and for all! I'd be happy to test any pre-releases to confirm whether or not it's still an issue."
