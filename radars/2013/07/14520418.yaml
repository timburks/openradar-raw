    description: "Summary: Dequeuing a UITableViewCell and calling systemLayoutSizeFittingSize can cause a NSInternalInconsistencyException on iOS 7, that does not happen on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- The goal of the code is to create a table view cell that can expand vertically based on its content.\r\n- Create a UITableViewController with a custom cell that has a label in it.\r\n- Set constraints on the label such that its height is not fixed, but depends on the cell's height.\r\n- In viewDidLoad:\r\n  - Dequeue a cell.\r\n  - Set the label's text.\r\n  - Add a width constraint to the cell so it matches the table view's width.\r\n  - Call systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:UILayoutFittingExpandedSize on the cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A CGSize is returned with the result.\r\n\r\nActual Results: A NSInternalInconsistencyException is generated with the reason 'Invalid parameter not satisfying: isfinite(c)' \r\n\r\nRegression: The problem occurs on iOS 7 beta, regardless of whether the app is built with Xcode 4 or Xcode 5. The problem does not occur on iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes: Sample project that exhibits the crash is attached."
