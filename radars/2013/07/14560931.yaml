    description: "26-Jul-2013 12:23 PM Amruta Krishna Ravavarapu:\r\nSummary: Keychain Access Service returns -25308 UserInteraction not allowed when trying to access the keychain items data when the app is launched. This happens when the user tries to use the app after restarting the device. We are using the default kSecAttrAccessible attribute value (i.e. kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked). This doesn't happen consistently. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Set the pin lock for the device. Run the sample project on the device and reboot the device and unlock your device.  Use the app after restart, and it should crash. Since we are raising unhandled exception when we get this error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Should be able to give access the keychain service since the user has unlocked his device and every app should be able to access its own keychain items.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Sometimes, after the reboot of the device and the unlocking of the device, we are not able to access keychain service since it is throwing an error -25308 UserInteraction not allowed \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2013 12:23 PM Amruta Krishna Ravavarapu:\r\n'GenericKeychain.zip' was successfully uploaded"
