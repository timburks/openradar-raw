    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://7827522\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\niOS SDK: make networkActivityIndicatorVisible behave as a semaphore\r\n\r\nCurrently, networkActivityIndicatorVisible is a BOOL, simply YES or NO. This forces developers to create their own semaphore-style code to track number of active network connections and hide the indicator once all requests are complete.\r\n\r\nThis in itself is not onerous, but when incorporating third-party code that also wants to be a good citizen and display the indicator appropriately, the separate implementations will interfere with each other, most notably hiding the indicator when requests are still active.\r\n\r\nProviding a standard \"increment/decrement requests\" functionality to the framework would allow developers to easily incorporate shared code and have this behavior \"just work.\""
