    description: "When a timer is set, the iPhone lock screen should display a live countdown of the time remaining on the timer.\r\n\r\nThis would provide busy and preoccupied users a quick way to see how much time is left on their timer. In situations like cooking or home improvement, it's not always practical to open the app or invoke Siri.\r\n\r\nI think this would be neat."
