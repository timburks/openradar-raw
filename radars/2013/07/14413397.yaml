He goes to in the Settings app -> Safari -> Auto-Complete -> Saved Passwords\r\n5. Now he can see all of my saved passwords\r\n\r\nExcepted Results:\r\nThose passwords should be protected by a master password like the AppleID password.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey are not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nCreate another view controller inside the Settings app -> iCloud -> Keychain which will hold all the saved passwords like:\r\n- Login passwords from Safari\r\n- Wi-Fi Network passwords\r\n- etc."
