    description: "Summary:\r\nDebugging an app that behaves differently depending on the battery state or battery level is difficult, especially for battery state, since the device must be plugged in to debug it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Write code that depends on a specific battery state or battery level where the state is not \"Charging\" or \"Full.\"\r\n2. Try to execute that code on the device while attached to the debugger.\r\n3. Give up, then write code that modifies the UI of your app to confirm what it’s doing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should be able to debug this code.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe device can’t be debugged when the power is disconnected, and the iOS Simulator doesn’t support modifying those states, either.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBattery level and state monitoring has been available since iOS 3.0, so since then.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBeing able to modify the values via a menu in the iOS Simulator would be an effective way of solving this problem. Currently the Simulator reports a power state of \"unknown.\""
