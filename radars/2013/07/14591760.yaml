        Summary:
        instancetype is a better pattern for subclassing. So templates and autocomplete should support that.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode (version doesn't matter, all latest versions are the same).
        2. Create a new single-view project.
        3. Go to the view controller.
        4. Start typing init, and select autocomplete for a new init method.
        5. Notice that return type is (id) instead of (instancetype)

        Expected Results:
        Should see instancetype instead of id in init method return types.

        Actual Results:
        Still see id. :(

        Regression:
        no

        Notes:
        Apple's frameworks have largely switched to using instancetype, and we'll be teaching it. It would be a lot easier if the dev tools (Xcode) supported using instancetype instead of id.
