    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen switching between the currently active application and the most recent but one application, one is tempted to press cmd-tab and while holding cmd press tab again, then let go. This can be done very quickly and before the bezel actually displays, however, if the bezel has not yet displayed then the second key press of tab is not registered and the application switch you were expecting is not what you get.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have lots of apps running.\r\n2. Hold cmd, press tab twice, then release all keys.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe most recently active but one app is now the active app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe most recently active app is now the active app."
