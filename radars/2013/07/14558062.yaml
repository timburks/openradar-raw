    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMobile web apps would benefit from an option allowing to lock the screen orientation to either portrait, landscape or a combination of these. This would help make them feel more like native apps.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would only work for apps which are run in standalone mode. A similar option would be <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"\"> which also only works when the web app is run from the homescreen. Like that, people browsing such a website casually would not be irritated by a it locking the screen orientation, but developers would benefit greatly from this ability.\r\n\r\nThe most sane syntax would be something like <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-allowed-orientations\" content=\"\"> with the following options:\r\n\r\n- `all` (default)\r\n- `portrait`\r\n- `landscape`\r\n- `landscape-left`\r\n- `landscape-right`\r\n\r\nThe options can then be combined using a comma-separated list, like this:\r\n\r\n`<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-allowed-orientations\" content=\"portrait, landscape-left\">`\r\n\r\nUsing the syntax described above and the provided restrictions developers could benefit greatly without the overall user-experience being deteriorated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a web app.\r\n2. Rotate to an undesired rotation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApple offers an option to prevent the user from rotating the page to an undesired rotation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApple does not offer such an option.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
