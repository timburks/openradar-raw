    description: "Summary:\r\nBackground:  I was trying to write some simple code that logs to and reads back from the ASL log on iOS.  The same code works in a Mac OS X application and also in the iOS simulator, however, asl_search doesn't read the records back on iOS.  So, I posted a question on the devforums (https://devforums.apple.com/message/850994) and I got some feedback from an Apple DTS engineer that listed a number of differences between the behaviour of ASL on Mac OS X and iOS. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this information is not documented anywhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch for information that outlines the difference in ASL behaviour between iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn official Apple document that describes (at least) the following pieces of info:\r\n - iOS only stores 256 entries\r\n - iOS is in-memory only \r\n - iOS restricts access to kernel entries\r\n - other differences??\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo documentation.  There are several places where Quinn describes the differences in the dev forums or on stack overflow, but that is not the right place for this info.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMy original question in the dev forum was about why asl_search wasn't retrieving log entries that I had logged.  This radar is not about that (I will raise a separate radar for that)... this radar is about the fact that the documentation does not describe the different implementation details between the platforms."
