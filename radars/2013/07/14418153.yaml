    description: "Summary: the system-wide Spotlight menu should support extension: or ext: to search for file extensions\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Click on the Spotlight menu or invoke it with Command-Space.\r\n2. Type the following, without quotation marks: \"extension:psd\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe search results show all my psd files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe search returns only one result: a Messages.app message transcript wherein I described this feature to a coworker before filing the radar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has never worked, and as far as I can tell, it continues not to work in the latest Mavericks dev seeds.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere is an Extension field in the Finder's spotlight search options (pickable from the Otherâ€¦ menu item), but there is no textual shortcut to invoke it. You can search for kind:photoshop in the system-wide Spotlight menu, but then you also get back non-psd Photoshop files such as .tpl templates and .csh custom shapes.\r\n\r\nI can actually get the results I would want from \"kind:photoshop kind:image\", but that only happens to be true in this case, and may not serve all cases. There should be a dedicated option to search by extension."
