    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen running tests, no console output is shown unless a debugger breakpoint is encountered.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a new Xcode project with a unit-test bundle (e.g. an iOS app, or Cocoa Framework). Press COMMAND-U to run the test target.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTests run, and test output is displayed in the console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTests run, but no test output is displayed. Output is displayed if a breakpoint is encountered, but not when tests fail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTests are definitely running. The CPU/Memory/Energy displays are updating, and the \"Testing...\" spinner is displayed at the top of the window. In addition, the \"Build Succeeded\" and \"Tests Suceeded\" notifications are displayed. When tests fail, the failure messages are shown in the issues navigator as well."
