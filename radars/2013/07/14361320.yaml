    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have two 27\" monitors connected to my Mac, with screen mirroring turned on. While moving the mouse around the screen, every few seconds or so, the mouse will briefly stop moving, and then end up across the screen, apparently trying to make up the ground that it lost. It seems as though the system is cpu spiking on the display thread."
