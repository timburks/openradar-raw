    description: "16-Jul-2013 11:31 AM Paul Goracke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen using the Phone app's voicemail feature, you cannot change away from the tab without the currently playing voicemail message being interrupted.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful behavior to have when needing to call back a number given in the voicemail. Instead of having to find a pen and paper or switch to a different app, the ability to be enter the number directly into the keypad while listening is desired.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Open the Phone app, switch to Voicemail tab.\r\n2. Select a message and begin playing.\r\n3. Switch to the Keypad tab.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe voicemail audio continues to play, and I can enter a phone number given in the message into the keypad while listening.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe voicemail audio terminates as soon as the tab is switched."
