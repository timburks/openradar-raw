    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn IB if you initiate an universal app with an iPhone and an iPad storyboard and without using the xcassets, add an UIIMageView and select an image, the interface shows a preview of the rendered asset.\r\nIf you add an image.png and an image~ipad.png IB can't find the iPad one and show the iPhone asset.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIn IB if I choose and image that have an iPad specific version in an iPad storyboard, Xcode must present the iPad ones and not the normal version."
