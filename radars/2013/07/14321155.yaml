    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a feature request.  In the SCM commit window, it would be nice to have the ability to automatically paste in previous commit message when pressing a keyboard shortcut.  \r\n\r\nThe reason this is useful is when placing ticket numbers in commit messages, it removes the need to look up this number each time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. Open a project that is connected to SCM.\r\n2. Click Menu: Source Control -> Commit\r\n3. Click in commit message text area.\r\n4. Press Command+UpArrow (for example) and previous commit message will populate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI use this feature in GitBox and it is quite handy.  Websites like Github allow you to tag commit logs with ticket numbers.  This feature avoid the need to constantly look up the number on previous commits.\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nP.S. The improvements to the SCM tools in XCode 5 are pretty awesome!!!!  Love it!"
