    description: "28-Apr-2012 02:25 PM Gregory Combs:\r\nThe CLGeocoder reverseGeocode works fine, except it only produces Zip5 postal codes.  For most of my purposes, dealing with ballots and election precincts, I actually need the full 9 digit ZIP+4 postal codes ... can we get a little more granularity on the postal codes?  Alternative, add an additional property so that you can keep both around for backwards compatibility."
