    description: Sometimes there is a situation where an app runs as a menu bar item but occasionally runs separate windows. In this case it is easy to "lose" the apps windows behind other running apps windows and then having no obvious way of getting them back. This could be alleviated by allowing this app to have a presence in the app switcher (perhaps only when it is displaying separate windows) so that these can be switched to in the case of other apps becoming active while they are still being used.
