    description: "Summary:\r\nMFMailComposeViewController crashes when you try to present it and there are no mail accounts. Conversely, SLComposeViewController presents an alert telling the user they need to create an account when they try to Tweet or Post to Facebook and they don't have a Twitter or Facebook account setup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Delete your all your Email, Facebook, and Twitter accounts on the device. \r\n2) Present an MFMailComposeViewController. It causes a crash.\r\n3) Present an SLComposeViewController for Twitter or Facebook. An alert is presented saying you need to setup an account. There's even a handy Settings button that takes you right to the Settings app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMFMailComposeViewController should behave like SLComposeViewController and present an alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMFMailComposeViewController crashes and you have to do your own check and present your own alert.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
