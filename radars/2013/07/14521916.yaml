        Summary:
        Writing header documentation is now much more useful. But there is a lot of boilerplate typing involved. Using a snippet can help, but it'd be better if Xcode could help autocomplete a header template based on the actual method parameters and return value.

        See here for an example of someone who wrote an Xcode plugin to do this:
        https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode

        I like the choice of "///" as a keyboard shortcut that would only trigger the new functionality if it was typed in the correct place (above a method or class definition), but other options work too.
