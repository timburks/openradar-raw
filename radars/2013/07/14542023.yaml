    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter logging into OS X having checked the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" box prior to restarting, apps that were previously fullscreen are resumed in a \"regular\" windowed state, then proceed to transition back into their fullscreen state.\r\n\r\nI tend to have a lot of apps running at any given time, many are development related and benefit from the fullscreen experience on my iMac. It is incredibly frustrating to reboot for whatever reason, hoping that this feature will help me quickly get back to where I left off, and then get interrupted repeatedly as OS X tries to show me how wonderfully it can animate into fullscreen mode. It does this for each app I had in fullscreen mode one by one.\r\n\r\nTypically, it takes about a full minute or more (haven't timed it, but it isn't fast) to re-open all the apps I was using and so it's not uncommon for me to be reading an email or webpage and repeatedly get interrupted with this animation. I don't mind this animation at all when I actually click the fullscreen toggle on an app, but I am not clicking it in this case yet it still shows this slow, unstoppable animation that completely destroys my train of thought.\r\n\r\nWould it not be possible to do this process silently? I mean, the point of the feature is to restore the state of all your apps prior to rebooting, right? Why not silently restore the virtual desktop and silently restore that app into it? Do it in a way that blocks off the user input if necessary, similar to how apps that are in the process of resuming get the spinning cog to show you that they are in the process of loading their state.... just in case they try to flip over to that space before the fullscreen app has finished restoring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave Xcode, TextMate, Safari, Mail and Messages open in fullscreen mode. Add about 10 \"regularly\" windowed apps so that there is plenty of state restoration to occur. Restart OS X with the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" box checked and get some popcorn. When you log back into OS X, try your damnedest to read an email that you just got from your PM about that thing you're trying to ship in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe ability to read and mentally digest the contents of the email without OS X reenacting the incredibly slow fullscreen animation that it clearly couldn't get enough of the first time (when I actually wanted it).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOS X waits until you are mid-sentence in learning about the unholy level of scope creep that your PM just threw at you and then dramatically takes from you the world you had just become reacquainted with and replaces it with another virtual desktop that you currently don't need or care about.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI think this issue has been present since fullscreen apps + state restoration was introduced... however I don't have any hard numbers on that.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
