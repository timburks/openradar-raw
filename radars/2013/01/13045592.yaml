    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen building payload-free packages with pkgbuild, the installation of the payload-free package does not produce a receipt\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build payload-free package with pkgbuild using the following command:\r\n\r\nsudo pkgbuild --identifier com.company.run_software_update --nopayload --scripts /Users/username/Desktop/Run_Software_Update/scripts \"/Users/username/Desktop/Run_Software_Update/Run Apple Software Update and Restart.pkg\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter payload-free package is installed, receipt is generated and two files are put into /var/db/receipts:\r\n\r\n/var/db/receipts/com.company.run_software_update.plist\r\n/var/db/receipts/com.company.run_software_update.bom\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nReceipt is not generated. .plist and .bom files are not in /var/db/receipts\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWas able to reproduce problem on 10.7.5 Build 11G63 and 10.8.2 Build 12C30006.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's notes:\r\n\r\n25-Feb-2013 04:56 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of receipts is principally to track upgrade behavior.  They are not 'cookies'.  Payload-free packages are meant to be convenient bags of scripts.\r\n\r\nIf this is still an issue, or you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue."
