    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to switch from the default Google search to a different search engine. Yahoo and Bing are not sufficient. I would prefer to switch to DuckDuckGo as my default search engine. \r\n\r\nNext to that I would like to use the Google encrypted search as a backup, instead of the plain Google search configured in Safari by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open preferences -> General\r\n2. Click the 'Default search engine' popup button\r\n3. Select a search engine other than the default 3 options\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBeing able to add an option to the search menu, for example using a menu item in the popup button that says: 'Customise'.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to customise the search engines in Safari\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis could be made easier by implementing something like the opensearch discovery protocol, so average users won't need to know about search engine query templates to add a new search engine."
