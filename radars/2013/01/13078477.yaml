    description: "I'm sure you're all well aware of this and trying to make it better, but here's a radar anyway. :)\r\n\r\nSiri does not understand people well enough. On several occasions I've witnessed people new to iOS trying to show off Siri to friends in a crowded, bustling, loud coffee shop. No doubt Siri worked well enough when they were at home playing with it, but here, with their friends, in the noise, it totally and utterly fails. They end up feeling foolish as they repeat the same thing 2.. 3... 4.. times and it doesn't work. It's embarrassing for them. It reflects poorly on Apple and themselves. Next time they're less likely to brag about it. Next time they might not trust it. Next time they might not buy Apple.. and next time they won't be a potential customer for me. This hurts us all. I don't know the tech and I don't know what you can do, but it's got to be better. It's got to be bulletproof. It's got to feel real."
