    description: "There is no free price tier for In App Purchases on iOS. All In App Purchases must be given a price.\r\n\r\nPricing of In App Purchases should be treated like apps so that we can offer short term promotions. For example, a game may included several In App Purchases for additional levels. We may want to offer some of these levels for free as a temporary promotion.\r\n\r\nThe only option we have is to provide our own system for offering these In App Purchases for free by bypassing StoreKit. The problem with this is that it prevents free purchases from being restored across devices. This behaviour would not be accepted in the App Store, therefore it should not be accepted for In App Purchases."
