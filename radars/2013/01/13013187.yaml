    description: "Summary: I recently had my account disabled, for reasons not entirely clear to me. Attempting to download or update an app is giving the error \"Your Apple ID has been disabled.\" On iOS, this is the only information related to the error given anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn iTunes for the Mac, a much more helpful second line is included: \"Contact iTunes Support at http://www.apple.com/itunes/storesupport/ for assistance.\" There's no reason this information shouldn't be included in iOS. I had a very hard time figuring out the appropriate contact method to use for this, which made a troubling and confusing problem much worse.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log into an Apple ID for which purchases have been disabled.\r\n2. Open the App Store\r\n3. Attempt to download anything. I've tried this with updates to apps that are already installed, apps I have purchased but do not have installed, and apps that I don't own at all.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A problem this severe and alarming should include information about what to do to resolve it.\r\n\r\nActual Results: On iOS, the only error given is \"Your Apple ID has been disabled.\" I can even go to \"View Apple ID\" and there's no indication of a problem there at all, much less any helpful information.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: N/A\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI just wanted to follow up with more details on my experience: Once I got the http://www.apple.com/itunes/storesupport/ link on my Mac, I clicked a few links and filled out a form, which took me to a support article: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2446?viewlocale=en_US (I'm not sure why the link in the article couldn't just take me straight there.) The link didn't help me, but below the link to the article was also a large \"Email\" button that did get me started in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThrough email I got the number 1-800-275-2273 which seems to be the main support number in the US. I called them and they fixed the problem for me in less than 15 minutes. I actually put off calling them for a few days because the alarming and unhelpful error message had me convinced I'd be spending closer to an hour on the phone sorting it out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a link to http://support.apple.com/kb/HE57 (listing the worldwide support links and phone numbers) would be the most useful link to provide along with this error message. On iOS a button to open the link should also be provided."
