    description: "29-Jan-2013 10:23 AM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen submitting a missing location on the Maps \"Report a Problem\" screen, entering any field besides \"Address\" before \"Name\" is populated prevents a name from being entered (it is impossible to select the field).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the Maps page curl select \"Report a Problem\"\r\n2. Select \"Location is missing\" and click next\r\n3. Move the pin the the appropriate location (using either Standard or Hybrid)\r\n4. Enter the phone number, hours, url of the location\r\n5. Attempt to enter name\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nName can be added after other information fields are populated (as was the case in prior builds of iOS)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nName can only be added first or after Address field is populated. Populating any other field first prevents the name field from having text entered, forcing the user to cancel and start the process over.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked in 6.0 and 6.0.1. Unknown for prior builds of 6.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshot attached (note different format of \"name\" field).\r\n\r\n29-Jan-2013 10:23 AM Robert Willmore:\r\n'photo.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
