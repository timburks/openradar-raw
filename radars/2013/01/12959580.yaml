    description: "04-Jan-2013 10:55 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nLong time ago I mistakenly registered two Apple ID of mine as free Apple Developer accounts: \"xfox\" (the one I'm using right now to file this bug report) and \"xfox@mac.com\". \"xfox@mac.com\" has then been disabled as a Developer Account and I've never actively used it for anything developer related. In fact, \"xfox@mac.com\" is still disabled, as I can verify trying to login with it on http://connect.apple.com/.\r\nAs far as I remember, I've never been able to login to Apple Bug Reporter using the disabled \"xfox@mac.com\" Apple ID but I tried last night and now it works. I think that Bug Reporter should prevent disabled Developer Apple ID(s) to login. I don't know if it's a general problem affecting all disabled Developer accounts or my account only.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Login to Apple Bug Reporter with a disabled Developer account like \"xfox@mac.com\".\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLogin should be denied.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLogin is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n21-Jan-2013 08:46 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nAs requested, RadarWeb access has been removed from the account \"xfox@mac.com\".\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether the issue is resolved for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Jan-2013 03:51 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nFirst time I tried to login with \"xfox@mac.com\" after your update, I used Safari 6.0.2 and I got a red error saying:\r\n\"An error has occurred. Please report the error to Apple Inc. by emailing the error detail to debugs@apple.com.\".\r\nPlease see attached screenshot \"An error has occurred..png\".\r\nIt should not error like that, IMHO, but at least my disabled Apple ID has not been allowed to log in.\r\nBy the way, the Home button never works.\r\n\r\nAfter that I tried to login with \"xfox@mac.com\" using a different browser than Safari (I don't know if it could matter) and I've been allowed to log in!\r\nPlease see attached screenshot \"I'm in.png\".\r\nEvery other subsequent tentative to log in with \"xfox@mac.com\" using Safari or other browsers has been successful.\r\n\r\nIt seems the issue is NOT resolved.\r\n\r\n22-Jan-2013 04:02 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'An error has occurred.-1.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Aug-2013 11:41 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following:\r\n\r\nThat Apple ID should now be deactivated and access to Bug Reporter should be removed.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether that helps you resolve the issue by updating your bug report.\r\n\r\n\r\n27-Aug-2013 12:07 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nOk, now I understand what happened a few hours ago.\r\nThere is a problem, this time you completely disabled my \"xfox@mac.com\" Apple ID, not only RadarWeb access!\r\nThe whole point of this bug was that I found that disabled Developer Apple IDs could still access Apple Bug Reporter and the resolution is NOT to completely disable my Apple ID but to have your systems prevent (all) disabled Developer Apple IDs to access the Bug Reporter!\r\nI'm using \"xfox@mac.com\" as my main Apple ID for iCloud, iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Training and so on and since this afternoon I'm stuck!\r\nAs soon as I noticed I could not access my e-mail anymore I contacted AppleCare regarding this issue and I have a couple of follow up numbers you could check against:\r\n- 497638088\r\n- 283111386\r\nPlease reenable my Apple ID as soon as possible, meanwhile I'll update the senior advisor that's following this case."
