    description: "Summary: Apple TV has a really nice view when you select the Music icon. It shows the last few albums that were recently added. I'd love to be able to do something similar in iTunes, which would basically just mean adding \"Date Added\" to the sorting options for Albums.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes\r\n2. Select Music\r\n3. Click Albums\r\n4. Choose View > View Options…\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I thought for sure there would be a \"Date Added\" option or something similar, but no luck.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The only date-related option is \"Year\", which surely is much less useful to people.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: There was one other way I thought I might be able to do this: create a playlist of recently added music, sort by \"Date Added\", then switch to \"Grid\" view. But nope—it switches to sorting by Artist, and View > View Options… no longer includes the \"Date Added\" option."
