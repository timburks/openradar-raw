    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen calling focus() on a text input element from a touchend event called triggered on that same input element, the user will not be able to input text into the element. Pressing any of the keys on the keyboard seems to have no effect. Tapping the text input element a second time should cause the entered text to suddenly appear. Tapping it a third time will render it unusable again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Load the attached test case in Safari on iOS\r\n2) Tap the text input\r\n3) Attempt to enter text using the virtual keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1) The entered text appears\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n2) No text appears and the input box remains blank\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis was not present on iOS 5.0.1 or iOS 5.1. The regression began with iOS 6.0 and has continued with iOS 6.1 beta 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe attached test case is available at: https://raw.github.com/ftlabs/fastclick/master/tests/37-reduced.html"
