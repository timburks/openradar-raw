    description: "31-Jan-2013 08:57 PM Dair Grant:\r\nCFSocketCreateWithSocketSignature creates a socket with CFSocketCreate+CFSocketSetAddress, and CFSocketSetAddress binds the socket.\r\n\r\nThis renders CFSocketCreateWithSocketSignature incompatible with SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT, as these options must be set after the socket is created but before the socket is bound.\r\n\r\nI would like CFSocketCreateWithSocketSignature's documentation to be updated to point this out, as setsockopt does not provide an error when this option is set on a bound socket. As SO_REUSEADDR is probably the default behaviour you want for listening sockets (side-effects notwithstanding), this API is probably not a good choice for server code.\r\n\r\nAlternatively CFSocketCreateWithSocketSignature could be deprecated, and a CFSocketCreateBoundSocket API introduced that could take some options to apply to the socket?"
