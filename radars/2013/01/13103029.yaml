    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe zsh startup file /etc/zshenv alters $PATH using /usr/libexec/path_helper. Since *every* instance of zsh sources /etc/zshenv, $PATH is altered even by non-login shells (e.g., when one runs \"zsh\" from the command-line).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a new Terminal window or tab.\r\n2. Prepend a new directory to the $PATH environment variable. For example, run \"export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:${PATH}\"\r\n3. Run a zsh shell that only sources /etc/zshenv and prints $PATH. This can be done by running:\r\n\r\n    /bin/zsh -o NO_RCS -c 'echo $PATH'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNon-login shells should not alter $PATH; they should respect the value of $PATH that they inherit from the parent environment. An instance of zsh started from the command line should therefore have the same value of $PATH as the parent shell had.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe non-login zsh sources /etc/zshenv, which evals \"/usr/libexec/path_helper -s\", which changes $PATH.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI believe all versions of OS X with zsh have this issue, although I currently cannot verify.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA similar issue probably exists for bash, since /etc/bashrc also evals path_helper.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is to run path_helper in /etc/zprofile, which is only sourced by login shells."
