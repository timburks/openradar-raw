    description: "31-Jan-2013 08:50 PM Dair Grant:\r\nSummary:\r\nRenaming a source tree can result in the loss of that source tree entry, without warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a source tree called \"Test1\", with a path to \"/Library/Apple\".\r\n2. Create a source tree called \"Test2\", with a path to \"/Library/Pear\".\r\n3. Rename \"Test2\" to \"Test1\". There are now two \"Test1\"s in the list.\r\n4. Rename the \"Test1\" from step 1 to \"Test1_old\". There is now \"Test1_old\" (Apple) and \"Test1\" (Pear).\r\n5. Close the preferences window.\r\n6. Open the preferences window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth \"Test1_old\" (Apple) and \"Test1\" (Pear)\" should be present in the list, as they were there when the window was closed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Test1_old\" (Apple) is still present, however \"Test1\" (Pear) no longer exists.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe have two source trees that we swap the value of depending on which version of an external framework we are building against. As such we have a \"Library_Test\" (testing) and \"Library\" (actual). When swapping to the test branch we rename \"Library_Test\" to \"Library\" and \"Library\" to \"Library_Old\" but this then causes one path to vanish."
