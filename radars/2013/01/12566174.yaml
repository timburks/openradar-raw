    description: "Summary:\r\nOpening a storyboard, even just to look at it, is often enough to mutate its XML, adding or removing outlets seemingly at random.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a storyboard.\r\n2. It's probably dirty; save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStoryboard XML should be stable, changing only if a change is made.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStoryboard XML often is mutated. This would be acceptable if it was only mutated once, but it is mutated back and forth depending on unknown factors (opening and closing source files in the project seems to be one of them). My intentional changes are lost in a sea of churn.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am not complaining about mutation for new versions of Xcode, new versions of OS X, or other changes. I am referring to mutation that often occurs several times per day.\r\n\r\nI am not the only one experiencing this, see: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/170840?tstart=45"
