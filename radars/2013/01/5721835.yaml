    description: "02-Feb-2008 10:48 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nMy MacBook Pro will fail to wake up from sleep if a 2nd monitor is attached and if that monitor was turned off before my computer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAttach a secondary display to a Macbook Pro using the HDMI to VGA adapter. In this case I am using a generic Dell CRT monitor. Turn off the secondary monitor and then close the lid to the Macbook Pro causing it to sleep. Wait until the status light on the hinge release begins pulsating indicating that the macbook pro is in sleep state. Then open the Macbook pro to try and wake it up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\n\r\nI expect the macbook pro to wake up and function normally.\r\n\r\nActual Results\r\n\r\nThe Macbook Pro hard drive can be heard spining up and the screen will appear to activate (the backlight will turn on but the screen will still be black), however, the login prompt will never appear and the laptop must be restarted by holding down the power button for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nRegression\r\n\r\nI am not able to test this on a previous version of OS X at this time.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOrder is important! The 2nd display must be turned off before the laptop is put to sleep to reproduce this issue. If the laptop is put to sleep first and then the secondary display is turned off, the laptop will wake up properly as expected.\r\n\r\nPlease see my attached system profiler data as well as my system.log file for today. The first appearance that I noticed occurred this morning between 12:30 and 1:30pm. I then tested a few more times to confirm that it was a reproducible bug after 11 PM. \r\n\r\nMy secondary display that I'm using to test is a 17\" Dell CRT, model number E773c. I can test with few other displays on request if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'system.log' and 'jonstacey.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n03-Feb-2008 11:56 AM Jon Stacey:\r\nCorrection: Use the DVI to VGA connector\r\n\r\n05-Sep-2011 09:52 AM Jon Stacey:\r\nI do not know if this issue has been resolved. However, I no longer have the second monitor to test with and there have been two major operating system releases since this time. As such, I am closing this issue.\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2012 03:10 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nThis bug is still present 4 years later on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. I hope it is hardware specific, because this is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2012 03:12 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nI tested using a Sharp Vision projector using the RGB adapter with OS X 10.8 Gold Master and it is indeed still a problem. From the sounds, it seems as though the drive spins up as expected, but the screen does not turn on.\r\n\r\n21-Jan-2013 05:31 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nI've changed the title to reflect that this affects multiple OS X versions. This bug was original reported for OS X 10.5.1 and continues to persist in 10.8 Mountain Lion."
