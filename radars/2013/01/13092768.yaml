    description: "Summary: Safari/WebKit has minor display glitches on certain web pages on my 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. These glitches are present both on the Retina Display itself, and on an external, non-Retina display, like the 27\" Cinema Display (even if the Retina display is not on at all). I've checked the current nightly WebKit built (r140906) and the problem is preset there as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get a 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\r\n2. Visit a web page like this one: http://juncld.com/e3AP\r\n3. Examine the rounded corners on the large image\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I would expect a Retina MacBook Pro with an external display to render web pages identically to a non-Retina Mac, without any visual glitches. I would also expect something like a border-radius to render smoothly on the Retina display itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Certain web pages exhibit visual glitches. See the attached screenshots for examples. On the Retina display, you can see the glitches in the rounded corners on the right side. On the non-Retina display you can see some missing pixels on the left side.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown\r\n\r\nNotes: These glitches are not limited to rounded corners. Here's another example: http://mikepiontek.com/files/8760/safari-ign.png The black line should not be there, and isn't present on my non-Retina Macs. Unfortunately I'm having trouble finding a live web page that exhibits that problem that I can easily share."
