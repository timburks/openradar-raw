        Summary:

        If you set the transition to "automatically", you can set a delay of 0.5, 0.4 and 0.3s and it will work. If you set 0.2 or 0.1 the change will be ignored.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Set auto transition delay to 0.1
        2. click onto another object
        3. click back to the object

        Expected Results:

        auto transition delay should be 0.1

        Actual Results:

        auto transition delay is whatever it was before.

        Regression:

        I think this has happened for some time.
