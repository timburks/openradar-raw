    description: "07-Jan-2013 05:18 PM Michael Herring:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe attached NSPersistentDocument-based app will create an entity, and attempt to obtain a permanent ID for it. This fails when the document is newly-created, because an autosave hasn't yet happened (and thus, there are no persistent stores via which a permanent ID can be made).\r\n\r\nUncomment lines 56 and 57 in CDDocument.m and it works. Since there is a persistent store (even an in-memory one), the permanent IDs are generated. The problem seems to be that Core Data will not implicitly create a persistent store when permanent IDs are requested, leading to a failure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n - Build and run the attached app on OS X 10.8.\r\n - Create a new document.\r\n - Click \"do both.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe output should illustrate the creation of a new object, followed by information about its newly-permanent ID.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error message is logged, citing problems with persistent stores.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe test case does not exhibit the issue if an autosave is \"induced\"; that is, click \"Create NSManagedObject,\" then switch to another application, then switch back, and click \"Obtain Permanent ID.\" Be sure you're reproducing with a new document in the test app, without switching apps.\r\n\r\n07-Jan-2013 05:18 PM Michael Herring:\r\n'PermanentOID.zip' was successfully uploaded"
