    description: "09-Dec-2012 03:18 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the last song in an Up Next queue is being played, double clicking on a track or album immediately begins playing the clicked track or album instead of prompting the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Begin playing a track\r\n2. Add another track to the Up Next queue\r\n3. Allow the first song to play or skip to the second track (the track you just added to the queue)\r\n4. Double click any single track or album\r\n5. Note that the double clicked track or album begins to play immediately, clearing the song in the Up Next queue which was playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes prompts the user about the Up Next queue with the \"You are about to start playback...\" dialog box.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes immediately stops playing the current song and begins playing the clicked song or album with no prompt and no way to return to the previously playing track short of finding it again and starting playback (which, ironically, in more than one instance for me did prompt me with the Expected Results).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUp Next behavior not present in previous versions of iTunes.  The exhibited behavior was the behavior for iTunes 10.7 and prior, but the Up Next feature theoretically changes that behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nQuicktime screen capture attached exhibiting the behavior detailed above."
