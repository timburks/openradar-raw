    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen used as subview of a view that has layer-backing turned on then making it wider causes the background color to not fill the entire area of the control.\r\n\r\nI am seeing this bug in a scenario where I have a text field in an inspector panel that I can change in width via an NSSplitView. I attached a screen shot of the bug how it appears on an empty text field without the workaround mentioned below.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- have an NSView that has layer-backing turned on\r\n- add an NSTextField as a subview to that\r\n- have layout constraints that fix the left and right margin between the text field and the superview\r\n- enlarge the NSView\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- the background color of the control should be filled consistently\r\n- the amount of text in the textfield seems to play a role. If it is empty then the unfilled background stays. If not then it might get filled once the user release the mouse button\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- only the part of the control that was visible before stays filled, the new space appearing on the right side does not have background filling\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- only occurs in connection with layers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs workaround I subclassed NSTextField and overwrite drawRect like this:\r\n\r\n- (void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect\r\n{\r\n\t[super drawRect:self.bounds];\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem because the dirtyRect is too small."
