    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen working in Xcode, swiping horizontally with two fingers while the cursor is above the main text-editing area will cause Xcode to switch to the previous file that was loaded into that editor. \r\n\r\nThis sudden file-switching is INFURIATING. \r\n\r\n99% of the time, when I swipe my fingers horizontally, it's because I'm working on a small screen and I need to SCROLL left or right within my file to see the rest of a line of code. Exactly 0% of the time do I want to suddenly flip to another file by swiping. To do that, I can use the breadcrumbs bar above the editor or the outline view to the left. \r\n\r\nXcode is not a consumer app. It needs swipe-gestures about as much as it needs Cover Flow. Delete the swipes or at least provide an option to disable them, please."
