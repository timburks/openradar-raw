        Summary:

        I believe that, in order for a Core Data Mapping Model to work, it needs to be bundled within the ".xcdatamodeld" package.  As near as I can tell, this is not possible with Xcode 4.

        If I create a mapping model with the "New File" workflow, the app asks where I should save the file.  But inside the ".xcdatamodeld" package is not an option.

        If I import an existing ".xcdatamodeld" package into an Xcode project, its ".xcdatamodel" files will be included but its ".xcmappingmodel" files will not.

        I looked through the relevant documentation, but stopped in my tracks when I saw that the screenshots were from Xcode 3.

        I ended up working around this by using Xcode 3 on a Snow Leopard Server VM.

        I honestly don't know whether I am missing something or whether this functionality does not exist in Xcode 4.x.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1.  Try to add a mapping model by selecting "File" -> "New" -> "Fileâ€¦" from the menu bar and indicating that you want to add a mapping model for to a Mac project.
        2.  Try to save that as part of an ".xcdatamodeld" package.

        Expected Results:

        Add the mapping model to the project as part of the ".xcdatamodeld" package.

        Actual Results:

        Unable to select that as a save destination.

        Regression:

        I have this problem on Xcode 4.5.2. I have had the same problem on other Xcode 4.x versions as well; I don't think I have ever successfully added a mapping model in Xcode 4.x.

        Notes:

        This is a Mac (not an iOS) project.

        It seems unlikely that this is as broken as it looks to me, so if I am missing something by all means let me know.  ;-)
