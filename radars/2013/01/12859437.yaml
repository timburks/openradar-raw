    description: "11-Dec-2012 06:33 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen songs in an album are added to the Up Next queue and then edited, the changes are not reflected in the track information/progress pane of the iTunes window or the Up Next queue until iTunes is restarted.  The change is reflected in the Mini Player and other elements of the interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add an album to Up Next\r\n2. When (at least) the first track of the album has begun playing make a change to a track name coming up in the album\r\n3. When the track is played, the updated track information is not shown in the track information/progress pane or the Up Next queue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAny changes to the song's information are reflected immediately\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nChanges do not take effect in the main iTunes window's progress/track information pane or the Up Next queue until iTunes is restarted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nChanges were reflected immediately throughout the application in iTunes 10.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe changes *are* reflected in the Mini Player and searches, but switching back to the main iTunes window shows the title pre-edit.\r\n\r\n11-Dec-2012 06:33 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Edit Inconsistencies.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-Dec-2012 06:43 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-12-11 at 6.16.00 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
