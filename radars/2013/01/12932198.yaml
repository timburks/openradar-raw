    description: "24-Dec-2012 10:36 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen closing a folder in the last row when scrolled to the bottom in the Open from iCloud dialog the animation is not consistent with other folder closing animation in iOS and OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Pages, view the Open from iCloud dialog with several rows of items and with a folder in the bottommost row\r\n2. Scroll to the bottom row of documents/folders\r\n3. Open folder\r\n4. Close folder\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe folder closes with an iOS-like closing animation, with the scroll bar showing the changing state as the view scrolls.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe view is instantly moved to the completed state while the animation completes and the scroll bar updates.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot tested.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording attached."
