    description: "Summary: When connected to an Actice Directory (both Server and Client), profiles for AD-Users don't apply except if enrolment has been made with that user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Setup Profile Manager and bind to AD\r\n- Bind Client to AD\r\n- Make test-Profile with simple on-first-glance payload settings on a user or a group\r\n- Enrol Client in profile-manager with an account that is not in that group or does not contain test-settings\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- test-settings should apply to all accounts they are attached to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- only if the account with the attached test-settings are used to enroll the client in profile-magager the settings are applied. the activity-view shows profiles being pushed\r\n- if another user (that has not been used for enrollment) logs in and has profiles set in profilemanager, they are not applied.\r\n- in profile-manager activity view, no profiles are being pushed (as opposed to when the user used for enrollment has logged in)\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nApparently, the user-setting-feature should work when using OpenDirectory, not ProfileManager. This has not been tested by me."
