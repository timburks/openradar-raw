    description: "14-Jan-2013 02:19 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nAs is common on actual note pads, a different color or weight line separates the top margin (where the title is written/typed) from the rest of the page which contains the note body. This would also indicate that the first line of text controls the note's title.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSome indication that the first line of text on a note determines the note's title (also would serve as a separator between the title and the note contents)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll horizontal lines are the same color\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
