    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a currently open project disappears because I switched branches, and then reappears when I switch back, it does not load in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. cd Desktop\r\n2. mkdir test\r\n3. cd test\r\n4. git init\r\n5. Create a file called readme.txt in the test directory. Type some text into it and save it.\r\n6. Stage and commit readme.txt:\r\n6a. git add readme.txt\r\n6b. git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\r\n7. git branch dev-branch\r\n8. git checkout dev-branch\r\n9. Open Xcode 4.6.\r\n10. Create a new Xcode project. Choose Single View iOS application and click Next.\r\n11. Name the project MyProject and click Next.\r\n12. Do not let Xcode create a local git repository. Save the project in the test folder from step 2.\r\n13. Make sure to leave the project open in Xcode for the next steps.\r\n14. git commit -m \"New iOS app\"\r\n15. git checkout master\r\n16. git checkout dev-branch\r\n\r\nAfter step 15, the Xcode project window goes empty. MyProject still shows up in the left sidebar, but there is nothing under it. A sigle build error appears: \"Workspace Integrity: Couln't load project.\" This is expected, and is how it has always been as far as I know.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter step 16, when the project file reappears in the file system as a result of switching back to dev-branch, Xcode should reload the project, preferably with the same disclosure triangles open in the sidebar as before switching branches.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter switching back to the branch that contains the project, the Xcode window does not change. It stays empty. Clicking the project in the sidebar results in the modal dialog, \"The file couldnâ€™t be opened.\" I have to close the window, find the project, reopen it, and then reopen all the disclosure triangles in the sidebar because none of my interface state is preserved.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis exists in Xcode 4.5 as well. I haven't tested it with earlier versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI often switch to another branch just to look at something or pull a change, then switch back. It would be nice if that didn't interrupt my work."
