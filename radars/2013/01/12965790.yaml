    description: "Summary: When setting up a new 27\" iMac (iMac13,2), Washington, DC was missing from the registration options. DC was also missing from the state list.\r\n\r\nWas unable to reproduce, as the user who was setting it up just skipped registration and continued through setting up their system."
