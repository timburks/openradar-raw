    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the calendar app (or events that use Eventkit) have been open or running in the background for more than one day, the add event dialogue view does not reflect the correct date. Instead, it reflects the date the app was launched.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Calendar.app\r\nWait for the following day, without force quitting the app.\r\nRe-open Calendar.app\r\nTap the \"Add Event\" button\r\nStart/End date will not reflect the current day's date\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStart/End date always shows current date, not date in the past.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStart/End date shows the date the app was originally launched.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnkown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis affects all apps using EventKit and EKEventEditViewController."
