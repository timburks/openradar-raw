    description: "29-Nov-2012 02:33 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWith the \"Use custom colors\" option enabled it can be very challenging to read text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable \"Use custom colors\" option in iTunes 11\r\n2. Browse through various albums and movies.\r\n3. Try and read some of them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA nice pretty color combination with, perhaps, a pastel version of it under the text (or a darker version with white text) so text is legible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nColor combinations often make it hard to read text, both for song titles and movie descriptions.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBack in the good old days of iTunes 10.5 I was able to read the names of my songs and read the description and cast of my movies.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSome example pictures attached.\r\n\r\n29-Nov-2012 02:33 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'itunes artwork.jpg' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:02 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Apollo 13.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:02 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Blood Diamond.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:03 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'For Cheap.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:03 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'I Robot.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:03 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'If I Die Young.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:03 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Recovery.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:04 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'The American.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:04 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Uninvited Guest.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:04 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'We Were Soldiers.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2012 08:04 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'West Wing.png' was successfully uploaded"
