    description: "05-Jan-2013 05:59 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nOn 3 January 2013 I tried to buy an ebook from iBookstore with iBooks 3.0.2 on an iPad (first generation) with iOS 5.1.1 (9B206) using Apple ID “xyxy@ngi.it\" (that's my father's Apple ID). Apple ID “xyxy@ngi.it\" is an Italian Apple ID with Italian set as the preferred contact language. My father had always skipped the dialog box asking to set up the three security questions but this time there was no skip button, so we went ahead and created them, right in the iBooks app. In the same (Italian) dialog box that let us create the security questions we filled in the rescue e-mail address “my_AppleID@mac.com\" but the verification e-mail sent to \"my_AppleID@mac.com\" was in English.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Try to buy an ebook with iBooks 3.0.2 using an Italian Apple ID that still needs to set up the (now mandatory) three security questions and with Italian set as the preferred contact language.\r\n2) Touch Create (or the equivalent \"go ahead\" button) in the dialog box asking to create the security questions.\r\n3) Fill in the security questions and answers, the rescue e-mail address and confirm.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Italian localized version of the verification e-mail is sent to the given rescue e-mail address.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe English version of the verification e-mail is sent to the given rescue e-mail address.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPlease note that if I login to the Apple ID management site [1] with Apple ID “xyxy@ngi.it\" and choose to resend the verification e-mail to \"my_AppleID@mac.com\", the correct Italian localized version of the verification e-mail is sent to the given e-mail address.\r\nI've not been able to try to reproduce the problem with iBooks or the iTunes and App Store iOS apps because to reset the security questions and answers I have to contact iTunes Store support (see [2], \"Additional Information\" paragraph). Tell me if you want me to try to reproduce the issue and if you can reset the security questions and answers for me.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA screenshot of the verification e-mail I'm referring to is part of Apple Support article HT5312 [2].\r\nI'm attaching the original English verification e-mail I received as file \"Verification e-mail.eml\".\r\nI don't know if this issue is applicable also to Apple IDs with addresses registered in other countries and/or with different preferred contact languages than Italian but, as a bottom line, I think that if it is available a localized version of the verification e-mail matching the language set as the preferred contact language for a given Apple ID, the localized version of the e-mail should always be sent, both when the verification e-mail is requested from appleid.apple.com and when it's triggered from an iOS app like iBooks during the security questions creation process.\r\n\r\n[1] https://appleid.apple.com/\r\n[2] http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5312\r\n\r\n05-Jan-2013 05:59 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'Verification e-mail.eml' was successfully uploaded"
