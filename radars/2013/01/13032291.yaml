    description: "We have several projects that share code, e.g. Sparkle, video decoder libraries, and other frameworks on the Mac. Whenever I try to open two of them at the same time, Xcode gets its panties in a knot about workspace integrity or whatever and leaves out most of the sub-projects in the newly-opened project.\r\n\r\nPlease fix Xcode so I can have both open. This used to work before you added all the schemes and workspaces, and it is annoying to have to wait for the lumbering giant Xcode to close one project and open the other just to check whether both projects still build after a change to the shared code, just to then close it again and re-open the other. Surely *someone* at Apple works with more than one project that has shared code ???"
