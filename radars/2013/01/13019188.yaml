    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAdd an method to the iOS SDK to allow the app developer to remove the dictation button if needed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nShow keyboard for editable field on iPad 3 or newer.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nDeveloper has ability to hide the dictation button on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDictation button is always shown, although it may not be appropriate in context of this app.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe dictation button on the keyboard cannot be removed when it is not appropriate in the context of the app.  When using an app with alternative voice recognition capability, this button appears to be redundant, and leads to a confusing user experience."
