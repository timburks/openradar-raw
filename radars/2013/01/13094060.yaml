    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI've been using the 30-pin VGA adapter for the last few years with no problem. I was pleased to see the new VGA adapter for Lightning devices (Apple Part # MD825ZM/A) added a power input port. It has been able to output any resolution we can throw at it on various screens and situations via UIScreen and UIScreenMode.\r\n\r\nBut it seems the new adapter doesn't actually change the output resolution when you tell the app to run the second UIScreen at a certain UIScreenMode. No matter what UIScreenMode I tell it to use, it always sends a pre-determined resolution out. Instead it seems to just scale the UIWindow contents to the output resolution it already decided to use, not the UIScreenMode we told it to. \r\n\r\nThis causes devices that can only run at certain resolutions to have problems or be completely unusable in some situations by the new Lightning devices which refuse to change their output resolution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect iOS device with Lightning Port to VGA display using Apple's \"Lightning VGA Adapter\"\r\n2. Launch app that can set the UIScreenMode of the external UIScreen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpect the device to change the resolution of the VGA display and display it's second screne contents onto the screen.\r\n\r\nThis is the results I get on my 5th Generation iPod Touch and 4th Generation iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe iOS device hooks up the external display and it's contents but doesn't use the resolution we set via UIScreenMode. Monitors that show the info for the incoming signal will show the actual resolution it's receiveing video at.\r\n\r\nSee attached picture: LIGHTNING_VGA_OUTPUT.JPG and note the video resolution on the monitor after my sample code set the new video output resolution.\r\n\r\nAlso see second attached picture: ARCADE_LIGHTNING_VGA_OUTPUT.JPG to see my sample code changing it on my arcade monitor which only handles a maximum of 640x480. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected with iOS 6.0.X and Apple's 30-pin VGA Adapter on older iOS devices. \r\n\r\nIn my testing works as expected on my 3rd Generation iPad and the iPhone 4 & 4S running iOS 6.0.X. Monitors that show the info for the incoming signal will show the actual resolution it's receiveing video at.\r\n\r\nSee attached picture: 30_PIN_VGA_OUTPUT.JPG and note the video resolution on the monitor.\r\n\r\nAlso see second attached picture: ARCADE_30_PIN_VGA_OUTPUT.JPG to see my sample code changing it SUCCESSFULLY on my arcade monitor which only handles a maximum resolution of 640x480 using a 30-pin VGA output cable on a iPad 3rd Generation. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached my sample code that sets the second screen (if present) resolution to 640x480 on startup and shows an image on the screen. \r\n\r\nYou can also use any other app that does external monitor support and you should see the same results.\r\n\r\nOPEN RADAR NOTES:\r\nFile attachments can be found here: http://cl.ly/2N2Z401K1g1N\r\n\r\nSo you don't have to open the zip file attached, here is a link to a side by side photo showing the issue on a VGA monitor with my sample code being told to output 640x480\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1e062M051K11"
