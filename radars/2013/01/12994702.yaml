    description: "10-Jan-2013 10:12 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a note annotation is open in a Preview PDF document when Notification Center is activated by clicking the Notification Center icon or performing the appropriate trackpad gesture, the note does not slide to the left on the screen with the other screen contents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In a PDF document add or open a note annotation\r\n2. Either click on the Notification Center icon in the menu bar or activate Notification Center with a swipe gesture on a trackpad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNote text box slides left on the screen when Notification Center is activated and back to its original position when Notification Center is closed. Alternatively the note box closes (as results with any click off of box).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe note text box stays in its original position on screen despite all over screen contents sliding to the left.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen capture demonstrating behavior attached.\r\n\r\n10-Jan-2013 10:12 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Notification Bad Note.mov' was successfully uploaded"
