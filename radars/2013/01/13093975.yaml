    description: "27-Jan-2013 04:17 PM Nicholas Riley:\r\nSummary: Keyboard vertical scrolling of an entry text in Dictionary is reversed (up arrow/page up scrolls down and down arrow/page up scrolls up); there is no visual indication of what will be scrolled via the keyboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Search for something in Dictionary, such as an article with the Wikipedia source selected.\r\n2. Press Tab twice to focus the article text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. There is some visual indication that the article text is focused (instead, the article list appears focused).\r\n2. It is possible to use page up/down, arrow up/down, home/end, or space/shift-space to scroll up/down in the article in the expected directions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. When tabbing or clicking on the article text to focus it for keyboard scrolling, there is no visual indication of this.\r\n2. Page up/down, home/end and arrow up/down scroll in the opposite directions.  Space/shift-space do nothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDictionary in 10.6 had a very simple, easy to understand keyboard navigation model.  Vertical navigation, either via arrow keys, home/end or page up/down, would scroll the article, even if keyboard focus were in the search field.  If keyboard focus was in the article, space/shift-space would additionally scroll the article.  There was a visual indication of keyboard focus.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
