    description: "When using UICollectionView to display cells with a UITextField, there seems to be a problem with the dequeuing process where it will force the text field to resign and draw the cell multiple times. This only appears to happen when the cell has a subview with a first responder and that cell is scrolled off screen. The dequeue process seems to create a new cell but still adding the old view. You can see this if the cell has a partially transparent background view.\r\n\r\nSample Image:\r\nhttp://f.cl.ly/items/412e233Z1q0O0y3b2821/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-29%20at%2011.54.16%20AM.png\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project with a UICollectionView.\r\n2. Add a cell with a text field\r\n3. Set the cell to have a partially transparent image\r\n4. Scroll the collection view forcing it do dequeue and reuse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCells should be added once and not have mysterious cells in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt appears that multiple cells are stacked behind the current cell.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSample code is available at: https://github.com/jnjosh/RadarSamples/tree/master/CollectionViewError"
