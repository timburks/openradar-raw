    description: "Attached sample project: http://d.pr/f/u5Ha\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUILabel's property preferredMaxLayoutWidth has an important effect for applications using constraint-based layout. But it can't be set in Xcode/Interface Builder (it seems to be, by default, the label's given width in IB). This leads to weird bugs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Download attached sample project.\r\n- Run in the iOS Simulator with hardware \"iPhone\"\r\n- Run in the simulator with hardware \"iPhone (Retina 3.5-inch)\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The same layout is used in both situations. The label should never wrap because there are no constraints that should affect its width.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- On the Retina display the label wraps to two lines. On the non-retina display, it stays on one line."
