    description: "[Note, this has been edited pretty heavily from the actual bug report due to confidentiality issues.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nManaged objects synced via iCloud have the wrong entity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild an app that uses Core Data's built in iCloud syncing. Then create some data on one Mac, and inspect the results received on a different Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nObjects created on one Mac would appear on the other Mac with the same Core Data entity as the one used to create the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFrequently, the following (for my data model, at least):\r\n\r\n1. Create an object on Mac A using entity ItemType1\r\n2. Receive an object on Mac B with the same attributes and relationships, but which is an instance of entity ItemType2.\r\n\r\nIn my case I can verify that it's the same instance because the entity has a field that stores a string representation of a UUID. It also has a \"type\" field that tells me which item type it's supposed to be. By comparing UUIDs and \"type\", I can verify that the received object is the same as the one created and that it should be an instance of ItemType1.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect every instance of ItemType1. I have not been able to detect a pattern that correlates the problem with any attributes of the affected instances.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone, but FWIW both Macs are running 10.8.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPerhaps not coincidentally, both ItemType1 and ItemType2 inherit from the same abstract parent entity (FooItem) which in turn inherits from another abstract parent entity (AbstractItem)."
