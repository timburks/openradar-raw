    description: "15-Jan-2013 11:50 AM Joachim LeBlanc:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen a new window is opened while in Mission Control mode, the new window is created on top of the Mission Control display. Windows, except for the newly created, are still selectable but not visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a new window spawn after entering Mission Control. Such as Messages.app after receiving a message or Launch an application right before entering Mission Control.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA) The new window to be added to the Mission Control view shuffling all the windows around to their new spots,\r\nor\r\nB) Mission Control to cancel and close\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe new window is displayed in normal view over Mission Control but is not selectable or usable. Windows that are unseen but under the newly created window are still selectable.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn the attached screen shot, iTunes was launched before entering Mission Control and the window was spawned after entering Mission Control. The iTunes window is not usable or selectable. Behind the iTunes window you can see the shrunk down windows from other applications and the brushed metal border that surrounds the desktop when in Mission Control.\r\n\r\n15-Jan-2013 11:50 AM Joachim LeBlanc:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-01-15 at 11.40.02 AM.png' was successfully uploaded"
