    description: "18-Dec-2012 10:12 AM Michael Jurewitz:\r\nSummary:\r\nA sandboxed application, when creating a security scoped bookmark from user data, can sometimes be handed back an entirely different path for the file than what exists on disk. Accessing this new path from a sandboxed application causes the app to be quit with a deny-read assertion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a bunch of screenshots by the usual mechanism and make sure they are placed on your Desktop. Since this repro's for only _some_ files, it's helpful to make a good handful of these.\r\n2. Open Keynote.app\r\n3. Drag the previously created screenshots into a new Keynote document.\r\n4. Save this Keynote document to iCloud\r\n5. Build and run the attached project. It will tell you files for which their path on disk is different from what a security scoped bookmark tells the app the path actually is.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe SSB API should always hand back the actual path to an item on disk, or at least one our app is entitled to open.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes a different path other than the actual file is given to the application, which in a production application reads to a deny-read for that different location and our inability to open that file.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSeems to affect 10.7.3 and 10.8.2. We did not test others.\r\n\r\n18-Dec-2012 10:12 AM Michael Jurewitz:\r\n'Bookmark Hardlink Test.zip' and 'MacBook Pro (Retina 10.8.2).spx' were successfully uploaded"
