    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf any application is monitoring the pasteboard, and if the Finder is used to \"Copy\" a large number of items, and if the monitoring of the pasteboard happens while the Finder is populating the pasteboard, files will be missed.  When pasted, some files will be missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInstall any clipboard history application (eg Keyboard Maestro, iClip, PTH Pasteboard, etc).\r\nCreate a directory with a large number of small files in it (1000-100,000).\r\nCreate a new empty directory.\r\nSelect Al files in the first folder.\r\nCommand-C\r\nMove to the second folder\r\nCommand-V\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll files copied.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSome files are missed if the pasteboard is read while the Finder is populating the pasteboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis may be a bug in the Finder, or a bug in the system pasteboard.  There is no apparent way to set the clipboard atomically, nor to tell when a change to the clipboard is \"completed\".\r\n\r\nIf the reading clipboard accesses [[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard] changeCount] and either  [[[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard] pasteboardItems] count] or PasteboardGetItemCount, files will be lost."
