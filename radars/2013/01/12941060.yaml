    description: "31-Dec-2012 09:44 AM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a video is selected in an iPhoto library and the Share menu is selected, either from the menu bar or the toolbar at the bottom right of the window, the Email option is shown as available (it can be clicked). However, clicking Share > Email in either location results in a dialog stating \"You canâ€™t email videos from iPhoto. You can only email photos.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a video in iPhoto\r\n2. In either the menu bar or the bottom toolbar click Share > Email\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto is either able to email a video or, if iPhoto is unable to share a specific location, that location is greyed out and not selectable. The \"Set Desktop\" option in the Share menu in the menu bar is greyed out in this instance.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhoto lists Email as an available method of sharing the selected video.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:"
