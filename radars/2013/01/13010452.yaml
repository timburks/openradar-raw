    description: "14-Jan-2013 05:44 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf \"Start Genius\" is chosen on a track when playing tracks from a Genius playlist playback stops, the status viewer is cleared, and the new Genius playlist silently replaces the previous playlist in the Up Next queue. Playback does not resume.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Begin playback of a song\r\n2. In the status viewer, click the options chevron (or right click the song title), and choose \"Start Genius\"\r\n3. Allow playback to progress to another track (through playback or skipping tracks)\r\n4. When in another track in the Genius playlist, click the options chevron (or right click the song title), and choose \"Start Genius\"\r\n5. Clicking the Up Next queue shows that a new playlist/queue has been generated despite playback stopping\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new Genius playlist begins playing based on the selected (currently playing) song (and the currently playing song continues playback) - the same behavior exhibited when a playing song starts Genius playback.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback of the current song stops and the previously playing Genius playlist is silently replaced in the Up Next queue with a new Genius playlist based on the selected song. However, the selected song immediately stops playback, is not included in the Up Next queue.  Playback of the new queue does not start and the track it is based on does not resume playback.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked in iTunes 10.7, Unknown for iTunes 11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording demonstrating behavior attached\r\n\r\n14-Jan-2013 05:44 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Genius Stops Playback and Fails.mov' was successfully uploaded"
