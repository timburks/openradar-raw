    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be great for Developers to have a 'Developer Mode' toggle to grant full access to the device. By allowing running of unsigned code it would be extremely useful. Group testing applications, or beta testing, for example, would be much easier as currently developers are only allotted 100 devices per account, per year. This would also allow for a more customized workflow, as developers could install custom applications and libraries, SSH could be an example of this. By having this only available to users in the iOS Developer program it would be safe for everyone else who wouldn't otherwise wish to have this. \r\n\r\nThis could also be implemented in the way Gatekeeper is on Mac OS X, by allowing only App Store applications or applications from anywhere."
