    description: "Contrary to documentation, UITableView's -rectForRowAtIndexPath: method will crash by way of throwing an exception if the passed in index path is invalid.\r\n\r\nDocumentation states the following:\r\n\r\nReturn Value\r\nA rectangle defining the area in which the table view draws the row or CGRectZero if indexPath is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis is not what happens. I'm pretty sure that older iOS versions did as the documentation says, so this is probably a regression.\r\n\r\nAttached is a project that will cause the exception to get thrown by sending an invalid index to the method."
