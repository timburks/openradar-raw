    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe /usr/libexec/path_helper program prepends the appropriate directories to $PATH (i.e., the ones given in /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d), even if those directories are already present in $PATH. If those directories are already in $PATH, there really is no need to add them again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a new Terminal window or tab.\r\n2. Prepend a directory to $PATH, so it is different from the default one constructed by path_helper. For example, run \"export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\". If your shell's startup files already add directories to $PATH, this step is unnecessary.\r\n3. Run \"/usr/libexec/path_helper -s\" to display the new $PATH that path_helper constructs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSince $PATH already contains all the entries that /usr/libexec/path_helper wants to add, path_helper should not alter it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n/usr/libexec/path_helper moves all default paths back to the beginning of $PATH. This is unnecessary; path_helper should only append any entries that are missing from the pre-existing $PATH.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI do not have older versions of OS X available to check for regressions."
