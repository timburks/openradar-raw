    description: "When the developer website (such as the bug reporter here), expires my AppleID password, I end up having to re-enter it EVERYWHERE and it's crazy annoying. AppleTV, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Messages, etc.. just an endless sea of prompts for days after my password gets expired.\r\n\r\nI understand the desire to get users to change their passwords and I have no problem with that. What sucks is how the password change invalids every other login I have!\r\n\r\nI think this would be a lot better if when your password changed it didn't revoke access for all the other devices. Separate the action of changing my password from revoking all devices/software that's authenticated using my account. This way, if I'm concerned, I can hit a button to revoke ALL software/devices for my account *optionally*. So this way I can change my password as often as I like without massive disruption on every device I own.\r\n\r\nMotivation: The more devices and software that gets tied to AppleID with this behavior, the bigger the hassle of changing my password becomes. This keeps me from ever voluntarily changing my password. Fix this and you could actually improve overall security by convincing people to change their passwords more often since it doesn't totally disrupt everything for a couple days afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\nApple's response:\r\n\r\n\"This issue is not a software bug that we can address through this channel.\"\r\n\r\nWut?"
