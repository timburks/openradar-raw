    description: |-
        In the docs for - [defersCurrentPageDisplay], the discussion says:

        Set the value of this property to YES so that, when the user clicks the control to go to a new page, the class defers updating the page indicator until it calls updatePageIndicator. Set the value to NO (the default) to have the page indicator updated immediately.

        Where it is not possible to "click" on an iOS device.
