    description: "31-Dec-2012 09:49 AM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen a video is selected in an iPhoto library and the Share menu is selected, either from the menu bar or the toolbar at the bottom right of the window, the Twitter option is shown as available (it can be clicked). However, clicking Share > Twitter in either location results in a dialog stating \"iPhoto does not support sharing video to Twitter.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a video in iPhoto\r\n2. In either the menu bar or the bottom toolbar click Share > Twitter\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto is either able to post a video to Twitter or, if iPhoto is unable to share a specific location, that location is greyed out and not selectable. The \"Set Desktop\" option in the Share menu in the menu bar is greyed out in this instance. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhoto lists Twitter as an available method of sharing the selected video despite not being able to share videos to Twitter.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe dialog notifying the user that iPhoto cannot share videos to Twitter is a different type than the dialog notifying the user that iPhoto cannot share videos via Email."
