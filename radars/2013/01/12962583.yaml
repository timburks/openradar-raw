    description: "When sending a new message from Messages, adding a contact with a linked Facebook card changes the message type to MMS with little warning. This could result in significant charges for users whose phone plans do not include MMS messages, and messages being sent to unexpected email addresses. \r\n\r\n\r\n— Steps to Reproduce —\r\n\r\n1. In the conversation list in Messages, tap the 'compose' button.\r\n2. Press the blue '+' button in the 'To' field.\r\n3. Select a contact that has a linked Facebook contact card, or that consists only of a Facebook card.\r\n\r\n\r\n— Expected Results —\r\n\r\nThe contacts details should be shown, allowing the choice of telephone numbers and email addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n— Actual Results —\r\n\r\nNo details are shown, and a bubble is added directly to the list of recipients. The message type, as shown in the title bar, changes to 'New MMS'. While I cannot reproduce this for all Facebook-linked contacts, it happens consistently for the same ones each time."
