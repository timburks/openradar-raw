    description: "Summary:\r\nWhenever I create a new document in Pages, the save dialog defaults to iCloud. I don't use iCloud for documents; it's very annoying to have to select my hard disk every time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn Pages, select \"File > New…\" from the menu\r\nSelect \"All > Blank\" from the Template Chooser\r\nClick \"Choose\" to open the new blank document\r\nSelect \"File > Save…\" to save the document\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe save dialog will show me the same location that I previously saved a new document on my local hard drive, and would honor the expanded state of this local file view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe save dialog briefly shows the expanded local save location from the last time I saved a document, but before I can interact with it, it then minimises the save dialog to just say \"Where: iCloud\". I then have to change \"iCloud\" back to a local file location, and then click the downwards-pointing triangle button (next to the filename field) to see the detailed view of my local drive. This is despite the fact that I saved my previous new document to the local drive, and previously had the local drive view expanded."
