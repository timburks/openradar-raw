    description: "22-Jan-2013 10:24 AM Chris Adamson:\r\nSummary:\r\nTurning on Accessibility:Speak Selection from the General settings destroys custom UIMenuItems that have been added to the UIMenuController\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun the attached SpeakVersusMenuItems project on an actual iPad device (not the Simulator). This app has a text view with some initial text. In viewDidLoad, it adds three menu items (Item A, Item B, and Item C) which can be accessed by selecting text or long pressing in the text view. When tapped, these items just append a timestamp to the text view. There is also a table at the bottom of the main view that shows the current menu items, as returned from [UIMenuController sharedMenuController].menuItems. There's a reload button next to this table that reloads the local array that serves as the table model.\r\n\r\n1. Select some text, press the custom menu items. The text view updates with a timestamp.\r\n2. Long press, press custom menu items. The text view updates with a timestamp.\r\n3. Dismiss the keyboard and tap the reload button. The table continues to show the three menu items (by title and selector string)\r\n4. Leave the app, come back in, do more selecting and menus. Still works as before.\r\n5. Switch to the Settings app and choose General: Accesibility : Speak Selection. Use the switch to turn Speak Selection \"ON\"\r\n6. Return to SpeakVersusMenuItems.\r\n7. Select a single word. Menus behave as before\r\n8. Use the selection pins to expand the selection, or do a \"Select all\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should continue to behave as before\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe custom menu items (Item A, Item B, and Item C) are no longer in the menu once you select more than one word. Tap the reload button and the table will show 0 items. They have literally been deleted from the UIMenuController as a side-effect of turning on Speak Selection.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe suspect this is a bug, but if this is intended behavior, the app should at least be notified of the loss of the menu items it created, but none of the notifications provided by UIMenuController indicates a change to the menuItems property. We're preparing to set up a background task to poll the number of mediaItems and repopulate if necessary.\r\n\r\n22-Jan-2013 10:24 AM Chris Adamson:\r\n'SpeakVersusMenuItems.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n22-Jan-2013 10:26 AM Chris Adamson:\r\nAttaching an AirPlay recording (SpeakVersusMenuItems-ReflectorRecording-2.mov) that shows the bug in action.\r\n\r\n22-Jan-2013 10:26 AM Chris Adamson:\r\n'SpeakVersusMenuItems-ReflectorRecording-2.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n[OpenRadar: copy of the demo movie at https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12216224/xanedu/SpeakVersusMenuItems-ReflectorRecording-2.mov , at least for the time being]"
