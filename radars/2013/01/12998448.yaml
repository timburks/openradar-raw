    description: "11-Jan-2013 02:33 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nTwo finger swipes switch between pages when the system is set to use two fingers to swipe between pages, but when the system is set to use three finger swipes to change pages Reminders does not allow pages to be switched with three finger left/right swipes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures set \"Swipe between pages\" to \"Swipe with three fingers\" or \"Swipe with two or three fingers\"\r\n2. Open Reminders with more than one list of reminders (and/or reminders that have been completed)\r\n3. Attempt to swipe between pages using a three finger left/right swipe\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen trackpad is set to three fingered left/right swiping to switch between pages Reminders should allow a three fingered swipe to switch between pages as it behaves with two fingered swipes with two finger swipes enabled. Reminders should behave like Safari, Messages, Finder, etc. and respect the change from two- to three fingered swipe gestures and continue allowing left/right swiping.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLeft/right swiping with either two or three fingers has no effect when \"Switch between pages\" is set to \"Swipe with three fingers\" and left/right swiping with three fingers has no effect with \"Switch between pages\" is set to \"Swipe with two or three fingers\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
