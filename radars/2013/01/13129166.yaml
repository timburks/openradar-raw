    description: "31-Jan-2013 04:54 PM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to file a radar and have it visible to all the members of a team, e.g. all the developers at a company.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. File a bug for an issue related to an app being developed at a company.\r\n2. Quit the company and get a new job elsewhere.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOthers at the original company should be able to track the bug so that they can follow its progress and be aware of any changes that affect their apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nStaff at the original company cannot check up on the bug except by asking the original filer to look it up for them. Since that developer no longer works for the company, this may not be a high priority for them.\r\n\r\nWHAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL:\r\n\r\nIf the web interface to Radar followed the same approach as the iOS developer portal. When accessing the developer portal I'm asked which team I want to use, of the several I belong to. Team selection determines what content is available in the portal.\r\n\r\nFollowing this approach, it would be possible to file a Radar in a team account. If someone filed an issue as part of a team, it would be visible to everyone on the team. Updates could be posted by team members, and if the issue were resolved, a team member could mark it as such.\r\n\r\nUnder this approach, access to previously filed Radars would be maintained, even as individuals came and went from the company.\r\n\r\nIt might even make sense to have a new tab in the provisioning portal labeled \"Issues\" or \"Radars\" or something along those lines, for all team-specific issues.\r\n\r\nOther approaches would no doubt also work. If allowing team access to Radars was not possible, a minimal substitute would be the ability to assign an existing Radar to someone else for continued tracking. That way when a person left a company, they could at least assign company-specific Radars to others before leaving. However the team concept would be vastly superior, and would align with current implementations of both iOS and Mac OS X developer portals."
