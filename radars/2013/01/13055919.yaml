    description: "Summary:\r\nUINavigationBar throws an exception on setDelegate: when it is managed by a UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nThis is reasonable because of the implementation details needed by UINavigationController. However, developers need a way to hook into this as well.\r\n\r\nUINavigationBar should be switched from using delegates to notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up an app with navigation controller and try to change the navigation bar's delegate.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt works... or there are associated notifications so that other objects may respond to the delegate methods.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Cannot manually set the delegate on a UINavigationBar managed by a controller.'"
