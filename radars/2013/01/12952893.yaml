    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nInitial gss_init_sec_context() call succeeds even when there are no credentials when using Heimdal GSSAPI with NTLM mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis has the side-effect of causing the SPNEGO mechanism to use NTLM as the preferred mechanism when no credentials are present. However, a context cannot be established successfully since the second gss_init_sec_context() call fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Verify no credentials are present that can be used by any GSSAPI mechanism.\r\n   E.g.: Running '/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Heimdal.framework/Helpers/gsstool list' yields no credentials.\r\n\r\n2. Call gss_init_sec_context() with initiator credential set to GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL and using either GSS_SPNEGO_MECHANISM or GSS_NTLM_MECHANISM as the mechanism.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nReturns GSS_S_NO_CRED.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nReturns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nClients that use GSSAPI on Mac OS X may falsely start initiating an authentication context with a server when no credentials are present."
