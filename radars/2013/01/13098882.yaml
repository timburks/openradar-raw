    description: "Went to download the new Xcode release today and the store forced me to close Xcode (which was running) before it would begin downloading the update. This is comical because Xcode is over 1.6GB and not exactly a quick download. After I closed Xcode and it started downloading, I simply relaunched Xcode with no warning or errors whatsoever and got back to work.\r\n\r\nExpected result: To not have to close Xcode while I download a new version of Xcode which could easily take all afternoon. Closing it when it's ready to install is understandable, but closing before it's even downloaded is pointless."
