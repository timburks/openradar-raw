    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an MPMoviePlayerController is embedded on a detail view of the UISplitViewController, if the device orientation changed while the video was playing full screen, the UISplitViewControllerDelegate methods for hiding/showing the master view controller are not reliably invoked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStarting from a  new project using the master detail project template, embed a movie player controller in the detail view (sample project attached).\r\n1. Start the app in landscape.\r\n2. Launch full screen mode on the video.\r\n3. Rotate the device to portrait.\r\n4. Exit full screen mode.\r\n5. Observe if the \"Master\" bar button item is visible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"Master\" bar button item should always be visible because the -splitViewController:willHideViewController:withBarButtonItem:forPopoverController: should be called when exiting full screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt seems to sometimes work the first time, but if you run through the steps a second time, the delegate method is not invoked. You can also do the reverse, starting in portrait and moving to landscape. The companion delegate method (willShowViewController...) is not reliably triggered either.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSeems to only occur on iOS 6. Able to reproduce in simulator and on device.\r\nXcode 4.5.2\r\n\r\n03-Jan-2013 11:15 AM Daniel Pfeiffer:\r\n'SplitViewVideo.zip' was successfully uploaded"
