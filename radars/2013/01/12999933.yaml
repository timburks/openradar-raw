    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen joining computers to Active Directory using Directory Utility, we uncheck the box \"Require confirmation before creating a mobile account.\" However, after the bind operation is complete, that box rechecks itself automatically. If we don't uncheck it again before delivering the system to an end user, they are prompted to create a mobile account at login.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Login to a Mac with a user with administrative rights\r\n2. Launch Directory Utility from System Preferences, Users & Groups, Login Options, \"Join\" Network Account Server\"\r\n3. Unlock the app\r\n4. Open Active Directory by clicking the pencil\r\n5. Expand Advanced Options\r\n6. Check \"Create mobile account at login\"\r\n7. Uncheck \"Require confirmation before creating mobile account\"\r\n8. Bind system to Active Directory\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect that if I uncheck the box it would remain unchecked and our users would not receive a prompt.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe option is rechecked and users are prompted at first login."
