    description: "18-Dec-2012 06:01 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\niTunes shows some songs with similar titles by the same artist as being duplicates despite not having any true duplicate in the library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Have 3 songs with similar names by the same artist, on the same album, in the library with no duplicates of said songs\r\n2. Use Show Duplicate Items command\r\n3. The songs with similar names are listed as duplicates despite not truly being or having duplicates\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly items which have a duplicate are displayed when Show Duplicate Items is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome results listed as duplicates are not actually duplicates.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDisplay duplicates worked fine in 10.x and was not present in 11.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI discovered the bug after using the Show Duplicate Items command and finding that the songs \"$\", \"$$\", and \"$$$\" by George Watsky were listed as duplicates despite there not being any duplicate items of the same track name, even by a different artist.  The three tracks mentioned are different durations (1:38, 2:32, and 3:56, respectively) and should not have been classified as duplicates in this instance.\r\n\r\n18-Dec-2012 06:01 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-12-14 at 2.25.09 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
