    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nScene Kit seems like an amazing framework both for apps and for games, and it would be really useful to have it on iOS. Here are a few reasons why this would be a good thing for us and Apple:\r\n\r\n• It would give more developers access to and awareness of Scene Kit\r\n• It would give developers a larger target audience\r\n• It would allow more shared code between desktop and iOS projects\r\n• It would be a significant competitive advantage over other mobile platforms\r\n• Profit?\r\n\r\nIn the year since the introduction of Scene Kit to developers, I haven't seen many utilize it; many I've talked to weren't even aware it exists, and those I've shown it to have been excitedly prototyping cool things. So much of the developer focus has been on iOS lately that Mac-only technologies often get passed over.\r\n\r\nBringing it to iOS would be a big step forward, and Scene Kit will only get better with more people using it, testing it, writing tutorials and sample code and hopefully amazing apps with it.\r\n\r\nI understand that there are many things involved in getting this working well, including optimization, drivers and sufficient hardware specs too, so just consider this my +1 at bringing SceneKit to iOS."
