    description: "Summary: If iTunes Match is on, but cellular data is off, and you ask Siri to play a song that's not on your device, it will act like it's playing it, but you won't get any audio.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Turn on iTunes Match (in Settings > iTunes & App Stores)\r\n2. On the same screen, make sure Use Cellular Data is off\r\n3. Turn off Wi-Fi or make sure you're not connected to Wi-Fi\r\n4. Ask Siri to play something that's in iTunes Match, but hasn't been downloaded to that device (I tried \"Play VHS or Beta\")\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I would expect a clear error. At worst, something like \"I can't find VHS or Beta\", or at best, something very clear: \"You must connect to Wi-Fi to download this song\". Even better if it would ask if I want to download it over cellular anyway.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Siri tells me \"Here's VHS or Beta\", and then that's it. There's no other audio. I thought my volume must be down or my Bluetooth connection wasn't working right or something. Crazy confusing.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown\r\n\r\nNotes: On a closely related note, I find it pretty frustrating that there's one big \"Use Cellular Data\" switch for both automatic downloads and iTunes Match. There are plenty of things I don't want to happen on cellular data: I don't want it to automatically download apps I may not even need right now. I don't want it to automatically download hundreds of songs if I press \"shuffle\" in the music app. But If I ask to play something specific, of course I want it to download that!"
