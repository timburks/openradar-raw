    description: "27-Jan-2013 08:32 AM Andrew Lee:\r\nSummary:\r\nUnder Xcode's \"Font & Colors\"  preferences, add an option to set the highlight color for type-over completions, and possibly all auto-completions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWhen you type an opening punctuation mark (like a left bracket or a quotation mark), Xcode displays the closing punctuation mark as an auto-completion, which like any auto-completion you can either type over, tab over, or ignore and type something else altogether. It calls this a \"type-over completion\".\r\n\r\nThe problem for me is that the color of the offered punctuation is close to the color for regular text. So if I'm editing a nested message-send and I see a right bracket, it's hard to tell if Xcode put it there or if it was already there. If it was already there and I type a right bracket, Xcode will add a matching left bracket somewhere upstream, which makes my code not only wrong but instantly ugly, and I'll have to hit Undo; hitting Delete won't fix it.\r\n\r\nIt would help if I could set the highlight color for type-over completions so it's visibly obvious when I did *not* type the closing punctuation. It might also be useful to set the highlight color for auto-completions in general, but that's less important since it's almost always more obvious when it's a method name, function name, etc., that's being auto-completed.\r\n\r\nXcode does have the option to turn off type-over completion, but I do want to use the feature, because it tells me that I need to close some punctuation that I opened, and also *what* the closing punctuation should be, which is useful when I have mixed nesting of parens and brackets."
