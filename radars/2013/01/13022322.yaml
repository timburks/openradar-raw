    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using Xcode's awesome quick open feature, one is unable to use keys that are mapped in the systemwide keymap to navigate the file list. Specifically one is force to use arrow keys (which let's not forget didn't exist on the original Mac keyboard*) instead of some other key combo mapped to up/down such as control-p and control-n which are mapped to up/down by default in all standard MacOS X installs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Cmd-Shift-O to open the quick open dialog\r\n2. Type something to obtain a filtered list\r\n3. Press Control-n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n4. Selection moves down a line.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n4. Press Control-n again\r\n5. Realise what's happening\r\n6. Move fingers from home key position to the arrow keys\r\n7. Press down key\r\n8. Move fingers back to home key position\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAll versions of Xcode I have show this behaviour. The main regression is in one's productivity.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* conveniently ignoring the fact that the control key appeared far later on the Mac keyboard than arrow keys."
