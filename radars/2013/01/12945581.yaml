        Summary:

        The "Manage Your Apps" page contains application icons that are retrieved via HTTP, instead of HTTPS.  This introduces two problems:

        1.  The browser URL bar does not show that the page is being served securely.
        2.  A man-in-the-middle attacker could substitute those image files with other files.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1.  Log into an iTunes Connect account with at least one app.
        2.  After logging in, note click on the "Manage Your Applications" link.

        Expected Results:

        I would expect the URL bar to indicate that the page is being served securely.

        Actual Results:

        The URL bar indicates that the page is not served securely.

        Regression:

        N/A
