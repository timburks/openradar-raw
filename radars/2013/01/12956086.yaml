    description: "04-Jan-2013 Joris Kluivers:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen streaming music from iTunes on Mac OS X to the Apple TV music sometimes stops playing when one song ends and another should start playing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Start playing a playlist or start playing music and have at least multiple other songs in the Up Next list.\r\n- At some point music on the Apple TV stops playing in between songs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe next song in the Up Next list should have started.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn case iTunes is just streaming to the Apple TV music stops playing, with 2 seconds left in the song indicated by -0:02 in iTunes.\r\n\r\nIn case iTunes is streaming to multiple speakers music keeps on playing on all speakers, except the Apple TV which stops.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I own a second generation AppleTV\r\n- I'm not using song cross fading.\r\n- This only happens when streaming from iTunes on the Mac. Streaming from an iOS device doesn't show these stalls.\r\n- Seems easier to reproduce shortly after waking the Apple TV from sleep\r\n- Multiple speakers in my case happen to be iTunes on a MacBook Pro, AirPort Express first generation and AppleTV. Only the AppleTV stops playing, iTunes and AirPort Express continue playing.\r\n- More people experiencing the same problem: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2697498"
