    description: "Summary:\r\nTime Machine is now the supported way to archive an Open Directory Master. There seems to be no purging mechanism for the sparseimages created by the process, and the perl script has a comment saying it will not create a new sparseimage while the current one exists. This leaves servers without any backup for new modifications.   \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup 10.8.2 with Server.app 2.2 and Open Directory\r\n2. run Time Machine with no exceptions (besides entire non-boot volumes), sparseimage is created in /var/backups\r\n3. add user to Open Directory, and/or wait 24 hours(since at least one of the postgresql scripts waits 24 hours to reattempt)\r\n4. run Time Machine again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLog file is updated to indicate backup, modification date of sparseimage becomes current\r\nOld sparseimage is purged, new one is created and copied by Time Machine\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNone of the above, the contents of the existing sparseimage are not updated\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nServer.app 2.1 had the same symptoms, and possibly all previous\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I could put the perl scripts into debug mode I would be willing to assist engineering with getting this addressed ASAP"
