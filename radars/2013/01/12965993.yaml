    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAccessing some UITableViews with VoiceOver evinces crashes. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Run the attached sample project with VoiceOver disabled.\r\n2. Tap on any of the listed plays to see that it works with VoiceOver disabled.\r\n3. Re-run the sample project with VoiceOver enabled.\r\n4. Tap on any of the listed plays to observe the crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe VoiceOver transition between view controllers should be as seamless as the non-VoiceOver one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app crashes when tapping a play, with the following stack trace:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'unable to dequeue a cell with identifier <~> - must register a nib or a class for the identifier or connect a prototype cell in a storyboard'\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n*** First throw call stack:\r\n(0x3a3123e7 0x38a1d963 0x3a31229d 0x395467b3 0x3420d9ab 0xa84c1 0x3405d541 0x34042361 0x340597ff 0x34015897 0x3938c4eb 0x3938c08d 0x3938cfb1 0x3938c99b 0x3938c7ad 0x3938c611 0x3a2e7941 0x3a2e5c39 0x3a2e5f93 0x3a25923d 0x3a2590c9 0x3655f33b 0x34066291 0xa6655 0x387edb20)\r\nlibc++abi.dylib: terminate called throwing an exception\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n(None)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe DataController & Play classes were borrowed from the Apple Sample project named SimpleDrillDown."
