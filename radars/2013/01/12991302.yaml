    description: "Summary:\r\nI found out that there is a limit of 5 concurrent NSURLConnection network connections per app. I thought it was a bug, but you guys replied that it worked as expected ( http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=2542401 ). This limit is not documented anywhere that I can find. Can you please elaborate on what the limits are? And maybe add some documentation to NSURLConnection's documentation. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Is it always 5 connections?\r\n- Does it vary depending on if you're using wifi, edge, 3g, or LTE?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect this was documented in NSURLConnection's documentation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo documentation"
