    description: "Summary: the Back button in Xcode's documentation browser jumps to the top of the previous page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. View some documentation in the Xcode documentation browser. For this example, we will use UIView from the iOS 6 documentation.\r\n2. Scroll down until you see a link that you know goes to a different page. For example, \"OpenGL ES Programming Guide for iOS,\" which is in a box two paragraphs after the heading, \"The View Drawing Cycle.\"\r\n3. Click the link.\r\n4. Click the Back button, or, depending on how you have your trackpad set up, swipe with two fingers to the right or three to the left.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation browser will go back a page, and show the point where you left off, scrolled to the same place you were when you left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe documentation browser jumps back a page, but is always scrolled to the top, no matter where you were scrolled to when you clicked the link.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt was definitely like this in Xcode 4.5, possibly in 4.4. I don't remember how it worked in previous versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSafari also has this problem when viewing iOS documentation pages, but not when viewing most normal Web pages."
