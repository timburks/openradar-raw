    description: "Summary: Installing an update on an iOS device wipes all mobile data connection settings (APN settings) when using an unofficial carrier (which is common in many countries). All novice users will require support to resolve the loss of their data connection and might avoid installing updates in the future.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Setup an iPhone with custom APN settings\r\n• Install update through iTunes or over-the-air\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCustom APN settings remain and mobile data works like before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMobile data is disabled because APN settings are wiped."
