    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFor full details, see this blog post:\r\nhttp://www.bornsleepy.com/bornsleepy/mysterious-case-unit-tests-ran-speed-light\r\n\r\nEssentially, when a unit test bundle fails to load because of a missing shared library, otest crashes and displays some spurious advice about garbage collection.\r\n\r\nXCode then compounds this problem by presenting the user with a UI which suggests that all tests have run successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nMake a unit test that relies on a custom shared library which isn't present when the test runs.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode should report that your tests failed to run. If possible it should indicate that the unit test bundle failed to load because of a missing library. In an ideal world it should tell you which library, and which library was trying to load it (ie it may be a dependency of a dependency).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode reports that otest crashed, but only in the console. In the Log Navigator Xcode shows a successful (green) banner, even though no tests actually ran.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
