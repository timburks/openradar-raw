    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI'm starting to get kinda frustrated about placing calls with when using a headset. The reason is that I'll place a call with the phone in my pocket (using Siri) and while walking the screen does not turn off and I start pressing buttons with my leg.\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking, first world problem. But really, this seems like an iOS 6 issue, because I never recall having this issue with all previous versions of iOS and iPhone OS. I have noticed that when I am using a headset to place a call, place a hand on top of the proximity sensor will not cause the screen to turn off, it'll stay on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAsk Siri to call someone using the headset. Wait for the call to initiate and place a hand over the proximity sensor. The screen remains in the on state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen placing a call using a headset the screen should turn off when the phone it in one's pocket using the proximity sensor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe proximity sensor does not seem to work when placing a call using the headset.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI am using an iPhone 5, so I am also wondering whether it's an iPhone 5-only issue. Unfortunately I don't have sim cards for my other, older iPhones so I cannot test on those.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
