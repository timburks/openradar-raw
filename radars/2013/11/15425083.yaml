    description: /usr/local/bin appears only at the end of /etc/paths, making it the last location searched for binaries on a clean OS X install. Since /usr/local/bin is conventionally where users install software that _should override_ the system-provided defaults, this is hugely inconvenient for anyone that uses the command line.
