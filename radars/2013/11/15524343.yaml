    description: "My bots were all working as expected until someone on our team committed a change on the CoreData model, and as expected, all bots began to fail with the message: \"Test target XYZ did not finish.\"\r\nOn the devices we use to integrate, we manually deleted the application and Xcode server reinstalled them. But how to clean-up the old app from the simulators used by Xcode? Taking a close look into the logs, I has able to locate these directories in which has the same structure of a local workstation simulator directory.\r\n \r\n/var/_xcstest/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.0.4/Applications\r\n \r\nSimulator clean-up shouldn't be automatically on the server? Every time someone needs to change a CoreData model someone has to manually intervene on the server and mess up with non documented directories? Doesn't seem the right thing to do IMO.\r\n\r\nPlease, add this feature on the Xcode server so running bots can be more smoothly and automatic.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a new bot.\r\n2. Let him do a successful integration\r\n3. Do a project change that forces a simulation clean-up (i.e. a CoreData model change without migration)\r\n4. Try to integrate again. It will always fail with the message: \"Test target XYZ did not finish.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe bot should detect the need to reset automatically the simulator or let de server admin decide if it should cleanup the simulator/device after each integration like ir already does with build cleans.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe error message: \"Test target XYZ did not finish.\" I need to delete all my bots and recreate them again.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOSX 10.9 with OSX Server 3.0.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
