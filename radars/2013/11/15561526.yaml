    description: "Summary:\r\nIn general, developer tools work well in non-administrator accounts. However, one small exception is the DTSendSignalFlag() macro in DTPerformanceSession.framework, which has no effect for non-administrators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. As a non-administrator user, run a the attached program “flagtest” under Instruments. (See attached flagtest.zip)\r\n2. In Instruments, select “Manage Flags…” from the “Window” menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe flag posted by the test program (“From: se.ayton.jens.test [point]”) should show up in the window\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe window is empty.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\nMac OS X 10.9/13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA simple fix for this is to insert asl_set(tracermsg,ASL_KEY_READ_UID,\"-1\"); at an appropriate point in the macro. Presumably calling getuid() and stringifying it would also work.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:"
