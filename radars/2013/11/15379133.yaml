    description: "I am trying to do an archive build of my app, with an Ad-Hoc provisioning profile which contains three devices, none of which are connected to my Mac at the moment. Another iPad is connected to my Mac (I'm using USB internet tethering). \n\nWhen I try to build, I get this message: \"None of the valid provisioning profiles include the device Petulia (identifier: eb6410dc5d9488f45088c0a21b4ddff75626b4a5).  Xcode can resolve this issue by downloading a new provisioning profile from the Member Center.\"\n\nThe only choices are \"Cancel\" or \"Fix Issue\".\n\nThing is, I don't want a profile that contains that iPad. The iPad is irrelevant to the build I'm doing. Thus, I think there should be an \"Ignore\" button on that dialog, which will do the build anyway."
