        Summary:
        When updating from the MAS-version of Xcode from 5.0.1 to 5.0.2 we experienced on 3 machines that over 2 GB needed to be downloaded as opposed to getting only a small incremental update.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        We are including the App Store and Install log files for all 3 machines.

        Expected Results:
        Point releases of Xcode should always be incremental updates.

        Actual Results:
        The full 2 GB download occurred.
