        The UIAutomation framework is incredibly powerful, and opens up really
        exciting possibilities for real UI level acceptance testing on iOS.
        However, the current implementation is crippled by the fact that the
        framework is hidden away behind a layer of Javascript, and interacting
        with the framework requires you to jump to Instruments, forcing the
        developer to switch mental contexts. Some great people have tried to
        rectify this by creating frameworks that wrap UIAutomation, such as
        Bwoken[1].  And there have been some proof-of-concept attempts to open
        the framework to developers, such as PublicAutomation[2], which is
        currently being used by Frank[3] to bring the acceptance testing
        techniques used by the Ruby community to iOS.

        These frameworks are a step in the right direction, but if
        UIAutomation.framework were to be made public, the possibilities would
        be endless. Creating acceptance tests that run from inside an XCTest
        suite would be trivial to write, and we would have a much more
        comprehensive test suite to work with, leading to fewer bugs and
        better apps.

        Given the recent improvements made to unit testing in Xcode 5, and the
        introduction of XCTest, I would love to see this framework made public
        for developers to take advantage of so that we can test our
        applications more thoroughly.
