    description: "Summary:\r\nAn NSView brought to fullscreen with..\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/applicationkit/classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/enterFullScreenMode:withOptions:\r\n\r\nand options @{NSFullScreenModeApplicationPresentationOptions : @(NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar + NSApplicationPresentationHideDock + NSApplicationPresentationDisableProcessSwitching + NSApplicationPresentationDisableForceQuit  SApplicationPresentationDisableSessionTermination  SApplicationPresentationDisableHideApplication + NSApplicationPresentationDisableAppleMenu)}\r\n\r\nforgets some of the set options when an external monitor is attached to the Mac (no matter if HDMI or Lightning/Display-Port connection). At least, NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar and NSApplicationPresentationDisableProcessSwitching is gone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave XCode 5.0.2 installed.\r\nHave a NSWindow containing an NSView\r\nSend the following method to the specific NSView\r\n\r\n[view enterFullScreenMode:[NSScreen mainScreen] withOptions:@{NSFullScreenModeApplicationPresentationOptions : @(NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar + NSApplicationPresentationHideDock + NSApplicationPresentationDisableProcessSwitching + NSApplicationPresentationDisableForceQuit  SApplicationPresentationDisableSessionTermination  SApplicationPresentationDisableHideApplication + NSApplicationPresentationDisableAppleMenu)}];\r\n\r\nThe view will be on fullscreen on your main screen, all other connected screens will be black. You are not able to quit the application, switch processes, etc.\r\n\r\nConnect an external screen to your Mac or, if already connected, remove it and reconnect it.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the connected screen is not or no longer black, and you can actually escape the fullscreen mode of the NSView by moving the cursor to the second screen and click on its desktop. The NSView has obviously forgotten its presentation options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe NSView should behave exactly like it did before the second screen was connected or reconnected to the Mac.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSView forgets some of its previously set presentation options for the fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9, 10.8, might also affect 10.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested on several MacBooks (Air, Pro, recent models) with different external screens and connections (HDMI, DP, Lightning)"
