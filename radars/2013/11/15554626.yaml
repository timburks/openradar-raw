    description: "Summary:\r\nSince the introduction of the SKSPVC it's been possible only to specify the productID  as a parameter for loading the right page in the store.\r\nAn addition that would be very useful is to add the the affiliate parameters.\r\nBut then there will be another problem, the affiliate programs are different based on the state of the store, so in addition to the possibility to ad the affiliate parameters there must be chance to specify multiple affiliate and the framework has to sort out what is the one to use based on the nation of the store set by the user; likely the GeoRiot service is handling the problem right now.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen we create an SKSPVC we can specify, in addition to the product ID, one or more affiliate parameter leaving the framework to sort out which one to use.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe SKSPVC can accept only the product ID forcing the developers who wants to use the affiliate links to rely on the openURL: method of UIApplication."
