    description: "Summary:\r\nAny subclass of a UIPanGestureRecognizer that calls -[UIPanGestureRecognizer ignoreTouch:forEvent:] makes the recognizer be stuck in an inconsistent state\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a custom UIPanGestureRecognizer subclass.\r\n* Override only [UIGestureRecognizer touchesMoved:withEvent:]. After calling the method on super, ignore any touch.\r\n* Create an instance of the gesture recognizer with minimumNumberOfTouches set to 2.\r\n* Observe the state changes in the action method.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project. Un/comment out line 24 in ViewController.m and observe logs while performing a pan with 2 touches.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Since a touch is being ignored, the recognizer should move to the UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed and subsequently be reset. This is because the recognizer is no longer getting the minimum number of touches.\r\n* The recognizer should not react to tap or pinch gestures\r\n* The numberOfTouches should not keep increasing\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* The recognizer is stuck in UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged\r\n* The recognizer calls the action method for tap and pinch gestures as well\r\n* Calling numberOfTouches when the incorrect action method is called results in the a large number of touches returned (all of them not part of recognition)"
