    description: "Summary:\r\nAt the moment, iOS 7.0.3, it is not possible to navigate from a mail message in my inbox directly to a reply which I have sent. This is handled well on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nI would like to have the same options that I have on Mac OS X, that is, to be able to click a button in the message list and be shown the reply, and/or have the option to show replies inline with the received messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Launch the Mail app on your iPhone. \r\n2. Select a message in your inbox. \r\n3. Reply to that message. \r\n4. Note that there is no way to see your reply, without navigating out of the context your are in, back to the top level of folders/accounts, select the correct account, navigate to the Sent folder.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected to be able to tap on the Reply icon which is shown in the message list for messages that I have replied to. \r\n\r\nI expected there to be an option in Mail Settings to show replies inline with threaded messages.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is much more difficult to find a reply on iOS than it is on Mac OS.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone 5s iOS 7.0.3"
