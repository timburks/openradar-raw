    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a number of utterances are in an AVSpeechSynthesizer instance’s queue, the stopSpeakingAtBoundary: method is unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround, but it shouldn’t be necessary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Xcode project.\r\n2. Give the ViewController class an AVSpeechSynthesizer property.\r\n3. Feed the synthesizer a series of AVSpeechUtterance instances.\r\n4. Attempt to stop the queue ***after the first two utterances have been spoken but before the second to last utterance have been spoken*** using -stopSpeakingAtBoundary:.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND:\r\nJust before the -stopSpeakingAtBoundary: call, call -speakUtterance:. This utterance can be as simple as [AVSpeechUtterance speechUtteranceWithString:@\"\"].\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe synthesizer should stop speaking the utterances in its queue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe synthesize continues and -stopSpeakingAtBoundary: returns NO.\r\n\r\nWith the workaround, it works as expected. The workaround should not be necessary.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2, 7.0.3, 7.0.4, 7.1b"
