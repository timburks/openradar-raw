        Summary:
        When using Image IO API to write PNG files with custom embedded XMP data, written PNG files don't contain the XMP data.
        This works as expected for TIFF and JPEG files. As the XMP norm is compatible with PNG files, it is expected that the Image IO API be able to write such XMP data into PNG files.

        APIs used:
        CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL
        CGImageMetadataCreateMutable
        CGImageMetadataRegisterNamespaceForPrefix
        CGImageMetadataSetValueWithPath
        CGImageDestinationAddImageAndMetadata
        CGImageDestinationFinalize
