    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm localizing my app to run in other languages.\r\nMy app is all storyboard based and using base localization.\r\nAll the UI gets localized correctly on real time, with the exception of the static (non editable) UITextViews that never gets localized. Attached code gives context to the problem and reproduces the problem.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild a storyboard with UITextViews, localize it using base localization, and get angry, because your UITextViews never get localized. You have to do it in code manually.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe static UITextViews should be localized.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll the UI gets localized, with the exception of the UITextViews\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways. Simulator, devices (tested on iPad 2/3), iPhone 4 and 5. All using iOS 7.0.4 and 7.1 beta 1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe reproducible issue code is attached."
