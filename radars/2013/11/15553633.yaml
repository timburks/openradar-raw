    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a '%' character is included in a string that is set on the alertBody property of UILocalNotification, the character is squashed in the alert output as if the string was a format string. It can be worked around by doubling '%' characters. To display a '%' in the output, you then have to set a string with '%%'\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate and schedule a UILocalNotification with the alert body:\r\n@\"10% of battery remaining\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen displayed, the local notification should look like this:\r\n[App name]\r\n10% of battery remaining\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen displayed, the local notification instead looks like this:\r\n[App name]\r\n10of battery remaining\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf I create and schedule a UILocalNotification with THIS alert body:\r\n@\"10%% of battery remaining\"\r\n\r\nThe local notification is displayed as expected.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
