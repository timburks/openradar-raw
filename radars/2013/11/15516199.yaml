        Summary:
        I am updating a set of objects using a background NSManagedObjectContext, which I then import into a primary MOC.
        when updating a int32_t (or 16-bit) field using setPrimitiveValue forKey where I pass in an NSNumber @(11), the ManagedObject returns the new value properly, but a call to hasChanges returns NO.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1) create a bunch of ManagedObjects in a MOC.
        2) in a separate thread create a new MOC with the same persistentStoreCoordinator.
        3) update an int32_t property in the objects using the new MOC and check the results of the hasChanges method.
        4) using NSNotificationCenter import merge the changes in the background MOC into the primary MOC and check the value of the int32_t field you updated.

        Expected Results:
        i would expect the hasChanges in the managed object to return YES.

        Actual Results:
        the hasChanges method returns NO.

        Regression:
        Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

        Notes:
        Provide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.
