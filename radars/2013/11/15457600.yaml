    description: "Summary:\r\nConsider an app that was published in App Store without push notifications. The next update adds push notifications support and a typical scenario looks as follows: edit app to enable push notifications, generate APNS server certificates and there is no step 3. But this change breaks provisioning profile of this app. Upon uploading app built with this profile you receive a warning \"Your app appears to include API used to register with the Apple Push Notification service, but the app signature's entitlements do not include the 'aps-environment' entitlement\". That's frustrating. It would save a lot of time if developer portal offered to update provisioning profile immediately after enabling push notification service.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Release an app to App Store without push notifications enabled\r\n2. Enable push notifications for this app\r\n3. Generate APNS server certificates\r\n4. Attempt to upload an app built with outdated provisioning profile\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niOS Developer Portal should offer provisioning profile update immediately after enabling push notifications service.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niOS Developer Portal doesn't offer provisioning profile update\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nCurrent iOS Developer Portal version\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
