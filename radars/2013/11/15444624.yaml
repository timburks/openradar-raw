    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's pretty clear that the Security folks want all code that runs in the system to be signed.\r\n\r\n<http://furbo.org/2013/10/17/code-signing-and-mavericks/>\r\n\r\nQuick Look plug-ins can run as either signed or unsigned code. But when they run as signed code, the sandbox restrictions severely limit the functionality of the plug-in.\r\n\r\nFor example, a plug-in that wants to extract data from an archive has nowhere to write temporary data (there is no sandbox container for it to write in, nor can it access the filesystem outside of the sandbox provided by the Quick Look daemon.)\r\n\r\nThe result is that all Quick Look plug-ins that are code signed can only read data. It is impossible to write a plug-in that unpacks a ZIP file, examines the file contents, and displays formatted results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download this project: https://github.com/chockenberry/Provisioning\r\n2. Update the Project Build Settings so that \"Code Signing Identity\" is \"Developer ID: *\"\r\n3. Build and install the Provisioning.qlgenerator\r\n4. Use the plug-in to examine an iOS app archive that is attached (Twitterrific-Beta.ipa). Note that an .ipa file is just a renamed ZIP archive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe provisioning information contained in the .ipa file should be displayed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe console log shows:\r\n\r\nNov 11 19:03:57 Myrtle kernel[0]: Sandbox: unzip(56818) deny file-write-create /private/tmp/com.iconfactory.Provisioning\r\nNov 11 19:03:57 Myrtle.local com.apple.quicklook.satellite[56817]: No file data for file:///Users/craig/Desktop/Provision%20Testing/Twitterrific-Beta.ipa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 / \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nNote that moving the unzip folder to NSCachesDirectory doesn't help either. Since the plug-in doesn't have a sandbox, it tries to write into ~/Library/Caches and fails just as badly as when /tmp is used.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Twitterrific-Beta.ipa' was successfully uploaded."
