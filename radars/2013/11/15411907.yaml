        Description:
        Launchpad keyboard search sometimes does not respond to typing.

        There's no step to reproduce. Sometimes it works (typed text appears in the field, and icons are filtered), sometimes it does not (no text, no filtering).

        This bug is really annoying as it renders Launchpad ineffective if users are required to manually identify an app icon out of 10s or 100s of them. This bug is there since Mountain Lion, including latest releases of Mavericks.

        The only known workaround is to logout or restart.
