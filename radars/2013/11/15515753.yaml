    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n\r\nI get a crash in the _isEquivalentTo method of UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes when transitioning from one layout to another. The crash occurs after prepareLayout gets called. The layout attributes are all instances of the base class, and NOT subclasses. In this case the transition is from a second layout back to the original layout using the UICollectionViewController's layoutToLayout transition in iOS 7. This works without issue in all previous versions of iOS 7, but now the crash above occurs as a EXC_BAD_ACCESS pointing to that method in the beta of iOS 7.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIn numbered format, detail the exact steps taken to produce the bug.\r\n\r\nTap the back button to transition back to the original layout. Crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.\r\n\r\nExperience a smooth transition back to the original layout without a crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExplain what actually occurred when steps above were executed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't yet tried subclassing layout attributes to implement isEqual and hash methods. I am not sure if that would solve the problem or not."
