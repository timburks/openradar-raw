    description: "Summary:\r\nThe new MacPro website performance page says \"Up to 12 Gb\" which, if true, is pretty lame.\r\n\r\nFortunately every other page indicates up to 64 Gb which is more reasonable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Spend hours oggling the new MacPro website\r\n2. Scour the performance page looking for imaginary ways to justify buying one based on increased productivity\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFind a chart showing how much time I'll save code-signing app bundles to convince myself that I would be stupid not to order a maxed out model the day it's available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotice a callout box with an incorrect maximum memory spec."
