    description: "Sample code also at https://github.com/stuffmc/rdar-workspace-asset\r\n\r\n1. The `media.xcassets` only needs to be added to the `.xcworkspace` for it to be *seen* already by the `.storyboard`. Is this normal?\r\n\r\n2. You might start by removing that reference to `media.xcassets` from the `.xcodeproj` (or remove it from the target). It will compile, but you'll see this at runtime\r\n\r\n>Could not load the \"image\" image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier \"biz.pomcast.rdar-workspace-asset\"\r\n\t\r\n3. You would think having that `media.xcassets` in the target (thus also in `Copy Bundle Resources) solves the problem. So did I think."
