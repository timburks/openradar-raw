    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe selectedImage of a UITabBarItem is not honored on iOS 7.1 (11D5099e). The standard tab bar item image is applied instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new storyboard\r\n2. In the Storyboard, create a Tab Bar Controller with two child view controllers\r\n3. In the Storyboard, set an image on the TabBar Item of the first child view controller\r\n4. In the first child view controller viewDidLoad method, set the tab bar item selectedImage to another image\r\n5. Launch the app in the Simulator or on the Device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen switching the selected tab, the selectedImage should be used as the tab bar icon when the tab is selected, and the standard image when the tab is not selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe standard image is used as the tab icon regardless of the tab selection state.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from iOS 7.0.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe root issue of all this is that the selected tab bar icon can’t be set from Interface Builder — which force developers to write this in code instead.\r\n\r\nA sample project demonstrating the issue can be found here: http://cl.ly/1B0S1b3u1X00 (or in the attached file)."
