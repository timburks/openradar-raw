    description: "Summary:\r\nCertain PDFs (in this case, produced from OCR scans) containing compressed object streams do not display or print correctly through native PDF rendering (e.g. Preview).  See the attached reference PDF and compare how it renders in Preview and Adobe Acrobat Reader.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download the attached PDF\r\n1a. Open the attached PDF in Preview\r\n1b. Open the attached PDF in Acrobat Reader\r\n2. (optional)\r\n2a. Print the PDF from Preview\r\n2b. Print the PDF from Acrobat Reader\r\n3. Compare results\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIdentical or acceptably accurate renderings\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlank or garbled text in the Preview rendering\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.8.5\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRe-optimizing the PDF without compression from within Adobe Acrobat Pro creates a Preview-compatible PDF, but is only a workaround to this shortcoming in the implementation of the PDF standard.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThe specific hardware and software configuration used to generate the PDF is currently unknown.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Moore,Heidi.pdf' was successfully uploaded."
