    description: "Pierluigi Cifani\r\n29-Nov-2013 01:11 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNOTE: possible duplicate of rdar://15369540\r\n\r\nA fixed set tests against a fixed set of code, sometimes passes, but other times fails with some unknown error like \"Unexpected TestCaseDidFinish\" or \"Unexpected TestSuiteWillFinish\". This is reproducible with Xcode 5.0.2 and with Xcode Bots\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.- Write tests\r\n2.- Write some code that passes the test\r\n3.- Build & Test multiple times on your local machine\r\n4.- Build & Test multiple times on a remote Xcode bot\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test suite behaviour should be consistent\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe test suite behaviour is random, sometimes not executing some tests and giving cryptic error messages such as \"testFeature encountered an error (Unexpected TestSuiteWillFinish)\" or \"testFeature encountered an error (Unexpected TestCaseDidFinish)\"\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMac OS X 10.9 (13A603)\r\nXcode 5.0.2 (5A3005)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIncluded screenshots of the Xcode and Xcode-Bot output\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nI haven't found a consistent way to reproduce, but it's definitely more likely to happen in slower Macs\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Local Xcode.png', 'Local Xcode Passes.png', 'Remote Xcode.png' and 'Remote Xcode Passes.png' were successfully uploaded."
