    description: "Summary:\r\nUsing the Xcode \"Analyze\" menu option, we should be able to see APIs called from our code that aren't somehow protected against being called on older OSes, e.g. calling a handler that was introduced in a newer API where we aren't checking for the existence of that handler in an older OS.\r\n\r\nFor example, calling -[MPVolumeView setRouteButtonImage:forState:] on iOS 5.1 without first checking whether the MPVolumeView responds to the selector.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAnalyzer warning something like, \"Calling new API 'setRouteButtonImage:forState:' without first checking for support on pre-iOS 6 devices\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nProductName:\tMac OS X\r\nProductVersion:\t10.9\r\nBuildVersion:\t13A603\r\nXcode 5.0.1\r\nBuild version 5A2053"
