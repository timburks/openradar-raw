    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen developing iOS apps, especially real-time multiplayer games where users use more then one device next to each other, it would be very helpful to be able to have multiple instances of the iOS simulator running instances of an app. Currently the Simulator is limited to run one single instances of an app a time.\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n* Developing a multiuser app needing 2 or more instances at a time. Currently for this one has to have multiple devices connected to the development machine all the time.\r\n* Testing interoperability of multiuser apps between app versions\r\n* Testing interoperability of multiuser apps between iOS SDK versions\r\n* Testing interoperability of multiuser apps between iPhone and iPad app versions\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Launch an app in the iPad iOS Simulator\r\n* Launch the same app in the iPhone iOS Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* 2 simulators open with 2 debug sessions attached in Xcode\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* Error Message: Simulator in use - \"The Simulator can't be launched because it is already in use\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
