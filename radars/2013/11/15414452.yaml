    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen we add new images to an icon assets and multiple icons share the same dimension Xcode seems to not recognize this and put the image only for the selected icon.\r\nA better approach is to add to all the images with the same dimension and scale factor the same image if they haven't one already.\r\nA simple case is with the iPhone and iPad spotlight icon for iOS 7. Both this icons share the same dimension in retina screens but if I add an image to the iPhone one, the iPad icon remain empty and if I re add the same image to the iPad icon in the assets catalog the file appear two times with the -1 appended to the file name.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1 - Create a new project with asset catalog in it for the icons\r\n2 - Add an image that can be in multiple place because has the same dimension.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the empty place where the image can be begin to point to that image, I can later change or delete the image for a single place and the change don't apply to the other slots.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI have to add the image multiple time and create duplicate images inside the assets catalog folder."
