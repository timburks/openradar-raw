    description: "Summary:\r\nCapturing a full screen screenshot using drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates: does not accurately capture the background of the keyboard on iOS 7.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard background when captured by the user (by holding power and the home button) captures the blurred effect of the keyboard. When snapshotted with drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates: the keyboard background is transparent but not blurred.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open attached project.\r\n2. Tap any cell to bring up a keyboard.\r\n3. Take a screenshot with the home button/power button combo (standard iOS way).\r\n4. Take a screenshot by tapping the \"Screenshot\" button on the navigation bar.\r\n5. View both screenshots in the photos app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth keyboards should be captured with a blurred background.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe screenshot taken programatically does not have a blurred background on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.3 (11B511)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'TransparentKeyboardBug.zip' was successfully uploaded.\r\nhttps://github.com/daveverwer/TransparentKeyboardBug"
