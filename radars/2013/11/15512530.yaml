        Summary:
        My app relies on Game Center for turn-based games, however sometimes my device doesn't get a push notification that it is my turn. Sometimes the application badge is updated correctly however this is not always the case. My notification center settings for Game Center are correct: displaying banners, show on lock screen and in notification centre is on.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Make a move in a turn-based game. You could use my app to test: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/en-passant-chess-against-friends/id641111989?ls=1&mt=8 wait for the other device to get a notification. Sometimes it doesn't.

        Expected Results:
        A notification to be sent to remind you it is your turn.

        Actual Results:
        No notification.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        I'm often in a spotty network location and also on wifi networks without internet. This could be the reason why I do not receive notifications. However all the other push notification work reliably and my friends have the same problems and they are always using a reliable wifi network.
