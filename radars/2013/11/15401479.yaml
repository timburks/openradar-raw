    description: Apple Configurator downloads and stores IPSW iOS Firmware files in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.configurator/Data/Library/Caches/com.apple.configurator/Firmware/. This is a different location than iTunes stores downloaded IPSW files, which causes both applications to redundantly download large restore files and negatively impacts user experience. It also buries files that should be user-accessible in a non-obvious location, making preload to prevent unnecessary download time difficult.
