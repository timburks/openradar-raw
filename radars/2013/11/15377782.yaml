    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a fully customized MPVolumeView, the minimum track image is not resized correctly if the volume view is initially shown in landscape, and then a rotation to portrait occurs. The autoresizing masks are set correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create an instance of MPVolumeView.\r\n- Set a custom minimum track image for the volume view, using the setMinimumVolumeSliderImage:forState: method.\r\n- Set a custom maximum track image for the volume view, using the setMaximumVolumeSliderImage:forState: method.\r\n- Set a custom thumb image for the volume view, using the setVolumeThumbImage:forState:.\r\n- Show the containing view in landscape mode (with the attached sample project: start the application in landscape mode)\r\n- After viewing the volume view correctly in landscape, rotate to portrait.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA perfectly fine slide animation of the thumb image, with the normal behaviour for all the slider image view components.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen rotating to portrait, the minimumVolumeSliderImage is shown beyond the borders of the volume view, which seems to be resized correctly but does not clip the minimumVolumeSliderImage."
