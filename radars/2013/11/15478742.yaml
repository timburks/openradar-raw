    description: "Summary:\r\nIt's quite straightforward: adding a second Run Script action deletes the contents, but not the overall entry, of the first.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Edit Schemes... in Xcode for an active project\r\n2. Click on a Scheme (e.g. Test) and then Post-actions\r\n3. Click on the + and add a Run Script action\r\n4. Add any text to the body of the script\r\n5. Click on the + and add another Run Script action\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new Run Script action is created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA new Run Script action is created, and the box containing the first action's script is replaced by a single line. Clicking to another section (e.g. Pre-actions) and then backs causes the text box to return, but it only contains placeholder text."
