    description: "Summary:\r\nOn the iPhone the Apple Contacts App has private API for Phone Number Formatting that is not public.  This is evident when inserting an AddressBook Phone Number Record with a leading one or without having the format correctly handled as 1 (###) ###-#### or (###) ###-####. This is also evident in International phone number strings such as 011-(Country Code)-...  \r\n\r\nMaking the API public would enable developers to consistently display phone numbers on the iPhone to match the Apple phone number formatting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an App with the ABAddressBook Framework.\r\n2. Insert a contact with a phone number record 4089961010 into the Address Book.\r\n3. Look at it in the Contacts App. Number is formatted as (408) 996-1010\r\n4. There is no way to format this number in Xcode without writing an NSFormatter and some regular expression to parse the pattern in order to apply the proper format.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect an API to format phone numbers on the iPhone based on the locale.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.4\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
