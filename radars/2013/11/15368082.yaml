    description: "Summary:\r\nChanging the alternateImage on an NSButton does not cause the button to redraw properly if one of its superviews is layer-backed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add a button to a layer-backed view hierarchy.\r\n2. Ensure it is displaying its alternate image (i.e. is in NSOnState).\r\n3. Call -setAlternateImage: on the button with a different image.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe button should change its alternate image and redraw.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe button does not change appearance.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nXcode 5.0.1 (5A2034a) / OS X 10.9 (13A603)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project attached. To demonstrate the issue, run, then press the second button (labeled \"Change That Button's Alternate Image!\").\r\n\r\nCalling -setNeedsDisplay: on the button with a YES argument does not fix this problem.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'ButtonStateRedraw.zip' was successfully uploaded."
