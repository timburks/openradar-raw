    description: "Summary:\r\nHit testing for icon controls created with CreateIconControl() is broken in Mavericks. It appears that Mavericks is doing hit testing with a vertically flipped (upside down) copy of the icon mask.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download Fetch 5.7.3 from http://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/download/Fetch_5.7.3.dmg\r\n2. Open Fetch, click the Enter Serial Number button, and enter:\r\n\r\nSerial Number Name: Bug Reporter\r\nSerial Number: FETCH55001-VVXJ-2JHL-LBP7-K9CZ-9A52\r\n\r\n3. Make a connection, e.g. to:\r\n\r\nHostname: ftp.fetchsoftworks.com\r\nConnect using: FTP\r\nUsername: (leave blank)\r\nPassword: (leave blank)\r\n\r\n4. Click on the little black triangle in the lower-right corner of the Path icon in the toolbar\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA pop-up menu with the current path appears\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. If, on the other hand, you click outside the icon image in the upper right corner of the 32x32 pixel icon area, the menu does appear. Similarly, clicking in the upper left (where there are icon pixels) doesn't work, while clicking in the lower left (where there aren't) does.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9/13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a regression from OS X 10.8.x.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nA first-generation Retina MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9 13A603"
