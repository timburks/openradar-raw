        Summary:
        Accessing methods within a file with keyboard in the method popup menu is a great feature. Xcode 5.0.2 has a bug that prevents this from working the first time it is invoked.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        - Launch Xcode (fresh start needed)
        - Open a project, and a file
        - Do CTRL-6 to show the method list in that file
        - Start typing

        Nothing happens (expected to filter method list)

        - Close the popup
        - Do CTRL-6 again
        - Start typing

        You now see that what is typed filters the popup contents, as expected.

        This only occurs with on the first try. This was working correctly previously, the bug has been introduced with a recent version of Xcode (probably 5.0.1)
