        Summary:
        Support for Activate custom Behaviours when the default behaviour is activated to Xcode.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create the custom behaviours in Xcode preferences.

        Expected Results:
        Can set to activate the custom behaviour when default behaviour is activated eg. Create the custom behaviour named 'Debug' and when the 'Runnings->Pause' is activated, Xcode activate the 'Debug' behaviour.

        Actual Results:
        We can't

        Regression:
        I think Xcode 4 can do it.
