    description: "Summary:\r\nIt is not possible to create localized asset catalogs using Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS or OSX project.\r\n2. Create a new localization of the app. The language of the new localization does not matter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dialog with all resources to be localized. \r\nAfter adding a localization, a button to localize a non localized Asset Catalog in the File Inspector when the asset catalog is selected.\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, once you have more than one localization, it is not possible to localize an asset catalog from the UI:  . This works for other non localized resources (e.g. images:)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dialog does not show any asset catalogs to be localized when adding a localization: http://cl.ly/image/1p3C3O161V06\r\nAfter adding the localization, there is no button to localize the asset catalog: http://cl.ly/image/0D103D1n1U2D. This button is present on non localized images: http://cl.ly/image/373S2y3C2v1T)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWith some tricks, it is possible to create a localized asset catalog.
