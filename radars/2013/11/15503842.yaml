    description: "Note: Apple marked this as a duplicate of rdar://13433596.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen updating projects, Xcode suggests changes to the project, but it ignores settings that are already set in xcconfig files.\r\n\r\nSee the example project:  https://github.com/samdeane/XcodeValidateWarningBugExample.git\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nClone https://github.com/samdeane/XcodeValidateWarningBugExample.git\r\n\r\nOpen it with XC5.1\r\n\r\nObserve that the project is set to use Test.xcconfig, which defines:\r\n\r\nONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH = YES\r\n\r\nObserve that Xcode is offering to update the project because it believes that Build Active Architecture is not set.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect Xcode to notice that it doesn’t need to add a setting for ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH as it is already enabled via the xcconfig file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode offers to set the option. Clicking “Perform Changes” adds a superfluous setting to the target, which masks the setting inherited \r\nfrom the xcconfig file. If the xcconfig is changed later, the change will not be inherited.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been happening for many Xcode versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
