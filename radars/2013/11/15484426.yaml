    description: "Tom Harrington 15-Nov-2013 03:39 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nExperienced developers know the value of well-commented code. It can make all the difference when reviewing someone else's code, or even when reviewing your own code six months later.\r\n\r\nIn any non-trivial Core Data model, a similar level of built-in documentation would be extremely useful. However the Core Data editor does not support this, so model files must be accompanied by external documentation.\r\n\r\nIdeally:\r\n\r\n- The data model inspector pane in Xcode would include a field labeled \"comments\", which could hold arbitrary text.\r\n- This field would be available for every selectable item in the Core Data model editor, including entities, attributes, relationships, fetch requests, configurations, and any other selectable item I forgot to list here.\r\n\r\nTom Harrington 19-Nov-2013 10:12 AM\r\n\r\nThe comments above apply equally to xib files. When editing a xib, I should be able to add comments linked to specific UI elements, or to the document as a whole."
