        CIImage sampling mode cannot be chosen on iOS. This means that, as an example, when drawing to an OpenGL context, displaying a pixellated image using CIPixellate filter (4x4 pixels) at a zoom level above 1.0 will always result in blurry (linearly interpolated) pixel edges.

        On OS X, this can be done by using a pass through filter with specific sampling:
        CISampler *sampler = [CISampler samplerWithImage:self keysAndValues:kCISamplerFilterMode, kCISamplerFilterNearest, nil];

        Could you please consider adding an API to expose sampling on iOS? Thank you.
