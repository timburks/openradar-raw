        Summary:
        The iOS simulator could previously be used with the host Mac's Dvorak keyboard layout. This is no longer the case.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        0) Change OS X input method to US/Dvorak in System Preferences
        1) In the iOS Simulator, enable "iOS Uses Same Keyboard Layout as OS X"
        2) Run an iOS app that requires text input
        3) Enter text into a text field or text view

        Expected Results:
        The entered text should be based on the US/Dvorak layout.

        Actual Results:
        The text entered is based on the US/English layout, in contrast to the system setting. The same result is gained if step (1) above is skipped and the setting is left off.

        Regression:
        The Dvorak layout worked fine in the simulator (despite the aforementioned setting being absent) for all 4.x.x builds.
