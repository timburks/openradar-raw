    description: "It is seemingly impossible for apps to launch in fullscreen. \r\n\r\nSome of the system apps don't even attempt to do this, it seems. Notes and App Store, for instance, just launch into a window even if they were quit while in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\niPhoto and iTunes remember that they were in fullscreen mode, but they launch to a window which then clumsily resizes itself to fullscreen.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the App Store app.\r\n2. Put the app in fullscreen mode.\r\n3. Quit the app\r\n4. Launch the App Store app again.\r\n5. Note that the app is back to windowed mode.\r\n\r\nApps that are set to fullscreen mode should relaunch to fullscreen mode, and without going through an awkward window-resizing animation first."
