        Summary:
        In the context of per-frame, time-accurate video processing application (think of stabilization processing which computes per-frame motion), custom video compositor don't currently allow accessing input frame timing information.

        In-depth description:
        When using the following method, - (void)startVideoCompositionRequest:(AVAsynchronousVideoCompositionRequest *)request, and retrieving the input frame with [request sourceFrameByTrackID:inputTrackID], there is currently no way of knowing the frame timing information in its original track. We can only estimate it from the composition time (request.compositionTime) using some heuristics that we try to guess. And if we guess wrong, or if Apple later changes the rounding methods, we're screwed.

        Could you please consider exposing the input frame timing information? Thank you.
