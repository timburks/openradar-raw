    description: "Summary:\r\nSLComposeViewController has no error structure for reporting bad twitter credentials (HTTP 401 from Twitter), and does not provide useful information to the user when it fails.\r\n\r\nI have multiple accounts in Settings > Twitter: one authenticated, the other not. Presumably because I have one account logged in, [SLComposeViewController isAvailableForServiceType: SLServiceTypeTwitter] returns YES.\r\n\r\nIf I then select the unauthorized account and try to tweet, I get a vague \"connection to Twitter failed\" message. The console, however, reports that a 401 auth error came back from Twitter.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems here:\r\n\r\n1) The user isn't told how to fix the problem (Go to Settings > Twitter and re-enter user/pass)\r\n2) The API does report or return errors\r\n\r\nSo neither the developer nor the user are receiving the information they need to improve the situation.\r\n\r\nIt's also unclear how this happens in the first place. Settings does not let you save a Twitter account without successfully authenticating, so it sounds like someone is resetting auth tokens after the fact. Whether this is iOS (device-side) or Twitter (server-side) is unclear, but it spans versions and devices. I have other devices that are working just fine with all accounts.\r\n\r\nVerified on:\r\n\r\niPhone 5, iOS 6.1.4\r\niPhons 5s, iOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Add multiple accounts to Settings > Twitter\r\n2. Break or expire credentials for one of the accounts (unclear how or why this can happen)\r\n3. Try tweeting a photo from Photos / Camera with the broken account\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the tweet to work, or to see actionable information on how to fix the auth problem.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"The tweet cannot be sent because the connection to Twitter failed.\" (see attached pic)\r\n\r\nAlso attached device log output reporting the 401 auth failure from Twitter.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niPhone 5, iOS 6.1.4\r\niPhons 5s, iOS 7.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSavvy users will be able to experiment and figure out what's wrong, but this could be a lot better on both user and API fronts."
