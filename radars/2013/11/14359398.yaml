    description: "In windows created from a XIB in the new Xcode 5 format all views have the \"S\" marker set in _subtreeDescription.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild and run the attached project. _subtreeDescription of the main window is logged to the console and shows the \"S\" marker (S=scaled/rotated) for all views.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNone of the views is actually scaled or rotated, the internal state of the views should reflect this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn our application we see serious (at least 2x) performance degradation when moving splitter positions after conversion to the Xcode 5 XIB format."
