    description: "Summary:\r\nIn pre-Mavericks versions of Mail, using Mailbox > Rebuild would re-download all messages in that mailbox. In Mavericks, it appears to rebuild the mailbox from disk. \r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because Mavericks Mail also has problems synchronizing with the server. Without this feature, there is no way to fix a broken mailbox short of deleting the whole account."
