    description: "It is very difficult to determine what components (hardware or software) are the cause of poor battery life on an iOS device.\r\n\r\nThere are no metrics available to a user on energy impact by application or by system component (screen, radio, CPU, GPU, etc).\r\n\r\nRight now, one of the few ways to discover what is using the excess energy is a process of trial and error involving:\r\n\r\n* Disabling/enabling WiFi\r\n* Disabling/enabling cellular \r\n* Disabling/enabling location and/or system services\r\n* Disabling background app refresh\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nAdding such metrics would be extremely useful information, even if only available to developers.\r\n\r\nHowever, more Apple-like would be the ability for users to select between energy usage profiles, e.g. profiles like Low Energy Usage, Balanced (Default), High Performance, or, to automatically switch between such profiles based on information like usage patterns, current battery levels, etc."
