        Summary:

        For now only the tab bar item "image" can be set from Interface Builder. However we must rely on code to set the selectedImage, as Interface Builder doesn't expose some UI for this.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        1. Open a Storyboard in Xcode
        2. Add a Tab Bar Item to a View Controller
        3. Select the Tab Bar Item

        Expected Results:

        In the sidebar, there is a field to set the tab bar item image and selectedImage.

        Actual Results:

        In the sidebar, there is a field to set the tab bar item image, but not the selectedImage.
