    description: "Summary:\r\nAsset catalogs cannot be localized. First of all, there's no UI (see #15543744), but doing it manually by juggling some files (see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19452251) does not yield the expected results when building the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new iOS xcode project. The same probably applies to OSX projects but I haven't tested that.\r\n2. Add a launch image to the Images.xcasset catalog already present in the project.\r\n3. Create a new localization (does not matter which one it is)\r\n4. Go to the location of the Images.xcasset catalog in the Finder.\r\n5. Move this folder to the en.proj folder of the project.\r\n6. Go back to Xcode, and update the location of the Images.xcasset catalog using the File Inspector.\r\n7. You can now update the localization of the catalog using the checkboxes present in the file inspector.\r\n8. Build the project.\r\n \r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo build errors.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build fails with the error message: \"There are multiple launch image set instances named \"LaunchImage\"\".\r\nMoreover, there are warnings for all images or resources present in the asset catalog telling me that they're present more than one time.\r\n\r\n./en.lproj/Images.xcassets:./AppIcon.appiconset: warning: The app icon set name \"AppIcon\" is used by multiple app icon sets.\r\n./nl.lproj/Images.xcassets:./AppIcon.appiconset: warning: The app icon set name \"AppIcon\" is used by multiple app icon sets.\r\n./nl.lproj/Images.xcassets:./Kevin/login_button.imageset: warning: The image set name \"login_button\" is used by multiple image sets.\r\n./en.lproj/Images.xcassets:./Kevin/login_button.imageset: warning: The image set name \"login_button\" is used by multiple image sets."
