        Summary:
        vCards generated with ABPersonCreateVCardRepresentationWithPeople use UTF-8 as string encoding but does not specify it in their various fields, as expressed by the vCard file format. The resulting vCard in turn is incorrectly parsed or imported in software that make other encoding assumptions.

        As an example:
        	N:Gérard;Depardieu;;;

        should actually be expressed as
        	N;CHARSET=utf-8:Gérard;Depardieu;;;

        to ensure compatibility with software using the resulting vCard.
