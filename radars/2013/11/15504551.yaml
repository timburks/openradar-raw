    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to modify attendees of EKEvent objects using Event Kit. EKCalendarItem's attendees property is readonly. The documentation reads \"This property is read-only; it is not possible to add attendees with Event Kit.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes it challenging to create a custom UI for creating/editing events when some functionality is only available using EKEventEditViewController, without also having to write code to talk to a remote calendar directly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Retrieve an EKEvent item from the user's calendar database.\r\n2. Retrieve the event's attendees array.\r\n3. Add or remove an EKParticipant to the array.\r\n4. Attempt to set the attendees property to the new array.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEvent's attendees are updated to reflect the changes in the array.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsetAttendees: method does not exist.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.1. (although if the documentation is accurate, this should affect all iOS versions from 4.0 onwards).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAny iOS device running a version of iOS that supports Event Kit (iOS 4 or newer)."
