        Summary:
        When canceling local notifications, if you pass in `nil` to -cancelLocalNotification:, everything goes boom and is ruined forever. Or, at least, momentarily. The app crashes, is what I'm trying to get at.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have code that boils down to `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] cancelLocalNotification:nil];` somewhere in your app.
        2. Have it run.

        Expected Results:
        1. Nothing. Nil was passed in. Silently stop working 'cause theres nothing else to do.

        Actual Results:
        The world ends. Maximum entropy occurs. Etc etc. At the end of the day, my app crashed and I was sad.

        Regression:
        I don't know if this ever didn't happen. I can't install older OS's on my test devices to check.
