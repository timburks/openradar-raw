    description: "15390104\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nMKMapSnapshotter does not provide a way to capture and render map overlays along with the map image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the MKMapSnapshotter to create a snapshot image of a map view. Look for ways to include overlay information with the snapshot.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would be really great to be able to snapshot an actual map view's representation of a scene including things like overlays and annotations. Of course, some of these items may not be desirable in the final scene, but there should at least be optional ways of adding overlays or annotations to the rendered scene created by the MKMapSnapshotter.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCan't add overlay information to the snapshot.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDescribe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProvide additional information, such as references to related problems, workarounds and relevant attachments."
