    description: "Summary:\r\nThe letters in the navigation now only show up when there are more than 50 (?) artists in the list. The bigger size of the table rows makes this even worse. Removing or setting this threshold to 10 would be a sensible resolution as those letters are a huge help in navigating big lists and there's nothing in the UI that competes with them."
