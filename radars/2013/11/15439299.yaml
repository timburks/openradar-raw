        Summary:
        L2TP VPN doesn't work due to missing Shared Secret

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a new L2TP VPN Interface in System Preferences > Network
        Enter connection credentials, hostname, username, password and L2TP Shared secret. Appy settings to save them.
        Try to connect.

        Expected Results:
        VPN should connect successfully.

        Actual Results:
        L2TP asks for a password (sometimes) even though it is correctly entered in the preferences.
        When trying to connect OS X is unable to connect and complains about a missing shared secret. Even though it was correctly entered in preferences, saved and is availablee in the keychain.

        Regression:
        Tested against an OS X Server 10.8.5 with L2TP over IPSec VPN. The VPN server is correctly reachable from other devices like iOS 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and  OS X 10.8.5.

        Notes:
        This problem has not occurred before 10.9
