    description: "When inspecting EKEvent objects, and getting the list of attendees, the EKParticpant's isCurrentUser never work.\r\n\r\nFor the organizer, if the organizer is the current user, it does work, but that's often not helpful enough.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make any sample event kit application for iOS \r\n2. Using a google email account (I haven't tried with other accounts), make sure that is set up to be one of the calendars on your phone.\r\n3. Create an event from google calendar.\r\n4. From any different account, invite that calendar to an event.\r\n5. In the iOS app, retrieve the EKEvent objects for those two events.\r\n6. Go through the attendees array\r\n7. Notice, the isCurrentUser is not set for any attendees.\r\n8. Look at the organizer\r\n9. Notice the organizer for the event you created has isCurrentUser = YES\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected the participant that is you to have the isCurrentUser flag set.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe participant does not have the isCurrentUser flag set"
