    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen using -[UITableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:] to delete the bottom-most row of a Table View, the Delete button and the cell content stays visible until the animation ends.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iOS project from the project template \"Master-Detail Application\"\r\n2. Open the Storyboard, select the Master View Controller and set the Table View style to \"Grouped\"\r\n3. Run the app on the Simulator\r\n4. Add a few rows by tapping the \"+\" button\r\n5. Swipe the bottom-most row and tap the \"Delete\" button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* The row deletion should be animated: the row should shrink to the top until not being visible anymore.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* The row background and the Delete button stay visible over the table view background until the end of the animation. At the end of the animation, the cell disappears suddenly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt also seems that deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation: doesn't honor the row animation parameter: the change is animated even when using UITableViewRowAnimationNone."
