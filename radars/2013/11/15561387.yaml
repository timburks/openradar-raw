    description: "Although you can specify Leaderboards in many different \"Units\" (Integer, Fixed Points, Time, ...) and even specify Score Format Suffix, you can't — somehow — do that for Achievements.\r\n\r\nExample: Imagine I have a Leaderboard which counts \"Jumps\" (when people do something in an app) and I'd like to do something when they reach 50... Jumps, not Points!"
