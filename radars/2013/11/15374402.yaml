    description: "Summary:\nWhen using MKUserTrackingModeFollow, programmatic zooming using -[MKMapView setRegion:animated:] doesn't work. The map shortly zooms out but returns to the previous zoom level as soon as it receives the next location update.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nOpen and run the attached project.\nEnable user tracking using the button.\nThen tap \"Zoom Out\".\n\nExpected Results:\nThe map continues to track the user but zooms out.\n\nActual Results:\nThe map shortly zooms out and zooms back in when it receives the next location update. Under iOS 7 it zooms back in right after tapping the \"Zoom Out\" button.\n\nNotes:\nMany apps need to set the zoom level according to the shown content (such as pins). This is hardly doable in combination with the new user tracking feature. I can think of hacks like disabling the tracking mode during the programmatic zoom but this is clearly not the way it should work.\n\nRegression:\nsee rdar://9921109 \nI believe the bug was once fixed but since (at least) iOS 6.1 it occurs again."
