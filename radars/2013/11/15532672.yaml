    description: We have a situation with some of our collection view UICollectionViewCell's.  In our collection view (which is similar to a UITableView but with section AND subsection headers instead of just section headers), when we delete cells while rotating, very occasionally, the layout of a cell may be as if it was in landscape mode rather than portrait mode.  In this case, items that are relative to the right of the view are offscreen.  This does not happen for all cells which is slightly puzzling.
