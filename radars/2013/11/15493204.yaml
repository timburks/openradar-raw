    description: "In OS X user can switch between running applications using \"Cmd+Tab\" keyboard shortcut and between multiple windows of the currently running application using \"Cmd+` (backtick)\". But the behavior differs among the two.\r\n\r\n           When invoking \"Cmd+Tab\", a user gets to the most recently used previous application (in that order), whereas in case of \"Cmd+`\", user always cycle through the windows of the current application in a round robin manner. Is there a mechanism (via system preference or an undocumented hack)using which a user can get \"Cmd+Tab\" like functionality to work with \"Cmd+`\", i.e. get to the most recently used window of the current application from amongst all the open windows."
