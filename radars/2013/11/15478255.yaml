    description: "Summary:\nIf you enable the accessibility inspector you can cause crashes on UIViews which implement custom accessibility elements. \n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n- Get the sample project:\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cocoanetics/DTCoreText.git\n- enable the Accessibility inspector on the iOS 7 simulator, General - Accessibility\n- Build&Run the DemoApp target of the project\n- Double-Click on the first entry that says \"README\"\n- Double-Click on the Portrait Photo\n- Swipe and click wildly around on the view\n\nExpected Results:\n- No crash\n\nActual Results:\n- Crash with the following stack trace:\n\n2013-11-15 10:41:23.205 RTDemoApp[1502:70b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[DTAttributedTextContentView superlayer]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0xa3f42a0'\n\nRegression:\nThis occurs only on the iOS 7 simulator, not on iOS 6 simulator.\n\nNotes:\nThere is no method -[UIView superlayer], yet accessibility hit testing wants to call it from -[CALayer(CALayerPrivate) ancestorSharedWithLayer:]\n\nAn alternative method to reproduce this is to enable the BettterTouchTool (http://www.boastr.net) which seems to also enable some sort of Accessibility inside iOS simulator."
