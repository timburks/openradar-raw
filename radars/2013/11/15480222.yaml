    description: "Summary:\r\nI have Touch ID enabled on my iPhone. If my phone is sitting on a table and I want to use it, I'll grab my phone so that my thumb is near the home button; then I click the home button and roll my thumb slightly so that the part resting on the Touch ID sensor is the part that Touch ID recognizes most consistently. (Yes, I realize that if I spent more time calibrating my fingerprint then I might not have to move my thumb during this process.)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that as I reposition my thumb on the sensor, my thumb is also touching the screen, and so iOS interprets the movement as a swipe to the left or to the right. This swipe is short and slow enough that usually the only effect is that the date and time display drifts to one side for a second before Touch ID recognizes my print and the phone unlocks. However, this little bit of drift is unexpected and kind of jarring. I think it would be a nice touch if the lock screen were able to ignore these kinds of swipes (i.e. at the very bottom edge of the screen, near the center) when Touch ID is enabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Enable Touch ID.\r\n2. With the phone locked (i.e. display off), activate the phone by tapping the home button.\r\n3. Before Touch ID accepts or rejects your fingerprint, reposition your finger or thumb slightly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe lock screen will not move as you reposition your finger or thumb.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe date and time display \"swims\" slightly to the left or right as you reposition your finger or thumb.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n7.0.4 (11B554a)\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone (presumably the 5s) with Touch ID enabled"
