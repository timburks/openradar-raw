        Summary:
        iOS 7 exposed a new capability (videoCompositor) that allows performing custom video compositing in real time, opening the door to special filters, transitions, etc.

        This is very interesting, but alas, AVPlayer lacks an API that allows reloading the current frame when compositor parameter change and the player is not currently playing the composition.

        Imagine a diagonal swipe transition compositor for which you can change the diagonal angle (parameter). If the video is not playing, there is currently no way to tell the AVPlayer to update the currently displayed image when changing the diagonal angle parameter.

        Thank you for considering adding such a 'reload' API to AVPlayer.
