        The MKMapView camera property is great but it could be much more useful if it were also updated during any user interaction such as panning, pinching, rotating or tilting.

        This would allow realtime updates according to the current camera settings. Auxiliary objects could stick firmly to the map.
        Right now those use cases aren't possible because the camera is only updated once the user finishes the touch gesture.

        This is not understandable because the region property IS being updated during user interaction. Therefore I consider this a bug not an intended omission.
