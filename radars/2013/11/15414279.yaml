    description: "Summary:\r\nOn various pages, Safari simply crashes when VoiceOver is running, shortly before the page has finished loading. I have seen this on http://logitech.com, http://zagg.com, http://apple.com.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iPad Air, turn on VoiceOver and do some regular surfing on the pages listed above. View the iPad Air keyboard cases offered by both Zagg and Logitech, for example.\r\n2. Infrequently, but very regularly, Safari will simply exit.\r\nOne specific set of steps I have found to reproduce is the following on zagg.com. Note that you need an account *and* an open order there to reproduce the problem:\r\n1. go to http://zagg.com.\r\n2. Tap on \"My account\".\r\n3. Fill in your login details, or have them filled in by Safari + Keychain, and hit \"Login\" on the left side.\r\n4. Go to the open order and tap the linked invoice number for that order.\r\n5. The order details will appear.\r\n6. For ten minutes, or so, open another tab, or change to another app and do some work. You need the site to log you out after a timeout to actually reproduce the problem.\r\n7. Return to your order summary, and hit the Reload button.\r\n8. You'll once again be prompted to log in.\r\n9. Hit Login.\r\n10. On almost 100% of times, when the order summary page reloads, Safari crashes. For example the latest of the attached crash reports is from that exact crash.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo crashes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrashes. Safari simply closed. VoiceOver continued to run.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3 (11B511)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPad Air WiFi, iOS 7.0.3. Safari password saving enabled, Keychain syncing enabled. Device in landscape."
