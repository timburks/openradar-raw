    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an external display is attached, the order of NSStatusItems change as soon as they are clicked on. The also don't send the action to the target until they have been tapped on several times.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download and build the attached Stashed.xcodeproj\r\n2. Run the app without an external display attached\r\n3. Tap on the red, green and blue status items on the built-in display.\r\n4. Attach an external display\r\n5. Tap on the red, green and blue status items on the external display's status bar. Do this four times.\r\n6. Tap on the red, green and blue status items on the built-in display's status bar. Do this four times.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn step 5 and 6, -selectRed:, -selectBlue: and -selectGreen: should be invoked and a beep should be heard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn step 5 and 6, the methods are not called the first three times (and there is no beep.) The order of the status items also shift one position after each click until the fourth click puts the items in the correct order.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 / 13A603\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttp://files.iconfactory.net/craig/bugs/Stash.zip"
