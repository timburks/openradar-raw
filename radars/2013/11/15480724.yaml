    description: "Summary:\r\nCaching server is enabled for Server 3 on Mac OS X 10.9.\r\n\r\nAt first it cached updates to iOS apps made from iOS devices on the local network. However this seems to have stopped.\r\n\r\n- The caching pane in Server.app shows 223.5MB of iOS apps, a figure that does not change when iOS devices install app store updates.\r\n- Updating apps on iOS happens at the speed of the (slow) internet connection instead of the local network speed. Also, Activity Monitor on the server shows no outgoing network activity when iOS app updates are being downloaded.\r\n- With cache logging cranked up to \"verbose\", the cache server logs show no activity when iOS devices are downloading and installing app updates.\r\n\r\nFor Mac apps, caching seems to work fine. The amount of cached data increases as expected, the cache server logs show considerable activity, and updates happen much more quickly than the local internet connection would allow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up Server 3.0.1\r\n2. Connect two iOS devices to the same local network\r\n3. Install an app update on the first iOS device\r\n4. Install the same update on the second iOS device\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAt step 3, the cache server would show an increase in the amount of cached data, and cache server logs would show activity related to the update. At step 4, the device would get the update over the local network, and cache server logs would reflect this.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor steps 3 and 4, the updates install directly from the app store. Server shows no activity at all, and there's no indication of network traffic in or out of the Mac running Server.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nServer 3.0.1 / Build 13S2015\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis started with Server 3.0, and updating to 3.0.1 did not make any difference.\r\n\r\nVarious voodoo rituals like rebooting the server Mac, disabling and reenabling caching, and rebooting iOS devices did not make any difference either."
