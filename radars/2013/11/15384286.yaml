    description: UIWebView does not implement any delegate methods, nor support any notifications that provide the user application with the ability to respond to changes in the current webpage load progress. The OS X API for WebView supports the notification WebProgressEstimateChangedNotification to provide this functionality to user apps. On iOS, the WebView API is considered private due to the fact that you can only access it through the undocumented class UIWebDocumentView, underpinning the UIWebView class. This makes it effectively impossible to use UIWebView in a situation where the app needs to monitor page load progress or display progress information to the user.
