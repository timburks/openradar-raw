    description: "Summary:\r\nTo date, a developer can not know how a user has become aware of its application and from where it was redirected on the page of the store.\r\nIt would be useful to provide this information in iTunes Connect to get a clearer picture on where to focus marketing efforts or how the users search for new applications on the store itself.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFor each App in iTunes Connect will be available a summary of the links or sections of the store from where the user was before downloading the App.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no way to know where the user find an App and decided to download it."
