    description: "This only appears to reproduce on certain Macs. We have successfully reproduced (100% of the time) on:\r\n2008 MacBook Pro\r\n2010 MacBook Air\r\nEarly 2011 MacBook Pro\r\n\r\nOther Macs do not reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nTo test, run the attached Mac app. You will see the CBCentralManager state code, along with the value returned by IOBluetoothPreferenceGetControllerPowerState. On affected systems, CBCentralManager state will be 4 (CBCentralManagerStatePoweredOff) where as IOBluetoothPreferenceGetControllerPowerState will return 1. See attached screenshot."
