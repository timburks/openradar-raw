    description: 'I subscribed to a number of podcasts in iTunes on the Mac. I then installed the Podcasts app on the iPhone. My expectation was that the two would stay in sync: if an episode is marked as played on the phone, it should get marked as played in iTunes, and vice versa. If one app checks for new podcasts, finds and downloads them, they should show up on the other app. In my experience, this doesn''t work. I have identical Stations set up in both places, and the Podcasts are the same, but the episodes are totally different. If I listen to one on the phone, it still shows as unplayed on the Mac. If I listen to an episode partway, the play position should update correctly on the other device.'
