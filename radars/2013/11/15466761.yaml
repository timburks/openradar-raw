    description: "Summary:\r\nProvide a descriptive summary of the issue.\r\n\r\nThere is an intermittent crash that I get with no clear cause and very strange symptoms. The crashing line is in a private class. The debugger points to the DDTokenCacheMoveStreamOffset class on a background thread labeled as \"Queue: NSOperationQueue Serial Queue\".\r\n\r\nThe following also gets logged to console:\r\n\r\n\"2013-11-13 23:52:29.389 Runs[61726:5c07] DDRequire failed: the following assertion will only be logged once\r\n2013-11-13 23:52:29.390 Runs[61726:5c07] assertion on /SourceCache/MobileDataDetectorsCore_Sim/MobileDataDetectorsCore-355/Sources/PushDown/DDTokenCache.c:360 \"delta >= 0\" failed :Bad shift in DDTokenCacheMoveStreamOffset, aborting\"\r\n\r\nEvery other thread is also a private execution set. One thread includes DDApplyOptions.\r\n\r\nThe crash log I get from Flurry sometimes includes the following:\r\n\r\nFull Stack Trace:\r\n0   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a6c48 <redacted> + 319\r\n1   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a6acb <redacted> + 2182\r\n2   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a6a71 <redacted> + 2092\r\n3   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a6a71 <redacted> + 2092\r\n4   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a6a71 <redacted> + 2092\r\n5   DataDetectorsCore                   0x329a5df1 _DDScannerScanQuery + 328\r\n6   DataDetectorsUI                     0x329c0f7d -[DDOperation main] + 288\r\n7   Foundation                          0x2ef30aa5 -[__NSOperationInternal _start:] + 772\r\n8   Foundation                          0x2efd496d <redacted> + 60\r\n9   libdispatch.dylib                   0x38e47e7b <redacted> + 374\r\n10  libdispatch.dylib                   0x38e44f93 <redacted> + 42\r\n11  libdispatch.dylib                   0x38e48745 <redacted> + 76\r\n12  libdispatch.dylib                   0x38e489c5 <redacted> + 56\r\n13  libsystem_pthread.dylib             0x38f72dff __pthread_wqthread + 298\r\n14  libsystem_pthread.dylib             0x38f72cc4 _start_wqthread + 8\r\n\r\nThe line of my code where this seems to sometimes originate from, if it is to be believed, is this:\r\n\r\n    _mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 140.0f, 90.0f)];\r\n\r\nWhich is being called in a view's initWIthFrame method.\r\n\r\nI seriously have no idea what is causing this.
