    description: "If someone has automatic downloads of apps purchased on other devices turned on, it's possible to purchase a large app on one device (e.g., an iPad), and then another device with the same Apple ID (e.g., an iPhone) begins the large app download, and then for the user to not realize the download on that second device hasn't finished. If the user leaves home, thus dropping the wi-fi connection, before the download is finished, often the download will eventually time out and remain paused. Even if the user returns home and stays connected to wifi for days and days, the download will never automatically restart unless explicitly told to do so by the user.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Verify two devices have the same Apple ID associated with the App Store.\r\n2. Verify the second device is using wi-fi.\r\n3. Begin a download of a large app on one device.\r\n4. Verify the second device has begun automatically downloading the app.\r\n5. Take the second device out of wifi-range, monitor the download progress indicator on the home screen until the progress indicator on the app icon goes away and you're left with just a dimmed icon.\r\n6. Take the second device back into wifi range, verify that it reconnects to the wifi network.\r\n7. Observe that, no matter how long you wait, the app download will not be automatically resumed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app download automatically resumes in the background at some point.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app download remains paused in perpetuity (see attached image). Not a great user experience; for someone with many pages on the home screen who doesn't use a large app particularly often on the second device, they can be surprised later, expecting the automatic download would have finished."
