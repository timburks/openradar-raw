    description: "Summary:\r\nFor many Apps a nice feature is to implement some kind of \"click\" sound when an user tap on a UIButton or some UIView subclasses with an UITapGestureRecognizer attached to them, like game menus implemented with UIKit or some sort of quiz App with audio feedback when an user select a wrong/correct answer. At today there are many ways to implement a sound but the one with AVPlayer is somewhat overkill and the one based on the systems sounds methods has some weird comportment (like put the App volume to zero but not mute the device and the system sound continues to play).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA nice addition to the API (even for OS X SDK) is a method like setSoundWithName:forControlEvents: for UIControl subclasses and a setSoundWithName: for UIGestureRecognizer subclasses that are based on the App volume and super-duper optimized for the scope. (If it help limit the dimension/duration of the file, in the majority of the cases the sounds are never longer than 1/2 sec.)"
