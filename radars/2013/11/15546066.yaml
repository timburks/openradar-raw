    description: "Summary:\r\nShared Photostreams should allow a setting for not using cellular data. They easily plow through data caps without the user realizing it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Share a photostream with a friend\r\n2. Go to work\r\n3. Have your friend upload a few hundred photos to the stream\r\n4. Be notified by your carrier that your data cap has reached this months volume\r\n5. Be angry at your friend for uploading now, instead of waiting for when you're home at your wifi.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n6.0 and up"
