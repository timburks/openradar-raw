    description: "Summary:\r\nRetrieving the InstantAmperage value for the battery returns the wrong value which is usually a value more than 60k\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run ioreg -rn AppleSmartBattery | egrep -i '\"InstantAmperage'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA value between 0 and ~3000\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA value that is more than 60k\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 - Build 13A569\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes after disconnecting the power cable the value that is returned appears to be correct, but after a minute or so it will shoot back up to >60k. \r\n\r\nTaking the large value that is returned and subtracting 0xFFFF gives a value that is within the correct range but I'm not sure if this is actually correct."
