    description: "Summary:\r\nI was wondering if there was any developer documentation on how app auto updating works? Does iOS 7 only auto update apps that are not running, or does it stop apps that are in the background to update them? Is there possibly services (like VOIP or location) that would control when the app update would occur? Is there possibly a way to programatically \"flag\" the app to not update under certain conditions (user is logged in for example)?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that my company (Cerner Corporation) has a messaging/alerting/VOIP application in the app store that provides mission critical alerting information to nurses in a patient care environment. We are trying to determine if our users should continue to use auto-update or if we need to communicate to them that it needs to be shut off to prevent the app from being stopped in the background during update (which would be a patient safety concern).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I appreciate any information that you can provide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nn/a, this is a question.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nAll devices are iPhone 5s running iOS 7.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
