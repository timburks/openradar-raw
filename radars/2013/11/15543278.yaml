    description: "Summary:\r\nMail often unarchives messages that have been archived by the Archive button. After the button is pressed, the message will be archived for awhile, but it will come back later. \r\n\r\nThis seems to coincide with bug 15319513.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nMail 7.0 (1822)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nTested using multiple Gmail and Google Apps accounts. The archive folder is set as \"All Mail\" (although the archive folder setting should not affect anything). \r\n\r\nThe recent Mail update for Mavericks is installed.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
