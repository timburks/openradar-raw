        2. Under “Albums,” select “See All >”

        Expected Results:
        The albums will be sorted in release date order.

        Notes:
        The best example I’ve seen is the Beatles’ page: https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtistSeeAll?cc=us&dkId=2&ids=136975&section=0
