        Summary:
        When setting a manual proxy on iPad (model tested: 32GB iPad Mini Cellular with Retina Display UK version) with 7.1 Beta (Build 11D5099e) the settings are not remembered and go back to Off

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1- Go to settings
        2- Select the details of the wifi network you are connected to
        3- Switch HTTP PROXY to Manual
        4- Enter the proxy Server and Port address (the proxy I wanted to test didn't require any authentication)
        5- Go Back to Wi-Fi using the navigation button

        Expected Results:
        The selected wi-fi network should now use the defined proxy.

        Actual Results:
        The proxy settings are forgotten as soon as we leave the wi-fi details page. When going back to it the HTTP PROXY settings are reverted back to Off.

        Regression:
        The problem occurs systematically on my iPad, regardless of the wi-fi network I'm using. Restarting the device (normal restart and hard reset) didn't fix the problem.

        Notes:
        The problem doesn't occur on my 32GB iPhone 5s (UK version) with 7.1 Beta (Build 11D5099e). The manual proxy works as expected on that device.
