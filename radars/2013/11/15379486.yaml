    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you connect an iOS device to a Mac laptop, if the laptop itself is solely on battery power the USB connection is still used to charge the attached iOS device.  This is a serious battery killer in general, and especially for larger connected device like iPads.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Unplug your laptop\r\n2. Connect an iOS device\r\n3. iOS device will start charging\r\n4. Watch battery level fall.... \r\n5. Weep.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be an option, especially with lightening/thunderbolt connections that the connection is used only for communications and not charging connected devices.  Having such an option would preserve the laptop's battery.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nthe battery-only powered laptop winds up charging any/all connected iOS devices depleting the battery much faster.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nOS X 10.9 (13A598)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nObviously not a problem when the laptop is connected to mains power.\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
