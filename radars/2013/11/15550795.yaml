    description: "Summary:\r\nSome elements show up yellow and some purple, and I can never remember which is which.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the iOS Simulator and run an app.\r\n2. Choose Debug â†’ Color Misaligned Images. Some things may turn purple, and some things may turn yellow.\r\n3. Try to use that information to debug your app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a key that indicates that purple means misaligned and yellow means stretched.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such key, so I have to resort to post-it notes to remember which is which, and that only works when I'm at my desk: https://alpha.app.net/zev/post/11835250/photo/1\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS Simulator 7.0 (463.9.4.2)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is true for the Core Animation instrument in Instruments as well. There is no obvious way to tell which color means what. Before the post-it notes, I had to resort to finding this Stack Overflow post every time: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6283480/what-does-yellow-tinting-represent-when-using-color-misaligned-images-on-iphon"
