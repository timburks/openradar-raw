    description: "George Villasboas22-Nov-2013 05:28 PM\r\n\r\nVídeo of the issue happening: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKqQXGroO5Q&feature=youtu.be (private video)\r\n\r\nGeorge Villasboas22-Nov-2013 05:24 PM\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIf you have an third party app that runs on background as a bluetooth peripheral service, turning an iDevice into an iBeacon will not be possible because it hangs the iBeacon advertisement after a couple of seconds.\r\n\r\nI made a setup to prove this bug using very basic code showed on WWDC sessions about iBeacon, using 02 iPhones 5, one as a iBeacon and the other as an Ranger. On the device running as a iBeacon, I also installed an app that turns itself into a Bluetooth Peripheral on the background (in my case I used Knock to unlock).\r\n\r\nWhen I turn the setup on without the Bluetooth Peripheral app running, every thing works as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen I fire up the bluetooth peripheral app, the iBeacon device starts advertising for a couple of seconds and then stops.\r\n\r\nThere's a priority issue there, since iBeacons only run on foreground, it should have priority over any other bluetooth service.\r\n\r\nI made a vídeo demonstrating the bug for further information and the source code used is also attached.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Setup a device as a Beacon emitter and another as a ranger.\r\n2. On the beacon device, open and authorise any app to run as a Bluetooth Peripheral Service.\r\n3. Go back to the beacon device\r\n4. Watch the ranging device stop sensing the beacon.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSince iBeacons only work on foreground its expected to have priority over any other bluetooth service. But what happens is that the iBeacon advertisement is halted by the system.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe third party bluetooth service app gets priority over the beacon broadcast, hanging it up.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nTested on iOS 7.0.3, 7.0.4 and 7.1 Beta 1 using different setups as emitters and rangers.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe app used to simulate the Bluetooth Peripheral Service was \"Knock (to Unlock)\", available at: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knock-to-unlock/id692929970?mt=8\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nOccurs on any device (iPhone or iPad) running iOS 7.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n'Sources.zip' was successfully uploaded."
