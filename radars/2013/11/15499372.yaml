    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen MFMailComposeViewController is used in landscape mode (at least on iPhone), the frame for content has the incorrect width - it appears to be the portrait width.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Fire up the attached sample code. This is slightly modified sample code downloaded from the Apple Developer Center (I added support for landscape in the project file).\r\n2. Select \"Compose Mail\"\r\n3. Rotate the device or simulator to landscape\r\n4. In the content, type some random characters on a single line...at some point the characters will no longer show in the view. The cursor still displays, however.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nText should be visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText is input in text view, but does not display properly.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7.0.3, iOS 7.1 (beta). Does not occur in iOS6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached my slightly updated version of Apple's messaging sample code from the developer center.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nRun using XCode 5 and 5.1 (beta) on a Macbook Pro (Retina, 2013)"
