    description: "Summary:\r\nThe way a Shared Photostream currently handles the offline availability of photos can be very confusing. It would be a great improvement to have some way to ensure that a certain photostream is available offline on a certain device. (e.g. a switch in the photostream settings)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Take lots of photos of some event, then at home, edit them on the Mac and create a shared photostream \"album\", in order to have the photos available on all other devices.\r\n2. Check if the photos appear on your iPad, because you'll meetup with friends at a diner later, who want to see the photos.\r\n3. Once all photos seem to have been downloaded on the iPad, take it and leave the house.\r\n4. Meet your friends, pull out the iPad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll the photos you JUST uploaded are available in full resolution on the iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt actually only downloaded the thumbnails and needs an internet connection to download the full-res version.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis would be a non-issue if there was a GOOD way, to transfer photos to an iOS device without having to use iTunes' weird way of syncing albums. But for now using Shared Photostreams as albums seems to be the most convenient way to do this."
