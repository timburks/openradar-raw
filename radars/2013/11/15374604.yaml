    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen MKUserTrackingModeFollow is set an MKAnnotation at the edge of the mapView can not be selected. Apparently, the behavior to automatically switch to MKUserTrackingModeNone and move the map to make room for the annotation callout doesn't work when map tracking is enabled and there was a programmatic zoom request.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run the attached sample project\r\n2. Simulate the location of \"San Francisco\" in Xcode\r\n2. Switch to MKUserTrackingModeFollow using the right bar button item\r\n3. Tap the red pin on the left edge. The callout should open\r\n4. Deselect the pin by tapping on the map\r\n5. Tap \"Zoom Out\"\r\n6. Tap the red pin on the left edge again\r\n\r\nExpected: Tracking mode should be disabled, the map should move and the callout should open.\r\n\r\nActual Result: Nothing happens."
