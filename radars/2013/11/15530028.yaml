    description: "Summary:\r\nThis issue affects a UIScrollView with pagingEnabled set to YES.  When the contentOffset becomes large enough, paging stops working properly.\r\n\r\nWhen contentOffset is smaller than some threshold, no matter the contentSize, paging works perfectly. \r\n\r\nWhen contentOffset passes some threshold, paging becomes sluggish.  That is, rather than crisply stopping at a page boundary, it stops near the boundary and then slides to the boundary slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen contentOffset passes another, larger threshold, paging stops working entirely.  Dragging the UIScrollView and releasing seems to yield undefined behavior and the UIScrollView rarely lands on a page boundary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up a very large UIScrollView (contentSize at least 30 million) with paging enabled.  Add some indicator of where page boundaries should be (at multiples of the UIScrollView's bounds).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPaging works perfectly no matter the current contentOffset\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFor large contentOffsets, you see the behavior described above.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nIn all 7.* releases I've tried.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nHappens on iPhone 5 and 5S, as well as in simulator.  May happen elsewhere as well but I haven't tested.\r\n\r\nSample code: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ochafsc0t22whv6/Z_4Pgn5TDw"
