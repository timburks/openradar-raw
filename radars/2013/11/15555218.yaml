    description: "Summary:\r\nSandboxed apps should write crash logs out to the Logs folder of their container.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nBecause Apple rejects apps that request the entitlement\r\n\r\ncom.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.home-relative-path.read-only: /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\r\n\r\nit's impossible for developers to get direct access to the customers that are experiencing the crashes. We can't gather any data and we're forced to use the TERRIBLE UI in iTunesConnect to get crash reports.\r\n\r\nThis is the most critical tool developers have to help them improve their software and the combination of sandboxing and App Store rules are preventing access to it. If a sandboxed application could write a copy of its crash log out to its container then we could collect and submit them in a method of our choosing and still operate within the restrictions of the sandbox."
