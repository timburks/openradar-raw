    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen on my wifi network (Airport Extreme, both new tower and previous dual band) my new 15\" rMBP (2013) has a lot of latency and sometimes packet loss to anywhere on the network including the router.  Problem doesn't exist on other machines and is mostly non-existent in linux.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect rMBP to wifi (5ghz, 2.4ghz, doesn't seem to matter)\r\n2. ping 10.0.1.1 or router IP\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFrom a MBA in OS X 10.9\r\n--- 10.0.1.1 ping statistics ---\r\n202 packets transmitted, 202 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\r\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.841/2.551/4.258/0.743 ms\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFrom rMBP in OS X 10.9\r\n--- 10.0.1.1 ping statistics ---\r\n256 packets transmitted, 256 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\r\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.958/102.892/1002.802/123.781 ms\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n10.9/13A3017\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a numbers files with 3 ping values, linux & OS X for rMBP and OS X for MBA.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\nThis doesn't occur on any other wireless machines on the network, including a MBA 2010 on 10.9. That never gets above 6ms ping.\r\nThis also doesn't occur on ubuntu booted from thumb drive on rMBP, except it still seems very occasional ping spikes when using most recent proprietary linux broadcom drivers."
