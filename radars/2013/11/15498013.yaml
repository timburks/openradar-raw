    description: "Summary:\r\nFor a UITableViewCell subclass loaded from a xib, even if you don't specify it as an accessibility element in that xib, if you add string properties to the class, it will show up as an accessibility element with *all* the strings concatenated together.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Clone the git repository https://github.com/apontious/VoiceOver-String-Properties-in-Cells-Bug.git\r\n- Build and run it on a VoiceOver-enabled iPhone or iPod touch\r\n- Double-tap the + button a couple times to add a few rows to the table\r\n- Swipe through the accessibility elements\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe only table accessibility elements are the image view and the button inside every cell.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe cell itself is an accessibility element, with its string properties concatenated together as the label.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\niOS 7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRemoving the string properties from the cell subclass removes the cell as an accessibility element.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\niPhone and iPod touch. Haven't tested on iPad."
