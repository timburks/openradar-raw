    description: "Summary:\r\nThe following header map settings has no effect for library and application target types:\r\n\r\nHEADERMAP_INCLUDES_PROJECT_HEADERS \r\nHEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FRAMEWORK_ENTRIES_FOR_ALL_PRODUCT_TYPES\r\nHEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FLAT_ENTRIES_FOR_TARGET_BEING_BUILT\r\n\r\nThis is contrary to the Build Settings Reference documentation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install Xcode 5\r\n2. Create a project containing a dylib target or a console application target\r\n3. add an xcconfig file to the targets, setting the above three build settings to \"NO\"\r\n3. Create a subdirectory in the source directory with 1 header file, adding this file to the project hierarchy, but not to the header build phase of the target (if applicable)\r\n4. #include \"thefile.h\" in the main class or main file of the library/application.\r\n5. build\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe build should fail, because the subdirectory should not be searched, and it should not be referencing any header files with flattened file name mappings. The header files should also not contain flattened file name mappings.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe build succeeds. Headermap files are written to the DerivedData directory, containing flattened file mappings (TARGETNAME-project-headers.hmap, TARGETNAME.hmap).\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVersion 5.0.2 (5A3005)"
