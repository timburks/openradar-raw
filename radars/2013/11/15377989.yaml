    description: "Summary:\r\nGarageBand 10 removed the ablity to export to one of the most widely-used audio formats in the world that is accepted by nearly every single music website for artists and works on every music player ever sold. Instead we are forced to export to a proprietary m4a file.\r\n\r\nThis must be some kind of sick joke.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a musical masterpeice\r\n2. Desire to share it with the worldâ€”including people with PCs and non-Apple devices\r\n3. Attempt to export your song in the most widely-used music format in existence\r\n4. Punch a hole through your monitor upon realizing it is no longer an option\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI should not punch a hole through my monitor while trying to share my music with the world.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nI rage so hard that I fracture all of my fingers angrily logging into Radar to report a problem that never should have existed.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nGarageBand 10.0.0"
