        The new stringsdict functionality in 10.9 and iOS 7 is super powerful, but Xcode doesn't have a file template for it, and doesn't seem to recognize the stringsdict filetype.

        Steps to reproduce:
        1. Try to create stringsdict file

        Expected:
        1. There is a stringsdict file template
        2. Creating a plist file and giving it the .stringsdict file extension causes Xcode to recognize it as a plist file

        Actual:
        1. There is no stringsdict file template, and you have to use the plist template
        2. Files with the .stringsdict filetype aren't recognized as plist files, and display as source code
