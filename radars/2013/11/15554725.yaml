    description: "Summary:\r\nNotifications on OS X should be displayed on the currently active screen, instead of the \"primary\" screen when multiple displays are in use. The system should assume that the currently active screen is the one that has the user's attention, and therefore, should be the place to display the notification so that the user can see it.\r\n\r\nWhen using a 15\" rMBP on the right and a 27\" thunderbolt display on the left, using the thunderbolt display as the active display but using an app on the MBP's screen, the notifications that show up on the thunderbolt display are almost completely out of even your peripheral vision.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use multiple displays\r\n2. Make app on \"secondary\" display active\r\n3. Receive notification from the notification center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification should be displayed on the currently active screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification is displayed on the screen designated as the \"primary\" screen"
