        Summary:

        The documentation for App States and Multitasking makes no mention whatsoever of the content-available key in the APS payload of a remote-notification push for the iOS 7 API. I spent hours trying to figure out why my remote-notification pushes weren't working in the background.

        Steps to Reproduce:

        Search documentation hopeless for ages. Finally stumble across this in Apple Push Notification service guide:
        "content-available
        Provide this key with a value of 1 to indicate that new content is available.
        This is used to support Newsstand apps and background content downloads."

        That's the only hint that you need this to make remote-notifications work.

        It's also mentioned in the What's New with Multitasking video, but that's a long way from API documentation.
