    description: "Summary:\r\nThe user setting for 12-hour / 24-hour style in General / Date & Time has important changes in iOS code (NSDateFormatter), but developers can't change it using Simulator's Settings and the simulator doesn't change the style based on OS X hour style.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use a format like yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\r\n2. Format it using 24-style / 12-style - notice the AM/PM.\r\nThis is expected: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1480/_index.html\r\n3. The problem is you need an actual device to test this.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSimulator should get the 12-hour / 24-style hour style from OS X or have an option in Settings / General to change it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachments:"
