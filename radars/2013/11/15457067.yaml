        Summary:
        I am unable to view Bots that have been previously created by Xcode. I can see the Xcode server instance when I select Xcode -> Preferences... from the menu bar, and switch to the Accounts tab in the Preferences window.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Xcode
        2. Open the Log Navigator

        Expected Results:
        3. View a list of Bots that have been created on the Xcode server instance configured in Xcode's Account preferences tab.
        4. Use the action menu at the bottom left of the Log Navigator to interact with the Bots

        Actual Results:
        3. There are no Bots listed.
        4. The action menu only offers the ability to create a new Bot.

        Regression:
        N/A

        Notes:
        None
