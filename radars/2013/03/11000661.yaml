    description: "Summary: When using the Spotlight field in Open and Save dialogs, the search criteria can't be saved as a Smart Folder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: In any Apple application, bring up an Open or Save dialog. Use the Spotlight field in the Open/Save dialog to perform any search (e.g., kind:folder, SomeSearchTerm, etc.). Click the small Save button immediately below the in-dialog Spotlight field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The user should be prompted for a name for this Saved Folder with a checkbox to only display this Smart Folder in the current application.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Nothing. Pressing the Save button immediately below the in-dialog Spotlight field fails silently.\r\n\r\nRegression: Under 10.7.x and 10.8.x, there are some third-party applications in which this functionality works as expected: TextWrangler, Microsoft Office 2011 applications, and Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 applications have been successfully tested. However, most other applications tested (all of which are the current version) fail to allow this functionality: iWork, Movist, XLD, OmniOutliner, VLC, MarkdownNote, nvAlt, Byword, Fission, Marked, and iCab.\r\n\r\nNotes: Copying the relevant NSNavPanelAppSmartFolders plist data from an application in which the functionality works (i.e., TextWrangler) to an application where this doesn't work (i.e., Safari) has no effect."
