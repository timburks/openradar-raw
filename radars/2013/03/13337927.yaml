    description: "It is not possible to test any camera-related API in the simulator, even when running on a Mac with a built-in camera that could be used to simulate camera input.\r\n\r\nThere should be an option in the simulator to use the build-in Mac camera to simulate an iOS device with a camera.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to turn this on and off, so the simulator can simulate a device both with and without a camera."
