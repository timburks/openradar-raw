    description: "15-Jan-2013 02:45 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf a full screen Quicktime screen recording is recording when display mirroring is enabled the recording appears to continue recording but silently fails. Recording does not resume until display mirroring is disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Begin on a Mac with a secondary display connected and mirroring disabled\r\n2. Begin a full screen Quicktime screen recording (with the primary screen as the recorded screen)\r\n3. Open System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement\r\n4. Enabled display mirroring\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nScreen recording continues recording on the primary screen, as the \"full screen\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nScreen recording silently pauses (at the time the Quicktime controller shows the size and duration increasing) and resumes only after mirroring is disabled and the display returns to its original state.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe screen recording that I unintentionally documented this in is attached.\r\n\r\n15-Jan-2013 02:45 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Recording Mirror.mov' was successfully uploaded"
