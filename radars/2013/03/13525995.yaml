    description: |-
        I'm working on an app that uses location services extensively, and is meant to be used on trains. I've tested this extensively, mainly on the High Speed Trains running on the Great Western Main Line (between London and Bristol), and I've discovered that geofences don't work on trains.

        If I set up a geofence around a station, with radius 1000 metres, then travel through it on a train, it will not fire. This is true even if the train stops at the station, so I'm sat there within the geofence for 3 minutes. If, however, I leave the train and stand on the platform, the geofence fires.

        It's not a signal (mobile or GPS) issue. The HSTs are far more GPS-transparent than (for example) a Voyager. Also, if I turn on the full location updates, I can get highly accurate location information. But for some reason the geofences will not fire.

        If this is a known issue, it should be mentioned in the documentation. If not, it would be great if you could look into the reason why.
