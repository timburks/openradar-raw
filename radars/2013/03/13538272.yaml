    description: "Summary: While iTunes is downloading songs from iTunes Match, using the main song list is nearly impossible, since the entire list seems to be refreshed on each song's download completion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place several songs (perhaps a few albums) in iTunes Match. Ensure those songs are not already downloaded in iTunes.\r\n2. Select those undownloaded songs in iTunes. Right-click and select \"Download.\"\r\n3. Attempt to select multiple items or perform other stateful interactions with the main song list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The song list works essentially as it would while iTunes is not downloading songs.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The song list appears to be completely refreshed every time a song finishes downloading, so existing selections are cleared; as a result, contextual menus and other UI elements lose or change meaning at unexpected times.\r\n\r\nRegression: Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotes: This makes it very difficult to sort through a long list of albums, selectively downloading certain albums from iTunes Match, since starting downloads effectively prohibits me from selecting and queueing the next album until the first set of downloads is finished."
