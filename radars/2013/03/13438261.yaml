    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen one opens the typographic panel to utilize the small-caps feature of many OTF fonts (Minion Pro for example), the small-caps options \"Lower Case: Small Capitals\" and \"Upper Case: Small Capitals\" have no effect.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect lower-case and uppercase text.  Choose an OTF font like Minion Pro, Calluna, Calluna Sans etc. that has small-caps glyphs, then open the typographic dialog cmd-t and select the options \"Lower Case: Small Capitals\" and \"Upper Case: Small Capitals\".  This has no effect in Pages of Keynote\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe font should be rendered in small-caps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe font is unchanged: either upper-case or lower-case.  Note: one can activate \"small caps\" from the Format->Font>Capitalization menu, but this does not use the typographic feature (it fakes the small-caps with anemic looking scaled-down capital letters).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a serious bug, and has been around for some time.  Please fix the typography - typography was my primary reason for using Pages and Keynote.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19920578\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19185695\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19336964\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/8757206"
