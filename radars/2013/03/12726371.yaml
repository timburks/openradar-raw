    description: "The iOS Simulator allows Hardware Device / iOS Version combinations which are not permissible.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an iPhone 4-inch Retina display with the iOS 5.1 or 5.0.\r\n\r\niOS Simulator should either disallow setting those combinations, or perhaps present something non-modal to let the user of the simulator know that they may get odd results because they are using a combination that does not exist in released hardware/software."
