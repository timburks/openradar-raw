    description: "Summary: CGDisplayCreateImageForRect function captures the mouse cursor on HiDPI displays with the cursor being set to larger size than Normal in Accessibility preferences. This makes the function's behavior inconsistent. It either should always include the cursor, or never.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCGImageRef image = CGDisplayCreateImageForRect(0, CGRectMake(_point.x - 4.0, _point.y - 4.0, 9.0, 9.0));\r\n\r\nWhere _point is the mouse cursor location.\r\n\r\nAnother way to reproduce it is to use the Grab application:\r\n- open it and set in its Preferences to add a cursor to the screen shot\r\n- make a screen shot with the cursor being set to normal size - all is fine\r\n- now try again with the cursor being set to larger size - two cursors appear on the resulting screenshot - one provided by accessibility, second one by Grab\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCGDisplayCreateImageForRect either includes the cursor pointer on all platforms, or none.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCGDisplayCreateImageForRect includes the cursor pointer only on Retina displays that have the cursor set to larger than Normal in accessibility preferences.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
