        Summary:
        Scrolling has artifacts and janky motion when scrolling to view iCloud open tabs

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Enable iCloud tabs for two macs and three iOS devices
        Open Safari on Mac (retina MBP)
        Click on iCloud
        two finger scroll up and down and see how part of the window scrolls and part remains laggy / hanky

        Expected Results:
        smooth, beautiful scrolling with no lag and tearing

        Actual Results:
        lag, tearing and non-smooth scrolling

        Regression:
        fairly sure this wasn't present on previous builds

        Notes:

        this only affects my retina mac - not my Air.
