    description: "For checkboxes, the label should be clickable as well as the box itself. But when you drag a file into Xcode, which brings up the sheet where you can choose the targets to add to, if you click on a target's name it does nothing. You have to actually click on the checkbox itself. \n\nThe expected result is that I could click on the target name in that dialog, and doing so would toggle the appropriate checkbox."
