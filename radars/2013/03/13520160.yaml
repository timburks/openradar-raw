    description: "Summary:\r\nThe discussion section in the documentation for +[NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:] says:\r\n\r\n\"Whether the NSDecimalSeparator is a period (as is used, for example, in the United States) or a comma (as is used, for example, in France) depends on the default locale.\"\r\n\r\nBut this offers no insight into what determines the \"default\" locale. I've done some experimenting and none of the obvious places that might affect this value seem to apply (I've detailed what I tried in this stack overflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15535394/1059264).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nVisit https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDecimalNumber_Class/Reference/Reference.html and scroll down to the decimalNumberWithString: section.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA description of what \"default locale\" means.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo description is present."
