    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen building an iOS app, I want to put my app's version and build numbers in the Settings bundle.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS app with a settings bundle.\r\n2. Try to get the version and build number into the Settings bundle so that they'll be there if the user opens Settings.app and looks at your settings before they run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThis is easy to do.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs far as I can tell, the only way to get the app version and build number (which may be generated dynamically by a build script) into the settings bundle before first run of the app is to write a custom compile-time script to go into the settings bundle, find the appropriate .strings file, and do a string replacement. This is clumsy, and every developer who wants to do this has presumably rolled their own solution.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has always been a problem.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would like to see $VARIABLES that you can use in your settings bundle for version, build number, and other common constants you might want to include. Or, I would like to be able to run my own code inside Settings.app."
