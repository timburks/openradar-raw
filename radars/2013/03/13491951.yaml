        Summary:
        Keyboard focus is incorrectly assigned to the address bar instead of the download popover if no window is visible when the downloads popover is requested.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Safari.
        2. Close all Safari windows.
        3. Press Command-Option-L to display the downloads popover.

        Expected Results:
        The downloads popover has keyboard focus.

        Actual Results:
        The address bar has keyboard focus. There is no apparent way to focus the downloads popover short of hiding and showing it again.

        Regression:
        In Safari 5, this problem did not occur because downloads were in a window.

        Notes:
        Workaround: Press Command-Option-L twice more to hide and show the downloads popover.
