    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIPanGestureRecognizer exhibits a \"lag\" before recognizing a pan, which is appropriate in some applications but not in others. Turning this off is not possible using public APIs, but is possible by calling the private API setHysteresis:(CGFloat)hysteresis with a value of zero.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUseful API is not public, forces developer to risk app rejection for using private API or re-writing pan gesture recognizer from scratch.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:"
