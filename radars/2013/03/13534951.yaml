    description: "30-Mar-2013 12:24 AM Ray Hilton:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nApple Maps displays towns in other states in Australia, but not in Victoria where it seems that local council names are used in error and towns are not displayed at all.  This makes the map very hard to navigate, especially in rual areas.  And third-party apps are very limited in usability.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLoad Apple Maps on iOS 6+, search for \"Lakes Entrance, Vic\".  Although a drop pin is displayed, no town marker for it, or any other town, is displayed.\r\n\r\nThen, zoom out and pan west to see a couple of markers for \"Wellington\", \"Latrobe Vally\", \"South Gippsland\", etc... none of which are towns, just administrative councils.\r\n\r\nAgain, within Melbourne, search for \"Thornbury, Vic\".  Zooming out shows a marker for \"Darebin\" and \"Moreland\", but not the town/suburb names \"Brunswick\", \"Thornbury\", \"Northcote\", etc.  Again, Darebin and Moreland are local council names.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect towns to be display on the map as they are in other states (I've specifically looked at QLD and NSW.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for \"Bryon Bay, NSW\" and you will see that the map shows a marker near the dopped pins for \"Byron Bay\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTowns are not displayed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBefore 5.0 (using google maps) the towns and suburbs were displayed in Victoria.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis severely affects the usability of maps, especially within third-party apps."
