    description: "Summary:\r\nThere should be settings within Guided Access to prevent users who are not the primary owner of the device from using IAP or seeing/clicking through to iAds on the device, if the owner so wishes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGo to Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI'd like to see settings for the disabling of IAPs and iAds in this screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe settings are not there.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs a parent, I often use Guided Access to 'lock' my children into an app, game or task that they are using on an iPhone or iPad. On more than one occasion, my children have come to me with the device in hand having visited an iAd or having attempted to purchase something using IAP.\r\n\r\nI would like to see an option in the Guided Access configuration to offer device owners the chance to diable IAPs and iAd – either outright, or diabling click throughs – within applications that use these particular features."
