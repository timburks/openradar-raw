    description: "19-Mar-2013 12:13 AM Peter Steinberger:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nUIMenuController doesn't re-set UICallbar page state when changing items. When the menu is larger than the screen space, < > arrows will be displayed to split up the content. Press > and go into the second \"page\" of the callout menu, then select a menu. The submenu is displayed, but it's already at the second page! And the < arrow isn't working. Once you press the > arrow, nothing happens (but internal state of UICalloutBar gets fixed) and then < works again. But obviously, that's not the real fix.\r\n\r\nI found two workarounds. The ugly one is\r\n\r\n [menu setMenuVisible:NO animated:YES];\r\n\r\nbefore showing the menu again. But that ruins the fade animation.\r\n\r\nThe better one is to reset the callout bar state:\r\n\r\n        [((id (*)(id, SEL))objc_msgSend)(NSClassFromString(@\"UICalloutBar\"), NSSelectorFromString(@\"activeCalloutBar\")) setValue:@\"0\" forKey:@\"m_currentPage\"];\r\n\r\nBut that's unspeakable horrors - so not really usable as well. So please fix this for me, so that http://pspdfkit.com can be better and my customers are happy again :)\r\n\r\nBtw, wonder how I found that out? Runtime headers are awesome, and so is Hopper :)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI was so nice to make an example, simply start it and follow the instructions above.\r\nSo you better not tell me that this is a duplicate :)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSubmenu should start at page 1, not 2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm @steipete on Twitter, and I hope some Apple birdies tip me on WWDC 2013 so that I can visit you at the labs again :)\r\n\r\n19-Mar-2013 12:13 AM Peter Steinberger:\r\n'UIMenuControllerBug.zip' was successfully uploaded"
