    description: "Currently, there's no way to specifically customize the background image for the high UINavigationBars with prompt. There is UIBarMetricsLandscapePhone to address the mini navigation bar, so the lack to customize the extra high navigation bars with prompt seems obvious.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important to work with the UIRemoteView concept introduced in iOS 6. In my case, I need it for the contact picker when adding recipients to a MFMessageComposeViewController."
