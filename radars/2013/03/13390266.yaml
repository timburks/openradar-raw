    description: "Summary: On a portable (13 inch retina MBP 2012 and 2013, 13 inch Air 2012) I get daily errors of the type:\r\n\r\n\tDetailed failures: \"Externally Indicated Failure\", \"Safety Over-Voltage\", \"Discharge FET\", \"Charge Over-Current\", \"Fuse Blown\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: open terminal and run `pmset -g pslog` the error is most often seen on discharge when AC is not connected. Typically these messages will pop up at least once an hour and often 4 to 6 are logged in a single discharge cycle.\r\n\r\nI did take the first machine that experienced this to genius bar and have service diagnostics run as all-clear. One of the 6 machines that are all brand new - out of the box have this message and one was exchanged under EFFA program, but I'm not convinced that all 6 machines I've run this command have external failures on the first day we put them into service. (100% of the new Macs I've tested have logged this external failure)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  Less false positives (assuming that there isn't actually a failure here)\r\n\r\nActual Results: perhaps 5 safety messages are logged per machine in a normal discharge cycle from full to empty.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have seen this error on multiple Mac, multiple builds, all machines less than a week out of the box, brand new with less than 5 cycles on the internal batteries."
