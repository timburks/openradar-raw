    description: "Seriously I'm sick of my colleagues complaining that Apple has not updated the version of Ruby that ships with the OS X for 9 YEARS now.\r\n\r\nruby --version\r\nruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [universal-darwin12.0]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Ruby_2.0) Ruby 2.0 was released on February 24, 2013. Ruby 1.9 was released in December 2007.\r\n\r\nI think most developers would be delighted if Apple updated the bundled Ruby to version 1.9, they would be ecstatic if Apple went \"all-in\" and adopted ruby 2.0 in the next major OS Version.\r\n\r\nPlease Apple, *PLEASE* this is really a request that causes little work (have an Intern do it!) but big rewards. Goodwill from the developer community, fame, wealth, good fortune, good karmaâ€¦. and my ever lasting gratitude for having one less reason for people whine around me that you are supposedly boycotting any development language other than Objective-C."
