    description: "17-Jan-2013 07:44 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nText in \"In the Store\" view of albums is appears blurry due to excessive drop shadow when \"Use custom colors for open albums, movies, etc\" is disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Uncheck \"Use custom colors for open albums, movies, etc\" preference\r\n2. In \"Albums\" view click on an album\r\n3. Click \"In the Store\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"In the Store\" text is clear, as the text throughout iTunes is (and, oddly, is the text of track names)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBecause of drop shadow of all text from \"In the Store\" it is challenging to read song and album titles. They all take on a bit of a \"smudged\" appearance.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown. (N/A from previous major versions of iTunes)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached screenshots with a couple of examples\r\n\r\n17-Jan-2013 07:45 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-01-17 at 7.35.22 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Jan-2013 07:45 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-01-17 at 7.35.35 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n18-Jan-2013 02:43 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nThis occurs on a Mac running OS X 10.8.2.  Additional (full screen) screenshots attached. Sorry for the confusion.\r\n\r\n18-Jan-2013 02:43 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-01-18 at 2.41.49 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n18-Jan-2013 02:43 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Screen Shot 2013-01-18 at 2.42.16 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
