    description: "04-Mar-2013 03:57 PM Jonathan Felchlin:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen styles are adjusted after initial load, viewport units are being miscalculated. This is most noticeable when rotating an iPad while visiting a page which uses viewport units for layout.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the attached file in Safari on iOS 6+ and rotate the device after the page loads.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe red space should exactly fill the viewport. Scrolling should immediately reveal the white content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe width stays set at the original width. The height expands drastically, possibly to the size of the original page content.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis also happens when appending a <style /> tag after the page loads. This instance can be created by running the Modernizr javascript script after the page is loaded.\r\n\r\nModernizr bug report: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/839\r\n\r\n04-Mar-2013 03:57 PM Jonathan Felchlin:\r\n'MobileSafariTest.html' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n04-Mar-2013 04:13 PM Jonathan Felchlin:\r\nNew attachment showing adding style to the header after load, which recreates the issue without rotating the device.\r\n\r\n04-Mar-2013 04:13 PM Jonathan Felchlin:\r\n'MobileSafariTest-1.html' was successfully uploaded"
