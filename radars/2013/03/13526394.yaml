    description: "This is a duplicate of rdar://13525907\n\nSince XPC seems to be the New Hotnessâ„¢, can we have a way to use it between apps?\n\nCurrently, apps can make themselves AppleScriptable (or otherwise respond to Apple Events), and other apps can control and interrogate them by means of the Scripting Bridge. I like the Apple Events technology, but it isn't used much, partly due to it not being a very good conceptual match for a Cocoa app. \n\nIt would be brilliant if an app, as sold on the Mac App Store, could vend an XPC service, and another such app could talk to it through that service. Make it like the file open/save dialog, where a sandboxed app only gets to talk to another app's XPC service if the user selects that app from a GUI list. This would let apps easily vend APIs for control and data inspection."
