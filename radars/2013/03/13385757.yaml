    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen cycling through open windows with cmd-`, if one closes a window the order reverses.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open many, e.g. five windows in Safari (the application doesn't matter, this behavior is exactly the same in the Finder, for example).\r\n2. Hit cmd-` to cycle through the windows.\r\n3. Close one window.\r\n4. Continue to hit cmd-`. The order of the windows will reverse.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWhen one has a large number of windows to review, e.g. when one has a large number of Safari windows open and one want to \"clean up\", cycling through them when cmd-` is useful. The order is particularly useful is one wants to make a single pass at them all. However, when a window is closed, continuing with cmd-` reverses the order of the windows; one then is shown the windows that have already been reviewed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nsee above\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a - I haven't tested this on older OS's.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nnone"
