    description: "Summary: With the lack of keyboard shortcuts corresponding to the \"choose\" commands (available from the \"Action\" pop-up menu in the lower-right of the merge window, it is unduly cumbersome to actually perform a merge using FileMerge.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Initiate a comparison of two files (File > Open).  Then, make an effort to choose elements from the left and right versions so as to create the merge.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Ability to choose left or right by pressing a keyboard shortcut, much as one can navigate between differences using Cmd-Up/Down.\r\n\r\nActual Results: User must employ the mouse to physically click on the pop-up menu each time he wishes to make a choice.  (With more than one or two conflicts, this is a prohibitively arduous process.)\r\n\r\nRegression: As best as I can recall, this has always been a shortcoming of FileMerge since day one.\r\n\r\nNotes: A trivial fix that would improve usability immensely!"
