        Summary: Mail draws garbage around the parts of a mail message where data detectors have detected things that quick look can preview.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open Mail with several messages that have URL and other quick look data detector fields.
        2. Oberve that quite often, the initial paint of Mail after a reboot or quitting and reopening Mail has grey and other gabled junk drawn from outside the pane of the Mail window

        Expected Results:
        no garbage, flickering, grey rectangles and other ugly artifacts in the mail pane

        Actual Results:
        See attached video of the distortion effects as I scroll and mouse over the Mail preview window. This seems to be an often occurrence, but it certainly doesn't happen for each message - just a sometimes occurrence

        Regression:
        Seems to happen quite often on my 11 inch Air
