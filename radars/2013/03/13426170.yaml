    description: "14-Mar-2013 07:23 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen photos are added to a new page of an existing page of an iPhoto Journal on iPhoto, long page names (long enough to be condensed, but not truncated) overflow the page name/page change button in landscape.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In iPhoto, select photo and choose the share action button\r\n2. Choose Journal, then choose Selected\r\n3. Choose Journal > [Existing Journal name]\r\n4. Choose Page > New Page\r\n5. Enter page name as a long phrase, such as \"L.A. County Museum of Art\" and tap Add to Journal\r\n6. Tap \"Show\"\r\n7. Rotate the device into landscape orientation (if not in landscape already)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPage title appears as it should, condensed to fit and on the centerline of the page name button.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf photos are added in portrait orientation: page title overflows page name button and is not condensed and appears below the centerline of the button. (See IMG_1333)\r\nIf photos are added in landscape orientation: page title overflows page name button and is not condensed, but still appears along the centerline of the button. (See IMG_1328 and IMG_1329)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIMG_1328 and IMG 1329 show results when photos added in landscape orientation\r\nIMG)1333 show results when photos added in portrait orientation\r\n\r\n14-Mar-2013 07:23 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'IMG_1328.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n14-Mar-2013 07:24 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'IMG_1329.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n14-Mar-2013 07:24 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'IMG_1333.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
