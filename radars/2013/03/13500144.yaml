        Summary:
        At present, Safari/WebKit on all platforms waits until the entirety of a progressive JPEG has been received before rendering it onscreen. Regular JPEGs are re-drawn as the data arrives.

        On retina devices, it would be fantastic if the non-retina resolution image were drawn while the rest of the image arrives. I figure this would be a good compromise between file size, rendering speed, CPU time and bandwidth.
