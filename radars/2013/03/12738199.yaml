    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I choose \"iPhone Developer\" (Automatic Selection) as the code signing identity for my app, it sometimes chooses the Xcode-managed wildcard provisioning profile, instead of the profile that matches the bundle identifier. But if I choose an explicit code signing identity, then I can't check in my project file, as other members of my team probably won't have the private key for my identity in their keychains.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I need to choose an explicit provisioning profile is that the App IDs we have created in the past in the provisioning portal did not user our team identifier as the Bundle Seed ID; they used a separate seed. Since we use keychain groups so share information between our apps, all our apps must use the same bundle seed ID. However, the Xcode-managed provisioning profile doesn't use that custom bundle seed ID. As a result, any app built with the Xcode-managed profile cannot access the data in our shared keychain groups.\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions here.\r\n\r\n 1. When an automatic signing identity is selected, Xcode should look at all the provisioning profiles that it has signing keys for and choose the one whose app ID best matches the bundle identifier of the app being built. I think this is *sometimes* what is already happening, but it is not happening consistently enough for us to rely upon.\r\n 2. Let us specify the provisioning profile separately from the code signing identity. Automatic identity selection is nice, even when I want to specify an explicit provisioning profile.\r\n\r\nThese solutions are not mutually exlusive."
