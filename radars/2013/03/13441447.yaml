    description: "Summary:\r\nOften useful information is mentioned in apps descriptions and also in reviews left by customers. But neither in iTunes for the desktop/OS X nor in the AppStore app/iOS is it possible to copy any piece of text just by marking it with the mouse/finger and a simple COPY.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Just open iTunes for OS X.\r\n2) Open a description screen for ANY app\r\n3) try to copy information from the description part (text) of the screen\r\n4) switch over to the reviews section in iTunes for this app and try the same there\r\n5) No copy and/or marking of text is possible AT ALL.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI can simply mark text to be coped in the pasteboard and do anything I want with it. E.g. copying a URL and entering/pasting the URL into safari or an email.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not possible in iTunes, but it IS possible in the WWW pages of an app. So the only workaroundhere is switching over to the WWW/Safari for getting this piece of convenience. That cannot be a valid solution.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bugs me every time I start using the appstore again and again.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt is so simple. Just turn copy & paste ON for this fancy iTunes views which carry text."
