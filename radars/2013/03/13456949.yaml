    description: "19-Mar-2013 03:39 PM Nick McSpadden:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen looking at your apps in iTunes that have available updates, each app has  \"Get update\" button.  Clicking this button queues the app for download in the iTunes Downloads window.  If you click \"Get Update\" for an app that has not been downloaded yet, the \"Get Update\" button for all other apps will no longer function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nWith at least three apps that need updates already present in the iTunes library, purchase but do not download a third app.  Click \"Get Update\" for the first two apps, and see that they will queue up in the iTunes Download window.  Click \"Get Update\" for the app that has not yet been downloaded, and you will get an error message that the app has not yet been downloaded and you'll need to \"Check for available downloads from iTunes.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nClicking \"Get Update\" for the final app in the list after clicking it for the undownloaded app should continue to queue up the apps for download as normal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Get Update\" button no longer triggers a response.  It does not add apps to the queue to download until you quit iTunes and start the process over.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, all of these apps were purchased using Apple's Volume Purchasing Program."
