    description: "Summary: When registering a login helper item using the sandbox approved method of SMLoginItemSetEnabled, items do not appear under System Preferences -> Accounts -> Login Items. While I'm sure this was an intentional decision this does not yield a very good user experience. For example if an application registers with SMLoginItemSetEnabled and then causes issue with other applications. Something that is completely plausible despite the vigorous inspection of applications before they enter the Mac App Store. The user has no way to find out what applications are starting up when their computer does in order to combat the issue. While the could access the Activity Monitor and scan through the incoherent list of system processes, it is much easier for them to go to the accounts preference pane and go through the short list of items to be able to narrow down the source of the issue.\r\n\r\nAlso when the user realizes that they don't want applications like Spotify or Skype (non sandboxed and independently distributed applications) all they have to do to stop that behavior is visit the preference pane. Rather than navigating through the proprietary UI's provided by each application.\r\n\r\nAll around regardless of the fact that these items are sandboxed they should be visible and removable through the user's preference pane."
