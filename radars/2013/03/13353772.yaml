    description: "05-Mar-2013 08:17 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen viewing the Info sidebar for an event with many tagged Faces on a computer with a small screen (such as 11\" MacBook Air), the Faces and Places panels overlap, and scrolling causes graphic artifacts from the Places panel.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On a computer with a small display (or with the iPhoto window sized at an equivalent size), open iPhoto\r\n2. Open the Info sidebar\r\n3. Make sure both the Faces and Places panels are set to be visible\r\n4. Select an event with enough tagged Faces to fill 7+ lines in the Faces panel (long names, lots of faces, etc.)\r\n5. Also note that scrolling through the Faces panel (which should be possible) results in artifacts from the Places panel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFaces and/or Places panel resize to fit and scrolling through the list of Faces should be possible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe panels do not resize. Places panel overlaps the Faces panel making it impossible to see the remaining names. Scrolling in the Faces panel causes visual artifacts to appear.  Collapsing either panel (so that it is no longer overlapping) makes it impossible to have both open again until an event or photo with fewer faces is selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording demonstrating behavior is attached.\r\n\r\n05-Mar-2013 08:17 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'iPhoto Info Overlap.mov' was successfully uploaded"
