    description: "Summary:\r\nThe UIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification is not posted after an accessibility element's accessibilityLabel has been spoken. (It appears to only be posted after an announcement generated with UIAccessibilityPostNotification has been spoken.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Subclass UIView and implement the subclass's -accessibilityLabel method. Ensure it returns a non-null string.\r\n2. Add an instance of your view class to your UI\r\n3. Add an observer for the UIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification notification. Set a breakpoint inside the notification handler.\r\n4. Run the app with VoiceOver turned on and tap your view to give it focus.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVoiceOver speaks the view's accessibilityLabel, then the notification handler gets called\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe notification handler doesn't get called\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDon't know, this is the first time I've used UIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might be intended behaviour, but the documentation for UIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification imply it fires after any VoiceOver announcement has ended. e.g. \"if you listen for the notification UIAccessibilityAnnouncementDidFinishNotification, you can trigger a method to follow up the completion of VoiceOverâ€™s speech\", from http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/Accessibility/AccessibilityfromtheViewControllersPerspective.html"
