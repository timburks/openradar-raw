        Summary:
        A number of devs express frustration with simply logging into Radar.  Most times clearing cookies solves the issues, but others are never able to log in again, even on a new machine.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Attempt to log into Radar with active Apple ID

        Expected Results:
        Expected to see bug reporter main page

        Actual Results:
        Usually it works fine, but on occasion cookies that have been corrupted (somehow) prevent a successful login and the user is presented with a puzzling error message.  I would include it here but I don't have the ability to reproduce at the current time.

        Regression:
        No real way to provide reproducible results.

        Notes:
        As I mentioned clearing cookies is a usual solution, but some people still continue to have issues.
