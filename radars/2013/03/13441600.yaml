    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCurrently, a developer can specify different-sized PNGs of their app's icon for use in different places (Home screen icon, Spotlight/Settings/notification icon, etc. [1]). This means the developer can make their app icon look just right in every context it's going to be used... with one exception.\r\n\r\nWhen you put an app icon in a folder on the iPhone's Home screen, it looks like SpringBoard takes the 57x57-point Home screen icon and shrinks it down to approximately 13x13 points (substitute the respective values for the iPad's Home screen icons). Details that are visible at 57x57 become blurred at 13x13 to the point that it'd be better to not include them in the icon. The icon loses its sharpness. The effect is even more pronounced on a Retina display â€” I can see the argument that 13x13 pixels isn't enough space for a designer to create a detailed icon, but a good designer can cram a lot of detail into 26x26 pixels.\r\n\r\nLetting developers specify a PNG to use in folders would alleviate this problem.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/App-RelatedResources/App-RelatedResources.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1"
