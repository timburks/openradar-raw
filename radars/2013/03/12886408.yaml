    description: "14-Dec-2012 05:41 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn Calendar, dots beneath the date indicate there being at least one event on that day.  The days of the previous or next month also feature the indicator, except for the overlap between December and January.  Despite there being events on January 1, 2, 4, and 5, (on my device) there is no indication of those events from the month view, and in January there is no indication of events in December.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Assuming the example is December 2012/January 2013, schedule at least one event on December 30 or 31 and January 1 - 5\r\n2. Open Calendar to December in Month view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDots indicate the presence of events, as seen with every other month\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDots are not present despite events being scheduled\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlso present in 6.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n14-Dec-2012 05:41 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'IMG_0168.PNG' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n14-Dec-2012 05:42 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'IMG_0169.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
