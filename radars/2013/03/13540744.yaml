    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is currently no system status available for Game Center's Sandbox servers. When they go down or have issues it's impossible for developers to be able to tell \"is it us or is it them?\" without some sort of system status. \r\n\r\nAlso any scheduled downtime also isn't broadcast to developers who may be up late working on debugging issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Goto Apple's System Status Page http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\r\n2. Look for Game Center Sandbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect to see on this page, or similar, what the current status of the Game Center Sandbox is. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to know what the current system status of the Game Center sandbox is.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWe've never had this, but it'd save us a lot of time in the past and in the future when developing for Game Center.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease make this better."
