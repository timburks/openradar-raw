        Summary:
        Currently, when I merge an open Xcode project file through Git, Xcode collapses all the disclosure triangles in the file browser in the sidebar. This can be frustrating.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Open an Xcode project that's under version control.
        2. Have someone else add a file to the project, then commit it through Git.
        3. Pull and merge the changes in an external Git client (such as Tower).

        Expected Results:
        The changes are merged, and the new file appears in my Xcode project tool, but the expanded and contracted state of the groups in the file browser sidebar remains the same.

        Actual Results:
        The changes are merged, the new file appears in my project, but the disclosure triangles are all closed.
