    description: "In Xcode 4.x, while showing the Project Navigator in the left-hand pane, there are several switch controls at the bottom next to the search filter field.  One of these is \"show only files with source-control status\".  However, no key binding appears to be exposed for this switch.\r\n\r\nI frequently (many times a day) turn this mode on and off when switching between managing my current changeset and seeking particular files.  The only way (so far as I can tell) to toggle the mode is to physically mouse over to the icon and click on it.  That is very cumbersome, particularly when both the proj navigator (cmd-1) and search field (cmd-opt-J) can be focused via keyboard.  A shortcut for the toggle would be very welcome."
