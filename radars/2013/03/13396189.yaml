    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OSX 10.8 EventKit created all day events span an extra day in the Calendar.app Day list view.\r\n\r\n    Steps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open the attached XCode Project.\r\n2. In the file 'CJMAppDelegate.m', modify the 'NSString *calendarIdentifier' to have the UID of a calendar. (Either local or iCloud - in the notes I've added an Applescript to return the UIDs.) \r\n3. Compile and run the application.\r\n4. Open the Calendar application in day view and observe the future event list. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Expected Results:\r\nAn all day event on the current date shown in the \"Day\" view's future events list.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Actual Results:\r\nAn all day event on the current date and also the following date shown in the \"Day\" view's future events list.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Regression:\r\nAdding all day events works as expected when events are added manually in the Calendar application. \r\n\r\nThey also work as expected for all day events added by the depreciated CalCalendarStore API.\r\n\r\nUsing CalDAV to connect to Google Calendar, the event initially shows spanning 2 days, then reverts to a single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Notes:\r\n\r\n(* Applescript to return lists of calendar names and UIDs.*)\r\ntell application \"Calendar\"\r\n\tcalendars -- Needed to get around bug 10049078 that appears to be still there in OSX 10.8.\r\n\t{name, uid} of calendars\r\nend tell\r\n(* script ends *)"
