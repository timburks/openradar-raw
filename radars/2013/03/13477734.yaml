    description: "Summary:\r\nWe haven't touched our IAP code in over 1.5 years. Over the past few days, we've been getting support tickets from users about being unable to make purchases. When trying to buy a product more than once, the user received \"You've already purchased this but it hasn't been downloaded. Tap OK to download it now.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuy the same consumable product twice or more times.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe user successfully receives a product each time they buy one.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe user only receives the first product. Subsequent purchases are blocked by the error message: \"You've already purchased this but it hasn't been downloaded. Tap OK to download it now.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is sometimes reproducible in production, but always reproducible in sandbox.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe are calling finishTransaction: in all possible codepaths. Once again, this code is untouched and was working fine for a very long time. Uninstalling and reinstalling the affected app does not fix the problem. Logging out of Store on device and logging back in does not fix the problem."
