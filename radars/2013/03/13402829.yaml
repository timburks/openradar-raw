    description: "Starting in OS X 10.8, several .pc files are missing from /usr/lib/pkgconfig. These files are used by build configuration scripts that want to link against libraries included by the system.  The missing files are:\r\n\r\nlibcurl.pc\r\nlibexslt.pc\r\nlibbxml-2.0.pc\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to build any project that uses pkg-config in order to find how to link against libcurl, libexslt or libxml-2.0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\npkg-config should return compiler arguments based on the contents of the pc file.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\npkg-config returns:\r\nPackage libcurl was not found in the pkg-config search path.\r\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `libcurl.pc'\r\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\r\nNo package 'libcurl' found\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThese files were present before OS X 10.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
