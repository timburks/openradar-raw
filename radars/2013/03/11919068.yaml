    description: "20-Jul-2012 11:14 AM Jaehoon You:\r\nSummary: Before iOS 6, when user authorization in public hotspot is success and client's internet access is allowed by access point(hotspot), CaptiveNetworkSupport closes window. But starting iOS 6, CaptiveNetworkSupport leaves captive window even internet access is allowed. Instead, cancel button changes to done button.\r\nSometimes, Done button shows when disconnect from hotspot even user authorization isn't finished yet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect public Wi-Fi hotspot provided by mobile carrier or Wi-Fi provider.\r\n2. finish the user authorization.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Captive window close and return to previous window(mostly Settings app)\r\n\r\nActual Results: Captive window remain, and Cancel button changes to Done button.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: Will this change remains on release build?\r\n\r\n28-Jul-2012 03:29 PM Jaehoon You:\r\nchanging captive windows behavior seems connect to non-captive access point remembered by device when disconnect from public hotspot.\r\n\r\n17-Sep-2012 11:04 PM Jaehoon You:\r\nWhen user authorization is finished but somehow misconfigured hotspot or something is wrong, internet access is still not allowed at this moment. But CaptiveNetworkSupport thinks it allowed access to internet even I cannot connect to www.apple.com.\r\n\r\n28-Dec-2012 04:36 PM Jaehoon You:\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed."
