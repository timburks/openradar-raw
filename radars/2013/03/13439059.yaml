    description: "17-Mar-2013 10:31 PM Mark Douma:\r\nSummary:\r\nIt appears there is an issue in the NVIDIA graphics drivers in OS X 10.8.x on machines where there are multiple NVIDIA graphics cards installed. I have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 driving one display and an NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 driving another display. Other users who have seen the problem have several GT 120s. In any case, normal usage can trigger a kernel panic that has the following backtrace:\r\n\r\nSun Mar 17 16:02:55 2013\r\npanic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff8015851107): \"IOGMD: not wired for the IODMACommand\"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2050.22.13/iokit/Kernel/IOMemoryDescriptor.cpp:1424\r\nBacktrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address\r\n...... : ...... \r\n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\r\n         com.apple.NVDAResman(8.1)[A26D2A3D-C06F-3A0F-BCFF-901A98C93C3D]@0xffffff7f95cff000->0xffffff7f9600cfff\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.7.3)[1D668879-BEF8-3C58-ABFE-FAC6B3E9A292]@0xffffff7f95970000\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IONDRVSupport(2.3.7)[38C214C0-83C8-3594-8A4C-DC6AC3FEC163]@0xffffff7f95ceb000\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.3.7)[74E3E50F-E50A-3073-8C96-06F854292A91]@0xffffff7f95ca8000\r\n         com.apple.GeForce(8.1)[A15BB65E-3501-340F-87CB-2FD2BAD33E35]@0xffffff7f96a02000->0xffffff7f96acefff\r\n            dependency: com.apple.NVDAResman(8.1.0)[A26D2A3D-C06F-3A0F-BCFF-901A98C93C3D]@0xffffff7f95cff000\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IONDRVSupport(2.3.7)[38C214C0-83C8-3594-8A4C-DC6AC3FEC163]@0xffffff7f95ceb000\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.7.3)[1D668879-BEF8-3C58-ABFE-FAC6B3E9A292]@0xffffff7f95970000\r\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.3.7)[74E3E50F-E50A-3073-8C96-06F854292A91]@0xffffff7f95ca8000\r\n         com.apple.iokit.IOSurface(86.0.4)[C1007599-42D0-32FF-9F2F-C63F4E6C1DEB]@0xffffff7f966e6000->0xffffff7f966f7fff\r\n\r\nBSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nIt seems that a necessary requirement is that you have a machine like a Mac Pro that allows the installation of multiple video cards (for example, multiple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 cards each driving a display). Beyond that, it has been difficult for me to determine what triggers the panic. I guess the best I can do is to describe the state my machine was in prior to the panics. I usually have a couple of projects open in Xcode, and each project will have 10 separate windows each with a different source file, with the windows spread over 2 monitors. I also usually have maybe 10 to 30 Safari windows open and spread across 2 displays. I'll also usually have 10 to 20 Finder windows open spread across 2 displays as well. That said, the kernel panic has happened while viewing a movie in QuickTime Player 7, and while loading a web page in Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect to be able to use multiple video cards with multiple displays without experiencing kernel panics. I've been able to do so on this same machine with the same hardware in OS X 10.5.x, 10.6.x, and 10.7.x without any such issues. These panics began only after moving to Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAs mentioned, I will experience intermittent kernel panics.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs I mentioned, I never had this behavior in OS X 10.5.x, 10.6.x, or 10.7.x, but only after switching to Mountain Lion. I believe it's been happening since OS X 10.8.0 or 10.8.1, but I cannot find panic logs dating back that far (I may not have saved them elsewhere before they were purged automatically).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTo assure you that this is not just some fluke issue like \"faulty\" hardware, you can see that numerous other users, in addition to me, are experiencing the same issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19228201#19228201\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/20031392#20031392\r\n\r\nI have enclosed a system profile from the current OS X 10.8.3 (12D78) system along with the 2 most recent .panic logs. In case it can be of any help, I also have enclosed 13 additional .panic logs from previous versions of OS X 10.8.x in a folder named \"olderPanics\".\r\n\r\n\r\n17-Mar-2013 10:31 PM Mark Douma:\r\n'MacProInfoNVIDIAkernelPanic.zip' and 'MacPro.zip' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\nClosed as Duplicate of Bug ID 13424078"
