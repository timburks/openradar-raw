        Summary:

        The SecurityFoundation.framework is missing the localized names for OIDs related to Developer ID certificates.


        Steps to Reproduce:

        1) View a Developer ID Certificate with Quick Look or Keychain Access.
        2) scroll down to the bottom-most Extension
        3) Note that above the Certificate Authority Information Access there is an Extension without name


        Expected Results:

        OID 1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13 ( and other extension OIDs used for Developer ID certificates) should have a localized name


        Actual Results:

        It only shows the OID (1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13)


        Regression:

        Whoever added support for Developer ID certificates forgot to add the localized names to the OID.strings file contained in SecurityCore.framework.


        Notes:

        We believe that also the representation of the Extension data is incorrect. It currently shows "Data: 05 00" which we believe to be the ASN.1 representation of <NULL>. So instead it would probably be more accurate to either omit this line from Quick Look or replace it with "Data: Null" or "Data: None".
