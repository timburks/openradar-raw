    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen I open a Xib file, something is selected in the objects panel, but it's not *really* selected, with the inspectors showing \"hey!  No selection\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen a xib file. Say a view controller with a single object like a UIView\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe UIView is drawn selected.\r\nThe UIView is actually selected.\r\nI can manipulate the UIView without any extra work\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe UIView is drawn selected\r\nThe UIView is *not* selected\r\nI frustratedly poke around the inspectors, until I realize \"oh, this thing that's drawn selected is not selected\", and then go select it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen there forever. I figured someone is just being mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nImage attached ( http://borkware.com/hacks/selection-13422092.png ) showing the \"I just clicked a xib file\" state.  \"Mane Menu\" looks selected to me, but I can't do anything.  This is with Version 4.6 (4H127)"
