    description: "Xcode and LLVM is excellent at finding issues in code, allowing me to fix them before I compile.\r\n\r\nBut, currently if I import a system header but forget to add the framework to the project, the result is a build error that can be confusing, especially for a new developer:\r\n\r\n\"Undefined symbols for architecture i386:\r\n  \"_OBJC_CLASS_$_MKAnnotationView\", referenced from:\r\n      objc-class-ref in ViewController.o\r\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture i386\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\"\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Xcode could notice that a system header is being added to the code, and if the matching framework is not included in the project, give the user an easy way to add the framework.\r\n\r\nThis could possibly be similar to how Xcode will give project-level warnings about changing build settings to match new Xcode defaults, and give the ability to make the appropriate change."
