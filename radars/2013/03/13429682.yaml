    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the Calendar application all day events are not stacking properly and are rendering over each other. I attached some images which make the issue clearer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLook at a list of all day events in Calendar. The events were created using the EventKit API if that is relevant.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nList of events one above each other.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEvents overlaying each other in the IU, as if they had fallen to the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was pointed out to me by a user on OSX 10.8.2 and is still apparent in OSX 10.8.3. It only happens to a small number of events with no really discernible difference from those that list correctly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTwo images were included to illustrate."
