        Summary:
        In the Downloads popover, particularly when more than 10 items are present, keyboard focus is inconsistent and confusing.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Quit and restart Safari (some of these issues can differ if Safari has been running for a while).
        1. Accumulate approximately 15 items in the Safari Downloads popover.
        2. Enable Full Keyboard Access if it is not already enabled.
        3. Press Command-Option-L to display the Downloads popover.
        4. Explore the keyboard focusable elements by repeatedly pressing Tab.
        5. Scroll down, then repeatedly press Tab.

        Expected Results:
        The keyboard focus loop is consistent — somehow.

        Actual Results:
        The keyboard focus loop is confusing and inconsistent, including but not limited to:
        - If no download is highlighted, there's no indication of where keyboard focus is placed after the "Clear" button.
        - If you deselect all downloads with a Command-click, keyboard focus reverts to the list (with no visual indication), but tabbing. (In Safari 5, this isn't possible to do at all; a selection is forced.)
        - Potentially related to the above, sometimes the tab view loop gets "stuck" and won't wrap back around to the Clear button.
        - If a download past the first 10 items is selected, then it doesn't get shown when the Downloads popover is hidden and shown; nor does the scroll bar temporarily appear to indicate that the list is scrollable.
        - Sometimes you can focus the Reload/Reveal buttons for rows that aren't highlighted. Sometimes you can't.

        Regression:
        None of this happens with the Downloads window in Safari 5.
