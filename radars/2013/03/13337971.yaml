    description: "04-Mar-2013 06:22 PM Steve Harris:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe size of Finder aliases is large, often much larger than the original files.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Select a file in the Finder\r\n- Choose File > Make Alias from the menu\r\n- Choose File > Get Info to inspect the size of the created alias file\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The file size is quite small, a few kilobytes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The file size can often be measured in megabytes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI used DeRez with the -noResolve option to inspect the alias file, and most of the space appears to be taken up by an 'icns' resource."
