    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSwitching out of Music.app, changing the volume, then switching back in has the slider show the old volume, and usually blows away my ears, because it looks like it's music-volume (low) whereas it is Podcast volume (high).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Play Music using the Music.app on an iPhone 4.\r\n- Set the volume to, say, 10%.\r\n- Switch to Podcasts.app (or Downcast, or whatever other app you use for Podcasts).\r\n- Increase the Volume to, say, 50%, using the onscreen volume slider of the app, so you can understand the speakers' speech\r\n- Stop podcast playback and hit the Home button to return to the home screen because you've arrived at work.\r\n- Put your headphones back on when leaving from work and open Music.app\r\n- Note the slider shows 10%\r\n- Start playback and blow your ears away, because it is actually at 50% volume\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- When I tap Music.app, its slider should update to the current sound volume (i.e. in the example show 50%)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- As described above, the slider shows 10% although playback is actually at 50%."
