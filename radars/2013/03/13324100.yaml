    description: "01-Mar-2013 02:09 PM Fraser Speirs:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen reading a multi-touch textbook is not possible to create a text highlight that spans a page boundary.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Begin a highlight near the end of a page\r\n2. Hover your finger over the end of the test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- That there would be some way to navigate to the next page while still highlighting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- Nothing happens\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI tried creating a highlight up to the end of the page, then starting a new highlight on the first word of the next page. I had hoped that iBooks would merge the two highlights into one but this doesn't happen. Instead, I get two partial entries in the book notes."
