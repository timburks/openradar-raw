    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a Numbers document as a source for a mail merge in Pages, any text field with more than 255 characters (and no paragraph breaks) will not be copied over in the merge, resulting in a blank field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a Numbers document that has a text field with >255 characters and no paragraph breaks.\r\n* Create a new Pages document.\r\n* Link the Numbers document for use with Mail Merge.\r\n* Put the fields into the Pages document.\r\n* Perform the merge.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll records should be copied as they are in the spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nText fields that are too long are not copied (left blank).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached are two simple Numbers and Pages documents that exhibit this behavior. This has been reported in other places as well, e.g.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/11211657?messageID=11211657\r\n\r\nIn particular, please read the message dated \"Feb 18, 2010 1:38 PM\" by Yvan Koenig which lists further problems related to accented characters, however, the attached test documents do not have accented characters."
