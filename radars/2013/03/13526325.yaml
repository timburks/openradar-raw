        I'd like to request a new way of doing background processing. The app can request a wake-up at a certain date, with an API such as:

        [[UIAppliaction sharedApplication] scheduleWakeEventForDate:aDate identifier:@"anIdentifier"];

        Then, when that date rolls around, the application is woken and the following method is called on the app delegate:

        - (void)applicationDidReceiveWakeEventWithIdentifier:(NSString*)identifier;

        The app then has the usual five seconds before it is killed for being in the backgroundâ€¦ but it can of course request to run a background task in the usual way, and thus gain up to ten minutes.

        This API is designed to be similar to how geofences work. Like geofences, the app won't need to request a specific background mode in the info.plist. Like geofences, there could be a limited number of wake events scheduled at one time.
