    description: "When copying a Table from iBook Autor or Pages to the clipboard, the clipboard contents contain incorrect TIFF and PDF data, i.e. both are effectively blank. Only the RTF data is correctly representing the table.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd a table to a document of either app and copy it. Then use a clipboard viewer tool, e.g. Apple's own Clipboard Viewer.app, to look at the contents of the clipboard. You'll find that the TIFF and PDF data do not contain any valid data relating to the table.\r\nI guess that programs that prefer the PDF or TIFF data over the other clipboard contents (RTF, plain text) would also show the issue, but I can't name any. The proof, though, is any app that lets you look at the clipboard contents. Any developer will understand.\r\n\r\nI've attached example documents with a table and also attached folders that contain what the Carbon Pasteboard shows as contents. You can see that it contains the mentioned types, and you can even open them. You'll see that while the .rtf file shows the table, the .pdf and .tiff do not. But they should.\r\n\r\n(attachment: http://files.tempel.org/Various/radar_13468016.zip)"
