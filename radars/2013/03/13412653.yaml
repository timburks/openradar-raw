        Summary:
        Repeating events created in Calendar mysteriously acquire unwanted, timed alerts.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Create a weekly repeating event with alerts set to 5 minutes before and 1 minute before.

        Expected Results:
        Alerts for the event will trigger only 5 minutes before and 1 minute before the scheduled time.

        Actual Results:
        Multiple (at least two) extra alerts are triggered after the scheduled event, at apparently random times.

        Notes:
        These events are synced through iCloud.
