    description: "Summary: Documentation for CGRectGetMaxY and CGRectGetMinY is misleading.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRead the documentation for CGRectGetMaxY and CGRectGetMinY in the iOS Developer Library. The document I have is at http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGGeometry/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CGRectGetMaxY and was last updated on 2010-07-01.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe documentation for CGrectGetMinY should say:\r\n\r\n>>> Returns the y-coordinate that establishes the top edge of a rectangle.\r\n\r\nAnd the documentation for CGRectGetMaxY should say:\r\n\r\n>>> Returns the y-coordinate that establishes the bottom edge of a rectangle.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe definitions of the two functions are reversed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was probably copied from the OS X Developer Library, and because of the flipped coordinate system, it is correct there. However, since CGRects on iOS are almost exclusively used with UIKit and Core Animation, which have the origin at the upper left corner, the existing documentation is somewhere between misleading and wrong.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe it would be best to change both doc sets to express the idea of the min and max y-coordinates in a less ambiguous way."
