    description: "Summary:\r\nThrough the crash reporting in my app, I'm receiving reports of seemingly random crashes. As far as I can determine, they related to OpenGL, but I do not have any OpenGL calls in my code. I do use a map with custom annotations in one location.\r\n\r\nThe only hint I have found is that this may be related to MapKit loading a map (using OpenGL) while the app is going into the background, so I have applied the fix suggested on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12713781/occasionally-ios-6-mkmapview-crashes-in-initwithframe - but this has not resolved the problem.\r\n\r\nIt appears some users complain of this problem (e.g. <https://discussions.apple.com///thread/4471733?start=0&tstart=0> and I have also found several bug reports for other apps with this problem. However, none of them reveal a potential cause.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have been unable to reproduce this, in either the simulator or on a real device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe app should not crash.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes."
