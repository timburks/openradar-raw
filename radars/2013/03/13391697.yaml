    description: "Sometimes web sites suddenly start playing audio, e.g. Flash ads, or HTML5 video embedded somewhere. This can be really annoying, and hard to find when several windows or tabs are open, and even if it's only one window, the ad playing audio may not be obvious. Particularly when checking your e-mail or taking notes on SimpleNote during a phone call.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great help if Safari marked a tab that is playing audio with a little speaker icon (which could be clicked to mute this particular tab). That way one would at least know which individual tab to shoot down."
