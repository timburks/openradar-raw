        Summary:
        We'd like a Cocoa API for reading and writing zip archives:
        A) The iWork suite of apps have a document format based around zip archives. We'd like an easy way to achieve that same effect
        B) It would be nice to generate zip archives for export in our app too, ideally to an NSOutputStream
