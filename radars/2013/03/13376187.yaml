    description: "08-Mar-2013 12:18 AM Bob Kressin:\r\nSummary:  While working with iOS4 and iOS5, we created a product line of hardware accessories that communicated with iPads via WiFi Ad Hoc connections.  When our customers upgraded to iOS6, they lost the ability to communicate with our accessory.  We verified this; even though the iPad shows connected signal bars, and IP addresses are being assigned, a connection is never established, and the NSStream fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Setup an Ad Hoc Network.  Go to Settings.app.  Tap on Ad Hoc Network.  Do not believe the checkmark or the WiFi connection bars.  Your device is not connected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  Connection to an Ad Hoc WiFi Network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Cannot connect to an Ad Hoc WiFi Network.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:  This is openly discussed on the Internet as a real issue in many different contexts."
