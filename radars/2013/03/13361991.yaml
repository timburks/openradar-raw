    description: "Summary:\r\nThe `xcodebuild test` command doesn't work for iOS targets. You can use TEST_AFTER_BUILD=YES to run logic tests from the terminal, but this doesn't work for Application-hosted tests. There are horrible workarounds for this floating around on the internet, most of which involve modifying iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Tools/RunPlatformUnitTests, in varying fragile and incompatible ways.\r\n\r\nI just want to be able to run my application tests automatically on the build server. Please make this possible. And then show it off at WWDC so everyone will know about the right way to do things."
