    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen running the aurioTouch2 sample app unmodified on a 3rd generation\r\niPod Touch with iOS 5.1.1 (the latest supported iOS version) and a\r\nwired headset (the only way to run it since there is no built-in\r\nmicrophone), if the headset is unplugged and then plugged back in\r\nwhile the app is running, the app stops responding to sound.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload the aurioTouch2 example code.\r\n\r\nOpen the project it in XCode 4.6.\r\n\r\nIn the Build Settings, change the iOS Deployment Target to 5.0.\r\n\r\nConnect a 3rd generation iPod Touch running iOS 5.1.1 and provisioned\r\nfor development.\r\n\r\nPlug a wired headset (e.g, EarPods with Remote and Mic) into the iPod.\r\n\r\nBuild the project and run it on the iPod.\r\n\r\nVerify that the app is working correctly by speaking into the headset\r\nmicrophone and observing that the waveform display wiggles.\r\n\r\nUnplug the headset from the iPod.\r\n\r\nReplug the headset into the iPod.\r\n\r\nSpeak into the heasdset microphone again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe waveform display should wiggle as it did before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe waveform display fails to wiggle.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe older aurioTouch sample app (without the \"2\") also fails in a\r\nsimilar way.\r\n\r\nI am trying to resolve a similar problem in an app of my own, and it\r\nwould be really helpful to have some example code that actually works."
