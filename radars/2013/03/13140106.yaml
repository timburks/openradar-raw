    description: "02-Feb-2013 11:51 AM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen emoticons are disabled in Messages, messages that contain symbols that would translate to emoticons continue to appear as emoticons in the message list sidebar until the message is viewed, at which point they turn into (and remain) plain text (until Messages is restarted).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the menu bar, uncheck View > Messages > Show Smileys\r\n2. Receive an iMessage in a conversation other than the active one containing text which Messages would normally translate into an emoticon (such as \":)\")\r\n3. Note that the sidebar shows the emoticon, not the text equivalent\r\n4. Click on the conversation in the sidebar, noting that the emoticon turns into the text equivalent\r\n5. Change to another conversation\r\n6. Quit Messages\r\n7. Relaunch Messages, noting that the sidebar again shows the emoticon, not the text equivalent\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEmoticons/smileys are not displayed in message text or the sidebar when Show Smileys is disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmoticons/smileys are displayed only in the sidebar and only until the user views the message, at which point the emoticon changes to text. Restarting Messages reverts the text to being an emoticon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown for Messages, not a bug in iChat in Lion.\r\nMessages 7.0.1 (3314)\r\nNotes:\r\nScreen recording demonstrating behavior attached."
