    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nfeature request to include means of re-reading the SystemConfiguration Persistent Store and updating the SystemConfiguration Dynamic Store\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nIt has always been easy enough to adjust little details in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist, however I still have yet to discover a way to seamlessly load these changes into the Dynamic store without rebooting the computer. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to include this feature into networksetup... perhaps as: `networksetup -apply'?"
