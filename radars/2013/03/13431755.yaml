    description: "Summary:\r\nIn LLDB, if a method consists only of a single return statement, and you put a breakpoint on that return statement, then when you're stopped at that breakpoint all method arguments appear to be nil.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- (BOOL)testFoo:(NSString *)foo {\r\n  return YES; // Put a breakpoint here, run `po foo`. Note that it's nil, even when you passed something else.\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou can see the value of foo that was passed to the method\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou can't. It's nil. If you put a breakpoint on the closing brace of the method, then it works. But not on the return statement.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot sure.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSample project attached."
