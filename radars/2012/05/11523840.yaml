    description: "Summary: Picture Frame button is not always useful and generally is distracting when it is presented on the lock screen.  Generally it is possible to touch Picture Frame button in the process of unlocking the screen.  Unfortunately there is no way to remove Picture Frame button without turning Passcode Lock on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Settings => General => Passcode Lock\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Picture Frame switch is available and can be turned off, when Passcode Lock is turned off.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Picture Frame switch is available only when Passcode Lock is turned on, which is not a desired behavior as what is wanted is to remove Picture Frame button without turning Passcode Lock on."
