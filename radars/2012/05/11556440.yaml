    description: "When moving multiple files to a different volume holding the Command-Key for \"move instead of copy\", Finder stops after the first file if it is already open and thus can't be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntuitively I would expect that Finder resorts to Copy instead of Move for all open files and displays an error that the operation could not be completed. In fact, it does resort to this approach but only for the first file, then it stops the whole operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide Note: Really, the file (a PDF) shouldn't be in the open state because it has been closed after viewing it in Preview. Nevertheless, Finder complains about it, and \"lsof\" reveals that the files are still opened by Preview even though the windows have been closed. Will file this as another bug."
