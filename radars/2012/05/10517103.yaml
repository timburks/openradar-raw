    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Preview 5.5.1 (719.11) that was included with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2, PDF forms with multi-line text fields become unreadable after text is entered due to an excessively low line height causing text from different lines to overlap. \r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open any PDF document that contains a PDF form with a multi-line text field using Preview. \r\n2. Click in a multi-line text field. \r\n3. Type some text into the text field. The text must be long enough to cause word wrap or multiple lines in some other way.\r\n4. Click anywhere else in the PDF document to stop editing the text box. (The cursor should not be blinking in the text box.)\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text remains readable and the line height remains the same as it was while the text box was being edited. Different lines are not overlapping. (This was the behavior in versions of Preview included with OS X 10.6.x.)\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe line height is adjusted to somewhere around 0.5 em, causing text from the adjacent lines to overlap each other. (See screenshots in \"Notes\")\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- This bug is reproducible in all versions of Preview included with versions of OS X greater than or equal to 10.7.0. The bug was not present in OS X 10.6.x.\r\n- This bug also occurs when printing PDFs with the offending forms described in \"Steps to Reproduce.\"\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nScreenshots available here: <https://discussions.apple.com/message/16117861#16117861>"
