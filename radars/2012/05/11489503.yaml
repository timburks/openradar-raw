    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn addition to UIViewController, all new classes should get created with the private class extension defined. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new class that isn't a UIViewController\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe .m file would already have @interface <class>() @end defined at the top of the file much like UIViewController gets now\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOnly UIViewController gets this behavior.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nTo make it flexible, adding this as a checkbox on the new file dialog for a Objective-C class. Having this extension defined speeds up adding private properties defined in the class extension in the .m file."
