    description: "Summary:\r\nThe audio controls on the iOS (non-iPad) lock screen are too closely spaced together. The Music app has 150px of approximate width for each button, not including a non-responsive gutter between them which helps for wayward fingers.\r\n\r\nThe lock screen version of those controls have 115px of width with seemingly NO non-responsive spacing so 1px here or there will either pause or change tracks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlay audio in Music app and notate the width of spacing for audio controls. Then hit power button to turn off display. Hit power button to turn on display and double press the home button to bring up audio controls. See spacing is nearly 75% less.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo be able to pause music consistently.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAccidentally changing track nearly 50% of the time because of such small spacing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMy analysis\r\nhttp://adr.enal.in/weblog/28-ios-lock-screen-controls-spacing"
