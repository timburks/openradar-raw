    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen presented as a popover, a navigation controller in the master view of a split view controller has a shadow that incorrectly applies a toolbar gradient when no toolbar is present and fails to apply it when a toolbar is present. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an app from the Master-Detail template in Xcode. Select \"iPad\" for the Device Family (leave checkboxes unchecked). \r\n2. Set the background color for the detail view in the xib to Dark Gray (not necessary, but increases visibility)\r\n3. Run the app on the iPad 5.1 Simulator in portrait mode and tap the \"Master\" button\r\n4. Note the shadow at the bottom of the popover has a gradient artifact\r\n5. Now add a line \"masterNavigationController.toolbarHidden = NO;\" to the app delegate after the master navigation controller is instantiated but before it is added to the split view controller\r\n6. Re-run the app in portrait mode and tap the \"Master\" button\r\n7. The gradient artifact (which might look reasonable next to a toolbar) is gone. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe gradient effect in the shadow should either always be absent or only appear when a toolbar is present. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe gradient effect is present without a toolbar and absent with one. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
