    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTurning on automatic timezone settings either via Settings > Location Services > System Services or Settings > General > Date & Time cause the device to set itself to Denver during daylight savings time and Cupertino during standard time. The correct timezone should be Phoenix year round. This causes serious issues with calendar events, alarms, etc. as they shift to try and accommodate timezone changes when they shouldn't.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTurn on automatic timezone settings either via Settings > Location Services > System Services or Settings > General > Date & Time while in Arizona\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe timezone should be Phoenix\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe timezone is Denver during DST and Cupertino otherwise."
