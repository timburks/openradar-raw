    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter allowing Software Update to update Safari to 5.1.7, all my installed extensions disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUnknown if it is reproducible.  I allowed Software Update to update Safari, and the next time I launched Safari, I saw an error message saying that my extensions were no longer valid.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I reinstall the same extensions, they work fine with the current version of Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade, compatible extensions should continue to function, or I should be asked whether to keep them installed or discard them due to possible incompatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade, all extensions are uninstalled (\"gone\"). I have to remember what they were, find them, reinstall them, and reconfigure them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
