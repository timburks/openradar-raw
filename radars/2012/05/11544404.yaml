    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently, a NSURLConnection instance will send the connection:didReceiveData: and connectionDidFinishLoading: messages to its delegate, even if the HTTP status code is greater or equal to 400. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (RFC 2616) states that 4xx and 5xx status codes are respectively client errors and server errors.\r\n\r\nI think NSURLConnection should instead send the connection:didFailWithError: message to its delegate with an appropriate NSError of the HTTPErrorDomain. The HTTPErrorDomain should be added to the API for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot applicable. This bug report is about a suggested enhancement to the NSURLConnection API.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNSURLConnection has never sent its delegate the connection:didFailWithError: when encountering a HTTP level error.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI wrote CLURLConnection, an NSURLConnection subclass to workaround this behavior: https://github.com/0xced/CLURLConnection"
