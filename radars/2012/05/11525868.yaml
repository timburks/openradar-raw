    description: "24-May-2012 11:51 AM Joshua Hudnall:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe list of open messages in the \"Messages\" window doesn't always match the actual messages displayed in the thread view. Sometimes clicking a row will reveal the correct thread, but the list will be displaying the incorrect last message. Other times it opens the wrong thread entirely. \r\n\r\nAlso, some buddies appear multiple times even though they shouldn't (I would guess because their info is getting confused with multiple threads).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnsure. It just happens over the course of time and then fixes itself. I haven't been able to find a trigger.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nList and thread should be in sync.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey are not, as described in the summary.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a series of screen shots with an arrow superimposed to show which list row a particular thread should belong to. You'll see in the shots that the selected list row isn't always in sync with this arrow and that the last message is often wrong too.\r\n\r\n24-May-2012 12:38 PM Joshua Hudnall:\r\nDon't know how I didn't notice before, but quitting the app and relaunching fixes the problem, though I don't yet know for how long."
