    description: "Summary:\r\nThe OAuth 2.0 framework (currently http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-26) is becoming quickly a standard for authentication. Being able to leverage OAuth flow via Mac OS X frameworks would reduce the barrier to entry for application developers.\r\n\r\nThe request is to\r\n(1) support WWW-Authenticate headers containing Bearer (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-18#section-3) in CFHTTPAuthenticationCreateFromResponse\r\n(2) be able to support the OAuth request flow, including possibly authenticating Basic to the token endpoint, or allowing the user (or navigating on their behalf) to navigate to a web page to complete custom auth.\r\n(3) be able to store access tokens & refresh tokens (and their scopes) attached to a principal in the keychain\r\n(4) be able to refresh the access token from the refresh token\r\n\r\nThus, a user browsing to a site or connecting to it over WebDAV would be able to take advantage of OAuth credentials, esp. revokable tokens, rather than full credentials on every access."
