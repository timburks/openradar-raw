    description: "Summary: Holding down \"shift\" while hiding a section in an NSOutlineView source view makes the show/hide animation happen slowly. However if you shift-click it again before the animation completes, the next animation draws ontop of the currently sliding view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\nTry a Cocoa app with a source view (e.g Finder, Console), and hover over the section heading until the HIDE text appears. Shift-click it, then immediately shift-click it again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Animation toggles\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nViews overlap."
