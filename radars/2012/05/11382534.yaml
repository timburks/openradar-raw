    description: "Summary: when you have more than one monitor available you always want to utilize maximum screen space available.  Unfortunately this isn't possible with Mac OS X Lion full-screen mode because there is no possibility to view at more than one fullscreen application when you have mutliple monitors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open a fullscreen capable application on main monitor.  Open another fullscreen capable application on one of secondary monitors.  Make all of those fullscreen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  Each application occupies its own monitor when fullscreen.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Last fullscreened application moves to main monitor and obstructs all secondary monitors with grey background.\r\n\r\nRegression:  This isn't reproducible on Mac OS X Snow Leopard.  You can always use a fullscreen capable application as fullscreened on secondary monitor with Mac OS X Snow Leopard so this is definitely a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes: This also poses a major usability issue when you make an application opened on secondary monitor fullscreen.  Then it jumps to main monitor which is very distracting and there is no possibility to move it to secondary monitor at all."
