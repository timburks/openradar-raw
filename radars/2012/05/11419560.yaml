    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have a number of laptops running OS X 10.7.x which on a wifi network using Meraki access points authenticating (via WPA2 Enterprise) to an Active Directory server.  If a user's password changes in AD (due to password expiration, lost password, etc), their Mac no longer will authenticate to the network, but will not prompt for a new password.  Instead it just spins at the \"Connecting\" status.   To fix, we have to go into Network Preferences -> Advanced -> Preferred Networks, remove our network, and connect anew.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect laptop to WPA2 Enterprise network\r\n2. Change credentials on the server side\r\n3. Cause laptop to authenticate to network (sleep/wake, reboot, etc)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA prompt for a new password, similar to what I would get if I put in the wrong password while initially configuring the network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSpins on \"Connecting\" in the wifi menu forever.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDon't know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI haven't tried this on another wifi network, as I don't have access to another one using WPA2 Enterprise."
