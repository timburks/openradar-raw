    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen QuickTime Player is hidden, it is sometimes auto-terminated (Lion's Automatic Termination feature) even if it is playing a movie.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Load up your RAM so that auto-termination comes into play.\r\n1. Open a movie in QuickTime.\r\n2. Start playing the movie.\r\n3. Hide QuickTime.\r\n4. Go about your work and continue consuming memory.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie audio continues to play until the movie is finished.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe audio cuts off in the middle, and QuickTime no longer shows up in Activity Monitor (because Automatic Termination has kicked in).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPresent since Automatic Termination (i.e. 10.7.0), non-issue before that.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- QuickTime doesn't even properly recover from being auto-terminated -- it acts like it is still running, but clicking on its icon in the Dock or switching to it in the Command-Tab switcher does not bring back the app. It must be quit and then reopened.\r\n\r\n- This happens with both video and audio files."
