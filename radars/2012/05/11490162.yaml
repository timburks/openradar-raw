    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen looking at mp4 files on a Computer via the Apple TV interface, hovering over an episode does not reflect the artwork set for that episode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. On an iTunes Library that is accessible by the Apple TV you are using, set up two mp4 video files, let's call them file A and file B.\r\n2. Set the \"Show\" and \"Season Number\" attributes for both files to be the same. For example, \"Community\" for the Show and \"1\" for Season Number. The episode numbers should be different.\r\n3. Set the artwork for file A to be a jpg (it doesn't matter which jpg), set the artwork for file B to be a second, different jpg.\r\n4. Browse to the iTunes Library on the Apple TV (under Computers) and select TV Shows.\r\n5. Find the Show that you used in step 2, in my example, it's \"Community\".\r\n6. Observe results by scrolling through different episodes of that show.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEach episode for a show should use the artwork assigned to the mp4 file itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll of the episodes for a show use the artwork from the first episode of that show in the Library.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI've only used an Apple TV since version 5.0 but the bug was present in that version as well\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nFor videos ripped from DVDs to my iTunes Library, I assign a screencap of the episode as the artwork for that file as a quick visual summary of the episode."
