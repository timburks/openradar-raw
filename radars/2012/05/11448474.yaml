    description: "Summary: UITableView methods such as scrollToRowAdIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated: do not animate if called on a view in an Airplay secondary screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Build and run the provided sample application. The code is also available at https://github.com/HiddenJester/AirplayTableScrollingTest .\r\n\r\n2. Turn on Airplay mirroring in the usual fashion.\r\n\r\n3. The Airplay screen will display two tables and call scrollToRowAdIndexPath:atScrollPosition:animated: on both. The table on left has animated:YES and the table on the right has animated:NO.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth tables should scroll to the same cells. The table on the right should jump there instantly while the table on the left scrolls. NOTE: if you use a Digital AV Adapter to connect a physical screen instead of using Airplay the same view will be created and both tables scroll in this case.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe left table never changes position while the right table jumps to new positions as expected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI've confirmed this happens on an iPad running iOS 5.1 talking to an Apple TV (3rd generation) running both 5.0.1 and 5.0. It does NOT happen when using a Digital AV Adapter to directly connect the same display to the iPad's dock connector. The code does nothing to distinguish between the two cases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe code has a workaround, if you change USE_ANIMATION_WORKAROUND to be nonzero in SecondaryViewController.m. As far as I can tell any animated UITableView method has this problem, but if you animate the contentOffset directly in an animation block (via [UIView animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion]) then the animation behaves correctly both via Airplay and via a direct physical cable."
