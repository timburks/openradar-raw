    description: "Summary:\r\nDuring the renegotiation of the SSL, initiated by the server, the NSURLConnectionDelegate's methods are not called. This results in a failure when the server uses CA which is not in the system's list of trusted CAs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure a server with a self-signed CA.\r\n2. Enable SSL renegotiation on server side, and make some logic that will trigger it\r\n3. Build an iApp which will connect to this server and implement the NSURLDelegate's methods to do proper evaluation of the server certificate against the custom CA.\r\n4. Sand a request to the server which will trigger the SSL renegotiation to happen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe connection should be established.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe connection fails due to an invalid server certificate (check the notes below).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXcode 4.3.2 / iOS SDK 5.1 / iPhone 5.1 Simulator  / iPhone 4S with iOS 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhen the connection is initially established, all delegate methods are called properly.\r\nIt is in the renegotiation phase when the delegate methods are not called and the server certificate is validated against the system's CAs, which fails. If the custom CA is installed as a trusted CA on the phone, than the renegotiation is successful."
