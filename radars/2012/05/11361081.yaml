    description: "The WiFi menu extra (formerly the Airport menu extra) currently tells me whether I have WiFi enabled or disabled, and whether or not I'm connected to a network if it's enabled. It'll even tell me if there's an error connecting to the network (exclamation point icon) or if I'm only on a computer-to-computer network (grey monitor icon). What it doesn't tell me, though, is whether or not I'm connected to an ethernet network or the internet some other way.\r\n\r\nI realize that some of the other ways to get online have their own notification methods. (WWAN is the only one that springs to mind, though; the Bluetooth menu doesn't include network/internet connectivity in the icon.) But I would like to know the difference between having WiFi off but a working wired connection and WiFi off and no working wired connection; right now they look the same. (Similarly, having BOTH connections working will result in one of them being preferred, in which case I would like to see which one that is.)\r\n\r\nI guess I'm asking for a change from a WiFi status item to a Network status item."
