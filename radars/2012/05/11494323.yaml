    description: "Summary:\r\nThe bottom right and left corners of a Textured Window doesn't look good. Actually it's probably the whole \"bottom\" missing shadow that the corners have.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSimple create a new Cocoa (Mac OS X) app and change the Window from Normal to Textured.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPretty much a window (bottom) like http://diskalarm.com/img/en/window-en.png\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThat: http://cl.ly/0C1D2v1J0e2F3n3g1o1z -- See also \r\n\r\nhttp://twitter.com/StuFFmc/status/204492517541031936\r\nhttp://twitter.com/StuFFmc/status/204489338745126912\r\nhttp://twitter.com/StuFFmc/status/204489103474044930\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt used to look good, ya know? :-)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI hope this can get fixed during 10.7 -- not only for 10.8. I didn't tested under 10.6 or 10.8, but I guess it's not affecting 10.6 at least."
