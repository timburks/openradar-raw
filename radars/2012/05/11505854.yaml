    description: "Summary:\r\nI have an internal kiosk app that runs on many iPads at our company, and it runs 24/7. The app makes a call to our server every 10 minutes to pull data relevant to the app's operation (it is a calendar app that we mount on the wall outside of conference rooms). Every now and then, our networking team makes changes to the wireless network that causes the network to temporarily go down. When the network comes back up, the iPad does not jump back on the network. Sometimes it comes back on when I exit to the Home Screen, but it almost always requires me to turn the wifi off and back on, or manually selecting the network from the list. This is a serious problem for an app that needs to run all the time and is mounted in a wall bracket.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell from this having happened several times, with 15+ iPads all doing the same thing, there is something wrong in the OS that causes it not to look for wifi networks. If that can be fixed, that be awesome, as I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem. I would also be happy with the ability to toggle the wifi connection on and off programmatically via an API call. Basically let me call the same function that gets called when the user slides the wifi slider on and off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun my app, which runs 24/7.\r\nWatch it behave normally, talking to the server over the wifi connection.\r\nReboot the wireless network.\r\nWatch it break and not reconnect to the wireless network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the iPad to periodically search for the wifi network that disappeared. When/If a network becomes available, it should connect back to the network.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice does not reconnect to any wireless network.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
