    description: "Summary:\r\nAt the moment it's not possible to detect when a file copied to an app through iTunes is completely transferred rather than partially. To achieve this, please make the AFC daemon coordinate its writes using the presentation/coordination API.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up an NSFilePresenter on an app's local documents directory.\r\nWrite to that directory in code through an NSFileCoordinator. The file presenter is notified accordingly.\r\nWrite to that directory through iTunes File Sharing. The file presenter is not notified.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file presenter should be notified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file presenter is not notified.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nP.S. When are we going to get a product category called \"iOS\" rather than separate ones for \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\"?!"
