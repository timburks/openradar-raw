    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen summoning the dictionary popover using Cmd-Ctrl-D, the popover sometimes appears before the results have loaded, displaying \"No results found\". After a split second (when the lookup completes), the \"No results found\" will disappear and the popover will resize to show the actual results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Start with a fresh login, so the dictionary is not in the cache.\r\n1. Open a web page.\r\n2. Mouse over an English word.\r\n3. Press Cmd-Ctrl-D.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dictionary popover appears immediately, with the word \"Loading...\", which is then replaced by the results as they are found. If there are no results, the word \"Loading...\" is replaced by \"No results found\".\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe dictionary popover appears after a short delay, with the words \"No results found\", which is replaced a second later by the results as they are found.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot sure.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This is probably hard to trigger manually, especially on a faster or less memory-pressured computer than my four-year-old MBP. For me, it tends not to happen when I've used the popover recently (perhaps the dictionary files are being cached).\r\n\r\n- If the user has many dictionaries, or very large dictionaries, it will take a long time to verify \"No Results\" from all dictionaries. Some indication of progress (\"Loading... (no results in 3 dictionaries)\") might help there."
