    description: "I'm disappointed to discover there are no public scratch-and-sniff iOS APIs. Think of the possibilities! It's the APIs we need to push our fart apps to the next level. Smell the opportunity!\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nApple followup reply:\r\n\r\n\"We're always looking for ways to improve our products but we don' think this API will happen. ;-)\"\r\n\r\nAwww."
