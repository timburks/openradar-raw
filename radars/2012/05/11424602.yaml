    description: Please add a way to tell Xcode to recognize additional URL schemes in its comments. I see that file://, http://, and ftp:// URLs are clickable, but not blah:// or foo:// URLs. It would be handy to have clickable links in my comments that go to applications that handle custom URL schemes.
