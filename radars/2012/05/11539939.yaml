    description: "I was deploying some code that uses ARC on a machine running 10.6 today, and received an error from the dynamic linker:\r\n\r\n    Symbol not found: _objc_retain\r\n\r\n(amongst others).\r\n\r\nMy project was mostly using existing manual retainâ€“release code, with only a couple of new files using ARC. Accordingly, I had ARC disabled in the main target settings, and had selectively enabled it for the two files by adding -fobjc-arc to the per-file build settings (under Build Phases).\r\n\r\nOn a hunch, I enabled ARC in the target, and then flopped the per-file settings (removing the flag for the two files, and adding -fno-objc-arc to all the others) and no longer got the dynamic link error on 10.6.\r\n\r\nI suggest the documentation be updated to reflect this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13-Jul-2012 12:40 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nDoes this reproduce with Xcode 4.4?  Xcode should now be passing -fobjc-link-runtime to the compiler and linker, which we believe should fix this problem."
