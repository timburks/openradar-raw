    description: "Summary:\r\nThe latest version of Xcode prompts me to upgrade my entitlements to the new default DataProtectionClass of NSFileProtectionComplete -- which I would love to do -- but then won't let me run my app, complaining that the executable was signed with invalid entitlements. (0xE8008016).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError as above, with detail \"The entitlements.plist specified in your application's Code Signing Entitlements file do not match those specified in your provisioning profile\". (My provisioning profile is the automatic team one.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks!"
