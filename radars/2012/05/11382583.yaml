    description: "Summary: When you submit a new bug in Bug Reporter you sometimes need to check if Version Number was submitted with right value.  This is totally impossible as when you open submitted bug through \"My Originated Problems\" page there are no such field as \"Version Number\".  The same is for \"Is It Reproducible?\" field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Submit a new bug in Bug Reporter.  Specify a version in \"Version/Build Number\" field for it. Open it then for post-review after it was submitted either through displayed link or through \"My Originated Problems\" page.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: You are able to see values of \"Version Number\" and \"Is It Reproducible?\" fields.\r\n\r\nActual Results: This fields are hidden.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A"
