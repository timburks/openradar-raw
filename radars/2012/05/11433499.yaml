    description: "11-May-2012 08:22 PM Peter Steinberger:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4.4 (all tested versions) libarclite is *always* linked into a binary, even for static libraries that *never*  should link libarclite, as this most likely always produces linker errors later on.\r\n\r\nIn 4.3, i solved the linking problem by setting the iOS min deployment target to 5.0 to NOT link it in. This is also far from ideal, but was a doable workaround.\r\n\r\nNote that everything works great when using code as a submodule; however as I provide a commercial client this isn't a useful option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nexecute:\r\n\r\n  `xcodebuild -project PSPDFKit.xcodeproj -scheme UniversalFramework -sdk iphoneos5.1`\r\ncheck the Product folder, PSPDFKit.framework binary, contains libarclite when compiled with Xcode 4.4 but not with 4.3\r\n\r\n(or open PSPDFKit.xcodeproj and compile the framework)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo regression, no linking of libarclite.\r\n\r\nAlso, Xcode should be smart enough to not throw linker errors IF libarclite is linked multiple times.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nContact steipete@gmail.com / @steipete for more information.\r\n\r\n11-May-2012 08:25 PM Peter Steinberger:\r\n'PSPDFKit.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n11-May-2012 08:30 PM Peter Steinberger:\r\nYou'll find the binary that contains libarclite in Products/PSPDFKit.framework/Versions/A/PSPDFKit"
