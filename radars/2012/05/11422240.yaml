    description: "09-May-2012 10:35 PM Tim Burks:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nIn the iOS address book, merely touching a phone number initiates a call. This can easily be done accidentally. By making FaceTime calls so easy to accidentally start, you've made them highly discoverable but you violate user privacy by initiating unwanted FaceTime calls on our behalf. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: A confirmation dialog or other process for ensuring that starting a FaceTime confirmation is explicitly desired by the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results: See above."
