    description: "Summary: When resolving a security scoped document-based bookmark, nil is returned, with no error code\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Load attached sample app, which is sandboxed\r\n2. Update project settings to point to a valid code signing certificate\r\n3. Build and Run\r\n4. Click button \"1. Pick file\" and select any file outside the application's container from the Open Panel\r\n5. Click button \"2. Export\" and select any destination outside the app's container in the Save Panel\r\n6. Click button \"3. Import\" and select the file exported in the previous step\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe path of the URL selected in step 4 should appear in the bottom text field\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe URL doesn't resolve at all, so I display a message in the field instead\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAlso, try repeating step 6 with the check box unchecked. The URL resolves, but the location is relative to the app's container"
