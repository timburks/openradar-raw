    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen UIActionSheet displays buttons in a scrollable table view the returned button index is off by one. Presentation in a table view happens due to number of buttons, more often in portrait mode.\r\n\r\nThe bug happens when the action sheet is constructed via `initWithTitle:delegate:cancelButtonTitle:destructiveButtonTitle:otherButtonTitles:` constructor, specifying a cancel button title and no other buttons. After that, several buttons are added using `addButtonWithTitle:`\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an action sheet on an iPhone with five buttons. Hold the iPhone in portrait orientation. Show the action sheet and tap a button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet the correct button index in `actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:`\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGot the wrong button index."
