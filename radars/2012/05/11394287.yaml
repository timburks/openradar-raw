    description: "Summary:\r\nCore Data generated subclass declares method not implemented. Selector not found error at run time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI have a Core Data model with a \"List\" entity which has an ordered to-many relationship to \"ListItem\".\r\nUse XCode to generate a Managed Object subclass for the List entity.\r\nA method signature \r\n     - (void)removeListItemsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)indexes;\r\nis generated. \r\nHowever, when used it results in an unrecognized selector error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect the method to work. If its not implemented, at least don't declare it in the generated header."
