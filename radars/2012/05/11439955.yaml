    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the CFBundleName does not match the CFBundleExecutable in an iOS app's Info.plist file, everything will appear to work and it builds without warnings, but the application will not be allowed to multitask or enter the suspended state.\r\n\r\nCalls to [UIApplication beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:] will be refused with UIBackgroundTaskInvalid, and the application proceeds immediately from applicationDidEnterBackground to applicationWillTerminate.\r\n\r\nUpdating CFBundleName to match the value of CFBundleExecutable in Info.plist immediately resolved this problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI was able to reproduce it going back and forth with the mismatched keys in Info.plist.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- A mismatch between CFBundleName and CFBundleExecutable should generate a compiler warning.\r\n- Maybe multitasking should work or fail in a more informative way when such a mismatch exists, but that's up to you.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis was not a fun bug to find. I'm going to get a beer.\r\n\r\nRegression: n/a\r\n\r\nNotes:"
