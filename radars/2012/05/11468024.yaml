    description: "ummary:\r\n\r\nThe Provisioning Profile History page in the iOS Provisioning Portal sorts dates alphabetically rather than chronologically. For example, \"Aug 18, 2011\" is listed before \"Oct 20, 2010\", when in fact 2011 is after 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Log into iOS Provisioning Portal.\r\n\r\n2. Click Provisioning and then History (or go to the URL https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/provisioningprofiles/viewHistory.action)\r\n\r\n3. Click the \"Date\" field to sort by date.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nResults should be sorted chronologically\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nResults are sorted alphabetically by the date string. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n07-May-2013 12:09 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe that this issue has been resolved through changes on our side.  \r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether the issue is resolved for you by updating your bug report."
