    description: "Summary:\r\nIt should be possible to view In Case of Emergency (ICE) information from the lock screen of an iPhone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set a lock code on an iPhone.\r\n2. Lock the iPhone.\r\n3. Wait until after the codeless unlock period is over.\r\n4. Slide to unlock.\r\n5. Tap the Emergency Call button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a way to view information about designated emergency contact(s), and to get in touch with them by any means.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such feature.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been a deficiency in all versions of iOS.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt should be possible to designate one or more contacts as ICE, and to indicate their relationship to the device owner.\r\n\r\nOnce implemented, emergency response personnel should be informed that this feature exists.\r\n\r\nThis would probably be useful on all iPad and iPod Touch too."
