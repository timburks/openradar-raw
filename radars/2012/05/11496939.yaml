    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I want to file a bug against the user-facing side of iOS (for example, a problem with autocorrect) that's universal across iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch versions of iOS, there's no unified place to do it. I have to pick one of those devices from the list. I also can't file bugs against the iOS SDK in general - I have to pick iPhone SDK or iPad SDK.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to file a bug against the user-facing portions of iOS (text entry, Settings.app, Mail.app, other things that all iOS devices share in common) or against a part of the iOS SDK that is common to iPhone/iPad/iPod touch development.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be items under the \"Product\" menu in Bug Reporter for iOS and iOS SDK\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no item for iOS. Instead, I have to choose to file a bug against iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. The Mac section does not have this problem. I can file a bug against Mac OS X. I should be able to file a bug against iOS as a whole. Where there should be iOS SDK, there is iPhone SDK and iPad SDK.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis made more sense when the iPhone and iPad were separate, but since iOS 4.2 there has been parity between releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
