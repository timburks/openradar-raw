    description: "[Update] Thanks very much for your feedback.\r\nAfter much deliberation, engineering has removed this feature.\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\nIf you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with them.\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSummary: I am unable to authenticate as a BSD user defined in /etc/master.pass.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use vipw as root to edit the master.pass file and add a user on a new line such as bsduser:*:804:20::0:0:BSD User:/Users/bsduser:/bin:bash\r\nThen give the user a password as root with sudo passwd -i file bsduser\r\nWhen prompted enter a password twice (I used \"password\" for the test).\r\nThen id the user to be sure opendirectoryd is reading them correctly.\r\nTry to switch to the new user with su. (su bsduser)\r\nWhen prompted for the password, enter the previously set password.\r\nAuthentication fails.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I should be able to switch to the bsd user.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Authentication fails.  Secure.log reports:\r\nin pam_sm_authenticate(): authentication failed\r\nin pam_sm_authenticate(): OpenDirectory - User record NULL\r\nBAD SU clientadmin to bsduser on /dev/ttys000\r\n\r\nRegression:  \r\n\r\nNotes: I know in 10.6 there was an option in Directory Utility to enable directoryservice to use master.pass.  That changed an entry in /Library/Preferences/DirectoryService, but with the change to opendirectoryd, that is no longer available.  Also dscl no longer shows the /BSD/Local directory as an option.\r\n This certainly may be a \"works as expected\", but I have not been able to find that documented anywhere and quite a few others are unaware of an official changes in this area."
