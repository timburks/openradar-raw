    description: "09-May-2012 01:28 PM Karl Moskowski:\r\nSummary:\r\nXcode doesn't launch Automator.app to Debug an Automator Action project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch Xcode, create a new Automator Action project, click the Run button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAutomator.app should launch and the newly built action should be available in the list.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis used to work in Xcode 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is a problem for newly created Automator Action projects in Xcode 4, and for old projects that used to work in Xcode 3. In the latter case, Xcode 4 offers to upgrade project settings, but still renders it unrunnable.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to modify the scheme for the project.\r\n1. Under the Product menu, choose Edit Schemeâ€¦\r\n2. On the Edit Scheme sheet, Choose the Run Automator.app from the list.\r\n3. Under the Info tab, change the Executable to Automator.app.\r\n4. Under the Arguments tab, change the Expand Variables Based On option from None to your product.\r\n5. Click the + under Arguments Passed On Launch and add \r\n  -action \"$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FULL_PRODUCT_NAME)\"."
