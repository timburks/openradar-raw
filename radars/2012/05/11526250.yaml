    description: "24-May-2012 11:18 AM Justin Miller:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you start a simple HTTP server with something like netcat (`nc`) and use Lion's `ab` (Apache Benchmark) tool, it will repeatedly hammer the server with request headers, creating a Denial of Service issue. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start a simple server with `sudo nc -v -l localhost 80`\r\n2. Try to send a single request with `ab` using `ab -n 1 -c 1 http://127.0.0.1/`\r\n3. Observe the netcat window spew out repeated request headers as `ab` hammers it without mercy, despite being told to only send one request. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n`ab` should hang and/or give up after a timeout period since the server isn't responding. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt's a madhouse! \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDoesn't happen in 10.6 or other UNIX platforms. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHere's the entire contents of a diff between stock Apache 2.2.21 `ab` and Lion's version of same: https://gist.github.com/3d168bd4c29fe761c1b9 This appears to possibly reference rdar://7484748"
