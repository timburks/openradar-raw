    description: "Summary: This bug is reproducible only in Safari 5.2.  It isn't reproducible in any other browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera).  It is very annoying and involves doing unnecessary steps to open a URL\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Type a URL with whitespace in address bar, like \"last.fm/music/the beatles\", and press Enter\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Page located at the URL (\"http://last.fm/music/the%20beatles\") is opened with all whitespaces substituted with percent encoding.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Search engine page with query \"last.fm/music/the beatles\" is opened.\r\n\r\nRegression: This can't be reproduced with Safari 5.1 so this is definitely a regression."
