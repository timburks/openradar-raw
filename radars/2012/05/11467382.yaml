    description: "16-May-2012 01:34 PM \r\nSUMMARY:\r\nIn iOS 5.x Calendar on iPhone, notes that contain lines that are long and unwrappable break the layout of the Notes view, the view in which the entire note is shown.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Create a calendar event.\r\n2. Add a note to the calendar event. Make sure it contains (a) a very long and unwrappable line (I used a long URL), and (b) many lines, to force the Calendar app to give the Show All Notes option.\r\n3. Open the Event Details view for that event.\r\n4. Open the notes by tapping Show All Notes.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nThe notes display normally. Long lines that don't have any apparent places where they can be wrapped are broken arbitrarily so that the layout of the app does not break.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe long lines are not wrapped, which causes a rather ridiculous layout (see screenshots attached). \r\n\r\nThis also lets the user bounce scroll the text of the notes sideways, which is not allowed in similar views in other iOS apps.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nThis bug didn't happen on iOS 3.x. Perhaps it is caused by switching to a webview in iOS 5.x.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n16-May-2012 01:34 PM\r\n'Calendar Notes layout broken.zip' was successfully uploaded"
