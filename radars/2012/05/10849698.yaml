    description: "11-Feb-2012 08:09 PM:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\n\r\nIn Pages 4.1 (923) on Mac OS X 10.7.3 (11D50), attempting to scroll past the end of the document (bounce scrolling) causes white, rectangular artifacts to be displayed.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1. Open any document with Pages 4.1 (923). Alternatively, create a new document with Pages. \r\n2. Enter full screen. \r\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the last page in the document. \r\n4. Attempt to scroll past the last page in the document (bounce scrolling). \r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe area that is \"revealed\" by the document as it is pulled up is a uniform black.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\nWhite rectangles are displayed -- see screenshot. These rectangles flash whenever the document is scrolled.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\n\r\nOnly tested on Macs with multi-touch trackpads.\r\n\r\nPresumably, this also applies to Macs with multi-touch trackpads and mice. (Macs that support bounce scrolling.)\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Feb-2012 08:09 PM:\r\n'Pages 4.1 bounce scrolling shows artifacts.png' was successfully uploaded"
