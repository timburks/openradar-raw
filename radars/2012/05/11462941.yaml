    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation for NSMutableURLRequest doesn't state the minimum timeout for POST requests with a body on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an NSMutableURLRequest using the POST method and set a body on the object, then set the -setTimeoutInterval: method to 30 seconds. Test. After 30 seconds, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter 30 seconds, the NSMutableURLRequest object fails and returns a timed-out NSError.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 5.1.1 and below\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe documentation doesn't state that the timeout has a minimum of 240 seconds ONLY when NSMutableURLRequest is created on iOS and is being set using POST and has a message body attached.  Please either state this in the documentation, or allow us to manually set the timeout interval on POST requests.\r\n\r\nSee: https://devforums.apple.com/message/108087\r\nPosted by eskimo1 (2nd post)"
