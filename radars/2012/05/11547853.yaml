    description: "29-May-2012 10:51 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Mac OS X docs specify a format of n.n.n for LSMinimumSystemVersion (the example given there is \"10.4.0\"), but specifying \"10.7.0\" got our app rejected from the Mac App Store, and we had to go back to the end of the line and re-submit. This hurts a little bit extra because our app (net.zetetic.Strip.mac, http://getstrip.com) has already been unavailable for two weeks, since we removed it from sale due to a bug we needed to fix, and then waited for review.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen Info.plist in Xcode for your Mac App Store app, set the LSMinimumSystemVersion key to \"10.7.0\" as specified in the docs (see link) and submit your app for review.\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/general/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html\r\n\r\nThe documentation is quite specific:\r\n\r\n\"This string must be of the form n.n.n where n is a number. The first number is the major version number of the system. The second and third numbers are minor revision numbers. For example, to support Mac OS X v10.4 and later, you would set the value of this key to \"10.4.0\".\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApproval, since that's the only change, and we did it as we've been instructed. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRejected under 2.14, screenshot attached, reason given: \"The application has been set to the minimum OS to be \"10.7.0\", it should be \"10.7\"\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis has set release of our app back another week, and it's pretty clearly not our fault. Be nice if there was a way we could say, \"hey, what's the deal here?\" without having to file a bug report. The screenshot seems to indicate that this is some kind of IDE issue, but we only use Xcode. Catching the wrong fish!\r\n\r\n\r\n29-May-2012 10:51 AM William Gray:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-05-29 at 10.46.13 AM.png' was successfully uploaded"
