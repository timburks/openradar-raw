    description: "Summary:\r\nAdd notifications or enhance current ones to allow observing state of movie playback when these are loaded inside UIWebViews.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project with a single view and add a UIWebView as its subview. Programmatically request that the UIWebView loads the url: \"http://www.apple.com/ipad\"\r\n\r\nObserve the MPMoviePlayerPlaybackStateDidChangeNotification notification name.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe selector in the target that is observing the MPMoviePlayerPlaybackStateDidChangeNotification notification name is called when you tap on the \"Watch the iPad Video\" or \"Watch the TV ad\" links that play a video in the web view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTarget's selector for observed notification is never called.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
