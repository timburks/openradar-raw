    description: "17-May-2012 01:34 PM aaron Smith:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI have two computers, both with Mountain Lion installed, and both on the same wifi network. When I connect one computer to the other with vnc:// I experience significant latencies and delays.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n-Two computers on the same wifi network. (I was on 5GHz)\r\n-Go to Finder > Connect To Server:\r\n-Type in vnc://[hostname.local]\r\n-Wait and notice delays and latencies.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMuch less latency. Much less wait time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nScreen Sharing is unusable between Mountain Lion <-> Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have two computers, both with Mountain Lion installed, and both on the same wifi network. When I connect one computer to the other with vnc:// I experience a couple things:\r\n\r\n-it takes long to connect\r\n-controlling the remote computer isn't responsive. It's like what I'm doing on the remote computer takes minutes for it to recognize what I was doing. Like mouse movement, or clicks, there is significant delay.\r\n\r\nI'm using host names to connect to each other. My host name examples would be media.local, work.local, or air.local.\r\n\r\nPreviously with Lion this didn't happen. And note that when connecting a Mountain Lion computer to Lion, latencies and delays aren't there anymore."
