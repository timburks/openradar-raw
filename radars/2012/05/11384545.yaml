    description: 'Summary: Actions done upon breakpoints in the Breakpoint Navigator are not undoable. Particularly when deleting a breakpoint from the list, having an undo option would useful since the breakpoint is likely in a file you do not have currently visible. Restoring it in this case is usually hard to recollect.'
