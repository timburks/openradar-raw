    description: "Summary:\r\nOn volumes with disowned on-disk ownership, Spotlight indexing stores wrong values for kMDItemKind. Instead of the correct values, tangentially related ones (form other apps registered as handlers) are stored.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install iFlicks and MPlayerX from the App Store.\r\n2. Make sure QuickTimeX is the default handler for m4v files.\r\n3. Make sure MPlayerX is the default hander for mkv files\r\n2. Copy a m4v file from the iTunes library and an mkv file on the external drive. \r\n3. run mdls on the copied files\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nkMDItemKind of the m4v is ”Apple MPEG-4 Movie” (approximate translation, German system here)\r\nkMDItemKind of the mkv is ”“Video Media” (from MPlayerX)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nkMDItemKind of the m4v is ”Video-MPEG-4” (from iFlicks)\r\nkMDItemKind of the mkv is ”Video-DivX” (from iFlicks – technically wrong, too: iFlicks registers “Matroska-Video”)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRunning mdls on the source files (internal drive, adopted on-disk ownership) shows the correct values for kMDItemKind. Adopting ownership on the external drive, chown’ing the files and re-indexing will correct the erroneous Values. originally discussed on http://superuser.com/questions/424800/different-spotlight-kmditemkind-metadata-values-for-same-file-on-different-drive."
