    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a NSStatusItem has a custom NSView that implements NSDraggingDestination \"performDragOperation\" is never called, even though the other protocol methods are.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set a custom view that implements NSDraggingDestination as a NSStatusItem's view.\r\n2. Drag an item from a doc stack to the menu item.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAll the protocol methods should be correctly called, and performDragOperation should be called when an object is dropped on it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAll the protocol methods (\"draggingEntered\", \"draggingExited\") are correctly called except for performDragOperation. When an object is dropped on the menu item, draggingExited and draggingEnded are both called but performDragOperation is never called."
