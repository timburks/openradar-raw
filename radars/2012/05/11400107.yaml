    description: "07-May-2012 03:21 PM Jeffrey Barbose:\r\nSummary: There are some situations where apps are pushing the limits of performance in an iPad 2—memory usage and OpenGLES 2.0 implementations come to mind—where it's just not possible to produce an acceptable experience on the original iPad.  The only way to prevent an App Store customer from downloading an app on her original iPad is to require a camera.  If one's app doesn't use a camera, it creates a false expectation, which is an a unacceptable UX as well.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: n/a\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  a UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities key that would prevent original iPad owners from downloading an app so configured in the first place.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  must use \"requires still camera\" instead.\r\n\r\nRegression:  n/a\r\n\r\nNotes:  I understand the reasoning wanting the iPad to be a family and not a set of devices with their hardware specs exposed, but even now Apple touts the Retina display as a differentiator.  And when the RAM doubled in the IPad 2, you can't help but admit that Apple created new possibilities for a new class of apps that WERE NOT POSSIBLE on the original iPad.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is a recognition of that new class of apps."
