    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is inconsistent handling of image width and exif data between OS X, Safari, Mobile Safari, and other Webkit browsers. The image in question displays wider-than-tall in OS X Finder and Mobile Safari, but taller-than-wide in desktop Safari (5.1.5), other webkit, and pretty much everywhere else.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPlace an image on a webpage with tiff properties showing a portrait orientation, but exif properties showing a landscape orientation. Mobile Safari (iPhone and iPad) as well as OS X Finder will show the image in a landscape orientation. Desktop Safari, other Webkit, everything else shows the image in a portrait orientation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInconsistent behavior."
