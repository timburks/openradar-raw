    description: "26-May-2012 05:54 PM Daniel Pasco:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy is used for an NSURLRequest (the default), the frameworks use an apparently undocumented, very long-lived caching policy if expiration details are not explicitly provided by the server.\r\n\r\nIt would be very nice in this situation if a delegate method on NSURLConnection could be used to communicate to the app that it will be caching the data without server guidelines. In some cases it may be better for the application to disable caching and fetch data directly.\r\n\r\nThis would be preferable to disabling local caching through the use NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData, since that would totally ignore it when servers provide valid expiration information and could potentially result in a very large amount of server traffic.\r\n\r\nThis could conceivably be done by decorating the NSCachedURLResponse passed to the - (NSCachedURLResponse *)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection willCacheResponse:(NSCachedURLResponse *)cachedResponse with expiration information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe recently shipped an application using NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy. The server was not configured to provide expiration information in its response headers and users ended up missing time-critical events."
