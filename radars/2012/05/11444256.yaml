    description: "[ Marked as a duplicate of rdar://11232763 (Open) by Apple. ]\r\n\r\nWhen an HTTP connection is made SSL with e.g. Safari behind a corporate SSL proxy with its own certificate, the actual server certificates are marked as having an invalid issuer.\r\nI have tried with a fresh keychain for my user, and by removing crlcache.db and ocspcache.db as mentioned here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/18382755\r\n\r\n• Steps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure an SSL proxy via Network in System Preferences (at work we use a Cisco proxy: \"Application and Content Networking System Software 5.5.5\").\r\nOpen safari and go to mail.google.com.\r\n\r\n• Expected Results:\r\nNo sheet window, secure connection is made and Safari marks it as such.\r\n\r\n• Actual Results:\r\nSheet window: see attached files.\r\nWhen I go to mail.google.com I get the 'invalid certificate' sheet: the issuer certifcate 'Thawte SGC CA' is marked as valid, but for the certificate 'mail.google.com' it says: 'This certificate has an invalid issuer'.\r\n\r\n• Regression:\r\nNew bug since 10.7.4."
