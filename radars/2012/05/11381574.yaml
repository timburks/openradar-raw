    description: "Summary: Text typed in address bar disappears after a tab switch. This isn't reproducible in any other major browser (checked latest versions of Firefox and Google Chrome) and this is a major annoyance as for example you can't type partial URL then switch to another tab, copy something and then paste to the end of that partial URL in the address bar of the former tab.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Type anything in the address bar, don't press Enter.\r\n2. Switch to another tab (open new one if you don't have another tab).\r\n3. Switch back to the tab where you were typing in the address bar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: What you have typed in the address bar is restored.\r\n\r\nActual Results: What you have typed in the address bar is cleared and you have to type from scratch.\r\n\r\nRegression: I can reproduce this in Safari 5.1, so this is not a regression."
