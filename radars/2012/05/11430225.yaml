    description: "SUMMARY:\r\nCurrently, there is a 2-hour window during which bug reports must be submitted / copied into a word processor or they will be deleted. This causes lots of inconvenience for developers who want to help Apple improve its products. Apple Bug Reporter should have the ability to save drafts of bug reports for several reasons.\r\n\r\n- Collaboration is annoying. Instead of sharing a developer account, we often have to email drafts of bug reports to each other, and then at the end, someone tediously pastes things into each field on the New Problem form.\r\n\r\n- For technical problems with the APIs or developer tools, sometimes you need more than 2 hours to think about whether the problem really is on Apple's end. Offering drafts will decrease frivolous bug reports.\r\n\r\n- Increase the quality of bug reports, as developers will be able to polish them more before sending them off.\r\n\r\n- If I find a bug while I'm away from my desk, I must write it down in a separate application and save it, then transfer the information into Bug Reporter. Ideally, I should be able to save a draft using Bug Reporter's website from my iPhone with basic information about the bug, and then fill in the details when I have time. This will encourage developers to report more bugs because it is less annoying to do so, increasing the chances of finding less prevalent bugs."
