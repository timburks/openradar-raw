    description: "30-May-2012 03:28 PM Paul Goracke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen correcting a \"bare property\" typo for a property with a renamed backing ivar, the \"Fix-It\" recommendation should prefer invoking the getter/setter of the property, instead of recommending the backing ivar (which it currently does).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n1. Create a class with a property.\r\n2. Synthesize that property with a renamed backing ivar, such as \"@synthesize example = _example;\"\r\n3. Mistype the property without \"self.\" later in the code, such \"example = nil\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Fix-It\" popup from the compiler error should promote best practice of using the \"self.example\" property accessor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Fix-It\" popup suggests using \"_example\", using direct ivar access. I have renamed the ivar explicitly to avoid directly accessing it outside of specific conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30-May-2012 03:28 PM Paul Goracke:\r\n'PropertyFix-SampleProject.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n30-May-2012 03:29 PM Paul Goracke:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-05-30 at 3.16.51 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
