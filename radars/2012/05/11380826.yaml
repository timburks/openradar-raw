    description: "Summary:\r\nPressing Cmd-Ctrl-D brings up a popover showing dictionary entries for the word under the cursor. If I switch my keyboard to Dvorak, however, the shortcut still only works with my physical 'D' key, rather than the key with the 'D' character (physical key 'H').\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set the current keyboard layout to Dvorak.\r\n2. Mouse over a word in a web page in Safari.\r\n3. Press Cmd-Ctrl-D (Command key, control key, H key)\r\n4. Press Cmd-Ctrl-E (Command key, control key, D key)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe dictionary popover appears on 3. Nothing happens on 4.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens on 3. The popover appears on 4.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI don't think this has ever worked properly.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nProbably related to rdar://problem/7201724."
