    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode's \"Log Message\" breakpoint action is currently pretty useless. Doing simple logging actions like printing object descriptions as NSStrings requires jumping through needless hoops. It should be smarter. Here are a few suggestions that I'd love to see implemented:\r\n\r\n * Additional variables like %L for the breakpoint's line number in the current source file, the source file name and other similar information\r\n * More intelligent expressions â€” printing a NSObject subclass' description should be a matter of typing '@someObject@', not the convoluted '@(const char *)[(NSString*)[[someObject description] UTF8String]@' that only works some of the time\r\n\r\n As it stands, the \"Log Message\" breakpoint serves little purpose but to print out manually typed messages without any variables or smarts in them."
