    description: "Summary: When using Interface Builder inside Xcode, and holding the option key to get detailed information on the views position, and distance relative to other views, The distance will often get covered up by the resize handles on the currently selected view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a xib in interface builder. \r\n2. Place two subviews somewhat close togethers, between 10 and 20 pixels.\r\n3. Select one of the two subviews, and hold option and hover over the other to get a distance between them.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe distance should be displayed on top of the resize handles if they overlap, allowing you to read the distance between two subviews regardless of the distance between them.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe resize handles cover up the distance, making it difficult or impossible to read the distance between the two subviews."
