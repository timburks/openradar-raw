    description: "Summary:\r\nA CATiledLayer draws the same tile multiple times (mostly two times one right after the other). This creates huge drawbacks for the performance for rendering intensive apps.\r\n\r\nThis happens both for UIViews that are backed by a CATiledLayer (drawRect:) as well as for pure CATiledLayers (drawInContext:).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild & Run the attached demo app and observe the logs. This is a simple Xcode-Template (Single View) with a view backed by a CATiledLayer and a single CATiledLayer added in addition to illustrate the bug in both scenarios.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe respective drawing methods should be called once for each tile and CATiledLayer.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe drawing methods are called twice for each tile and CATiledLayer.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has been reproduced on iOS 5.1 on device supporting multithreaded rendering via CATiledLayers (ie. this is not observable on iPhone 3GS).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n'CATiledLayerDuplicateDraws.zip' was successfully uploaded"
