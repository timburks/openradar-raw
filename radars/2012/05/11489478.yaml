    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIImagePickerController alters video even when the videoQuality property is set to UIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeHigh when selecting a video from the library. This is counter to the documentation for UIImagePickerControllerQualityType which states: \r\n\r\nUIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeHigh\r\nIf recording, specifies that you want to use the highest-quality video recording supported for the active camera on the device.\r\nRecorded files are suitable for on-device playback and for wired transfer to the Desktop using Image Capture; they are likely to be too large for transfer using Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\nIf displaying a recorded movie in the image picker, specifies that you do not want to reduce the video quality of the movie.\r\n\r\nEither the class is wrong or the documentation is wrong. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Instantiate a UIImagePickerController and set videoQuality to UIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeHigh \r\n\r\n2. Present the picker\r\n\r\n3. Choose a video that's recorded at 1024 x 768\r\n\r\n4. Open that video with AVFoundation and check the frame size, it will be 640x480\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe video would remain at 1024 x 768 since the documentation states with the high setting that the video quality will no be reduced. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe video quality is reduced down from it's full resolution."
