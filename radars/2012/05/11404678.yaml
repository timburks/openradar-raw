    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen editing a document in Pages on iOS I expect to be able to open the document in another app. For example to first send it from a document management app (like Dropbox or our ELO client), edit the copy in Pages and then send it back for updating in the DMS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHave a Pages document in Dropbox. Open the Pages document via the document interaction controller in Pages. Edit it. Now try to send it back to Dropbox.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo be able to send the modified document to another app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou can only send it to WebDAV or iTunes file sharing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is a key feature for allowing people to see the iPad as a content creation device."
