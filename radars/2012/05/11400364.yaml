    description: "Summary: The keyboard shortcuts used for \"Close Window\" and \"Close Conversation\" items should be reversed, and the latter should actually be replaced. Cmd+W is the established \"Close Window\" shortcut throughout the System. Giving this shortcut the (irreversible) functionality of \"Close Conversation\" is irresponsible and dangerous (in terms of lost conversations).\r\n\r\nA miles better solution would be assigning the \"Close Window\" command the usual Cmd+W shortcut, and giving the \"Close Conversation\" command a very distinct (and also an already established) Cmd+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete) shortcut.\r\n\r\nSteps taken to close the Messages window:\r\n1. The user wants to close the Messages window quickly via keyboard\r\n2. The user presses the usual \"Close Window\" keyboard shortcut that's consistently used everywhere throughout the system: Cmd+W\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n3. The Messages window is closed, leaving all open conversations intact.\r\n4. The user carries on with their business.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n3. The conversation is closed.\r\n4. Swearing can be heard, depending on the user's mood.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInspired by lots of lost and accidentally closed conversations.\r\nAdditionally it is not possible to switch the shortcuts for these commands using the functionality built into the System — should that also be considered a bug?"
