    description: "Summary:\r\nUIMenuController always sends the action message of a UIMenuItem to the first responder, and uses the controller object as the sender, rather than the menu item. As a result, the only way for code to determine which item was tapped is to use different selectors. Among other things, this makes it entirely impossible to use a block as the action for a UIMenuItem; the methods that allow other subsystems to make use of blocks are defeated by the inability to specify a target and the passing of a generic sender to the action.\r\n\r\nThe preferred solution is to enhance UIMenuItem to take a \"target\" parameter in the style of other target/action objects (such as UIBarButtonItem). For backwards compatibility, allow a nil \"target\" to represent \"send to the first responder\".\r\n\r\nA secondary solution that does not require an API change is to pass the UIMenuItem to the action method rather than the UIMenuController. Backwards compatibility issues are minimal, as there is only one shared UIMenuController at any time, and the nature of the sender parameter to the action method is undocumented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSince UIMenuController was introduced."
