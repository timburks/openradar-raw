    description: "Summary: The voice memo app can record while multitasking but not while playing back. This is really an inconvenience. The only way to multitask while playing back recording is to lock the screen. Have a notification come in and check on it. Then it will multitask.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Voice memos.app, tap play, hit home button. Playback stops.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Playback continue after hitting home button.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Playback stops\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: The only way to multitask while playing back recording is to lock the screen. Have a notification come in and check on it. Then it will multitask. Therefore, I conclude that voice memos.app can multitask but there is bug in implementation."
