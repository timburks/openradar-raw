    description: "Summary: When user searches anything on Google, after opening the search results page the address bar shows the search query.  After changing the search query the address bar text also changes corresponding to the search query value but it still doesn't displays the actual URL of the search results page.  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Go to http://google.com (or http://images.google.com as Images search interface produces the same results) in Safari 5.2 update 4.\r\n2. Type arbitrary search query and do the search. (e.g. \"blah blah blah\") \r\n3. You'll see the page with search results.\r\n4. Select text in the address bar in copy it to clipboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Text from address bar is the URL of search results page when pasted. (e.g. \"http://www.google.com.ua/search?q=blah+blah+blah\")\r\n\r\nActual Results: Text from address bar is the search query text when pasted. (e.g. \"blah blah blah\")\r\n\r\nRegression: This isn't reproducible with Safari 5.1 so this is definitely a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes: Please note that this isn't reproducible when instant search is turned on in Google Search settings"
