    description: "Summary:\r\nAs the Big Nerd Ranch highlighted on their blog, there is a major 'gotcha' with ARC and the UIColor class. This is major enough that it should be highlighted in the ARC documentation.\r\n\r\nThe blog post from BNR is here: http://weblog.bignerdranch.com/296-arc-gotcha-unexpectedly-short-lifetimes/\r\n\r\nIn short, there is a problem in this code running under ARC:\r\n\r\nGColorRef color = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.2 green:0.3 blue:0.4 alpha:1.0].CGColor;\r\n[[self.view layer] setBackgroundColor:color];\r\n\r\nIt crashes. I'm sure experienced programmers that understand ARC semantics can see why, but new developers won't see the problem. Not only that, but this kind of code is *very* common, as creating CGColorRefs directly is more difficult than creating UIColors.\r\n\r\nThis could even be added to the Clang static analyzer as a mistake (\"referencing an unretained property of an autoreleased object may crash\"), but that's really a separate issue."
