    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen downloading files, Safari sometimes erroneously removes entries from download history that were successfully downloaded.  This happens when triggering a new download and usually removes the previous download history item.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Download file 1\r\n2. Wait until file 1 is complete\r\n3. Download file 2\r\n4. Wait until file 2 is complete (might not be required)\r\n5. Open download history popover\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDownload history popover should have the top 2 items be file 2 and then file 1.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly file 2 is at the top, then nothing or older files.  File 1 is no longer in the list but it still is in Downloads folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have been happening for quite a few versions of Safari."
