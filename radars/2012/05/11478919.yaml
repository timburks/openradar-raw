    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf I have a NSManagedObjectContext that's the child of another MOC and I ask for a permanent ID for an MO that has a relationship to another MO, the app will crash when I try to save the MOC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project and run it on the device or simulator. (http://cl.ly/3z250P2s3B1r3Z1W2C3o)\r\n2. Create a new MO with the \"+\" button.\r\n3. Go into the detail view for the MO just created.\r\n4. Tap the Do Work button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome new MOs are created on a child MOC and saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash when saving the MOC.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf you tap the Other Work button, the app doesn't crash because it creates permanent IDs for both MOs."
