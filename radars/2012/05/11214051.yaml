    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe class reference for -[UIApplication sendEvent:] says:\r\n\r\n\"Subclasses may override this method to intercept incoming events for inspection and special dispatching. iOS calls this method for public events only.\"\r\n\r\nThis is great, but the second sentence is not really true. There are events that are sent to this method that are not truly public with the class UIInternalEvent. There is no documentation on how to inspect or dispatch these events.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSubclass UIApplication and override sendEvent: with an NSLog and a call to the superclass's sendEvent:.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA stream of events with all sorts of nice details for inspection and special dispatch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA stream of events, some of which are opaque UIInternalEvent objects which cannot be inspected or dispatched other than passing unaltered to the superclass;\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUnless I don't understand what is meant by \"public events\", I would assume that any event arriving at sendEvent: can be inspected and used as the developer sees fit.\r\n\r\nI would like a way to inspect the contents of these UIInternalEvents, or have that opaque class replaced with a well defined and documented event class that we can inspect."
