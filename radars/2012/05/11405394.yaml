    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA CALayer is associated with a NSView, and gets a rotation animation.\r\n\r\nIf the view which contains the NSView does not use a layer too, the NSView's layer rotates according to its anchorPoint as expected.\r\nHowever, if the parent view uses a backing layer, the anchorPoint is not taken into account, and the layer rotates around the bottom left corner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe layer rotates around anchorPoint in both cases.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe layer rotates around the bottom left corner.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTried on OS 10.6: same bug.\r\nI tried to switch between SDK 10.6 and 10.7."
