    description: "25-May-2012 09:09 AM John Siracusa:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI have a 13\" MacBookAir4,2 attached to a Thunderbolt Display.  The Thunderbolt Display is connected to Ethernet, an external FireWire 800 drive (powered down), and an Apple aluminum extended keyboard.  After upgrading to Mac OS X 10.7.4, I get a kernel panic if I leave the machine idle for a while.  This did not happen with any earlier version of Mac OS X 10.7.x, which this Mac has been running since July without incident.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect a  13\" MacBookAir4,2 running Mac OS X 10.7.4 to a Thunderbolt Display.\r\n\r\n2. Connect the following devices to the ports on the back of the Thunderbolt display: an Apple extended aluminum keyboard, an Ethernet cable (live, connected to an AirPort Extreme base station), and an external FireWire 800 hard drive enclosure (powered down).\r\n\r\n3. Wait a few hours (or, often, less).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo kernel panic.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nKernel panic (see attached reports).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have since disconnected everything from the Thunderbolt Display *except* the Thunderbolt cable running to the MacBook Air, and the kernel panics seem to have stopped.  BUT, I'm still getting many, many lines like this in my kernel log:\r\n\r\nMay 25 09:02:12 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration begin ]\r\nMay 25 09:02:12 Airheart kernel[0]: PCI configuration changed (bridge=5079 device=374 cardbus=0)\r\nMay 25 09:02:12 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration end, bridges 8 devices 14 ]\r\nMay 25 09:02:47 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration begin ]\r\nMay 25 09:02:47 Airheart kernel[0]: PCI configuration changed (bridge=5081 device=374 cardbus=0)\r\nMay 25 09:02:47 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration end, bridges 8 devices 14 ]\r\nMay 25 09:03:47 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration begin ]\r\nMay 25 09:03:47 Airheart kernel[0]: PCI configuration changed (bridge=5083 device=374 cardbus=0)\r\nMay 25 09:03:47 Airheart kernel[0]: [ PCI configuration end, bridges 8 devices 14 ]\r\n\r\n\r\n25-May-2012 09:09 AM John Siracusa:\r\n'Kernel_2012-05-25-010709_Airheart.panic' and 'MacBook Air.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-May-2012 09:10 AM John Siracusa:\r\n'Kernel_2012-05-24-080621_Airheart.panic' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-May-2012 09:10 AM John Siracusa:\r\n'Kernel_2012-05-25-001602_Airheart.panic' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n25-May-2012 09:10 AM John Siracusa:\r\n'Kernel_2012-05-24-075207_Airheart.panic' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n26-May-2012 11:14 AM John Siracusa:\r\nReverting to 10.7.3 eliminates this problem.\r\n\r\n26-May-2012 11:32 AM John Siracusa:\r\nCorrection: reverting to 10.7.3 does NOT eliminate this problem."
