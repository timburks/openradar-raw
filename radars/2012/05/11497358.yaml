    description: "Summary: Ending a sentence with 'admin' doesn't auto-capitalize the start of the next sentence.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType a sentence into an auto-capitalizing text field like an email. End it with the word 'admin'. Sample keystrokes:\r\n\r\nH\r\ni\r\n[space]\r\na\r\nd\r\nm\r\ni\r\nn\r\n[space][space]\r\nw\r\no\r\nr\r\nd\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe text should read, \"Hi admin. Word\", because double tapping [space] should add a period, a space, and auto-enable the Shift key for the start of the next sentence.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe text reads: \"Hi admin. word\" with a lowercase 'w'. The 'w' is not auto-capitalized.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this is because 'admin' is considered an abbreviation, but it seems to be in common enough usage that this should be considered a bug. I've tested this on two iPhones and an iPad running iOS 5.1.1, but I couldn't file a bug on \"iOS\" (see rdar://11496939) so I flied this under iPhone"
