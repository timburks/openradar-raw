    description: "Summary: Web apps cannot play audio in the background. Audio stops after switching tasks in iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1) Navigate to a web page with Mobile Safari.\r\n2) Save that web page to iOS home screen.\r\n3) Open that new web app\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The audio should continue playing in the web app in the background.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The audio fades and ends.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm a front end developer at a major public media organization with 10s of millions of listeners each week. \r\nWe have rewritten our audio player with HTML5 and Javascript to create a universal player that will work across a wide range of desktop and mobile devices. We would like to offer this player as a quicker alternative to our native apps by presenting users with the option to save our live streaming player to their home screens. The current behavior is impractical if the web app cannot continue playing audio in the background when the user switches to another task. \r\nI should note that the streaming audio player works wonderfully in MobileSafari testing. This is the only hitch in the system that will prevent us from marketing the player as a web app."
