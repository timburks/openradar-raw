    description: "Gesture recognisers are awesome. But if you try to use a complex set of them in the same view hierarchy, often you run into problems where you have a certain gesture being captured by a certain recogniser, and you just want to forward that gesture to another view (for the view to respond to with its own gesture recogniser).\r\n\r\nI haven't really thought through exactly how it would work. Perhaps it's as simple as allowing the target of a UIGestureRecognizer, in its action method, to call [gestureRecognizer forceGestureRecognizerToFail]. When that is called, the gesture recogniser switches to a failed state, with the implications that any other gesture recogniser that had been set to requireGestureRecognizerToFail: would then get a chance to respond to that gesture."
