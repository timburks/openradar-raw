    description: "Summary:\r\nThe NSOpenPanel docs[1] state that setting setResolvesAliases:NO does not resolve aliases. Whilst this is true if the alias is the leaf it does not apply when the node is in the path. The same behaviour is seen for symlinks, I can only conclude that this is either an error in the document or an error in the implementation.\r\n \r\n[1] https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSOpenPanel_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSOpenPanel/resolvesAliases \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a NSOpenPanel setting setResolvesAliases:NO open a file with either an alias or symlink in it's path.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe symlink path\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe actual path before the leaf\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
