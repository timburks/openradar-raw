    description: "16-May-2012 01:39 PM\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nWhen an app's description has lines that are long and considered unwrappable by the system, the layout of the App Store breaks.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open an app with a long description.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS & ACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nTo hell with it, just look at the screenshot. The very long line goes off the screen, causing a white band and allowing the view to scroll horizontally (not correct).\r\n\r\n16-May-2012 01:39 PM\r\n'IMG_7214.PNG' was successfully uploaded"
