    description: "Summary: User isn't able to delete whole album or artist from iPad Music application with horizontal swipe.  Deletion only by track is available.  It is very annoying because when there is no free space left on an iPad user will need to clean up Music track by track.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Artist or Album view in iPad Music application, do a horizontal swipe on artist or album.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \"Delete\" button appears on album or artist icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \"Delete\" button doesn't appear neither on artist nor on album icon.\r\n\r\nRegression: I'm not sure if this was possible on previous iOS version on iPad but this bug is certainly absent on iPhone Music application where horizontal swipes on Artist or Album row in list view provide \"delete\" button without any problem."
