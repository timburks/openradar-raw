    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen playing a video with multiple audio tracks with AVPlayer, if you set the rate, only one of the audio tracks will change to that rate. So, for instance, if you have 1 video track and two audio tracks on a .mov file, then set the rate on the player to 2.0, the video track and 1 audio track will proceed at 2x speed while the other audio track continues at 1x speed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a video file with 1 video and 2 audio tracks.\r\n2. Create an AVPlayer object to play said file.\r\n3. Play the AVPlayer\r\n4. Set the rate on the AVPlayer, for instance to 2.0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video and audio all speed up to the 2.0 rate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video and one audio track speed up to the 2.0 rate, but the other audio track proceeds to play slower at the 1.0 rate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe submitted sample project includes a video file with 2 audio tracks. This one was created using Ecamm's Call Recorder for Skype, which records 1 audio track for each party on the Skype call. I presume there are lots of ways to get media with multiple audio tracks, but that's how I created this particular file.\r\n\r\nAlso, while my primary testing of this bug was on Lion, I did test this on Mountain Lion DP3 and the bug is present there as well."
