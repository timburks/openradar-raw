    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I select a location on the iOS 6b4 Maps app and share that location, e.g. via iMessage (to myself) and try to open it, the Maps app will open, it will put the address on the search field, but will show an alert saying \"No Results Found\". If I then touch the search field and press Search, the location will be correctly shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Maps app on iOS6b4.\r\nSelect a location, either by dropping a pin or choosing your current location.\r\nTap the disclosure button.\r\nTap Share Location.\r\nSelect Message.\r\nSend the message to yourself.\r\nGo to the Messages app.\r\nTap on the new Location object.\r\nTap on the map url.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Map app opens, the address will be on the search field and the location will be displayed on the map with a pin.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Map app will open, the address will be on the search field and a popup alert will say No Results Found.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI tested this on an iPhone 4 with iOS6b4 in Portuguese and in English, with links created and opened on both languages.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems the problem is just the Maps app trying to search in a different way than with the search field.\r\nIf I open the url via Safari, the same behavior happens."
