    description: "Summary: 'SightBook' app by DigiSight Technologies is compatible with and can be downloaded to and run on an iPad 2 running iOS 6.0.1, but the app cannot be found via a search in the App Store app, despite having been available in the iTunes store for many months. The search works on iPhone/iPad running 5.1.1 or 6.0.1 and I believe it worked on iPad 2 running 5.1.1 -- it just doesn't work on iPad 2 as of iOS 6.0.1. As a result the app can only be downloaded to the device initially via iTunes on Mac/PC while the device is tethered or via the app's iTunes URL (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sightbook/id468016180) in Safari on the device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOn iPad 2 running iOS 6.0.1:\r\n - open the App Store app\r\n - in the search area type \"sightbook\"\r\n - touch \"All results for sightbook\"\r\n - search results are 'No Results for \"sightbook\"'\r\n - touch the \"iPhone Apps\" button at the top of the app\r\n - search results are also 'No Results for \"sightbook\"'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iTunes page for the SightBook app should appear in the App Store app after searching for it and allow the user to download and install the app on the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe App Store app shows 'No Results for \"sight book\"' for both the 'iPad Apps' tab and the 'iPhone Apps' tab.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe that the App Store app was able to find the SightBook app prior to the release of iOS 6.0.\r\n\r\nNotes: This same problem occurs with other apps, including all apps from Hawk iMedia -- they cannot be find via search in the App Store app, but they can be downloaded via tethered iTunes or via Safari URL."
