    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an Xcode project is closed with it's toolbar hidden, upon reopening the project, the toolbar is always hidden regardless of whether it's subsequently shown again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Hide the toolbar, and everything but the editor in a new Xcode project;\r\n2. Close the window;\r\n3. Re-open the window;\r\n4. Show the toolbar again;\r\n5. Close the project;\r\n6. Reopen the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe toolbar is visible, as that was the state I left it in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe toolbar is hidden.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe toolbar state can only be reset by deleting the xcuserdata folders within the project."
