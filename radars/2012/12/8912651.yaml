Unfortunately, however, apps that allow users to play DRM-ed content (e.g., \"old\" songs within a user's iTunes song library) can only resort to the MPMusicPlayerController. This controller does not allow \"in-flight' modification of the playback queue - playback must be paused and resumed for queue updates to be applied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project that mimics my app's currently functionality (not the look & feel) - it's a split view controller whose master view is the contents of your library.  Tapping on the table row adds it to the queue.  Playback begins with the initial selection.  Rudimentary playback controls are also provided.  \r\n\r\n1) Start with an iPad containing assets of the Song media type.\r\n2) If necessary, edit the Info.plist to account for my developer Bundle ID\r\n3) Launch the app.\r\n4) Tap the first song - the \"last tapped\" field will update and playback will begin immediately.\r\n5) Tap a second song - notice the stutter mentioned as my \"new\" (second) approach.\r\n6) If you'd like to see how my first approach failed, uncomment the line in nowPlayingItemChanged: and comment out the reference to the preceding method (syncQueueWithPlaylist).  Tap one song to begin playback. Add a second song and observe that the first song repeats.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAdding songs to the current playback queue (playlist) should be possible without interrupting playback. This behavior would benefit apps leveraging MPMusicPlayerController and even the iPod app itself.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn the attached sample project, [JukeboxEngine syncQueueWithPlaylist] is the method that evinces the \"stutter\"?  This is fairly similar to what's noted in the iPod Library Access Guide, and evinces a stutter when updating the playlist during playback.\r\n\r\nAfter filing a DTS ticket, I was told that \"According to the MPMusicPlayer engineering team any queue changes you make will take effect when calling the -play method after setting a new playback queue and not during playback. You should be pausing queued playback between queue updates since changes are looked for after queue playback has stopped.\r\n\r\nThe preceding account suggest that you have to pause & play for the queue to be updated. In either case, audio playback is interrupted.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n(None)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor additional detail, please see DTS ticket 133268490. DTS encouraged the submission of this ticket. Thank you for your time and consideration."
