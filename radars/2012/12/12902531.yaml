    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a user goes into wi-fi settings and enables a manual proxy, the status bar on the device should change color to indicate a proxy is in use.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Tap Settings.app\r\n2. Tap Wi-Fi\r\n3. Tap the blue arrow in the cell for the wi-fi network you're connected to.\r\n4. Scroll to the bottom\r\n5. Under HTTP Proxy, tap Manual.\r\n6. Enter an IP address for a proxy server\r\n7. Enter the port for the proxy server\r\n8. Press home button\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStatus bar would be colored (red?) to show user that the proxy is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatus bar stays normal color, ensuring that the next day when you come into work and try to use your phone, you'll forget that you enabled proxy settings and you'll no longer have a proxy running, and you'll wonder why nothing is working.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnother possibility would be to add an icon to the status bar like the VPN or tethering icons that appear when those are enabled. Proxies are frequently used in development for debugging purposes and with multiples devices it's easy to forget to disable the proxy on one and run into issues later as a result, without immediately realizing the problem."
