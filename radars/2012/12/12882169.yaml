    description: "Summary:\r\nMany of the new Bluetooth LE classes are missing from the documentation. I cannot find any for iOS or Mac OS X. Protocols like CBPeripheralManagerDelegate. Classes like CBATTRequest. And enums like CBATTError. I have to look in the header files for the information I need. The header file documentation is not always helpful. For example, when should I return certain errors in respondToRequest:withResult: and what exactly is CBATTErrorUnlikelyError?\r\n\r\nSome samples on how to use this would be nice. \r\n\r\nThis makes developing new features that use Bluetooth LE difficult. At WWDC one of the new features touted in iOS 6 was the ability to use an iOS device in central mode. Trying to actually develop this is currently very much trial and error. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSearch for information on CBPeripheralManagerDelegate, CBATTRequest, or CBATTError. Either on the web or in the Organizer Documentation. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect to find plenty of information about my search results. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe only result is: iOS 5.1 to iOS 6.0 API Differences\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee summary. Developing an app where a phone is in central mode is very difficult right now (for a newbie to Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE)."
