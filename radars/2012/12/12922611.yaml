    description: "It is a royal annoyance that Xcode and Keychain Access cannot properly handle having multiple certificates in the same keychain at the same time that both have \"3rd Party Mac Developer Installer\" or \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application\". This is helpfully, but far too non-obviously called out in the documentation.\r\n\r\nHowever, for anyone who is only multiple teams, or who has previously expired certificates for these entries it means that Xcode throws errors their way with completely non-obvious instructions on how to fix the situation, such as the errors mentioned in <rdar://problem/12922600>\r\n\r\nIt's high time that Xcode got a more robust way to deal with the keychain instead of all this brittle prefix searching shenanigans. Please provide more robust team, certificate, and signing support and take the guessing games out of this."
