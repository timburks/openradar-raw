Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, set Full Keyboard Access to All Controls. (Assumes you're using Mountain Lion, those titles might be different on older OS versions).\r\n2. Open iTunes 11, start playing a track, switch to MiniPlayer\r\n3. With iTunes as the active app, press the Tab key to cycle keyboard focus through the various visible controls (Previous track -> Pause -> Next track -> Airplay -> Up Next -> Search)\r\n4. If you leave the focus on any of Previous Track, Pause, Next Track or Airplay, the controls remain visible when you mouse out of the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPlayer switches to showing current artist and track name on mouse-out\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPlayer leaves controls visible on mouse-out\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
