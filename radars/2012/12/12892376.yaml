    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nCLGeocoder returns unpredictable results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download the Apple Sample Code project named GeocoderDemo and run it - either in the iOS Simulator with a fabricated location or on-device.\r\n\r\n2. Enter a location prefix (e.g., \"San\").\r\n\r\n3. Tap \"Geocode String\" and observe the result(s).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would have expected either of the following to occur:\r\n (a) review multiple candidate results (e.g., San Antonio, San Diego, San Jose)\r\n (b) view the single closest result to my current location (e.g., San Antonio)\r\n\r\nSpecifying a Hint Region within said app does not appear to help.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nReturned \"San\" in the country of Mali. This might be an exact match for the unbounded search, but it's also returned when a hint region of 100.0 km is specified.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n(None)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIn fairness, the completion block -\r\ntypedef void (^CLGeocodeCompletionHandler)(NSArray *placemark, NSError *error);\r\n- for both \r\ngeocodeAddressString:completionHandler:\r\nand\r\ngeocodeAddressString:inRegion:completionHandler:\r\nstates that \"For most geocoding requests, this array should contain only one entry.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems logical that the single result might be closest to the user's current location, or at least to that of the specified hint region. That does not appear to be the case.\r\n\r\nThis was initiated via DTS Incident #244549677.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
