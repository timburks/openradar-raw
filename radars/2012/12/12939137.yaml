    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen there many downloads (e.g. songs) in the download queue sometimes downloading of one song get stuck. Since the iPhone loads several songs in parallel this should not be a problem. But it seems that the stuck download blocks other downloads. This way it's taking ages to downlaod 1000 songs from itunes match! I want to do this to be prepared for some days without WLAN access. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is: When I pause the stuck download, the queue starts to load the other songs until another song get stuck. After unpause the stock download, the queue stops downloading other songs again. \r\n\r\nSee my screenshots:\r\n\r\n1.) unpaused but stuck download => the queue seems to do nothing (Song \"Sleep\" is stuck, the song \"Middle Man\" also waits at 1MB downloaded)\r\n2.) pausend the stuck download => other files are downloaded and processed (I configured my phone to transform the songs to 128 AAC). The stuck download \"Sleep\" is paused and the downlaod of \"Middle Man\" starts getting data again. \r\n3.) Downloading then run \"in full pace\" for a while until there is another stuck download, which sadly happens very fast (after about 10 or 20 downloads)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHave a steady download an retry stuck downloads later. No stuck downloads would be the best, but I could live with 10 not downloaded Songs, if the other 2000 are downloaded in a proper time."
