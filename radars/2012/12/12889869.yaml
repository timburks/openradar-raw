    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen setting an attributedText on a UITextView the text is rendered with Kerning disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a simple attributed string, e.g. \"AV\" in Times New Roman with 50 px font size\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen setting this attributed string on a UITextView it should display the text with Kerning, as is the default when rendering this text via CoreText. For the example \"AV\" the right bottom of the A is overlapping the left top of the V.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLetters do not overlap making the text harder to read. Especially if using UITextView to display a longer text for reading it is bad to have Kerning disabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSupport for NSAttributedText is new as of iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nInternally UITextView converts the attributed string to HTML via NSHTMLWriter and then displays it in a UIWebDocumentView. The default mode for this is to have Kerning disabled.\r\n\r\nIt can be enabled by the CSS style, which is mentioned at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning\r\n\r\ntext-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving this not be the default also confuses developer, as you can see on this question on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13239267/kerning-in-ios-uitextview\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose that when text is set via setAttributedText on UITextView to make this setting the default since as a developer we would expect the output to match CoreText as closely as possible."
