    description: "01-Dec-2012 04:22 PM Sebastiaan van Stijn:\r\nSummary:\r\nEditing track-title in the artist-view causes other tracks to be modified as well if the artist has multiple albums\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOnly the selected track to be updated\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll tracks with the same 'track number' appear to be modified\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Select 'artist view' in iTunes and pick an artist with multiple albums\r\n(see screenshot1.png)\r\n- Select a track and double click it to play\r\n--> other tracks with the same track-number will get the 'now playing' icon\r\n(see screenshot2.png)\r\n- Modify the title of the selected track and press enter to update\r\n--> other tracks with the same track-number seem to be updated as well!\r\n(screenshot3)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAt first I was shocked to see this happening, thought I had overwritten the other track's information, but after checking this in another view of iTunes, it seems this is only a error in the *presentation* of the information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01-Dec-2012 04:22 PM Sebastiaan van Stijn:\r\n'Screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded"
