    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe ability to hide unused built-in apps should be added to Settings.app. Much like how the Nike+ app can be hidden, the rest of the built in apps should also have this option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Try to hide an unused app, such as Compass.app\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Setting in Settings.app to hide Compass.app (as merely an example)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. No setting to hide Compass.app\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nThe exceptions to this I could see would be Mail, Safari, Contacts and Calendar. But I think all the other apps should be able to be hidden by the user. They just add clutter."
