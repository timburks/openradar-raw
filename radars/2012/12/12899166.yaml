    description: "Summary:\n\nVia it's delegate, AMWorkflowController obtains a reference to a related NSDocument instance (this is not documented, but that's another issueâ€¦). \n\n- (void)updateChangeCount:(NSDocumentChangeType)change is correctly called when an action is added/removed/etc., but not when the properties of an action are altered (eg. changing the text in a prompt the user type action etc.)\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create an AMWorkflow object\n2. Create an AMWorkflowController and AMWorkflowView (in my case, in a nib file)\n3. Assign a delegate to AMWorkflowController which, in response to the - document method, returns an instance of a subclass of NSDocument.\n4. Using these objects/ui, create and save a workflow\n5. Alter a parameter of any action\n\nExpected Results:\n\nThe change indicator on the window should change.\n\nActual Results:\n\nThe change indicator on the window is not changed (and proven that updateChangeCount is not called on the document).\n\nRegression:\n\nNone known.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Proven that the indicator does change when actions/added/removed (and updateChangeCount is called)\n2. In the Automator app the change indicator does update correctly, so the actions are obviously indicating changes somehow."
