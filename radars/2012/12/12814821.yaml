    description: "If the mapView is zoomed out, transitioning from MKUserTrackingModeNone to MKUserTrackingModeFollow zooms in the map. This does not happen if the mapView is already zoomed to some degree.\r\n\r\nThis is an unwanted side effect because it renders the tracking mode feature useless for apps that want to control the visible region of the map. There's no switch to disable this behavior and it is entirely undocumented.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also: rdar://9921109"
