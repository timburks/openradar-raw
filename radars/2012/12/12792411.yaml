    description: "Summary:\r\nMail.app Undo Paste Image removes image, but still sends image with the message. Since the image isn't visible anymore, there is no way to remove the image from the message.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Photos app, select any photo and Copy.\r\n2. Open Mail.app, compose a new message\r\n3. Paste the image using the pop-up menu.\r\n4. Shake to undo paste (the image is no longer in the composition window, as expected).\r\n5. Address the message and send\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail.app sends the message without the image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail.app pops up the \"This message is xxxMB. You can reduce message size by scaling the image to one of the sizes belowâ€¦\".\r\n\r\nWhen sent, the receiver of the message can view the image, though it doesn't appear inline with the text of the message. It is attached to the end.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn Step 4, if you use the delete key to delete the image instead, you get the Expected Results -- no image is sent with the message."
