    description: "Summary:\r\nUIPageViewController's viewControllers resetting some time after previous calls to setViewControllers: and subsequent first (since application start) call to spineLocationForInterfaceOrientation:, resulting in the controller's showing the starting page of the model, regardless of the state before rotation.\r\n\r\nProblem is present in Apple sample code as well.\r\n\r\nDescription\t\r\n- (UIPageViewControllerSpineLocation)pageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController\r\nspineLocationForInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)orientation is called first time upon application launch with the correct view controller set in -viewDidLoad or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter the interface rotation, spineLocationForInterfaceOrientation: is called again, with the pageViewController instance's viewControllers array reset to whatever the initial state was. This happens in both landscape and portrait as starting positions, but only once per application run.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project using the Page-Based Application template. Build for iOS 6, run on device or simulator in any orientation.\r\n\r\nOn application start, January appears. Swipe/tap to get to March. Then rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMarch or March/April appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nJanuary or January/February appears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nBug not present in iOS 5.1."
