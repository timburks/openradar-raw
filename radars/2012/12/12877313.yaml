    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a font and colour theme that has a dark background, the debugger's line highlight does not adapt and as a result the text it's highlighting is difficult to read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Select a font and colour theme that has a black or dark background;\r\n2. Set a breakpoint somewhere in your code;\r\n3. Run the project, and trigger the breakpoint.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe line highlight colour adapts so that whatever is highlighted is still readable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe line highlight colour is too light for the light coloured text, and it becomes difficult to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis seems to have been a problem for at least a few major Xcode releases now.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nExample: http://cl.ly/image/1p0A2m1d2E2X"
