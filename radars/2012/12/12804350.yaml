    description: "- Create an NSTextField that is editable, set to \"Wraps\" and is tall enough to hold multiple lines in IB.\r\n- Write more text into it than will fit.\r\n- Select the text by dragging down from the top.\r\n- The overflowed text is scrolled into view\r\n- Use the scroll view to scroll back up\r\n\r\nEXPECTED:\r\n- Text field should scroll back up, like every scrolling area\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULT:\r\n- Nothing happens. The only way to get back to the top of my text is to drag another selection up."
