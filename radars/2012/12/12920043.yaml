        Summary:
        Notes.app doesn't display images that I've pasted into Notes.app on Mountain Lion in Notes that get synched between devices. Only a paperclip icon (probably meaning “attachment” is shown.)

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Open Notes.app on Mountain Lion. Create a new note with text and paste an image in there as well. The image is shown in the note on the Mac just fine.
        Open Notes.app on iOS and wait a moment for the note to sync to your iOS device. Display the just created note on the iOS device.

        Expected Results:
        Images shown in the Mac version of Notes.app should also be displayed in the iOS version.

        Actual Results:
        Images are replaced with a generic paperclip icon.
