        Summary:

        The public documentation for AMWorkflowView documents the following two essential methods:

        - (void)setWorkflowController:(AMWorkflowController *)workflowController
        - (AMWorkflowController *)workflowController;

        Without which it cannot work correctly. The header AMWorkflowView.h in the Automator framework does not include those methods.

        Notes:

        Using KVO for the property provides an effective workaround.
