    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems here. First, GameCenter shows more notifications than specified in setting. I have my GameCenter notifications set to only show the most recent 5 items, but the GameCenter section of the Notification Center has all the notifications I've received since the last time I've cleared them. \r\n\r\nWorse, as I clear them *more* *older* items are displayed and have to be cleared.\r\n\r\nSecond, there's no way for an app to clear its \"your turn\" notification from the GameCenter notification list.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install a GameCenter game that has turn-based notifications (i.e. Letterpress or Lost Cities)\r\n\r\n2. Start a bunch of games with friends\r\n\r\n3. Get a lot of notifications\r\n\r\n4. Play those turns in the games\r\n\r\n5. Repeat a few times\r\n\r\n6. Look at Notification Center\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. GameCenter turn notifications cleared\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Every turn notification since the last time things were cleared\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nAs an addition, it would be nice to add API that would allow and app to clear its specific turn notifications."
