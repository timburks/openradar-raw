    description: "Summary:\r\nThe iPad App Store search function will not display iPhone apps if no iPad apps match your query; the button to do so appears but is inoperative.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start App Store on iPad.\r\n2. Search for Principalm.\r\n3. No results appear. So tap \"iPhone Apps\" at top of screen.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTapping iPhone Apps should show iPhone apps.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTapping iPhone Apps does nothing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- This bug only affects iPhone applications, not universal applications. A couple hours ago, my app Rubrix was also iPhone only and exhibited this bug. Since releasing an iPad update in the store, Rubrix now appears in searches.\r\n- In order for this bug to appear, the search query must match *NO* iPad applications. For example, searching for Denominations returns an iPad result for Oxford Dictionary. As a result, the iPhone Apps tab works and shows Denominations.\r\n- This is a new bug in iOS 6."
