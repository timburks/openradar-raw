    description: "Summary:\r\nKVO is basically an implementation of a piece of technology created as a joke, the \"COME FROM\". It's stringly typed and should be replaced with a type-safe flow-based extension to the runtime, preferably, or at least to Foundation.\r\n\r\nFor more information on flow-based environments, please see the following book:\r\n\r\nFlow-based Programming, 2nd. Edition.\r\nISBN-10: 1451542321\r\nISBN-13: 978-1451542325"
