    description: "CoreMotion's deviceMotion.attitude API reports inaccurate device orientation, when device flatly lays on the desk. Pitch and yaw error is ~0.1 rad, which translates to ~5 degrees. Though this happens ONLY when UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer API is also used for tracking accelerometer data. If I remove sharedAccelerometer delegate registration code deviceMotion.attitude accuracy improves by more than 10x times, leaving pitch and yaw errors to be less than ~0.5 degrees.\r\n\r\nSo far I was able to reproduce this problem on iPhone 5 and iPad Mini running iOS 6.0.\r\nSuccessful problem reproduction slightly depends on framerate at which deviceMotion data is queried or application main loop is updated. Sometimes going from 30 fps to 60 fps or vice versa makes problem go away."
