    description: "13-Dec-2012 03:35 PM Phillip Jordan:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn an iPhoto \"Big Date\" Calendar Project, if you edit the text for a specific day, delete that text, and import a calendar in which that day is a significant day (holiday), the day in the iPhoto Calendar stays permanently blank and unhighlighted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a \"Big Date\" calendar project in iPhoto.\r\n- Edit the label for e.g. a known holiday such as 25th Dec.\r\n- Change your mind and delete the label.\r\n- Import a calendar which is known to contain the day in question as a holiday, e.g. UK national holidays\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The day should be displayed as a holiday as per the imported calendar\r\n- The font colour should change to the highlight (holiday) colour\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Notice the day is still displayed empty\r\n- The default colour is used (not highlighted)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis bug has been around for a few years now.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDeleting the label from a day should reset it back to defaults. Instead, the KHProjectJournalEntry table in the iPhoto Library's Projects.db contains multiple records for that day, including a blank one, and it appears only one of them is actually used.\r\n\r\nAs a work-around, manually locating and deleting the blank KHProjectJournalEntry record using the sqlite3 command line interface gives the calendar-imported entry priority, and the day is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nAnother work-around is to delete the whole calendar and start from scratch, avoiding manual editing of day labels.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour is extremely confusing and work-around 1 is beyond the capabilities of most users, and work-around 2 is extremely time-consuming."
