    description: "Summary:\r\nIn \"TV Shows / Unwatched\", episodes are sorted in a crazy order. In \"TV Shows / Shows\" and \"TV Shows / Genres\", View Options is broken or unimplemented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to TV Shows / Unwatched and select a show with multiple seasons present in the library (or iCloud).\r\n2. Look at the episode list.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEpisodes should be sorted by season and then by episode number, or grouped by season.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEpisodes are sorted by episode number, and not sorted or grouped by season. In other words: all first episodes, then all second episodes, then all third episodes, etc. (See attached annotated screenshot.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis view is new in iTunes 11, and the bug has been present since 11.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdditionally, selecting a Sort By field in the View Options window for Unwatched has no effect, and the available options don't really pertain to TV shows. It does seem to have an effect in the \"Shows\" and \"Genres\" tabs, but instead of actually sorting by the chosen fields it just duplicates entries in the grid view (though the duplicates inexplicably have a different text color when expanded). It's as though someone forgot to implement sorting of TV shows anywhere but in List view."
