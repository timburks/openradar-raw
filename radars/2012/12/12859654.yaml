    description: "When my Mac's CPU usage is high, the Notification Pane \"flashes\" the on/off button very quickly (1/4 second) during open animation.\r\n\r\nI was running an app that was using 50% of my CPU, and it showed almost every time I opened the Notification pane. It only shows for a 1/4 second.\r\n\r\nDuring screen recording it show almost all the time, and for longer time span.\r\n\r\nI'm using a Late 2009 13\" Mac Book Pro with 8GB RAM.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Utilize a lot of CPU\r\n2) Open Notification pane while empty\r\n3) You will see the on/off toggle button (which normally appears at the top of the pane) show for 1/4 second.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also attached a video of the problem happening on my mac book pro.\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/6444360/Notification%20Pane%20Flash.mov"
