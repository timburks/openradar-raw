    description: "Xcode 4.x features the best conflict resolution tool that I have every used. It's clearest UI and its inline editing capabilities make solving git-pull conflicts a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nI would like to submit a feature request for a standalone mergetool with the feature-set of Xcode 4.x merge component that shows when there is a conflict.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use this tool from the Terminal by invoking 'git mergetool'. This would be very useful for complex merge, rebase or cherry-picking operations that are not directly supported within Xcode.\r\n\r\nSee this question I submitted to apple.stackexchange for additional information:\r\n- http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22392/how-to-use-xcode-4-mergetool-in-a-standalone-fashion\r\n\r\nThank you."
