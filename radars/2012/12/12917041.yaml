    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen you try to take a picture for file upload on a \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" website (opened from your Home Screen), screen rotation behaves unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Open a website with the \"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" meta tag and a file type input in Safari on iOS (see attached demo file).\r\n2) Add the site to your Home Screen (tap the Share button, tap \"Add to Home Screen\" and tap \"Add\").\r\n3) Make sure Rotation Lock is disabled (using the side switch or via the button in the multitasking bar).\r\n4) Open the site by tapping the icon on your Home Screen.\r\n5) Tap the file type input and choose \"Take Photo or Video\".\r\n6) Rotate your iPad to another orientation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n7) Screen rotates according to the orientation of the device.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n7) Screen doesn't rotate according to the orientation of the device. You end up with rotated or cropped image. Try experimenting with different rotations and starting orientations (e.g., loading the website initially in portrait or landscape). The results will be weird.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem occurs on my iPad WiFi + 4G (3rd gen.) and iPad mini, both on iOS 6.0 and 6.0.1. The problem does not occur on my iPhone 5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAttached is a basic HTML file which can be used to reproduce the problem. You could also load it directly from my web server (I'll leave it there for a while): **REMOVED**."
