    description: "There is -[NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:] and -[NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:selector:object:]. But -[NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:selector:] is missing.\r\n\r\nThis would be useful if there are multiple delayed requests with different selectors running and one would like to cancel just a specific one. The additional restriction that -cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:selector:object: imposes, namely that the object of the previous request must be known, makes it rather useless in most situations. One would need to store the object in an ivar just to be able to cancel it later on. Sounds complicated."
