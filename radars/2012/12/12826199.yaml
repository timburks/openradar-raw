    description: "06-Dec-2012 11:31 AM John Marstall:\r\nSummary:\r\nOn September 12, 2012, I deleted my entire Messages transcripts archive. For a while, searching transcripts within the app worked well. Lately, performing any search within the app hangs Messages with a beachball animation while it queries the transcripts.\r\n\r\nThese same searches are instantaneous when executed via a Spotlight search.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAcquire a sufficiently large Messages transcript archive. For me, right now, that's a 4-month archive of 36.6MB.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearching transcripts should be as fast and responsive as when executed via Spotlight search.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMessages becomes unresponsive and must be force quit."
