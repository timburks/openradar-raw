    description: "10-Jun-2011 11:00 AM Steven Baranski:\r\nSummary:\r\nUIPageViewController is a terrific new feature of iOS 5, but not all types of view controllers adopt the \"page curl\" look & feel used by periodicals. Request an additional transition style that mimics flipping of rigid bodies (ala Flipboard), or the ability to specify interstitial transitions for use with said controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThe new PageViewController is a great component; it offers one page transition style at the moment. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWould like the ability to either inject new transition styles or seek an \"official\" ï£¿-supported transition for same.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n(see above)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n(none - new component)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAt WWDC this week, I visited the Core Animation lab seeking assistance polishing the look & feel of the page turn effect used in my app StereoMatic (available for iPad in the App Store). I was advised that I could simply adopt the PageViewController offered in iOS 5 to achieve the results I was seeking. Given the long lines, I accepted this as fact and went on my way. After investing this further, it appears that only one transition style is currently available for \r\n\r\nI recognize that you all are very busy, and I really appreciate the work you do. If it's not possible to add support for this type of transition, is it possible to create transitions for use with this view controller?  can you advise me so that can open DTS, hire a subcontractor to finish the effect, etc.?\r\n\r\nPS: Thanks for a great conference!"
