    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe UIActivityViewController does not allow (or at least honor) a title. This can be particularly helpful if there are more than one type of content worthy of sharing. For example, a restaurant review app might allow you to:\r\n1) Share your location (e.g., FB, Twitter, email, SMS)\r\n2) Invite a Friend (email, SMS)\r\n3) Share a Photo (FB, Twitter)\r\n\r\nEach of these intents might have overlapping activities. Once the controller view has been presented, it would be useful to affirm the user's choice for clarity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen the attached project and run it. Juxtapose the behavior of the explicit UIActionSheet presentation versus that of the UIActivityViewController. A few common approaches were taken in an attempt to present a title.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe UIActivityViewController should have a title.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNote that the manually instantiated UIActionSheet presented has a title. The UIActionSheet presented by the UIActivityViewController does not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n(None)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis was initiated as DTS Incident #243076529. Thanks!"
