    description: "This error text reported by the Organizer is confusing and unactionable: http://d.pr/i/vsoP/3EbmTWle\r\n\r\nIt states that a identity[1] is valid, but a \"package identify\"[2] has expired[3]. It does not give any indication what the real problem is, how to fix it, or what went awry.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n[1] What is this \"identity\" you speak of? I deal with developer and application certificates and provisioning profiles. Perhaps you could use a term that actually maps to things that are used in the development process.\r\n[2] What is a \"package identity\"? Does it have any relation to the other identity? How does this change or impact what I need to do to fix this situation?\r\n[3] OK great, it expired. What exactly is expired? Where did it expire? Where can I find this expired thing and fix it? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem here is that I had multiple certificates, some of which were old and expired, in my keychain for \"3rd Party Mac Application\" and \"3rd Party Mac Installer\". My signing certificate and my provisioning profiles were all up to date. This error text did nothing to help me figure this and made the problem even more opaque.\r\n\r\nThis text should be changed to be more intelligible to real people."
