    description: "12-Oct-2012 10:35 AM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nNew mail notifications are displayed even when Mail is in the foreground and remain even after the message is marked as read.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. With Mail open and in the foreground, receive a new mail message.\r\n2. Notification appears in the upper right hand corner\r\n3. Click on the message in Mail.  The notification does not go away.\r\n4. When the notification dismisses itself, it slides off to the right like it would if it were still pending, even though it is not visible in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNotification not displayed or notification disappears when message is selected.  Should fade out, not slide off \"into\" Notification Center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNotification displayed even after a message is selected and read, then dismisses itself as if it were still pending in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n24-Oct-2012 08:59 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'Notif_bug.mov' was successfully uploaded"
