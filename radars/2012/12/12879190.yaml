    description: "We have a versioned Core Data model file, using XML serialization:\r\n\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library2_1.xcdatamodel/\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library2_1.xcdatamodel/contents\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library2_2.xcdatamodel/\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library2_2.xcdatamodel/contents\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library3.xcdatamodel/\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library3.xcdatamodel/contents\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library3_prev.xcdatamodel/\r\nLibrary/Library.xcdatamodeld/Library3_prev.xcdatamodel/contents\r\n\r\nWhen the 'contents' file changes outside of Xcode (typically through a source control operation, e.g. 'git pull'), Xcode often doesn't realize that the .xcdatamodel bundle itself needs recompiling. Touching the bundle sometimes seems to dirty it, but not always. (When this happens, the symptoms are typically \"selector not recognized\" when accessing altered managed properties.)\r\n\r\nThe only reliable way I've found to get the model re-compiled is to remove the .momd from the build directory, or clean the whole project."
