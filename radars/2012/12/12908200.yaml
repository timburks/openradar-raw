    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIncomplete phrasings of searches for common cross-streets come back with 'No Results Found', or make a decidedly wrong guess at what the input means.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch for 'SE 39 & Hawthorne, Portland, OR' and 'MLK & Alberta, Portland, OR'.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSearch 1 should find SE 39th & Hawthorne (http://goo.gl/maps/l5hxU); search 2 should find NE MLK & Alberta (http://goo.gl/maps/m5dhW)â€”both are significant intersections in the city.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n'No Results Found'.\r\n\r\nSearch 1 will give the correct results if adjusted to 'SE 39th & Hawthorne, Portland, OR' (note the 'th'). Search 2 still doesn't work for 'MLK Blvd & Alberta, Portland, OR', but 'Martin Luther King Jr Blvd & Alberta, Portland, OR' does work.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, Google has no problem handling either search."
