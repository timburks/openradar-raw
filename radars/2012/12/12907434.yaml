    description: "iOS 6 includes many new emoji, but it could always use more. I am therefore requesting an official Gangnam Style emoji in the style of a man wearing a blue tuxedo doing the horse dance. Right now we can sort of fake it with \U0001F434\U0001F46F. (horse + dancing girls, in case RadarWeb doesn't pick that up), but a proper emoji for Gangnam Style would be better."
