    description: "18-Dec-2012 02:46 PM Jim Roepcke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nNormally one can drag and drop an image from the media library onto a UIView in a xib to create a new UIImageView with that image. However, if the xib is loaded into the Assistant Editor rather than the Standard Editor, UIViews will not accept the image drop from the Media Library.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open a xib with a UIView in the assistant editor.\r\n- Open the Media Library in the Utilities pane.\r\n- Drag an image from the Media Library.\r\n- Drop the image onto the UIView in the xib.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- A new UIImageView with the dropped image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n- The dropped image recedes back to the media library, and no new UIImageView was created.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Drag and drop works fine if the xib is loaded in the standard editor instead of the assistant editor.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
