    description: "29-Nov-2012 02:17 PM Robert Willmore:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen scrolling through a field in the iTunes Store in iTunes 11, it is impossible to scroll back after scrolling to the end of a field without removing fingers from the trackpad and beginning a new scrolling gesture.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the iTunes Store mouse over a scrollable field (such as \"New Music\" at the top of the homepage)\r\n2. Scroll over to the end of content\r\n3. Without removing fingers from trackpad, scroll back in the opposite direction (towards the beginning of the content)\r\n4. Watch as the field does not scroll back\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nField will scroll back from far/hidden end of content when directed to by scrolling on trackpad\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnce the further/hidden end of content is reached in a scrolling field, the field will not scroll back until a new scrolling gesture is initiated by removing fingers from trackpad and scrolling again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was not a problem in the iTunes Store in previous versions of iTunes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn the attached video I try to scroll through a field on the iTunes Store homepage.  The periods at the extreme end of field I try several times to swipe back, trying to scroll back to see previous content.  I am unable to scroll back until I lift my fingers from the trackpad and begin a new scrolling gesture.\r\n\r\n29-Nov-2012 02:17 PM Robert Willmore:\r\n'iTunes 11 Scrolling Bug.mov' was successfully uploaded"
