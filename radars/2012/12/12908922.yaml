        Summary:
        Xcode understands comments starting with TODO:, FIXME:, and a few other special strings. It can display those items in the method selector dropdown above an editor.

        This feature would be much, much more useful if there were some kind of browser for these items, like the Issue Navigator is for errors and warnings.

        As it stands, I litter my code with warnings for things I'd like to remind myself or other developers of. Surely this is not an ideal solution. But otherwise, TODO: items stay almost invisible unless actively searched for.
