    description: "03-Dec-2012 05:52 PM Mattias Wadman:\r\nSummary:\r\nI've tracked down a use after dealloc crash when using ARC and the release build configuration (debug seems to work fine). The problem happens when creating an object inside a if-scope with a non-constant condition, assigning it to a variable from outside the scope, and then only reference the variable using Objective-C array or dictionary literals.\r\n\r\nSee my stackoverflow question for reproduction case and more details:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13687509/object-created-inside-scope-dealloced-even-when-used-outside-scope\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee stackoverflow link.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nobject is dealloced\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
