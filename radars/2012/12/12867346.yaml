    description: "12-Dec-2012 02:51 PM John Brayton:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe NSUserNotificationAlertStyle can be set to \"banner\" or \"alert\" in the Info.plist file for an app.  Please consider allowing the alert style to be different for individual notifications delivered by the same app.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, I have a Google account backup app that requires the customer's Google username and password.  The password could become invalid at any time, and I need to alert my customer when that happens.  It is very important that my customers see this notification; therefore \"alert\" seems like the right notification type.\r\n\r\nI also allow customers to buy functionality with in-app purchase.  A banner-style NSUserNotification seems like a great way to thank my customers for their purchase.  Being required to click on a \"thank you\" notification is just annoying; I would rather risk the customer not seeing that notification.\r\n\r\nSince the NSUserNotificationAlertStyle is global for the app, I have to choose either the banner style or the alert style for all notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Write an app that delivers two NSUserNotifications.\r\n2.  Try to make one of those notifications a banner, and the other an alert.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully make one of those notifications a banner, and the other an alert.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nYou can't.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThank you."
