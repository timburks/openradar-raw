    description: "11-Dec-2012 11:47 AM Paul Goracke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMultitasking has been a boon to iOS apps. The ability to complete syncing to a remote server after the user has changed away from the app has been incredibly beneficial. Sometimes, though, completing that sync is not possible because the user is making changes while he or she does not have network access.\r\n\r\nThe ability to register for a background notification to be received when the device has regained network access would further help to make an iOS app \"fire and forget\" and \"always on and in touch\". I'd envision this could be implemented by passing a block to execute on reconnection, but it would probably be more full-featured to add this as a variant of -applicationDidBecomeActive: while UIApplicationStateBackground. Registering for this callback while network is available might possibly be rejected as an indication that the app should utilize normal \"continue in the background\" multitasking."
