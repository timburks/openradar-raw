    description: "Summary: iOS Needs a mechanism that lets people block numbers \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Receive a call or multiple calls from a number you want to block\r\n2. look in iOS for a way to block the number\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect to be able to block number in iOS on the received call listing or in the contact list so my phone never rings. This blocking could be temporary or permanent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such controls exist, you continue to get annoying calls from spammers or sources you wish to block either temporarily or permanently to no end. Depending on the source iOS may not let you do anything with the source you wish to block at all. You are helpless to do anything to block said source with an iPhone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
