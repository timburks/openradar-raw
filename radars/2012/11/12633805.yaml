    description: "05-Nov-2012 11:04 AM Ilja Iwas:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe CoreLocation API in iOS 6 snaps the user's GSP location to the next known road, once he or she travels above a certain speed on a valid road unknown the iOS 6 maps database.\r\n\r\nThis produces GPS tracks unusable for cyclist needing accurate data, e.g people using training apps like Strava.\r\n\r\nAn API for client apps to opt out of \"Snap To Road\" is needed, that provides them with the same data as on iOS 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGet on a bike, start any GPS recording app on your iPhone running iOS 6. Look for a bike lane unknown to iOS 6 maps that runs in parallel 60 feet away from to a road known to iOS ( there a plenty of those in my area). Watch your GPS position snap to the road, even though your GPS coordinates seemed to pretty accurate.\r\n \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI blogged about this here: http://ilquest.com/2012/11/02/ios-6-is-unusable-for-people-relying-on-accurate-gps-tracks/"
