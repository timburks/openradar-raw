    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to unlock the computer after sleep (and possibly screensaver), the unlock dialog intermittently refuses to unlock the computer.\r\n\r\nThere's no \"invalid password shake\" or error message - I am able to enter my password fine, but when I press enter or click the little arrow for \"log in\", nothing happens except the contents of the password field getting selected. Pressing \"escape\" or clicking the \"Cancel\" button does nothing - it stays on the unlock screen. Waiting for 10 minutes does nothing.\r\n\r\nOnly way to get in seems to be to do a hard shutdown via a long press on the power button.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Sleep (or lock?) computer\r\n2. Attempt to unlock\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Machine should unlock or tell me I'm entering the wrong password\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Nothing\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Did not experience these issues on 10.7\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAccount is a \"managed\" mobile account (admin) on the machine with an associated apple id (using AD integration). I've attached a log of lines from the log at the time of the failed logins - similar entries occur each time.\r\n\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.259 AM WindowServer[94]: CGXSetWindowBackgroundBlurRadius: Invalid window 0xffffffff\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.260 AM loginwindow[70]: find_shared_window: WID -1\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.260 AM loginwindow[70]: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid window 0xffffffff\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.260 AM loginwindow[70]: find_shared_window: WID -1\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.260 AM loginwindow[70]: CGSSetWindowTags: Invalid window 0xffffffff\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.268 AM coreservicesd[31]: Application App:\"loginwindow\" [ 0x0/0x1001]  @ 0x0x7fcefa42fa60 tried to be brought forward, but isn't in fPermittedFrontASNs ( ( ASN:0x0-0x80080:) ), so denying.\r\n11/21/12 11:39:40.268 AM WindowServer[94]: [cps/setfront] Failed setting the front application to loginwindow, psn 0x0-0x1001, securitySessionID=0x186a4, err=-13066"
