    description: "06-Nov-2012 06:08 PM Josh Avant:\r\nSummary:\r\nA parent Xcode project cannot control which Build Configuration to use when building Xcode subprojects.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a parent project's Build Configuration name doesn't match any of the subproject's Build Configuration names, the subproject will default to the Build Configuration setting in the 'Use XXXXX for command-line builds' dropdown (located in the Project's Info window, beneath the Configurations table).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic when a parent project has different Build Configurations from its subprojects and decreases modularity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create one project that will serve as the parent Xcode project (for example, Foo).\r\n\r\n2. Create a second project that will serve as the subproject (for example, Bar).\r\n\r\n3. Open Bar.xcodeproj in Xcode.\r\n\r\n4. In Bar's Project settings, add a target for a 'Cocoa Touch Static Library'.\r\n\r\n5. Close Bar and open Foo.xcodeproj.\r\n\r\n6. Drag Bar.xcodeproj into Foo to add Bar as a subproject.\r\n\r\n7. In Foo's project settings -> 'Foo' target -> Build Phases -> Target Dependencies, click the + and add Bar's static library.\r\n\r\n8. In Foo's project settings -> 'Foo' target -> Build Phases -> Add Build Phase -> Add Run Script, add the following script:\r\necho \"${CONFIGURATION}\" > ~/Desktop/parent_configuration\r\n\r\n9. In Bar's project settings -> static library target -> Build Phases -> Add Build Phase -> Add Run Script, add the following script:\r\necho \"${CONFIGURATION}\" > ~/Desktop/subproject_configuration\r\n\r\n10. Build Foo with the 'Debug' Build Configuration.\r\n\r\n11. Note the contents of these files:\r\n~/Desktop/parent_configuration\r\n~/Desktop/subproject_configuration\r\n(this will be referred to as Result Set 1).\r\n\r\n12. In Foo's project settings -> 'Foo' project -> Configurations table, rename 'Debug' to 'NewConfig'.\r\n\r\n13. Note the contents of these files:\r\n~/Desktop/parent_configuration\r\n~/Desktop/subproject_configuration\r\n(this will be referred to as Result Set 2).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBoth files (parent_configuration and subproject_configuration) contain the CONFIGURATION build setting, identifying the name of the Build Configuration used, when built.\r\n\r\nIn Result Set 1, both files contain 'Debug'.\r\nIn Result Set 2, parent_configuration contains 'NewConfig' and subproject_configuration contains 'Release'.\r\n\r\n(In Result Set 2, Bar automatically defaults to the Build Configuration set in the 'Use XXXXX for command-line builds' dropdown in the Project settings, due to the mismatch.)\r\n\r\nThere was no mechanism to control NewConfig's mapping to any of Bar's Build Configurations. It will only map to the default Build Configuration set in the dropdown.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA mechanism to control NewConfig's mapping to Bar's Build Configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project described in the steps above has been attached.\r\n\r\n06-Nov-2012 06:08 PM Josh Avant:\r\n'Foo.zip' was successfully uploaded"
