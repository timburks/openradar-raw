        Summary:
        I'm often riding my bicicle to work, and would very much like to take some notes or set reminders etc. through Siri. Unfortunately, with the iPhone in my pocket, and me speaking to Siri through my EarPods' microphone, it's next to useless: It won't read back to me what it thinks I understood, or what it took down as the new note etc. - it also doesn't ask me to orally confirm whether I want that or not.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        1. Have iPhone in pocket, earPods connected.
        2. Long-press middle of earPod remote; Siri activates.
        3. Say "New note: Look into iOS 6 blending shaders".
        4. Siri says "this is your note." Siri doesn't say anything else. Presumably, your pocket lights up. But you're in traffic. And/or wearing gloves. Or you're blind (or does Siri behave differently with VoiceOver on?). You're obviously not riding a bike if you're blind, because you're a responsible blind person.
        5. No further interaction is prompted by Siri. Did it save your note? Trash it because you didn't say anything? Would it have allowed you to correct your note? Is the note even correct, provided it has been saved (it has been saved, but was wildly incorrect)? You don't know. You're left confused in a situation that you perceive as being in the middle of an interaction, not at the end of it.

        Expected Results:
        If I'm using any kind of headset with Siri, I always want it to read back to me what it's doing, and to ask whether that was correct (or give me a hint that I can correct or cancel, and that agreement is implied if I just switch off the mic.

        Actual Results:
        I'm left in the dark, and confused.

        Regression:
        ---

        Notes:
        I think there is "eyes free" for cars. I don't have a car. Bikes are much more common as a means for transportation in Europe than they are in the US ("A computer is a bicycle for the mind", said Steve Jobs. Bikes are actual bicycles. Computers should support them :)). There are many other reasons why it would be inappropriate to have to look at a screen when using voice interaction.
