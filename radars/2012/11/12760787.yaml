    description: When in a full screen app that hides the status bar (like most games), the only thing I miss seeing from the status bar is the time. I know you can swipe down from the top and a little handle is reveled over the app which can then be pulled on again to pull down full Notification Center and thus reveal the time, but this is an awkward two-step process that utterly disrupts the game playing experience when all I wanted to do was glance at the time. If the Notification Center's pull handle simply had the time itself visible on it or attached to it or superimposed on it or something, that'd solve this problem for me in virtually every case I can think of without causing such a large focus disruption.
