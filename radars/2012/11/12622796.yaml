        Summary:
        Property List editor jump to the first line after searching, unable to edit the found row.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        If I search in the Property List editor and I found a row and want to edit the value. But the
        the editor jumps at the beginning to the document, so that I'm unable to hit the row.

        Expected Results:
        The editor shouldn't to a complete different position if I want edit a value.

        Actual Results:
        The editor jumps to the beginning.

        Regression:
        This behavior was always there since Xcode 4.0

        Notes:
        My current solution is to hit Escape before I double-click the row.
