    description: "Summary:\r\nRemote.app 3.0 for iPhone lost the ability to rate songs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open Remote.app 3.0 on an iPhone.\r\n- Start playing a song.\r\n- Touch list icon in upper right corner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOne row in this view should show current rating in stars and allow the change of the rating.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no such row.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nStarted with Remote.app 3.0 and the addition of Up Next.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe row with the stars is visible on the iPad version of Remote.app. There is no reason why this row is missing on the iPhone, it would just show one song less in Up Next."
