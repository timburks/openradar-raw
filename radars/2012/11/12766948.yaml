    description: "28-Nov-2012 11:43 PM Weichung Yang:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you try to input some text in a UITextField for entering email address using the Zhuyin keyboard (注音) for Traditional Chinese, the app offering the text field crashes, when you try to switch to the mode to input digits and punctuation symbols.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable the Zhuyin keyboard. Launch  the Settings app, go to \"General\" -> \"International\" -> \"Keyboards\" -> \"Add New Keyboard\". Then, select \"Chinese - Traditional - Zhuyin\".\r\n2. There are two layouts for the Zhuyin keyboard. Select \"Dynamic\" but not \"Zhuyin\".\r\n3. Go to any app which has a text field for entering email addresses. For example, we can go to the Settings app and try to add a new Twitter account, by visiting \"Twitter\" -> \"Add Account\".\r\n4. Tap of the text field on the right side of the \"User Name\" label, and switch to the Zhuyin keyboard.\r\n5. Tap on the \"123\" button on the bottom left corner of the keyboard.\r\n6.
