    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS 6, UITextView supports attributed strings. Turns out that a few attributes are not set doesn't matter what. Using IB or on your code, you can set what ever value you want and UITextView will report 0 for them.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of them that is impossible to set:\r\n\r\nLineSpacing, LineHeight, LineHeightMultiple, NSKern, ParagraphSpacingBefore and BaseWritingDirection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1 - Create a new project.\r\n2 - Add UITextView to your view.\r\n3 - Try to set any of the attributes above. (Interface Builder shows a few of those attributes, but even there is not possible to set).\r\n4 - Run.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUITextView should show the attributed text exactly like you set it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUITextView shows the attributed text with all those attributes described above set to 0.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
