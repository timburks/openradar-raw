    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen an AVPlayer is instantiated and visible in the application and AirPlay mode is already active (routed to an Apple TV device) an HLS asset will report a duration of exactly 1 second, no matter how long the actual video is.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Create the App:\r\n * Create a Single View application in XCode \r\n * In the ViewController, instantiate an AVPlayer\r\n * Use an AVPlayerLayer to attach the AVPlayer to the ViewController's view,\r\n * Use an MPVolumeView to expose the AirPlay button,\r\n * Instantiate an AVPlayerItem which points to an HLS asset,\r\n * Use KVO to watch the item's duration property for changes, log duration values received to the console,\r\n * Use the AVPlayer's replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem: method to set the AVPlayerItem,\r\n\r\n* Run the app:\r\n * Run the app on an iPad or iPhone running iOS 5.0 or higher\r\n * In the running app, use the MPVolumeView AirPlay button to pair with an Apple TV running iOS 5.1\r\n * With the AVPlayer still streaming to the Apple TV, kill the app and relaunch (this is to ensure that the player is tethered to the external device during initialization)\r\n * The app should now be running, paired with the AppleTV\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* As better duration information becomes available, the duration reported by KVO should match the actual underlying asset.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* Irrespective of the actual length of the HLS movie, the duration is reported as 1 second\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n* We did not see this behavior on Apple TV devices running iOS 5.0.2\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* One workaround we've found is to set allowsExternalPlayback (allowsAirPlayVideo) to NO until a non-1 duration has been reported by the AVPlayerItem."
