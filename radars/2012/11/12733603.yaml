    description: "Summary:\r\nUsers in the iOS Developer University Program receive an error when refreshing their provisioning profiles in the Xcode Organizer. See attached screen shot.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAs a Team Member in an iOS Developer University Program account, open the Organizer in Xcode 4.5.2 and refresh your provisioning profiles.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nProfiles should refresh without error.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nProfiles refresh, but the user receives an error sheet that states\r\n\r\n\"The selected team does not have a program membership that is eligible for this feature. If you need assistance, please contact Apple Developer Program Support.\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/support\"\r\n\r\nIt is unclear what \"this feature\" refers to, but I suspect it is distribution certificates or profiles since the University Program does not have them. I noticed the status bar at the top of the organizer window showing that it was attempting to download distribution certificates.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFWIW, I am a member of multiple iOS development programs (University, Enterprise, and Standard Company), but I've received reports that this is happening to students who are only enrolled in the university program."
