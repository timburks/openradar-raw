    description: "Summary: With non-ARC code, Xcode's static analyser misses memory leaks when an object is retained by a simple block.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Run static analysis on the attached project. Note leak at NGAppDelegate.m:38\r\n2. Uncomment the line inside the block at NGAppDelegate.m:35\r\n3. Run static analysis again and note that this completes successfully. The object is still leaked however.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nStatic analysis should be able to detect this simple form of leak. If not, how can ARC work with blocks?\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nStatic analysis severely crippled as a memory analysis tool in the presence of blocks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nExample project at http://d.pr/f/UdCf"
