    description: "26-Nov-2012 03:55 PM Daniel Weeks:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen in a view controller and loading a UIStoryboard from code the developer calls the UIStoryboard +storyboardWithName:bundle method passing in a file that is in a specific bundle (or nil for the default bundle). When on an iPad a different storyboard needs to be called than when on an iPhone or iPod touch. There is no way to have two files named with only a device specifier to differentiate them like UIImage has.\r\n\r\nWhen loading a UIImage with +imageNamed: there can be two files: image~ipad.png and image~iphone.png. On an iPad +imageNamed: will rerturn image~ipad.png and on and iPhone image~iphone.png. This convenience is great for supporting Universal apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLoad a storyboard in code. The string specified in the +storyboardWithName:bundle: is the filename without the \".storyboard\" extension.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFiles name MyStoryboard~ipad.storyboard and MyStoryboard~iphone.storyboard would be loaded correctly on the appropriate devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe developer has to explicitly specify the name of the file, including the device specifier. For example rather than calling:\r\n\r\n[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"MyStoryboard\" bundle:nil];\r\n\r\nto get a device appropriate storyboard file if it exists the call must be:\r\n\r\n[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@\"MyStoryboard~ipad\" bundle:nil];\r\n\r\nThis is less than convenient for maintaining clean code in a Universal application.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nno regressions\r\n\r\nNotes:"
