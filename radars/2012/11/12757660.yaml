    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe attached sample project uses CommonCrypto to encrypt and decrypt a string with the Blowfish algorithm. In iOS 5, one could use the option kCCOptionECBMode just fine and still decrypt the correct string. In iOS 6, using the ECB mode results in an incorrect encryption result.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached example project on iOS 6, either a device or the simulator is fine. Some diagnostic output is printed on the debug console.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEncrypting and later decrypting should give the original input again.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen using ECB mode, the decryption result doesn't match the original input.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe sample project works just fine on iOS 5.\r\n\r\nNotes: -"
