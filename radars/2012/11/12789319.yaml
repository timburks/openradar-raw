    description: "Summary:\r\nIf the source of Up Next is a smart playlist with live updating, the playback of the current song stops if the song is removed from the source playlist by updating its metadata\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create Smart Playlist: Rating is 0 stars, Live Updating\r\n- Start Playback by clicking Play Button next to Playlist name\r\n- Set Rating of current song to a setting different to 0 stars\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPlayback of the current song should continue, as it did in iTunes DJ.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPlayback stops, is not even skipped to next song.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNew behaviour of iTunes 11.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding all songs to Up Next \"manually\" is not a viable workaround in case the smart playlist is limited by size (e.g. to sync it to an iOS device). Having the playlist instead of the songs in Up Next automatically adds songs added to the playlist to Up Next. Manual adding the songs to Up Next doesn't."
