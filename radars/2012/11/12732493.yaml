        Summary:
        Allow to observe the window property of NSView with KVO

        Steps to Reproduce:
        I try to observe the window property of NSView to add/remote bindings if the view is visible or not.
        [view addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"window" options:0 context:NULL];

        Expected Results:
        Describe what you expected to happen when you executed the steps above.

        Actual Results:
        I get currently following message if I try to observe the window property:
        KVO autonotifying only supports -set<Key>: methods that return void. Autonotifying will not be done for invocations of -[NSView _setWindow:].
