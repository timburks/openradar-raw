    description: "Summary:\r\nOur app tries to use AudioServicesPlayAlertSound or AudioServicesPlaySystemSound while recording audio with a kAudioSessionCategory_PlayAndRecord audio session. However, it does not play/vibrate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Start a kAudioSessionCategory_PlayAndRecord audio session.\r\n2) Attempt to vibrate using AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe device should vibrate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nDevice does not vibrate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIf the audio session is off, vibration works.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe Apple docs note:\r\n\"If the user has configured the Settings application for vibration on ring, also invokes vibration. However, the device does not vibrate if your app’s audio session is configured with the AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord or AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord audio session category. This ensures that vibration doesn’t interfere with audio recording. For an explanation of audio session categories, see “Categories Express Audio Roles” in Audio Session Programming Guide.\"\r\n\r\nWe chose the play and record session type because we have an augmented reality application and we HAVE to provide feedback to the user in response to recording. We understand vibration may alter the recording, but we want to vibrate anyway. Not only that, but play and record allows other media to continue playing anyway. We would REALLY like to have the ability to override."
