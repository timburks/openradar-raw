    description: "Summary: When you have downloaded an app, the button to download or purchase it is disabled. But this also disables the small disclosure button next to it which usually contains the \"tell a friend\", \"copy link\", \"share on twitter\" and \"share on facebook\". The end result is that I cannot evangelize about great apps I have purchased.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Purchase or download an app. Try to share the link on twitter\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I can copy the link, or share it on my social networks\r\n\r\nActual Results: the button to do so is disabled so I can't. See screenshot\r\n\r\nRegression: It was possible to do that in iTunes 10, if I recall correctly\r\n\r\nNotes:"
