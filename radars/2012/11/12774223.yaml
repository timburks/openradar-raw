    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFinder.app locks up while copying to slow filesystems such as network shares and USB sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Insert a slowish USB drive into any USB port on a top of the line MacBook Pro w/Retina display;\r\n2. Copy a large file (1-2Gb) from the internal SSD to the USB drive;\r\n3. While the file is copying, navigate around the filesystem of your local machine using the Finder.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Finder remains responsive to all other activities, including updating the copy UI.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe Finder locks up, showing the beachball cursor while the copy occurs for 5-10 seconds at a time. The copy dialog only updates in between these freezes.\r\n\r\nThere's no workaround, and the same behaviour occurs when copying to/from network shares via AFP, CIFS, NFS, etc."
