    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAfter a period of operating normally, Xcode fails to launch an app in the Simulator and remains in an inconsistent state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open Xcode project, run in Simulator (any combination of device/version)\r\n- Repeat a number of times (<10)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n- App launches in Simulator normally, and can be stopped from Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter a varying number of normal Simulator launches:\r\n- Xcode indicates that Simulator is running correctly by activating the Stop button, but produces no output in Console\r\n- Simulator does not start the application, and remains on home screen.\r\n- Attempting to stop the application with the Xcode Stop button has no effect.\r\n\r\nRecovery is possible by:\r\n\r\nEITHER\r\n\r\n- Force-quit Xcode and restart. \r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n- Change the Simulator device in Xcode to an alternative (e.g. change to iPad Simulator assuming iPhone Simulator has failed)\r\n- Run the project\r\n- The Simulator will switch to running in iPad mode, and the application will launch.\r\n- Quitting the application in Xcode stops it running in the Simulator, and leaves the Simulator in iPad mode\r\n- The Simulator now runs normally, and can be switched back to iPhone mode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProblem occurs repeatedly after a small (<10) number of successful runs.  No pattern relating to the type of application has been observed.  No obvious console logs are observed.  Problem occurs on all combinations of Simulator device and version.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nXcode version 4.5 (4G182)\r\nSimulator version 6.0 (358.4)"
