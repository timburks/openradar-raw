    description: "I'm requesting an enhancement to (view based) NSTableViews to allow opening a gap in the table view at the current target location of a drop operation, while the drag is still in progress. This would look similar to drag-reordering in UITableView on iOS. GarageBand for OS X's tracks list does this when reordering, as demonstrated here: http://www.screencast.com/t/OmUVHcCNSl\r\n\r\nNote that this behavior is not provided by NSTableViewAnimationEffectGap. In that case, the animation is done after the user releases the mouse button to complete the drop operation. I'm requesting an animation that happens and is continuously updated during the drag operation."
