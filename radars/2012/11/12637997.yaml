    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I get a FaceTime call to my Apple ID which is used on both my Mac and iPhone, and I answer the call on my Mac, the iPhone shows the same call as a missed call.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf the call was answered on the Mac, it should show as answered on the iPhone as well.  The call was not missed, so it should not show up as missed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA notification of the \"missed\" call shows on the iPhone lock screen, and a missed call is logged into the Phone app, which causes a red (1) badge to appear on the Phone icon.  These steps are only appropriate for a call that was not answered."
