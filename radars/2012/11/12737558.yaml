    description: "21-Nov-2012 05:34 PM Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen UIActivityViewController is passed an array with a text longer than 140 characters and the user wants to share that on twitter, the text is emptied. The same thing happens if an image is added to the array: the image is displayed but the text is missing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIActivityViewController with the initWithActivityItems: method using an array containing a long text (over 140 characters) and an image. Display to the user and share on twitter and facebook. The facebook composer shows the whole text, the twitter composer doesn't show any text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTruncation of the text on the view controller for the maximum size allowed by twitter according to the additional attachements, or overflowing of the text letting the user trim the text manually before being allowed to send the actual tweet.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnexpected total loss of the text data shared by the user, resulting in a useless experience.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis happened in iOS 5.x too but I didn't care to fill in a bug because I could manually trim the text before passing the text to the twitter composer. However, now that the UIActivityViewController is a \"hands off\" approach, this doesn't work. I might want to share a long text on facebook, which I can, it's just the twitter composer that is useless because it drops the ball.\r\n\r\n21-Nov-2012 05:34 PM Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz:\r\n'screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded"
