    description: "The Illustrious Greg Parker asked that I file the following bug:\r\n\r\nAppKit introduced a few string constants in 10.7.3 that we need to weakly reference. Unfortunately, our minimum deployment target is also 10.7, so we don't get these automatically weak-linked for us automatically by Xcode:\r\n\r\nAPPKIT_EXTERN NSString * const NSWindowDidChangeBackingPropertiesNotification NS_AVAILABLE_MAC(10_7); // added in 10.7.3; userInfo keys: NSBackingPropertyOldScaleFactorKey, NSBackingPropertyOldColorSpaceKey\r\n\r\nAPPKIT_EXTERN NSString * const NSBackingPropertyOldScaleFactorKey NS_AVAILABLE_MAC(10_7); // added in 10.7.3; an NSNumber\r\nAPPKIT_EXTERN NSString * const NSBackingPropertyOldColorSpaceKey NS_AVAILABLE_MAC(10_7);  // added in 10.7.3; an NSColorSpace\r\n\r\nwhen running on 10.7.2 and below we hit the following crash:\r\n\r\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.7.2 (11C74)\r\n\r\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\r\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000\r\n\r\nApplication Specific Information:\r\ndyld: launch, loading dependent libraries\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no way to work around this problem other than modifying the system headers, which is a mega bummer.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if these headers were corrected to not require this."
