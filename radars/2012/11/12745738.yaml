    description: I really want to have the ability to write programs which make use of the OpenCL framework. It's been a wondrous thing on the Mac, and I see it's a private framework on iOS right now. Making this public would negate many of the abuses of OpenGL and GLSL that many of us developers (myself included) have been making over the last few years.
