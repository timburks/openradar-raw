    description: "Summary: Currently, when you \"Record Trace\" in Instruments with the Automation tool, the trace continues even when the tests are done.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run a UI Automation test script on an iOS application, such as the \"Automatic for the People UI Automation Script.js\" script that comes with this project: http://github.com/apontious/Automatic-for-the-People\r\n- Wait for all tests to finish.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Now, Instruments stops.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Instruments keeps running forever, requiring you to stop it yourself manually each time. Tedious!\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe documentation even mentions this issue, in the Automated UI Testing section of the Instruments User Guide. But just because it's documented, doesn't make it right!\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could be some special logging message that Instruments listens for, which, if it sees, makes it stop running. I dunno, you folks figure something good out, I'll be happy."
