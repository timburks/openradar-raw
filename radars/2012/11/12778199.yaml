    description: "29-Nov-2012 01:52 PM Loren Brichter:\r\nI should be able to drag the miniwindow by clicking and dragging anywhere in the gray titlebar, even if a button is under the mouse pointer (click and drag over a button should just cancel the click for that button — similar to how on iOS scrolling a list with your finger doesn't \"tap\" the row that your finger initially touched down on).\r\n\r\nThe current drag area is a minefield, super tiny, and changes whether my mouse pointer is over the window or not. Hugely frustrating.\r\n\r\n(The full size window and App Store window should work the same way, drag anywhere to move)."
