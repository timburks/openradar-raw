    description: "Summary: \r\nThere is no way to add a song to Up Next without right-clicking\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Open iTunes 11 to a view that contains a song.\r\n2. Right-click, add it to Up Next\r\n3. Select another song, double-click it\r\n\r\nExpected Results: \r\nThe song should be added at the end of the Up Next list, or a prompt asking you if you want to play the song immediately or add it to Up Next\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\nYou get the following dialog http://cl.ly/image/1S3p0f2W1K0L with no option to add something to Up Next\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nStarted happening as of iTunes 11\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nThe dialog that appears when you have something in Up Next is somewhat jarring. An iTunes preference like \"Double-click adds song/album to end of Up Next\" would be a decent solution."
