    description: "Will you PLEASE make it possible to turn off notifications from the Mac App Store. I'm fed up of constantly dismissing those notifications only for them to re-appear 30 minutes later, again informing me of a fact I'm well aware of: that there are updates I can download.\r\n\r\nThis is Mac OS X. This is not Windows XP, we don't need Clippy informing us that it successfully detected a USB mouse and we don't need the Mac App Store bragging that not only is it's dock icon able to show there are updates available, but that it can also irritate the fuck out of you whenever it bloody well pleases without any way to tell it to bugger off bar shutting off notification completely, which is honestly a very tempting proposition just to remove this one problem."
