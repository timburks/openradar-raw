    description: "Summary: If I edit a JavaScript testing script that Instruments currently has imported, it will complain that it has changed each time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Run a UI Automation test script on an iOS application, such as the \"Automatic for the People UI Automation Script.js\" script that comes with this project: https://github.com/apontious/Automatic-for-the-People\r\n- Now edit the script.\r\n- Now run the script (i.e. Record Trace) again in Instruments\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Instruments uses the updated script without complaint.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Instruments complains that the script has changed behind its back, and you must click \"Revert\" to get the new script's contents.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Not a regression."
