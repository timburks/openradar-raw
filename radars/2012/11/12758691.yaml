    description: "27-Nov-2012 12:43 PM Matthew Dicembrino:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe 100 device limit for ad-hoc distribution is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBe an independent developer with multiple clients.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBe able to provide ad-hoc builds to all clients' devices for testing using 1 distribution certificate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly can add a small number of devices to stay within 100 device limit.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCurrently the only way to get around this is to purchase multiple developer licenses. I would gladly pay extra money for extra device slots w/o having to buy another license, so I could make an ad-hoc build for say 300 devices using the same certificate."
