    description: "02-Nov-2012 12:33 PM Marco Ponton:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\niCal/Calendar \"alerts\" are now integrated with ML's Notification Center. Unfortunately, although notifications can be \"snoozed\", the snooze duration cannot be changed whereas on previous versions of iCal, alerts offered multiple snooze durations (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, ...).\r\n\r\nA lot of people (me included) relied on this feature to \"manage\" their events/alerts/lack of memory. Google it and you'll find many threads of people complaining about this. An example of use for this feature: Birthdays. I want to be notified of birthdays days in advance so I have time to buy a card/gift yet I may not be able to do this immediately when I first get the alert. Before, I could snooze the alert for hours or days. Now I can only snooze it for 9 minutes or dismiss it. The former will bug me for hours during my work day, the later will end up in me forgetting the birthday.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a calendar entry with an alert that will popup in Notification Center.\r\n\r\nExpected (Desired) Results:\r\n\r\nSnooze button should allow user to select a duration other than the default, up to hours and days like it did previously in iCal.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSnooze button only allows for a snooze duration of 9 minutes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nWorks as expected in iCal 5.x and previous versions on Lion and Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis feature implemented directly in Notification Center would benefit all applications (e.g. Reminders) and would be a great addition to Notification Center in general, not only to Calendar.\r\n\r\n09-Nov-2012 07:31 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
