    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA popover controller hosting a navigation controller will not properly resize the navigation bar in response to a prompt being added or removed (either added/removed to an existing UINavigationItem or when different navigation items are added/removed from the stack. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a view controller which has no prompt set on its navigation item. \r\n2. Create a navigation controller with the aforementioned view controller as its root view controller. \r\n3. Create a popover controller with the navigation controller as its content view controller\r\n4. Display the popover\r\n5. Push a new view controller onto the navigation controller that *does* have a prompt set on its navigation item\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n6. The navigation bar should resize to accommodate the prompt\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n6. The navigation bar resizes, but is clipped by the popover's frame\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nScattered reports say this worked in iOS 3.2. It is not working in iOS 5.0 and 6.0. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA similar but less severe issue occurs when the root view controller has a prompt on its navigation item but a view controller without a prompt is pushed. In that case the navigation bar area remains too large for the prompt-less navigation bar. \r\n\r\nA project is attached that exhibits the bug. Build and run, tap the \"Display Popover\" button, and then tap the \"Push Child\" button to demonstrate the bug (repeatedly tapping it will alternate between a prompt and no prompt)."
