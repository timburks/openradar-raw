    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMy app, Viewfinder (http://connectedflow.com/viewfinder), uses AMWorkflow to communicate with Keynote (the workflow is attached). When I enable the app sandbox under Lion, the workflow does not run as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe following code is used to load a workflow from the app bundle and run it, passing in a file URL to a photo that has been downloaded:\r\n\r\n+ (void)sendFileToKeynote:(NSURL *)pathURL;\r\n{\r\n\tNSURL *url = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource: @\"CreateKeynoteSlides\" withExtension: @\"workflow\"];\r\n\tif(url) {\r\n\t\tNSError *workflowError = nil;\r\n\t\tid success = [AMWorkflow runWorkflowAtURL: url withInput: [pathURL path] error: &workflowError];\r\n\t\tif(!success && workflowError)\r\n\t\t\t[NSApp presentError: workflowError];\r\n\t}\t\r\n}\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected that the workflow would run and communicate correctly with Keynote.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe workflow does not run and Console reports:\r\n\r\n2011-07-01 10:31:20.352 Automator Runner[1548:707] Automator Runner is unable to establish a connection to the delegate.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe workflow runs correctly on Lion with sandbox disabled and on Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI request the following entitlements in my app: app-sandbox, assets.pictures.write, files.downloads.read-write, network.client. I have tried adding temporary-exception.apple-events but this doesn't help."
