    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm getting a clipped LineJoin in a UIBezierPath when one line comes back exactly over the previous line. If I adjust the second line by one pixel, the LineJoin behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUIBezierPath *path = [UIBezierPath bezierPath];\r\n[path setLineWidth:10.0f];\r\n[path setLineCapStyle:kCGLineCapRound];\r\n[path setLineJoinStyle:kCGLineJoinRound];\r\n[path moveToPoint:CGPointMake(100, 100)];\r\n[path addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200, 100)];\r\n[path addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(150, 100)];\r\n[path moveToPoint:CGPointMake(100, 120)];\r\n[path addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(200, 120)];\r\n[path addLineToPoint:CGPointMake(150, 121)];\r\n[[UIColor redColor] setStroke];\r\n[path stroke];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nBoth lines should have a rounded ends on both sides.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe first line has a flat end on the right side.  The second line looks as expected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have included a screenshot of the output from the code sample.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8ew1a8ysyjluf2w/LineJoinTest.jpg"
