    description: "01-Nov-2012 08:29 AM Karl Stenerud:\r\nSummary:\r\nMany crash reporters make use of backtrace() and backtrace_symbols() to partially symbolicate error reports.\r\nOn devices with iOS 6 installed, many of those backtrace entries have been replaced with <redacted>.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse backtrace() and backtrace_symbols() to get a symbolicated backtrace.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nsymbolicated entries show the function or method name.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSome entries show <redacted> instead.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nAs of iOS 6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nEven if the redacted entries are for private APIs, the names of those functions provide valuable clues as to what the app was doing when the stack trace was made. This is monumentally important when trying to track down a bug in the wild."
