    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nScrolling of an NSTableView using views (instead of cells) bogs down when it is layer-backed. Observed on Lion (10.7.5) and Mountain Lion (10.8.1).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a view-based table*. This problem repros even with a stock text-based cell view. Make sure the window is NOT layer-backed initially.\r\n2. Provide a very large number of rows (e.g. 5 million). Cell data does not matter.\r\n3. Run, present view, and notice scrolling performance when \"scrubbing\" the scrollbar with the knob.\r\n=> observe that scrolling is highly responsive\r\n4. Now go to the view and make the window's contentView layer-backed. Repeat test.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n=> Scrolling should still be very responsive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n=> Scrolling performance becomes sluggish, lagging behind the knob position.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A. View-based tables are new in Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* Performance appears to be proportional to the number of rows in the table -- NOT the number of rows visible on screen. Changing the row count to something more \"reasonable\" -- such as 500 -- mostly eliminates the lag.\r\n\r\n* Debugger: the number of subviews of the NSTableView is reasonable (~ the number of rows visible in the window).\r\n\r\n* The data source callbacks are all O(1).\r\n\r\n* The \"Time\" profiler is inconclusive, showing lots of time spent in CA code.\r\n\r\n* A simple sample project (\"LayerBackedTableTest\") is attached."
