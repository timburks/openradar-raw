    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nusing EventKit's eventsMatchingPredicate: and predicateForEventsWithStartDate:endDate:calendars: does not return last day of multi-day, non-allday events.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a multi-day event in calendar, for example Fri Nov. 9th, 6PM to Sun Nov. 11th, 7PM.\r\n\r\n2) Run a eventsMatchingPredicate: query on the calendar for the last day of the event, i.e. from Sun Nov. 11th, 12AM to Mon Nov. 12th 12AM.\r\n\r\n  EKEventStore *ekEventStore = [[EKEventStore alloc] init];\r\n\r\n  NSPredicate *predicate = [ekEventStore\r\n    predicateForEventsWithStartDate:aFromDate\r\n    endDate:aToDate\r\n    calendars:nil // all calendars\r\n  ];     \r\n  // Fetch all events that match the predicate.\r\n  NSArray *events = [ekEventStore eventsMatchingPredicate:predicate];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n  events array should contain the test event, as it overlaps the queried date range.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n  events array does NOT contain the test event.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n  this has worked correctly on iOS 5 and before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1) The bug is in the actual device as well as in the Simulator, and consistently for both only in iOS6. With iOS5, it works on both actual devices as well as the Simulator.\r\n\r\n2) The bug does NOT affect multi-day allday events. Only multi-day timed events are affected."
