    description: "The AirPlay menu presented in 3rd party applications doesn't rotate properly. It seems to use the proper style (the portrait version is a series of buttons while landscape is a scrollable list).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Play a video in landscape (or rotate a portrait video to landscape) and open the AirPlay menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: AirPlay menu should rotate with the orientation of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results: AirPlay menu uses the correct scrollable list style but doesn't rotate with the screen's orientation.\r\n\r\nRegression: This was working in iOS 5 and has since stopped working in iOS 6+\r\n\r\nNotes: I have attached screenshots, one from the Photos app where this menu works correctly and another from our app where it does not.\r\n\r\nWe have written some code to find the Action Sheet in the second UIWindow you guys create to show the AirPlay menu and rotate it ourselves. Obviously, we don't want to ship this code in case it is fixed in an OS update and we aren't able to tell that it has actually been fixed.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen even in the most simple of projects with all orientations enabled and using a simple MPMoviePlayerController."
