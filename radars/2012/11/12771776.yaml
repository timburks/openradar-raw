    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen a storyboard contains a view controller who's content view has been removed (in order to cause it to load from a nib), it is impossible to create a segue that refers to the same class of view controller without duplicating the controller and all incoming/outgoing segues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project using storyboards. \r\n\r\nDelete the content view from the extant view controller in the storyboard.\r\n\r\nAttempt to create a segue from that view controller to itself.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA new segue is created.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is impossible to create this segue.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
