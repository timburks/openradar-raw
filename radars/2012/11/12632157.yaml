    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm using NSUserNotification and can't use the \"Alert\" Style.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI can do a sample app, but in essence, it's as simple as \r\n\r\n    NSUserNotification *userNotification = [[NSUserNotification alloc] init];\r\n    userNotification.title = title;\r\n    [[NSUserNotificationCenter defaultUserNotificationCenter] deliverNotification:userNotification];\r\n\r\nHaving NSUserNotificationAlertStyle in my Info.plist set to `alert` or `alerts` still shows the Notifcation as a Banner.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe same as if the user would swap it to \"Alerts\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing. This Info.plist keys just do Nothing.\r\n\r\nSee http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=2242401"
