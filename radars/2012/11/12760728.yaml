    description: "27-Nov-2012 01:17 PM Jacob Jennings:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn practice, targets are usually used to separate configurations for production, debugging, QA builds, and other tool-specific (ex. Frank) additions.  Target duplication does not solve this most common use case very well.  Target-specific configurations are few, and changes that are not target-specific must be manually changed across all targets, which is a tedious and error-prone process.  I would like to see an inheritance option for xCode targets.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
