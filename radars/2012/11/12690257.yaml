    description: "Summary:\r\nTurn based games that use GameCenter for turns are not shown with their respective icon on the lock screen and notification center lists but all with the generic game center icon instead. This makes it hard to distinguish and also breaks consistency. Sliding a notification on the lock screen normally takes you to the respective app depicted by the icon. Not so with turn based games where you slide the GameCenter icon but are (correctly) taken to the actual game instead. This is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet any game that uses GameCenter for turns like Letterpress or Lost Cities. Play a round and wait until it's your turn. You'll get a push message which is shown on the lock screen of your iOS device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icon on the lock screen and notification center message list should show the correct game's icon.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nLock screen and notification center show the generic GameCenter icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlso applies to iOS 6.0.0 and iOS 5.x"
