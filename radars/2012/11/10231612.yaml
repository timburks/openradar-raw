    description: "04-Oct-2011 01:15 PM Rudy Richter:\r\nSummary:\r\nIn our specific case we needed to maintain usage of the same bundle identifier for Growl as it had previously used as a Faceless background application inside of a prefPane for 1.2.2 and earlier.  Unfortunately when we transitioned to the MacAppStore for distribution the result was that MAS/Installer proceeded to install the contents of Growl.app from the pkg into the GrowlHelperApp.app binary sitting inside the prefPane.  This obviously is a completely undesirable result as it installs it in a location that the user can't find and is additionally a problem when the user runs the \"old growl uninstaller\" that we direct them to via our startup sequence.  Since Growl 1.3 is installed inside the prefPane it will then be deleted by our uninstall script. The end result being that they now have to go back to the store to install Growl.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nDownload Growl 1.2.2 from http://growl.info/downloads.php\r\nInstall Growl 1.2.2\r\nGo to the MacAppStore and purchase Growl 1.3, allow it to install\r\nNavigate to /Applications and notice that Growl.app isn't there\r\nNavigate to /Library/PreferencePanes/Growl.prefPane/Contents/Resources/GrowlHelperApp.app/ and witness all the data files for Growl 1.3 being inside the bundle.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt would install Growl.app to /Applications\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nit for some reason thinks it should install the files into GrowlHelperApp.app, additionally hiding the binary from the user.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
