    description: "15-Nov-2012 02:42 PM David Beck:\r\n## Summary:\r\n\r\nOn launch, NSURLRequest does not use data stored in the cache and -[NSURLCache cachedResponseForRequest:] does not return a result. However, after the cache is used, both will start working until the app is restarted.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExample project for iOS: https://github.com/davbeck/CacheExample\r\n\r\n### A failed cache loading\r\n\r\n1. Launch app\r\n2. Tap \"Load From Server\" and observe a successfully loaded image\r\n3. Relaunch the app\r\n4. Tap \"Load From Cache\" and observe an unsuccessful load\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can tap \"Clear Cache\" and relaunch to reset.\r\n\r\n### A successful cache loading\r\n\r\n1. Launch app\r\n2. Tap \"Load From Server\" and observe a successfully loaded image\r\n3. Relaunch the app\r\n4. Tap \"Test Cache\"\r\n5. Tap \"Load From Cache\" and observe a successful load from cache\r\n\r\n## Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe cache should work on first launch without directly accessing the NSURLCache.\r\n\r\n## Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe cache does not return a result until it has been \"touched\".\r\n\r\n## Notes:\r\n\r\n\"Load From Server\" will always load from the server even if the cache would return a result. Conversely, \"Load From Cache\" never loads from the server and only loads from the cache.\r\n\r\nWhile `-[NSURLCache currentDiskUsage]` will cause the cache to work correctly, `-[NSURLCache diskCapacity]`, `-[NSURLCache currentMemoryUsage]`, `-[NSURLCache memoryCapacity]` as well as loading the request from the server (which causes the result to be cached automatically) will have the same effect. Other actions might work similarly.\r\n\r\n15-Nov-2012 02:42 PM David Beck:\r\n'CacheExample.zip' was successfully uploaded"
