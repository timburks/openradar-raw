'Open Recent...' in the File menu works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTwo items «[REDACTED]» and «[REDACTED]» are actually in an encrypted disk image somewhere on my disk. The reason I put them in there is I don't want anyone know I have these files. Compare two screenshots that show \r\na) Open Recent item in File menu\r\nb) Recent files when you right click on QuickTime icon in the Dock\r\n\r\n13-Jul-2012 03:07 AM Pooria Azimi:\r\n'QT-Recents.png' was successfully uploaded"
