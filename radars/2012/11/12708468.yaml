    description: Interface Builder in Xcode lets me change the border style and color of a custom NSBox, but does not expose the corner radius property. The only way to set is is via the user-defined runtime attributes page, but then IB doesn't know about it and the box will still draw with square corners. Please add a control for editing this and make sure IB previews the corner radius on the canvas correctly.
