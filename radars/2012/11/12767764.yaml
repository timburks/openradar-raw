        Summary:
        When launching Safari 6 with pages left open from the previous session, Safari leaves keyboard focus on the bookmark bar, specifically the Reading List button. Pressing the space bar, which typically scrolls by a page, instead reveals the Reading List sidebar. This is annoying.

        Steps to Reproduce:
        Quit Safari with some pages open. Relaunch Safari. Hit the space bar after the frontmost page has loaded.

        Expected Results:
        I expect the page to scroll.

        Actual Results:
        Reading List pops open. Repeat on every other page, unless I remember to click somewhere on the page before attempting to scroll, which isn't terribly likely.
