    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is an animation glitch when dragging and dropping files from one Finder window to another.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open two Finder windows to two different folders.\r\n2. Populate one of the directories with a large number of files. Enough files so that the windows must be shown with a scroll bar to see all of the files.\r\n3. Select all of the files from the one finder window and drag/drop them into the second finder window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the animation performed to \"be Apple-like\" with the appearance of intential design.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation has the appearance of glitch because the animated file icons appear outside the confines of the Finder Window. Even if this is intended behavior, it does not look correct in the context because the file icons are condensed during the drag operation. It doesn't make sense for them to expand as they do outside of the view. They should instead expand into place within the confines of the view.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not have the appearance of a glitch in previous versions of OS X because in older version of the operating system the drag and drop operation did not condense all of the files into the size of a single icon underneath the mouse with the count badge. The inclusion of that \"feature\" causes the re expansion to appear wrong because it seems it's a left over artifact of the old appearance of dragging and dropping files [where they were not condensed].\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTake a look at the 30 second video which demonstrates this animation."
