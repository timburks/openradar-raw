    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApp Store.app Updates table cell not esthetically pleasing when tapped and held after expanding the cell to show more information about the update. What you will notice is that some of the text color does not invert on highlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open App Store.app with updates pending.\r\n2) Select the Updates tab view. (At this point any updates are \"collapsed\".)\r\n3) Tap and hold in the description area of the cell. Notice that all the text color inverts properly when highlighted.\r\n4) Lift your finger to select the cell for \"expansion\".\r\n5) Tap and hold in the description area of the cell. Notice that only the app name and version text color inverts when highlighted.\r\n6) Lift your finger and weep.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the text color should invert to make things readable and esthetically pleasing. You might also look at the edge around the update button.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nText is not inverted on highlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nA change was made to the App Store.app selection of the cell. I believe initially you had to tap the very small \"What's New\" target which made it very difficult to expand. And the behavior was changed to expand when the cell was selected. Unfortunately once expanded you can still highlight the table cell and not all of the text is inverted correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
