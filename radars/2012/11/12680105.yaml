    description: "11-Nov-2012 08:07 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nA Javascript alert() window or any modal dialog such as HTTP Authentication will cause execution of programs in other windows to stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a new Safari window for www.pandora.com. Start playing some music.\r\n2. Open a second Safari window and go to a Web page that will cause a Javascript alert() dialog to appear, such as: http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_alert\r\n3. Trigger the alert() window\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect scripts in other windows and processes to continue uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt seems as though execution of script in other Windows will come to a halt until the blocking dialog box is dismissed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached 30 second video with audio demonstrating the problem. This problem also occurs on some other types of windows, such as an HTTP authentication dialog box.\r\n\r\n11-Nov-2012 08:07 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Safari Alert Window Bug.mov' and 'iMac.spx' were successfully uploaded"
