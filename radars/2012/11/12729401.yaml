    description: "19-Nov-2012 07:03 PM Simon Whitaker:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe UIActivity class reference says of the activityViewController method:\r\n\r\n\"If this method returns a valid object, the system presents the returned view controller for you, instead of calling the performActivity method. On iPad, your view controller is presented inside of a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, your view controller is presented modally.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, on iPad my view controller is always displayed modally, not inside a popover. In addition, calling activityDidFinish: on iPad does not dismiss the view controller. I suspect this is related to the fact that the view controller displays modally.\r\n\r\nOn iPhone the behaviour for both these methods works as documented.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the attached app on the iPad simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen you tap the \"Tap me!\" activity button, a view opens in a UIPopover\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWhen you tap the \"Tap me!\" activity button, a view is presented modally.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[File uploaded to Apple is available at http://cloud.goosoftware.co.uk/L0V5]"
