    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe desktop pictures preference pane takes too long to show the additional folders that I add under \"Folders\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Drag and drop a folder full of images onto the \"Folders\" item in the desktop pictures preference pane;\r\n2. Quit system preferences without selecting an image;\r\n3. Re-open the desktop pictures preference pane;\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe newly added folder is visible at launch, and the image previews load quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOnly the default list of items is visible, with any added folders not appearing for between 5-25 seconds.\r\n\r\nI often assume that the preference pane has actually lost the folder, and that I need to re-add it."
