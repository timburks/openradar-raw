    description: My usual workflow with Git (that would also mean with SourceTree & Git Tower) is that I have some files that I don't stage for a period of time. Those tools, much like Git itself  (command line) don't "auto-stage" files like Xcode seems to do it. I'd like those "non staged files" to check "checked out" (their checkbox).
