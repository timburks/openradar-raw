    description: "Summary: Please provide an uninstaller for the Xcode command line tools package.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no alternative to installing the command line tools package if one wants to use MacPorts, Homebrew, or ad-hoc configure/make. The tools package cannot be readily uninstalled, except by trawling the receipt, which has considerable margin for user error.\r\n\r\nThis means that some time after installing the tools package, when I'm juggling Xcode stable and preview releases with xcode-select or the popup menu in Xcode's prefs, there's a ton of extraneous crap in my default path, including old versions of git and svn. \r\n\r\nI've avoided this headache so far by avoiding installing the tools package, but I now have to bite that bullet. A tools package uninstaller would allow me to definitively fall back to the toolchain embedded inside whatever version of Xcode is considered current, mitigating a lot of potential complexity."
