    description: "Summary:\r\nI have app syncing switched off for my iPhone and iPad. However, whenever I sync with iTunes, it transfers all apps from the iOS device to the iTunes library. There's no need to locally store these apps, since they are available in iCloud. Additionally, especially on a MacBook Air the storage is limited and iOS apps are of no use on OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Disable app syncing for an iOS device\r\n2. Download or update an app on the iOS device\r\n3. Sync iOS device with iTunes\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should not copy apps to its library from devices for which app syncing is switched off.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes copies apps from iOS device to its library, although app syncing is switched off."
