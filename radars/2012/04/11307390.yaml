    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nApplication sandboxing causes problems with AddressBook.framework even when com.apple.security.personal-information.addressbook entitlement is enabled. Read-only mode works fine but when performing update the following errors are logget to console repeatedly:\r\n\r\n4/24/12 12:34:13.877 PM sandboxd: ([5846]) ABSandboxTest(5846) deny file-read-data /Users/dev/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AddressBook.plist.lockfile\r\n4/24/12 12:34:13.878 PM sandboxd: ([5848]) AddressBookSync(5848) deny mach-lookup com.apple.syncservices.SyncServer\r\n4/24/12 12:34:13.883 PM sandboxd: ([5846]) ABSandboxTest(5846) deny file-write-create /Users/dev/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AddressBook.plist.sb-344ba5c6-QamLum\r\n\r\nAnother side effect is that application appears stuck for second or often more when saving updates to Address Book.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun the following code in a sandboxed Cocoa application with com.apple.security.personal-information.addressbook entitlement:\r\n\r\n  ABAddressBook *ab = [ABAddressBook sharedAddressBook];\r\n  (void)[[ABPerson alloc] initWithAddressBook:ab];\r\n  [ab save];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n  This code is executed instantly, there are no sandboxing errors in console.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n  The code takes ~0.7 seconds when first executed, and causes a bunch of sandboxing errors in console as illustrated above.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
