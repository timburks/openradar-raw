    description: "This specific need has occurred since Xcode 3. \r\n\r\nTo explain it in a better way, it would be great if Xcode could provide the features similar to Mogenerator (http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/)\r\n\r\nWhat is needed from the current core data system was explained in this article:\r\nhttp://raptureinvenice.com/getting-started-with-mogenerator/\r\n\r\nSome features such as methods to manipulate the relationships of an object is already available. But, other things described on the article is not available yet:\r\n\r\n- A separate generated and custom code pair to provide a way to manipulate the custom entity classes without manually preventing it from being overwritten if we modify the data model.\r\n- Wrapper for NSNumber properties.\r\n- Validations tool.\r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice if we could \"regenerate\" the data model code without going through the \"New File\" wizard (although this feature is needed for initial file creation). Once these files are created, we could just edit the xcdatamodel files, and the updated data model classes will be regenerated upon building if there's a change.\r\n\r\nWe could still of course choose to create new NSManagedObject subclass.\r\n\r\nThen, instead of showing \"Core Data Model Editor Help\" on the context menu of the entity. Provide an option to create the NSManagedObject subclass (or any additional useful features related to the entity) from the menu."
