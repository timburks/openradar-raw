Enable FileVault\r\n2. Create one or more user accounts\r\n3. Open the FileVault tab in the Security & Privacy preference panel\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. A button named \"Enable Users…\" should be displayed\r\n2. Clicking that button should open a modal window with a table view that lists all the local user accounts\r\n3. For each account, an icon or a label should be displayed so the user can know whether the account is able to unlock the disk or not\r\n4. For each account, a button should be displayed so the user can enable or disable the account\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIf there are disabled accounts, a button \"Enable Users…\" is displayed that allows the user to enable them.
