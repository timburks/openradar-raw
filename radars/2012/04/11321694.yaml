    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe way that iMessage handles \"Caller ID\" is confusing and causes a poor user experience.\r\n\r\nSAMPLE CASE #1\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSend a message from your iPhone with the default Caller ID (phone number). Send another message from your iPod touch with the default Caller ID (Apple ID email).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe recipient receives both messages in the same thread. Any replies are delivered to both devices.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe recipient receives each message in a separate thread. Replies to the iPhone message will be delivered only to the iPhone. Replies to the iPod touch message will be delivered to both devices.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed as long as iMessage has been available on non-iPhone devices.\r\n\r\nSAMPLE CASE #2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSend a reply to an iMessage that has an email address as the sender/\"Caller ID\" from an iPhone with no data connectivity.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe message is delivered as an SMS to the recipient's phone if applicable, or is held until data service is available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\niMessage falls back to sending an MMS to the Apple ID email address. This results in an email from mms.att.net (in the case of an AT&T iPhone) arriving in the user's email inbox, which is quite counterintuitive.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed as long as iMessage has been available on non-iPhone devices.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThese are only two sample cases among several that are caused by the handling of Caller ID on iMessage. The addition of iMessage functionality to the Messages beta makes this even more significant."
