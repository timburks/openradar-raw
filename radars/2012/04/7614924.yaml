    description: "04-Feb-2010 07:00 PM:\r\nif a file would normally be downloaded via a web browser, it would be fantastic to have UIWebView automatically check the types available to UIDocumentInteractionController, and if they type was recognized, allow the user to opt to send that file to the appropriate program.  If the currently running program was the only program to accept the URL's contents, then it would automatically send the URL's contents to the running application."
