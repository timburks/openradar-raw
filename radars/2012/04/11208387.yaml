    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n-[UIBezierPath currentPoint] is documented to return CGPointZero if the path is empty. When trying to use the method, though, an error is logged to the console. This appears to be a benign error, since CGPointZero is returned as appropriate and nothing seems to misbehave. On the other hand, it causes worry for the developer since it specifically says \"Error\" in the log message, and it will generate log message every time it is used, which may be quite often if used in -drawRect:.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty UIBezierPath object.\r\n2. Call -currentPoint on the object.\r\n\r\nA sample project is attached.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe call behaves properly, with no spontaneous logging.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSpurious Error log.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
