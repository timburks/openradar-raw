    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Xcode's \"Debug Area\", a configurable filter for \"target output\" would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nXcode's \"Debug Area\" shows the console output of the currently run target. It would be very helpful if I could setup a unix filter script to just show the lines of output I am interested in. For me, a typical filter script would remove the NSLog prefix (timestamp, pid/thread).\r\n\r\nAlso, in larger projects, there's typically a lot of debugging output from other developers that I'm not interested in. It would be great if I could just set up a regular expression to remove whatever I don't want to see and change output to my needs.\r\n\r\nIt would be especially great if all output would be cached so that I can change my filter to something else and then see the output that was removed by the previous filter."
