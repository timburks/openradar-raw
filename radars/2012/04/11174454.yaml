    description: "03-Apr-2012 09:00 AM Michael Herring:\r\nSummary:\r\nJust as option-left and option-right can be used to quickly navigate \"words\" in the source editor, it would be really great if I could use Option+Up and Option+Down to navigate methods when editing C/ObjC/C++ source.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A (or, when editing source, try pressing option+up or option+down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn option in the \"Key Bindings\" of Xcode Preferences allowing me to move up or down one full method definition. Other spans could be defined for other sections of source, too (enums, blocks of import statements, pragma marks, etc.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nCurrently, Xcode has the aforementioned bindings assigned to \"Move Paragraph Backward\" and \"Move Paragraph Forward\" but they don't do anything other than move up one line and down one line, respectively. Perhaps this is, in fact, a regression but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAnother developer mentioned how awesome this would be here: http://twitter.com/jbradforddillon/status/187202969106788353"
