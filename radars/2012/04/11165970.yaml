    description: "02-Apr-2012 05:08 PM Jonathan Crooke:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn our projects, ARC refactoring tool does not complete by displaying preview of converted sources. Clearing of pre-check phase works fine, proceeding to \"Convert to Automatic Reference Counting\" dialogue. Preview generation proceeds, but completes with \"No source changes necessary\" although sources are clearly not refactored for ARC\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nPreview section with refactored sources\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\"No source changes necessary\" drop down\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME-arc.migrate folder created, with \"remap\" file (attached) that points to sources in /private/var/folders/dl/j75n4q5146v2wdrblf646gsh0000gn/T/. These sources appear to be correctly converted, but Xcode does not pick these up\r\n\r\n02-Apr-2012 05:08 PM Jonathan Crooke:\r\n'remap' was successfully uploaded"
