    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nProperty list editor keys are not sorted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open a .plist file with Xcode 4.3.2.\r\n2) Try to sort the items (by clicking on the \"Key\" header.)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nItems sorted by key.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNothing changes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nProperty List Editor had the appropriate behavior: it always sorted the items in the file by key. If I really want to know the order of the keys in the file I can open the damn file as XML or whatever and look at it.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt's the little things that drive us crazy."
