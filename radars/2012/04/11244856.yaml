    description: "13-Apr-2012 10:07 AM Martin McClellan:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFor Photography workflow, it is important to assign different photos different ratings or flags. In an app such as iPhoto, you can flag photos as \"x\" for \"hidden\". However, since you cannot delete photos from any app but Photos (a reasonable precaution against consumer confusion and accidental deletion of important media), there needs to be a method by which a third-party app can flag photos for deletion in the Photos app. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen iPhoto and mark a photo as \"hidden\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOpening Photos allows you to see the photos that have been marked as \"hidden\" or tagged for deletion by iPhoto (or other third-party app), sort by them, and group delete them with proper UI warnings of the permanence of this action. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nPhotos app has no way of displaying which photos have been marked for deletion in third-party apps.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe retina iPad screen is a perfect tool for professional photographers, but without the tools to mark photos for deletion and easily be able to do so, its use is severely limited. Adding this single hook to the Photos app would be a great step forward for pro photographers using this in the field. \r\n\r\nCurrently, importing 1000 or more photos and doing a first-pass delete-or-keep and rating (common practice for most photographers or photography editors) and tagging them in any third-party app, including iPhoto, is time wasted because one would have to manually compare the photos marked for deletion in the third-party app to the items in Photos app. Since Photos app is deliberately (and smartly) very simple, allowing third-party apps to send information back to it about deletion selections would open up a huge ability for workflow improvement, and give the many third-party photography apps more powerful tools to offer their customers."
