    description: "03-Nov-2011 09:10 AM Mark Aufflick:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen selecting child elements of a cell based tableview in IB (ie. subviews of a prototype table cell view), the selection border and resize blue dots do not appear if the tableview is in a layer backed hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add a table view to a window\r\n2. Make the table view view based\r\n3. Add an element to the cell prototype\r\n4. Make the enclosing view layer backed\r\n5. Attempt to select the added subview\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIB should draw selection and resize indicators\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIB does not draw selection and resize indicators (although with the correct number of clicks/double-clicks the correct selection does indeed take effect).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI saw this same bug in beta versions of 4.2 also.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAs soon as you turn off layer backing, the selection works correctly again. You don't even need to close and re-open the nib file."
