    description: "10-Oct-2008 09:19 AM Timothy Wood:\r\nIn many places we are required to pass NSStrings to specify properties.  @property fixed some of this for KVC, but KVO still requires that we pass strings; be they directly written inline @\"...\" (which is error prone) or declared as global constants (which is less error prone, but requires more discipline and setup time).\r\n\r\nInstead, the @property system should support this directly by adding a tiny bit of syntax.\r\n\r\nOne possible syntax (not claiming this is best, just possible) might be:\r\n\r\n    object.@propname\r\n\r\nor even:\r\n\r\n    object@propname\r\n\r\nor still yet (since properties are instance only, this isn't ambiguous):\r\n\r\n    ClassName@propname\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would:\r\n\r\n  - Return a constant-NSString instance @\"propname\"\r\n  - Perform type checking to ensure that the object or class has the named property\r\n  - Work off the type of \"object\", so if object was nil, it'd still work.\r\n\r\nAnother possible take on this to make KVO even more bullet proof would be to have this syntax return a 'binding point' structure (see OmniFoundation's OFBinding.h) that contains the object and the key.  This would be useful in improving the API on KVO with this extension.\r\n\r\nFor example, you don't really want to write:\r\n\r\n     [object addObserver:self forKeyPath:object@propname options:xxx context:yyy];\r\n\r\nsince you then are writing 'object' twice and grave disorder will likely result if you mess that up.  The KVO API is kind of inverted anyway; a binding-point struct would make this cleaner:\r\n\r\n     [self startObserving:object@path options:xxx context:yyy];\r\n     [self stopObserving:object@path];\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented the same as the current API, but it is less verbose."
