    description: "03-Apr-2012 09:42 AM Lee Mallabone:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen installing a web clip as part of a configuration profile, if two profiles each contain a payload specifying the same web clip, then removing one of the profiles causes strange behavior: the web clip icon in the springboard can be tapped but will open a blank white screen without loading the web clip's URL.\r\n\r\nThis problem only occurs when a \"full screen\" web clip is used. When FullScreen is set to false in the web clip payload, the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install the attached webclipbug1 and webclipbug2 configuration profiles on an iPad2, iOS 5.1.\r\n2. Tap the 'Clip' icon. Note that it loads apple.com without issue.\r\n3. Remove one of the profiles\r\n4. Tap the 'Clip' icon. Note the blank white screen and absence of network activity indicator.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nEither that the web clip icon is completely removed, or that it is not removed until all configuration profiles that specify it have been removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter removing a single configuration profile that contains the web clip, the launch icon for that web clip launches to a blank white screen. Restarting the device automatically removes the faulty web clip.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe use case that this test case derives from is if several configuration profiles are installed on a device and a single web-based management UI should be installed regardless of which other configuration payloads are present and regardless of the number of configuration profiles that are installed."
