    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\niOS 5 lets the user add an Emoji keyboard to their list of available keyboards when editing any kind of text field. If using Messages.app, for example, with the Emoji keyboard visible, if the user switches to another app and immediately selects a text field with UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad set, the Emoji keyboard will be shown instead.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to switch out of the Emoji keyboard using the keyboard selector, this is not the preferred behavior for text fields that explicitly call for a UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad. It is understood that numeric input is expected, something that the Emoji keyboard does not provide.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn addition to English, choose Emoji (and perhaps an additional language, in my case I also have the Spanish keyboard) from the International/Keyboard setting in General.\r\n\r\nOpen Messages.app, switch to Emoji using the keyboard selection button. Hit Home button. Launch an app with a UITextField with keyboardType = UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA number pad (keyboard of type UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad) would be shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEmoji keyboard is shown.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUntested in iOS 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis is specially jarring to apps that place a subview over the empty \".\" button in the bottom left, as this subview will hide the Keyboard switch button when this bug occurs."
