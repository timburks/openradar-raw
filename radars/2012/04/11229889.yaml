    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\ntintColor should be animatable. The ability to briefly flash a button to a different color would enable some useful UI behaviors, such as hinting that the result of an action has had its effect in a view reached by touching the button.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n[UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^{aButtonBarItem.tintColor = [UIColor redColor];}];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe button bar item gradually turns red.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe button bar item is immediately red.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
