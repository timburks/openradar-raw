    description: "08-Apr-2012 01:05 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen typing into the Spotlight menu on my 13\" MacBook Air, the menu itself flickers back and forth between what should be displayed, and solid white.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the spotlight menu using the mouse or the keyboard\r\n2. Begin typing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe menu's contents update smoothly without intrusive flickering.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe menu's contents flash back and forth between solid white (wrong) and the actual contents of the menu on each keypress.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't know â€” I only purchased this MacBook Air yesterday. The same problem does not occur on my 2011 MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached a system config report for the MacBook Air, as well as a sample video showing the flicker. Thanks!\r\n\r\n08-Apr-2012 01:05 PM Tony Arnold:\r\n'Screen Recording.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n08-Apr-2012 01:06 PM Tony Arnold:\r\n'MacBook Air.spx' was successfully uploaded"
