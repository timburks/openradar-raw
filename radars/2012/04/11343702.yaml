    description: "28-Apr-2012 11:54 PM\r\nSummary:\r\nNFS mounts made through Disk Utility's \"NFS Mounts\" menu cannot be written to using Finder.  Finder plays the error sound if you try to rename a file on the mounted volume.  There are no problems when accessing the mounted volume using the command line.  The problem also does not manifest if volume is mounted manually with \"mount\" command in Terminal, or with cmd+k in Finder.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Set up NFS automount using e.g. Disk Utility:\r\n  Remote NFS URL: nfs://server/share\r\n  Mount location: /Volumes/share\r\n  Advanced Mount Parameters: <none>\r\n  Mount as read-only: unchecked\r\n  Ignore \"set user ID\" privileges: unchecked\r\n2. Click Verify and then Save.\r\n3. Try to drag a file to the mounted volume with Finder. A reboot may be required for the problem to manifest.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Finder should allow files to be copied to the volume or moved within the volume, as long as the user has proper permissions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Finder mounts the volume, but does not allow files to be copied to the volume or moved within the volume, even if user has write permissions.\r\n\r\nRegression: Worked in past OS X releases.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOthers experiencing problem on this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3330976"
