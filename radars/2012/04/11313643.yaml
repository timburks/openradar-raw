    description: "The documentation for -[NSPathCell allowedTypes] reads:\r\n\r\n\"An array of strings representing either file extensions or UTIs. Can be nil, the default value, allowing all types, or an empty array, allowing nothing.\"\r\n\r\n(Basically the same in both the header and the \"actual\" docs.)\r\n\r\nHowever, we have a NSPathControl whose cell's allowedTypes is an array containing just \"public.folder\", yet I'm allowed to select seemingly any file. As part of sanity-checking this, I set allowedTypes to an empty array, and received:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason '*** File types array cannot be empty'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you have against my sanity?"
