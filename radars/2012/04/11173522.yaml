    description: "Summary:\r\nFull Screen apps in Lion are awesome. Apps restoring their windows when relaunching is awesome. These features don't work together in Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen an Xcode project or workspace. Hit the full screen widget in the upper right corner. Quit Xcode. Relaunch Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project window that was open in a full screen space is restored to a full screen space.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes it works. Sometimes the project is restored to a non-full screen window. Sometimes the project is restored to a non-full screen window, and then a second or two later goes full screen (sometimes it then goes back to non-full screen). Other times it restores to a full screen space, except the space is black and every time you switch to that space it kicks you back to the space to the left, until several seconds later when Xcode finishes loading and your project is located in a non-full screen window\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has never worked reliably."
