    description: "11-Apr-2012 02:32 AM Markus Mueller:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Xcode Organizer under the Archives tab, displays the CFBundleShortVersionString in the meta data of an archive. It would be very helpful to also have the CFBundleVersion in there.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Xcode Organizer. Navigate to the Archives tab. Select an application on the left and an archive.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe meta data field shows the CFBundleVersion and the CFBundleShortVersionString in the versions field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt only shows the CFBundleShortVersionString.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n/\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe CFBundleVersion changes much more often than CFBundleShortVersionString. For example in my case it is always set to the count of all git revisions in the current working repository (to mimic something similar to the commit number in svn)."
