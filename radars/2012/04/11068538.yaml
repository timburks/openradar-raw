    description: "17-Mar-2012 02:53 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMail encourages users to archive their messages when they are done with them, but does not properly handle the folder where the messages are archived to. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Setup a Gmail account in Mail.app using IMAP;\r\n2. Archive a message;\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMessage is archived to \"All Mail\", or the user is given the choice of which remote folder/label they wish to archive to (much like the Bin, Sent, Drafts and Junk folders).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMail archives the message to a folder/label called \"[Imap]/Archive\", which is both unattractive and the incorrect location to store the message.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n04-Apr-2012 09:13 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
