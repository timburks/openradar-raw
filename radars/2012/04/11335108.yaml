    description: "27-Apr-2012 08:47 AM Eliot Landrum:\r\nSummary: Other mobile Exchange clients allow the user to select which Contact folder to sync to the phone. iOS syncs all of them and does not allow for disabling certain folders. This causes my address book to be filled with contacts that I do not want on my phone.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: In Settings, select which Exchange Contacts folders to sync.\r\n\r\nActual Results: In Settings, there is no option to select which folders to sync."
