    description: "29-Feb-2012 11:51 AM Karl Moskowski:\r\nSummary:\r\nViewing a full-screen HTML5 video from a zoomed page displays incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a page with an embedded HTML5 video.\r\n2. Double-finger double-tap your trackpad on an element near the video player so it zooms.\r\n3. Click play, then click the video player's full-screen button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe video should simply go into full-screen mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video goes into full-screen mode, but only the upper-left quadrant is shown.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe full-screen video is unzoomed if its page is also unzoomed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe size of the corner portion shown seems to be related to the zoom factor.\r\n\r\nThis is on a fully up-to-date install of Lion on a MBP 15 in clamshell mode with a LED Cinema Display and external keyboard and Magic Trackpad."
