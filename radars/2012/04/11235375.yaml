    description: "Summary:\r\nAlthough I regularly go through the effort of arranging the application icons by alphabetical order in my \"Launchpad\" screen, I find that many of the applications icons are always shuffled somewhat after a system reboot, or simply logging out / logging back into my account and are no longer in correct alphabetical order. This despite having added no new applications or making any other changes that could explain the discrepancy.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure you have a Mac OS X 10.7.3 system in working order with a good selection (20-30+) of installed third party apps.\r\n2. Go into Launchpad, arrange Apple's own apps in alphabetical order on the first Launchpad screen, then arrange third-party apps in alphabetical order in the second Launchpad screen\r\n3. Reboot your computer\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application icons in both Launchpad screens should still be arranged by alphabetical order, just as they were prior to rebooting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application icons in both Launchpad screens are no longer arranged by alphabetical order, with no predictable pattern — they are just randomly shuffled somewhat.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlthough Launchpad seems conceptually very similar to iOS's \"Springboard\" application launcher UI, I have personally never witnessed \"Springboard\" systematically forgetting the layout of application icons that I assign. I expect no less of Mac OS X Lion's Launchpad feature.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also verified that the Launchpad feature present in the second developer preview of Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) still exhibits this bug."
