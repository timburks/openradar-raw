    description: "Summary: Debugger won't attach to iOS app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Install Xcode 4.3.2.\r\n- Create a new iOS Master-Detail Application project and build it for your device (I'm using an iPad 3).\r\n- Put a breakpoint in the insertNewObject: method in the MasterViewController class.\r\n- Debug the app on the device.\r\n- Click the + button in the master view.\r\n- When the debugger stops at the breakpoint, press Control-R to build and run the app again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- App is killed off on the device, app re-runs under the debugger.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- App is killed off on the device, but new app will not launch. Console message is:\r\nerror: failed to launch '/Users/{Blah-Blah}/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/MyApp.app/MyApp' -- failed to send the qLaunchSuccess packet\r\nAt this point, usually only restarting the device lets you debug again.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure I've done those debugging steps in earlier versions of Xcode, such as Xcode 4.2, and this didn't happen.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Note this does not need a sample project, you can reproduce it with a brand-new Xcode project."
