    description: "Summary: When scrolling a zoomed-in page which has a page background image with \"position: fixed\", the background moves in reverse to the page.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n• Open a page with a fixed background image, like http://camerapedia.wikia.com/\r\n• Zoom in on the page\r\n• Scroll around a bit (while keeping the page background visible)\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The background doesn't move (as it's \"fixed\" by the CSS rules) or, at the very least, moves with the rest of the page.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The background moves in reverse in relation to the rest of the page.\r\n\r\nRegression: Has been happening for a while, even since 5.2. Also might occur on Mobile Safari, unable to test right now. Tested on a multitouch MacBook using spread gesture to zoom."
