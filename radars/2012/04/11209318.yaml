    description: "Summary:\r\nAllow users to enable/disable iCloud syncing for each 3rd party app individually at the same place where it is possible to enable/disable it for the default apps like contacts, calendar, reminders, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the settings app\r\n- Choose iCloud\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Each 3rd party app with iCloud entitlements should be listed\r\n- On/Off switch for each of these 3rd party apps\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- No 3rd party app with iCloud entitlements is listed\r\n- Only all 3rd party apps can be deactivated as a whole by disabling \"Documents & Data\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nInstead of having each app incorporate a setting individually, this should be handled in one place for clarity and avoiding confused users. If at a place it is possible for all standard iOS apps, it should be possible for 3rd party apps too. As already done with the location services in the global settings app."
