    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have a CoreData app based on NSPersistentDocument that uses SQLite as its datastore.  When I turn on Sandboxing I can open files that the user chooses, but cannot save to them. The app fails with a sandboxing error while it tries to write a journal file alongside. I don't have control over this file - this seems to be SQLite doing this. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen app, open data file using standard open file dialog. Make change. Sandbox error on save. Refuses to save.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nData saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo data saved.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe error seems to be:\r\n\tdeny file-write-create /Users/person/Desktop/File.phlgp-journal\r\n\r\nand the stack trace is included an attachment.\r\n\r\nIs there a temporary entitlement I can use to get around this, or are there plans to fix this in a future update?\r\n\r\nMany thanks"
