    description: "06-Dec-2011 01:45 AM Sam Deane:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis bug has been around for a few versions of XCode 4, I don't think it's new to 4.3\r\n\r\nWhen you right click on a group in the project navigator and choose \"Add Files To...\", in older versions of XCode the open file sheet that is shown would default to the location represented by the group.\r\n\r\nThis no longer happens - instead it seems to just default to where you last had it.\r\n\r\nThis is a serious usability issue. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you often work with multiple projects that both contain copies a common sub-project, you can easily get yourself into a big mess, thinking that you're adding files from one version of the sub-project when you're actually adding files from the other - thus accidentally creating absolute paths or links to files outside the project scope, and consequently breaking the build.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRight-click on an existing group folder (just a normal one, not a folder reference) in an existing project. Add a file to the project using the open file sheet that comes up.\r\n\r\nNow open another project, and right-click on an existing group folder in it. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe file select sheet that comes up should default to the location represented by the group you right-clicked on.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe file sheet defaults to the place where you last used it for the previous project.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
