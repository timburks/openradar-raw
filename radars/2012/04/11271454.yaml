    description: "18-Apr-2012 07:55 AM Phillip Regan:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nThe section \"Moving Content That Is Located Under the Keyboard\" is no longer functional under iOS 5, or there is something about the implementation of a UIScrollView that needs to be addressed in this document.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results: \r\n\r\nNothing happens during runtime despite all of the functions given fire properly and all variables are populated with their respective objects.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther mobile platforms handle the sliding of content out from under the keyboard *automatically* and does *not* require 30+ lines of code spread across a minimum of six functions on the part of the developer to manage themselves. This document represents a crack in iOS development that needs to be filled; keyboard-related layout issues should be handled by Apple.\r\n\r\n18-Apr-2012 07:56 AM Phillip Regan:\r\nThe URL for the documentation and code sample can be found here: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH5-SW7"
