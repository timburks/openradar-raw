    description: "I have customized appearances of navigation bar and button items, using [UINavigationBar appearance] and [UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn:[UINavigationBar class], nil].\r\n\r\nThe media player opened for video in UIWebView would inherit the appearance of UIBarButtonItem but not that of UINavigationBar. It results in a ugly default black navigation bar carrying not-fit-at-all customized \r\nUIBarButtonItems.\r\n\r\nI tried using [UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn:[UINavigationBar class], [MPMoviePlayerViewController class], nil] to revert my customization for media player, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nSo, please make inline media players of web view ignore UINavigationBar appearance."
