    description: "Summary:\r\nIn the dialog that confirms replacing an existing Directory when creating a new project, the order of the buttons is not in conjunction with the HIGs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new project and try to save on top of an existing directory.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA dialog that has the action button on the right and the cancel button on the left.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA dialog with reverse button order.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nQuote from the HIGs: \"A button that initiates an action is furthest to the right. This rightmost button, called the action button, confirms the main point of the dialog. The Cancel button is to the left of the action button.\"\r\n\r\nAdditional Note:\r\nI just actually lost data due to this by accidentally replacing a directory. This led me to discover that my time machine backup was (silently) broken since two weeks."
