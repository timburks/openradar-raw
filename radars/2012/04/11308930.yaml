    description: "I have an aging Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro that I use via USB with my iMac 27\". Despite being a great keyboard, the location of where the Command key and Option key are switched from where you'd expect from a Mac keyboard, and so I like to swap them in the Keyboard preferences. When, however, I unplug the keyboard to connect it to my work MacBook Pro and use the iMac as an external monitor, it forgets the settings; when I plug it in again, I have to re-specify those settings. (This does not recur if I simply unplug and plug back in the keyboard.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Plug in your USB keyboard (maybe specific to the Natural Keyboard Pro?) to your Mac.\r\n2) Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keysâ€¦ - Swap Command & Option keys & click OK.\r\n3) <Verify it works right>\r\n4) Unplug the keyboard.\r\n5) Use the iMac 27\" as an external monitor, e.g., through a MacBook Pro\r\n6) Disconnect the computer running as an external monitor.\r\n7) Reconnect USB keyboard\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nCommand and Option keys remain switched, and the Keyboard preferences' modifier keys dialog to reflect that.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCommand and Option keys have reverted back to normal.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis did not occur in 10.6."
