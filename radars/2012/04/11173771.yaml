    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a webview contains embedded video, and the video is playing full screen,  the topmost view controller receives no rotation callbacks, if the view controller is contained within a UINavigation Controller.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee the attached project. Look in -[GVTAppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] for how to tun the bug on and off.\r\n\r\nTo see the bug in action, run the project, play the video displayed on the web view. Maximise it to full screen. Rotate the device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe view controller should receive rotation callbacks (the sample app has logging on these).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe view controller does not receive rotation callbacks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot tested on prior versions.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIf the UIViewController is not part of a UINavigationController hierarchy, the callbacks are received."
