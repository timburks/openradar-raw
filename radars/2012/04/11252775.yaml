    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI upgraded to the developer preview for 10.7.4 11E46 and the volume of my bluetooth headset is substantially softer.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPair with Beats Wireless headset and max out volume. It's pretty soft.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe volume range should be much wider. Should be able to go much louder even though you might not want it that loud.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nVolume is too soft.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have the Beats Wireless headset. I've compared it against iOS and another Mac Book Pro running 10.7.3 instead, those volume ranges are much louder."
