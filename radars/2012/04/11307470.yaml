    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen multiple address book accounts are enabled ABAddressBook class will return persons and groups from all of them. It's not possible to tell which group can be assigned to which person. If a group belongs to source A and person to source B, adding person to group will fail. Primary issue is that it's not possible to tell if the action will fail beforehand. \r\n\r\nThere are also many functional limitations due to lack of source support which are supported in Address Book app but not in Address Book framework. For instance it's not possible to create groups/persons in sources other than default. \r\n\r\nSources are supported in iOS SDK since version 4.0 but unfortunately they are still lacking in OS X.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
