    description: "11-Apr-2012 11:27 AM Amy Worrall:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe documentation says that the value binding for an NSTokenField should supply an NSString or an NSNumber. However, if I bind the NSTokenField to something expecting a string, I get a crash since the NSTokenField supplies an array.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSTokenField in the UI editor of Xcode\r\n2. Create a controller with an NSString property\r\n3. Bind the token field's \"value\" binding to the controller's string property\r\n4a. Try setting the controller's string property in code to a string containing a comma separated list\r\n4b. Enter text in the token field including some commas, to make it produce tokens, then commit the editing\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4a. The comma separated list appears in the token field as separate tokens\r\n4b. The separate tokens are concatenated to form a comma separated list, which is assigned to the string property\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4a. Works as expected\r\n4b. I get a problem along the lines of the following:\r\n\r\nUnacceptable type of value for attribute: property = \"OccasionTags\"; desired type = NSString; given type = __NSArrayI; value = (\r\n    Elevenses,\r\n    \"Afternoon tea\"\r\n).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe token field, when changed by the user, passes an NSArray through its value binding. This contradicts the documentation, which states that the value binding is \"An NSString or NSNumber that is displayed as the content of the NSTokenField\". \r\n\r\nI suggest that NSTokenField be given an additional binding, valueArray, which should supply and take an array (i.e. the current behaviour of the value binding). Then, the value binding be amended so that it actually both supplies and consumes an NSString."
