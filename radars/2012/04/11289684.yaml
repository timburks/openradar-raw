    description: "20-Apr-2012 12:28 PM Mark Rada:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe AXSubrole value reported by quick look windows is \"Quick Look\". This does not follow the convention for naming roles and subroles which is used by all other accessibility objects (rdr://9689584 excepted).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open the Accessibility Inspector\r\n- Open a Finder window\r\n- Try to quick look a file\r\n- Inspect the Quick Look window with the accessibility inspector\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect that the quick look window follows the convention for naming roles and subroles. It should be something like \"AXQuickLook\" or \"AXQuickLookWindow\".\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe given subrole is \"Quick Look\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis makes developing tools which generate classes more difficult because there is now a new case that is not documented anywhere."
