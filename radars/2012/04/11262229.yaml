    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen drawing text that mixes Chinese and English text and a font attribute of Helvetica CoreText incorrectly falls back to bold Chinese glyphs. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Switch to Chinese Locale on an iOS Device.\r\n- Create an NSAttributedString that has Chines and English text and a CTFontRef for regular Helvetica.\r\n- Render the text.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe Chinese glyphs should be displayed in non-bold because CoreText consults the global font cascade table.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe font cascade incorrectly returns a bold font for the chines glyphs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI think that this was working correctly before iOS 5.0. Also note that there seem to be differences between Simulator and Device and different Locales. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSTHeitiSC-Light should be used as a cascade font for non-bold. Instead STHeitiSC-Medium is apparently used."
