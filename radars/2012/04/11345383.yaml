    description: "Summary: Text copied from any iOS multi-line text field and then pasted into a web form text area has its spaces replaced with &nbsp<space>. Causes interference with space-significant text such as Markdown or Python\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. enter text into an app, such as the built-in Notes app as follows:\r\n\"Some Text\r\n\r\n    Some code\r\n    some more code\r\n\r\nSome more text\"\r\n(note that the 2 indented 'code' lines are indented with 4 spaces)\r\n\r\n2. Select and copy all of the text\r\n\r\n3. John Gruber's Markdown Dingus is a handy test bed, load http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus in Mobile Safari\r\n\r\n4. Paste the copied text into the \"Markdown source\" text area and press the \"Convert\" button\r\n\r\n5. See \"HTML Source\" text area for results and below.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe above text *should* produce the following HTML:\r\n\r\n<p>Some Text</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Some code\r\nsome more code\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Some more text</p>\r\n\r\nThe indented lines are wrapped in <pre><code> tags.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis is the html produced instead:\r\n\r\n<p>Some Text</p>\r\n\r\n<p>    Some code\r\n    some more code</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some more text</p>\r\n\r\nbecause the spaces have been replaced with a space and a non-breaking space htmlentitiy, the spaces are not correctly interpreted by Markdown.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI have tested this with my iPhone 4 and The New iPad, both behave this way every time.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you paste the text and manually delete/replace the spaces before submitting the form, it works normally."
