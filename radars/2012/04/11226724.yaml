    description: "Summary:\r\nIt should be possible to use the dication feature of the new iPad by pressing a button on a Bluetooth keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPressing a key (in the top row) should activate dictation mode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTo use dictation, the user has to reveal the on-screen keyboard by pressing the Eject button first. Then he has to move his finger to the screen and press the dictation button. Finally, he has to move his hand back to the physical keyboard and press Eject again to hide the on-screen keyboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suggest using the F5 or F6 button for dictation. These buttons are unlabeled on an Apple Wireless Keyboard."
