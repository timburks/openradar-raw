    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nBy dragging the green program execution marker in the breakpoint margin of Xcode, it's possible to skip the execution of lines of code. For example, if the debugger has halted execution on line 1 of a file, dragging the green marker to line 5 will cause the program to not execute lines 1-4. This works well under GDB, but under LLDB lines 1-4 are unexpectedly executed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Place a breakpoint on a line of code that you'd like to skip.\r\n2. Run the application until the debugger breaks on that line of code, showing the green program execution marker.\r\n3. Drag the green marker to the line after the line that the debugger has stopped at.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe line of code that the debugger stopped on should not have been evaluated.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nUnder LLDB, all lines of code are evaluated.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nGDB works correctly, LLDB does not.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis could be related to the lack GDB's `jump LINENO` under LLDB. I've filed a separate radar for that, which can be found here rdar://11225086"
