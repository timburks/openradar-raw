    description: The "Text Editing" option "Use Escape key to show completion suggestions" on the "Editing" tab is rather confusing. It's the only keyboard binding that has a separate option, while all other bindings are found under "Key Bindings". Enabling this option makes Escape key behave exactly as configuring Escape key for "Show Completion List" in the key bindings, so why is an extra option even be necessary? Since multiple key bindings are possible for any action, there is no need to have an extra setting for Escape outside of the normal key binding list.
