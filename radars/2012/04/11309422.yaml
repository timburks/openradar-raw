    description: "Summary:\r\nMost of the time, when receiving email from Apple (iTunes Store receipts, product announcements, etc.), the Mail app on iPhone crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nReceive a notification or manually launch the Mail app. Sender/subject line indicate email is (e.g.) from iTunes Store and is a receipt\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMail opens message and displays contents\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nMail crashes. This manifests as the notification disappearing and reappearing repeatedly as the system tries to relaunch the crashed process, or simply as the Mail app crashing and exiting. NOTE: when launching the app directly, the message is shown in the list with its sender and subject line, but whenever the (3-line) summary is about to be displayed, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown. I didn't see this before iOS 5, but see Notes below.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI run my own MTA (Citadel) for all the addresses affected by this crash. I never saw this crash before I started operating my own mail server. However, I don't experience crashes when receiving mail from email addresses other than those @apple.com and @itunes.com. Even more oddly, once the app has crashed, it will occasionally work on the second, third or fourth try."
