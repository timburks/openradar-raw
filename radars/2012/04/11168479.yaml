    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere is a handy to use but undocumented feature in iOS 5's Game Center Turn based Notification system. You can add a file named GKInvite.wav/caf/aif into your application bundle that iOS will play when you get a Game Center notification. This is currently undocumented so it's use in applications being allowed is questionable. \r\n\r\nIt was discovered by someone on the DevForums who said Apple said it was safe to use, but still is second hand info so very questionable. \r\n\r\nhttps://devforums.apple.com/message/614193\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch for GKInvite in iOS 5's Documentation\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFind documentation on the GKInvite sound file somewhere\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCan't find any reference to it, if it wasn't for a DevForums post we'd never know about it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nSince iOS 5 added Game Center notifications\r\n\r\nNotes:"
