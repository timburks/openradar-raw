    description: "30-Mar-2012 07:24 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis is a follow up to Bug ID# 11192519.  After further investigation it has been determined that this is a known issue, which is currently being investigated by engineering.  This issue has been filed in our bug database under the original Bug ID# 11090922. \r\n\r\nMarked as Dup of #11090922\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSummary: Apple is making users aware of when an application is accessing the users' contacts. That's good. However, the Me card is a special entity, used by apps for all manner of useful things (for example, auto-filling email addresses). Developers need SOME way to have the user's basic information accessible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Try to access the Me card.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The user should not be terrified by a scary dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:The user IS terrified by a scary dialog.\r\n\r\nRegression: In 10.7 and earlier, developers could access and use this information to smooth things for users.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThere are other options to handle this, and they may be fine. The Me card should be viewed as a special, accessible entity, but failing that, providing SOME way for the user's basic info to be auto-filled is needed."
