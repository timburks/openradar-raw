    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen stroking paths Quartz draws incorrect line joins in flipped contexts.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRun provided test project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe test project creates an image of a red and a green path. The red path is stroked into the untransformed bitmap context. Before the green path is stroked, the context is flipped. Both paths should be identical.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe red path is correct. The green path has a clipped (round) line join at the bottom.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSame behavior on Mac OS X as on iOS."
