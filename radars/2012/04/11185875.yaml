    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nawakeFromInsert is called twice on a managed object subclass if the object is crated in a nested MOC and save is called on that MOC.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project (http://cl.ly/281T0B3L2s0R2g2K2L24), which overrides awakeFromInsert on the Event NSManagedObject subclass.\r\n2. Build and run the project.\r\n3. Add a new entry by pressing the \"+\" button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA single \"awakeFromInsert called\" message to appear in the debug output.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n2 messages appear in the debug output.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis appears to violate the documentation at http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdManagedObjects.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003397-SW2 which says, \"awakeFromInsert is invoked only once in the lifetime of an objectâ€”when it is first created\"\r\n\r\nWhat the \"lifetime\" of an object is here is not exactly clear, but the code sample at that link implies that you can use awakeFromInsert to set a creation date value on your MO. If the method is called twice, it's not clear which value should be used for the creation date.\r\n\r\nThis becomes more complicated if awakeFromInsert is used to create additional MOs and establish relationships. When the method is invoked the second time, it leads to extra MOs being created."
