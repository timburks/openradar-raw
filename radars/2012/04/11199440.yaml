    description: "06-Apr-2012 09:13 AM Stephen Moser:\r\nSummary: When using the iPhone 4.3 Simulator Version 5.1 (272.21) with Xcode Version 4.3.2 (4E2002) the simulator reports this message to console when trying to access location services: \"server did not accept client registration 68\". The result is that the simulator is not able to accept a custom location through the debug->location menu option.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use the iPhone 4.3 Simulator Version 5.1 (272.21) with Xcode Version 4.3.2 (4E2002) and run an application that uses CLLocationManager to access location data.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: CLLocationManager returns a location that is specified in the simulator's  debug->location menu option.\r\n\r\nActual Results: CLLocationManager's delegate method \r\n\r\n- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation {\r\n\r\n is not called and \"server did not accept client registration 68\" is reported to console.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niPhone 4.3 Simulator Version 5.1 (272.21) with Xcode Version 4.3.2 (4E2002) \r\n\r\nThis problem did not occur in Xcode 4.2\r\n\r\nNotes: Currently I am using this workaround which adds a category to the CLLocationManager class.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.bignerdranch.com/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=2069"
