    description: "12-Apr-2012 11:54 AM Michael Jumper:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn Safari on iPad, when using drawImage() to copy a rectangle of image data from one canvas to another, the drawImage() call runs asynchronously, allowing further draw operations on the source canvas without ensuring that the previous drawImage() call has actually finished. Further drawing on the source canvas has a random chance of affecting the result of a previous drawImage() call.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nView the following test page in iPad Safari: http://guac-dev.org/pub/tests/async-test.html\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe test page renders correctly, as a 27x27 grid of circles, where each row is identical, and each column is unique.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe colorization of the circles in the grid is random, as drawing to the source canvas after a drawImage() call has a random chance of affecting the result of that call.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee attached reference image for expected results."
