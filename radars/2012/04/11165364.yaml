    description: "02-Apr-2012 09:00 AM Jonathan Sibley:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI updated my app's name on iTunes Connect and within the build configuration settings a few weeks ago, but the old name continues to appear in Game Center (including, but not limited to GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController, Game Center app, GKAchievementViewController).  I also changed the 512x512 icon in iTunes connect, but the old icon also persists in Game Center.  My app has not been published to the app store yet, so perhaps this is a Game Center sandbox-only issue.\r\n\r\nThe new app name is [redacted] and the old name is [redacted]\r\n\r\nThe app's Apple ID is [redacted].\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, but I did not create a new app, set up Game Center, and try to change the app's name and icon to reproduce this.  I can, however, say that the old app name and icon appear in Game Center every time in my app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nGame Center to use the current app name and icon, as listed in iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGame Center always uses the old app and icon.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
