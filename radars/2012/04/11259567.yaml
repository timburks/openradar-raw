    description: "16-Apr-2012 03:57 PM:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nOn iOS 5.1 (9B179), the Calendar application will post a notification/alert for an instance of a repeating event even if that instance has been deleted.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Open the Calendar application in any way.\r\n\r\n2. Create a repeating event with the [+] button, or by pressing and holding any day in the Month view. \r\n       - Type something into the Title field\r\n       - Set the repeat to something other than Never.\r\n       - Also set an alert.\r\n\r\n3. Navigate to and delete an instance of the newly created repeating event. Make sure it is not the first instance of that event.\r\n\r\n4. Wait until the notification for the deleted instance is supposed to be posted.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nThe notification does not post because its event no longer exists.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe alert will post. If the user taps View on the phantom notification, he/she is taken to the Calendar application, where the event isn't visible because it does not exist.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nOnly tested on iPhone 4S 16 GB black and iPod Touch 1st generation 16 GB (iOS 3.1.3). This bug was NOT present on the iOS 3.1.3 device.\r\n\r\nBoth devices were syncing their calendars with iCal on my Mac (OS X 10.7.3 build 11D50).\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nnone"
