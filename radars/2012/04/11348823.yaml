    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode decides to start Running when I tell it to Step too quickly.  Yes, technically, \"running\" is merely \"stepping\" very fast, but Xcode should not interpret my commands in this manner.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I have a method with breakpoints configured as shown in the attached screenshot (<http://is.gd/o48IDB>).\r\n2. The first breakpoint gets hit.\r\n3. I start single-stepping through the code (I have mapped ^-S to the Product > Debug > Step Over command).\r\n4. I start stepping rapidly, like maybe 5 - 10 times in rapid succession (I am NOT holding down the keys, so no auto-repeat).\r\n5. Before I can exit the for-loop (as shown in the attachment) Xcode has decided to Run, instead of listening to my repeated Step commands.\r\n6. Furthermore, Xcode seems to have become detached from the running executable, as none of the remaining breakpoints are hit, nor can I Stop the executable from Xcode anymore (pressing the Stop button does absolutely nothing).  I have to force-quit Xcode to make it start behaving again.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Instead of using a key command in #3, rapidly clicking the step-over button in the debugger toolbar behaves the same way: many fast clicks in a row causes it to start running instead of continuing to step.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect Xcode to respect my commands, as described above.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt doesn't, as described above.  BTW, this is with LLDB; not sure if it happens with GDB or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI can never recall this ever happening in Xcode 3.x.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
