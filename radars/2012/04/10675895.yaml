    description: "11-Jan-2012 04:07 PM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nNumbers such as +49 179 1234567 are not resolved with the name in the Address Book. Messages displays the number instead of the name, even if I start a conversation by selecting a phone number from the address book.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I re-assign the number to a contact by tapping the Contact button within the conversation and adding the number a second time, the title remains the number and is not replaced by the name.\r\n\r\nRegression: Saw this problem in iOS 4.0 already.\r\n\r\n17-Jan-2012 11:45 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nJust made a test: The name is displayed in the ringer display but not in the Calls list.\r\n\r\nIt seems that all incoming calls are not resolved in the Calls list. OTOH, outgoing calls are correctly resolved if the number is in the AddressBook.\r\n\r\nI should add that I save all numbers in international format (e.g. +49 89 1234567)."
