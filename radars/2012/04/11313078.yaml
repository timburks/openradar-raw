    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile using Quotebook, an iOS Core Data iCloud app that follows the Library model in iPhoneCoreDataRecipies, occasionally, transaction logs fail to sync, producing errors and halting the syncing process of other logs indefinitely.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect iCloud Core Data frameworks to be able to handle the transaction logs it creates.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOccasionally the framework throws hundreds of exceptions attempting to insert a nil key into a dictionary which prevents syncing from occurring.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached are screenshots, a log of the console, and the extracted bad transaction file which I retrieved from Library/Mobile Documents/.\r\n\r\n24-Apr-2012 06:55 PM Matt Bischoff:\r\n'iCloud Radar.zip' and 'iCloud Failing Console Log.txt' were successfully uploaded"
