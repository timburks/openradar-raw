    description: "MPMoviePlayerController doesn't provide any way to dismiss video if it is playing an audio-only stream\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAn MPMoviePlayerController whose view has been added to my view controller's view and whose controlStyle has been set to MPMovieControlStyleFullscreen normally shows a toolbar with a 'done' button that allows me to dismiss the movie player whilst it is playing a video. However if the video being played is a HTTP Live Streaming video and the movie player has switched to an audio-only stream, the toolbar and 'done' button are no longer shown and there is no way to dismiss the video.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a UIViewController subclass that initialises an MPMoviePlayerController, sets its controlStyle to MPMovieControlStyleFullscreen and adds the movie player's view to its view. Start playing a HTTP Live Streaming video that includes an audio-only stream. Use Network Link Conditioner to simulate a slow connection so the movie player switches to the audio-only stream.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is some way to dimsiss the video player (either by continuing to show the toolbar and 'done' button that is shown when playing one of the video streams or by providing a notification to my view controller so I can add a toolbar).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe playback controls change to a single black bar in the middle of the view with a play/pause button and no toolbar or 'done' button to dismiss the player (see attached sample project and screen shot).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis doesn't seem to be a problem with MPMoviePlayerViewController (but I don't wish to use this class as my view controller displays other content before video playback starts)."
