    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I'll often use breakpoint actions or the debugger REPL to return early from functions/methods with a particular return value. Under GDB, this is possible by setting a continuing breakpoint with a breakpoint action, where the action is `return <expr>`. There is no such `return` command available under LLDB.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion of a `frame-return` or `thread-return` on the LLDB-dev mailing list in July 2011, however I'm not sure if the patch was ever accepted. Email thread starts here:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/lldb-dev/2011-July/000493.html\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLook for an equivalent to GDB's `return <expr>` command.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFind an equivalent.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nDont' find an equivalent :-)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression, because something that was previously possible under GDB is no longer possible under LLDB.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
