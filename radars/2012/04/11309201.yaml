    description: "24-Apr-2012 10:51 AM Tom Harrington:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn an iOS device with iTunes match enabled, the device will fill with music until it interferes with device operation.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on iTunes match on an iOS device\r\n\r\n2. Play music for a long time, until Settings --> General --> About --> Available shows \"0 bytes\". (Alternately, go to the Music app and tap the download button for tracks until 0 bytes are available).\r\n\r\n3. Attempt to record a video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSince iTunes match is able to download tracks to the device, and since this happens transparently to the user, iTunes match would have some system to automatically remove downloaded tracks in low storage situations or to otherwise allow normal device operation to continue. (For example, limiting downloaded tracks to some configurable maximum total storage amount, or clearing tracks automatically when available storage drops below some threshold). Downloaded tracks are essentially a local cache of content available via the internet and could be safely removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe device reports that it cannot record video due to lack of storage space. Since the user has not explicitly added iTunes match tracks to the device, it can be confusing as to why this has happened and what to do about it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone, as far as I'm aware iTunes match has always been like this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAttached screenshots:\r\n\r\nscreenshot-1.PNG: Message displayed on iPhone 4s when attempting to record video while the device is full of iTunes match tracks.\r\n\r\nscreenshot-2.png: The \"about\" screen at this time showing 0 bytes available.\r\n\r\nscreenshot-3.PNG: iOS storage showing 18.1GB consumed by music (all iTunes match tracks).\r\n\r\nscreenshot-4.PNG: Music settings on the device showing iTunes match active.\r\n\r\nscreenshot-5.png: Device storage as indicated by iTunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n24-Apr-2012 10:51 AM Tom Harrington:\r\n'Archive.zip' and 'iphone 4s.deviceinfo' were successfully uploaded"
