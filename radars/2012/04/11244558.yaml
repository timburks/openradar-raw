    description: "13-Apr-2012 05:03 PM Sam Deane:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen building a target with some custom shell script phases, Xcode seems to sometimes become stuck whilst running one of them.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBuild/run a project with a custom shell script phase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe project builds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode says something like \"Running 1 of 1 custom shell scripts\".\r\n\r\nEditing etc continues to work, but the build is stalled. Pressing the stop button does not stop the build. Nor does quitting Xcode.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
