    description: "Messages sent via iMessage, to phone numbers or emails, often arrive after an extreme delay. Just now, my iPad notified me of an iMessage that was sent 3.5 hours ago. The problem seems intermittent and unrelated to any specific combination of iMessage apps, contact methods, or anything else I have control over. It has persisted since the introduction of the iMessage service. As the service is, to the user, a black box, I'm unable to provide any more details or debugging info.\r\n\r\nThis is a reliability issue that, if persistent, could lead to a serious loss of trust in the service."
