    description: "Summary: When you configure a Mac or Apple TV's Home Sharing account you need to have internet access, presumably to allow validation against Apple's servers for some reason. This is fine until you don't have connectivity for some reason (a crappy ISP is usually the reason for me) and then, if something happens you cannot re-configure Home Sharing so cannot watch Apple TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Disconnect yourself from the internet and try to set up Home Sharing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: You should be able to set it up.\r\n\r\nActual Results: You can't.\r\n\r\nRegression: The next time BT screw up my broadband connection and I mess something up and break my Home Sharing configuration and my daughter cannot watch anything on Apple TV and becomes a nightmare I'm Fedexing her to Cupertino.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
