    description: "20-Jul-2011 10:53 AM W Lewis:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe drag pasteboard that Mail.app supplies when you drag a mail message out of a viewer should include the mail message itself as data.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet up a NSView as a drag destination. Drag a message out of the list of messages (upper-right pane of the normal mail viewer window). Examine the types available on the drag pasteboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne of the types should be an RFC(2)822-formatted message.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNone of the pasteboard types contain message data.\r\n\r\nThere is a message: URI on the pateboard, but NSURLConnection/etc is not able to retrieve the message using that URI, so it's not terribly useful.\r\n\r\nThe closest thing is a file promise for the 'eml' file type.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, that file will contain the RFC822-formatted message, and 'eml' is registered to a UTI that is also rfc/822. So it's possible for an application to retrieve the message that way. However, an application should not have to depend on knowing this odd behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n13-Jan-2012 11:52 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\n[ Closed, status set to Behaves Correctly - I assume that means WONTFIX ]"
