    description: "To a user at seemingly \"random\" times, while doing absolutely nothing (e.g., at the home screen, in another app), iOS will ask for the password for the user's Apple ID. Thus far I've parameterized this to occur when iCloud is trying to keep things (apps, music, etc.) in sync after some amount of time has passed.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is a serious issue. The prompt is \"valid\" insofar as it's legitimately from you guys, and is presumably being displayed by necessity. That being said, the prompt has NO explanation and does not obviously occur from a user-prompted action. This simultaneously creates a dangerous scenario — you are conditioning users to blindly enter their password for no apparent reason — AND it's a user-experience nightmare, as the user is now forced to deal with this modal dialogue that they've done nothing to invoke."
