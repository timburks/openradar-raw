    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen receiving multimedia iMessages (a photo or a video) over a slow connection they will either not show up at all (if a video is being downloaded over EDGE and one later switches to WiFi) or will show up in an incorrect order  (as demonstrated by opening the iMessage on another device or by looking at the sender's device) \r\n \r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Send a text iMessage to someone\r\n2. Send a multimedia iMessage to someone\r\n3. Send a text iMessage to someone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe messages show up on the device in the order they were sent, maybe with a loading bar to represent the multimedia iMessage's download process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe two text messages show up first and the multimedia shows up later (after it is finished downloading)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAlways occurs\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've attached a screenshot showing the messages coming up out of order. The Mac sent the messages and the iPhone received them."
