    description: "Summary: It is impossible to add a highlight color (e.g. yellow) to text in Pages for iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nExhibit A: Trying to highlight text using Pages for iPad.\r\n1. Open Pages for iPad.\r\n2. Create a document.\r\n3. Type some text.\r\n4. Select the text.\r\n5. Look in the toolbar for a highlight function.\r\n\r\nExhibit B: Verify whether Pages can display highlighted text\r\n1. Open Pages '09 on a Mac.\r\n2. Create a document.\r\n3. Type some text.\r\n4. Select the text.\r\n5. Highlight the text in bright yellow, or any other color.\r\n6. Save the document to the Desktop, or any other location on the file system.\r\n7. Visit icloud.com\r\n8. Click on iWork\r\n9. Drag the document into the browser window\r\n10. Wait for the document to show up on Pages for iPad\r\n11. Open the document on Pages for iPad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExhibit A: Pages for iPad should have the basic functionality of highlighting.\r\nExhibit B: Because Pages can't add highlighting, it is expected that it cannot display it either.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExhibit A: Surprisingly, Pages for iPad does not have the ability to add highlighting. It only has the ability to change text color.\r\nExhibit B: Surprisingly, Pages for iPad *can* display highlighted text. It just can't add it.\r\n\r\nRegression: Pages for Mac supports highlighting text.\r\n\r\nNotes: This bug is serious because functionality is greatly affected, and there is no convenient workaround besides going through the iCloud dance. The impact of this bug may be nullified in the future with the release of OS X Mountain Lion and an iWork suite for Mac that supports iCloud Documents & Data. For now, however, this bug remains serious."
