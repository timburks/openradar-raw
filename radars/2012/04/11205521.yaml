    description: "Summary:\r\nWithout direct access to current keyboard status — whether the keyboard is shown and its frame — some situations can not be handled, and here is an example.\r\n\r\nIn view A, I have a text field. I tap a control to push in a new view controller B. View B only has a text view whose frame should be adjusted to accommodate the keyboard, and I always set the text view to be the first responder and the keyboard should show immediately when view B is pushed in.\r\n\r\nI do the usual keyboard notification handling in view controller B. So if the keyboard is not shown before view B is pushed, there is no problem. However, if the text field in view A is the first responder and the keyboard is already shown when I push in view controller B, I won't receive UIKeyboardWillShowNotification/UIKeyboardDidShowNotification.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
