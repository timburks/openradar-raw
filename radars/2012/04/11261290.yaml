    description: "17-Apr-2012 12:44 PM Mark Aufflick:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn earlier iOS versions there was an undocumented notification PLCameraViewIrisAnimationDidEndNotification when the camera iris opened.\r\n\r\nIgnoring whether this is or isn't useful in an application logic, it is very useful for automated UI testing to avoid an arbitrary timer delay which is bad coding and leads to false negatives.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way (I believe for shipping code as well as UI testing, but certainly for testing) to detect when the iris has openend.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAttempt to determine in code when the presented camera controller iris animation has completed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThere is a way\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThere isn't a way.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThere used to at least be an undocumented way, the PLCameraViewIrisAnimationDidEndNotification notification, which was perfectly fine for UIAutomation testing.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
