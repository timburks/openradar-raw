    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe buddy list in Messages beta intermittently loses all the buddies, leaving a blank window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% certain of this but I use my Mac Book at work and home with and without an external monitor. The bug appears related to the changing screens and screen sizes. At some point the window gets made very small, perhaps after unplugging the external screen that the window was on. After this the buddies sometimes disappear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWindow doesn't change size (significantly) and buddies remain visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWindow becomes small and buddies disappear.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nQuitting and re-launching Messages appears to fix the problem."
