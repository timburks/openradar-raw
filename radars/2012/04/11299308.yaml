    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode 4.4 adds in automatic closing syntax when a closing punctuation is typed. E.g. type `[` and automatically `]` is added after the insertion cursor. So far, I have discovered that you can use the normal \"tab-to-autocomplete\" that is familiar from Xcode code sense. However, if you have a method with unfilled arguments later in your code and try to tab-complete the closing syntax, the insertion cursor jumps to the field instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Type `NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObj`\r\n2. Choose the method \"dictionaryWithObjects: forKeys:\" from the code sense drop down\r\n3. Think \"oh, derp. I need to go make two arrays\"\r\n4. Back up a line and type `NSArray *objects = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"herp\", @\"derp\", nil`\r\n5. You are now at the end of what you want to type and you want to autocomplete the `]` that's on the other side of your insertion cursor - so hit the tab key\r\n6. Insertion cursor jumps down to the `NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects: forKeys:]` line\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter step 5, I expect to hit the tab key, have the closing syntax autocompleted for me so I can then type a semicolon and then tab AGAIN to get to the argument of the method I'm not done with.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSee attached annotated screen grab\r\n\r\n23-Apr-2012 09:36 AM Evan DeLaney:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-04-23 at 9.27.20 AM.jpg' was successfully uploaded"
