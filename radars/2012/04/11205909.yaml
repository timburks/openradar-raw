    description: "Summary: When trying to load a page that isn't quite loading (page timeout probably impeding), a click on the \"Stop\" button in the address/search bar causes the loading page's address to be cleared from the address bar. This prevents the user from ever loading the page again without going back and forces them to hunt for the link one more time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Find a page that loads slowly and takes a while to even load anything into the browser. Open it.\r\n2. Stop loading (via the button in the address/search bar) the page before it has fully done so. \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Loading stops. The requested URL is kept in the address bar to allow the user to perform any of these actions:\r\n• Retry loading the page by pressing Return on the address bar or by clicking a Reload button\r\n• Bookmark the page for visiting later\r\n• Copy the URL and try it in another browser (in case Safari has glitched out)\r\n\r\nActual Results: Loading stops. The address/search bar is cleared (\"Search Google or enter an address\" is displayed). Any of the above actions are disabled/impossible, most importantly the ability to try loading the page again."
