    description: "iCal's menu of alert times for an event is prepopulated with a list of time spans. They are bizarre and fairly useless - 352 hours? Why?\r\n\r\nI'm attaching an example screenshot showing times that a) I've never used before, b) I will never ever want to use. \r\n\r\niOS's approach of showing a hardcoded list of meaningful, sensical times is far better. We could still have the option of overriding it with custom times, but the offered list should be useful in some way."
