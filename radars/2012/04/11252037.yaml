    description: "Summary:\r\nOver the life of an iOS device, it may only be used on 3 iCloud accounts. If an attempt is made to log in to a fourth account the device responds with a message similar to \"Cannot sign in.  The maximum number of free accounts have been activated on this iPad.\" Even restoring the device to factory settings does not fix it. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Set up an iCloud account on a new device.\r\n2. Delete that account, and set up another.\r\n3. Repeat until you reach the fourth account.\r\n4. Receive the error message described above.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOver a device's life (especially with an iPad) it may easily belong to several people with different iCloud accounts. There should not be a limit on the number of accounts associated with a device, or this count should be easy to reset.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUnintuitive and user-hostile error messages, with no workaround or solution other than to resort to Apple support.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
