    description: "There is currently no support for an authenticated encryption mode (i.e. GCM, CCM, EAX, OCB) in CommonCrypto. This encourages many developers to not provide authenticated encryption at all (defaulting most often to AES-CBC), or forces them to implement their own encrypt-than-MAC implementation.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be available on both Mac and iOS to encourage correct use of authenticated encryption."
