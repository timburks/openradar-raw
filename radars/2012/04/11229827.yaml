    description: "For workspaces with a large number of schemes, either because of a particularly complex project, or because a variety of dependent projects are involved, it would be handy to be able to impose some visual organization on the schemes menu.\r\n\r\nI suggest at a minimum, a special \"divider\" type item. In the \"Edit Schemes\" UI, the gear menu popup could offer a special command \"Add Divider Item\". This item would be organizable in the list just like proper schemes, but would not actually *be* a scheme.\r\n\r\nGoing one step further, it would be great if schemes were organizable hierarchically. I don't know whether this would be best accomplished with explict user-defined groups, or with \"smart\" groups that automatically group schemes in the menu e.g. under headings for the project they belong to, or what."
