    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen prompted by the OS X system to enter a password for encryption the dialog can be crashed by entering a specific value.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Disk Utility\r\n2. Select to create a New Image from Folder\r\n3. Choose a folder and set the Image Format to \"compressed\" and Encryption type to \"256-bit AES encryption…\"\r\n4. When prompted enter the following digits into the password field…\r\n5. \"52553343667\" (without quotes).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe password field should be populated with the typed string, and allow you to enter the password into the 2nd field for confirmation.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe password prompt crashes and an error \"-60008\" is returned.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNote that this appears to occur anywhere on the system when a password prompt is invoked in order to create a password for encryption. It can also be reproduced in the Keychain Access app when exporting a key.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on 2 different systems running OS X Lion 10.7.3 with identical results."
