    description: "Summary:\r\nin iOS 5.1, a split view source list can be presented while in vertical orientation by swiping in from the left (single finger). This is different from iOS 5.1, where it was previously presented by a popover bar button item.\r\n\r\nWhen you have detail view content such as a UITableViewController subclass, it can be difficult to perform standard actions such as swiping cells to delete. A single swipe will activate the source list appearance from the left rather than perform the swipe gesture on the cell in the split view detail view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate iPad app with split view controller. UITableViewController subclasses in both source view and detail view. Perform swipe gesture on detail view cell.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSwipe should be captured by the detail view cell and forwarded to the table view delegate.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSwipe activates the source list view from left\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not happen in iOS 5.0 due to using popover.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe gesture to show the source list should be more like activating Notification Center - performing swipe starting from screen bezel and bringing into viewport."
