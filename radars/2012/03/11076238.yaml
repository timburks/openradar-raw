    description: "Summary: QuickLook window in Finder doesn't redraw its content when going through more picture files (one by one) that have same type and dimensions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Select one picture file in Finder's window in directory, where are more picture files with same file type and dimensions. Press spacebar to launch QuickLook window, press arrow key to select next or previous file (doesn't matter which one). If the newly selected file has same file type and dimensions, the content of the QuickLook window won't be redrawn.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: QuickLook window should redraw its content with each newly selected file.\r\n\r\nActual Results: QuickLook window doesn't redraw its content if newly selected file is picture file of the same type and dimensions as was the previously selected file.\r\n\r\nRegression: I've noticed this problem on OS X 10.7.2 (which was the first version of 10.7 I've used) and it persists also on OS X 10.7.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\nWe can't reproduce that. Can you please attach more pictures that reproduce this problem?\r\n\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\nDid you use fast user switching?\r\nAnswer: YES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDuplicate of bug nr. \"9536151\"."
