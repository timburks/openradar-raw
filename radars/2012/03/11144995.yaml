    description: "Summary: \r\nThere is no way to filter your list of friends who has the game and can be invited to the game. Right now the game lists a long list of all your friends, which can get very long, and no way to only show friends who own the game before inviting them.\r\n\r\nThe only way we see to make this a bit better is that if your game has a Leaderboard it'll show if that user is ranked in the game's Leaderboards, but it still requires you to scroll thru this list to find the users. Simply grouping the friends list table by friends with and without the game would solve this problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to find a friend to play a game against you in a Game Center Turn by Turn enabled game.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt'll show just the friends who has the game you want to play, the users who don't have it are seperated out to another area so if you wanted to you could tell them about the game as you can today. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt shows all the users who are your friend on Game Center, not the ones who own that game. \r\n\r\nSee attached image of the existing list of friends that doesn't indicate who does or doesn't have that game, it actually makes it look like everyone has the game by saying \"Not ranked\". \r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/173N2N3q1j3g2J2y3L2q\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS 5.0 introduced Turn Based Notifications\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
