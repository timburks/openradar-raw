    description: "Summary: The xib editor in Xcode 4.3 (4E109) fails to save the Autoshrink setting for UILabel instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. create a new project with at least 1 xib file.\r\n2. add a UILabel to the xib, make sure Autoshrink is checked for that UILabel\r\n3. save and close the xib file (leaving the rest of the project open)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nA. The xib file on disk will show the autoshrink key set to YES.\r\nB. The autoshrink property will still be set to YES in the xib editor when the file is re-opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA. The xib file on disk does not record that autoshrink should be YES.\r\nB. Therefore, the autoshrink property is set to NO upon reopening the xib file in the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI have not tested whether this worked correctly in previous versions of Xcode\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
