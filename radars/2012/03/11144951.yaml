    description: "Summary:\r\nDupe of rdar://10127439 \r\n\r\nBasically there is a lack of a working way to programatically create a rematch between two Game Center users. Users must already be friends and then they have to go thru our menus and then the GC to setup their first match or rematch the last player. If we had a way to do this programatically it could be done in one button touch instead of the numerous ones that are required today.\r\n\r\nGKMatchRequest has a playersToInvite array that doesn't do anything when the match request is passed into a GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController.  If this were to handle passing player GKPlayer objects and create a rematch it'd be much more ideal than how the flow works today.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate a GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController using a GKMatchRequest with playersToInvite set to your Game Center account and another's object by using their Game Center ID.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect to get a Game Center Turn Based Match setup between those users\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI get a Game Center match with the other player slot empty.\r\n\r\nSo because this method doesn't work, users have to go thru the entire game setup steps to setup a rematch. See attached image of the two existing flow compared to what would be more ideal. \r\n\r\nIMAGE: http://cl.ly/2q2i2a0p2z3M3X2j2t0b\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS 5.0 introduced Turn Based Notifications\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
