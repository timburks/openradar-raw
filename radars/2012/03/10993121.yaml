    description: "06-Mar-2012 10:43 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSometimes when I have an editor open for my .m file, and the header showing in the assistant editor, I go to paste some code in the main editor, and the editor locks up for a time after the paste. The rest of the interface is still working, the assistant editor works, but the main editor is hung. After a few minutes, it starts responding again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPaste some text. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould let me keep editing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nHangs for a bit.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\r\nThat seems a bit unfair ;-)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is something to do with the static analyzer checking my code. Once the editor started responding again, there was a warning on the line."
