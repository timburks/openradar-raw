    description: "Hi bug screener,\r\n\r\nI'm filing a few bugs on Radar today. Please take a moment to dupe these out properly. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics, so please do me this small favor.) (These all belong to an umbrella bug \"Make Radar better!\" bug that I'll save last and comment withÂ the number for, if you'd like to add these to it as Related.)\r\n\r\nTitle: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nOpen up the bug reports of external developers.\r\n\r\nI know how Radar is used internally. What is useful are the bug reports of my fellow third-party developers. Add a checkbox on external radars that says \"make this searchable and viewable by other third-party developers\". Many of the radars we file don't include anything that cannot be shared with other developers. Adding this checkbox obviously necessitates a way for third-party devs to browse and search these opened-up radars to see if one already exists. This lets us comment on it or add additional info instead of filing an unnnecessary dupe."
