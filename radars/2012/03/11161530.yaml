    description: "31-Mar-2012 10:57 AM Rob Napier:\r\nThe documentation for UIGraphicsPushContext (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIKitFunctionReference/Reference/reference.html) indicate that \"You should call this function from the main thread of your application only.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the iOS 4 release notes indicate \"Drawing to a graphics context in UIKit is now thread-safe. Specifically: The routines used to access and manipulate the graphics context can now correctly handle contexts residing on different threads.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, QA1637 says \"Important Beginning with iOS 4.0, drawing to a graphics context in UIKit is thread-safe. This includes accessing and manipulating the current graphics stack, drawing images and strings, and usage of color and font objects from secondary threads.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how \"manipulating the graphics context\" and \"manipulating the current graphics stack\" can be thread safe, but UIGraphicsPushContext not be."
