    description: "Compile the following with:\r\n\r\n% clang -framework Foundation -fobjc-arc -o ac autoreleasing-capture.m\r\n\r\nRunning this will often result in a segfault (but sometimes works, depending on ordering and that stuff). Expected result: Don't segfault, OR compiler should generate a warning if it's invalid to capture an __autoreleasing variable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code:\r\n\r\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, const char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n    @autoreleasepool {\r\n        __autoreleasing id thingy = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"Hi %@\", @\"folks\"];\r\n\r\n        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0, 0), ^{\r\n            NSLog(@\"thingy: %@\", thingy);\r\n            exit(0);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch_main();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n02-Nov-2012 10:48 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in Xcode 4.6 Developer Preview.
