    description: "06-Mar-2012 06:26 PM Cory Kilger:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen creating a customized UISegmentedControl using the appearance API, if you select any segment other than the first before it's initially displayed, the wrong divider will be drawn.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an iOS app.\r\n2. Add a UISegmentedControl to a view, programmatically or in the nib.\r\n3. Select any segment other than the first, in -viewDidLoad or in the nib.\r\n4. Run the app.\r\n5. Observe that the normal-normal divider was drawn rather than the normal-selected.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe normal-selected divider should be drawn.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe normal-normal divider is drawn.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAdding a delay to the segment selection makes it draw correctly."
