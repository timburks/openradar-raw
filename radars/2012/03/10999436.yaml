    description: "Hi bug screener,\r\n\r\nI'm filing a few bugs on Radar today. Please take a moment to dupe these out properly. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics, so please do me this small favor.) (These all belong to an umbrella bug \"Make Radar better!\" bug that I'll save last and comment withÂ the number for, if you'd like to add these to it as Related.)\r\n\r\nTitle: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nLet us file Radars from Xcode. (This is via http://fixradarorgtfo.com/)\r\n\r\nLet us file radars from Xcode. We spend most of our time in Xcode, so it makes sense to reduce the context switch needed to file a bug. Add a Radar tab to the organiser and let us quickly search and view existing radars. Save our login details so we don't have to login each and every time. Provide us with a nicely laid out form for filing new radars. Do work for us. If a report needs a system profile attaching then automatically generate one and send it if we don't include one ourselves. Let us drag and drop attachments onto the report. Add a checkbox to let us include the current Xcode project as an attachment. And let us save reports as drafts. This way we can make a note of all bugs and feature requests when we think of them, but properly file them when we get the time."
