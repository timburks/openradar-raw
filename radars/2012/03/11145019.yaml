    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nRight now the only way to find Game Center friends is by reading and comparing your address book and other friends. But now that iOS 5 has Twitter support it should also also include a \"Find my Twitter Friends\" option for finding new friends. \r\n\r\nThen also if Apple were ever to add Facebook support to the OS, then Facebook could also be added this way to make friend discovery even easier. \r\n\r\nUntil then the users of apps that use this tool will think it's the developer's fault for this feature not being made available to them. Like this user who negatively reviewed Words Play because of platform limitations preventing this from happening. http://cl.ly/110j1y3t0B2I2j3e211Q\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nTry to find my Twitter or Facebook friends on Game Center\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFind a way in the Game Center app to link my Game Center account to Twitter and/or Facebook like I can with my Address Book contacts today in Game Center.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCan't find a way to do this.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS introduced Game Center\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
