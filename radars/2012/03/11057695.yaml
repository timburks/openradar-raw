    description: "Summary: Xcode 4.3.1 will periodically lose the ability to properly highlight syntax as well as autocomplete.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use Xcode for an extended period of time.  Also, it seems to occur more often when the core data xcdatamodel is changed and the corresponding model class files are generated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Codesense/autocomplete should always work.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Codesense will fail to highlight code.  All code is generic text color (white for me since color scheme is midnight) except for reserved words. Clearing the \"Derived Data\" in Organizer > Projects > Derived Data > Delete... always fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nRegression: Did not happen until upgraded from 4.2 to 4.3.1.\r\n\r\nNotes: Wrote this bug report because filling it out takes less time in the day than the time lost to trying to complete long method names without autocomplete or codesense."
