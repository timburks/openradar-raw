    description: "Summary: as of iOS 5.1, HSPA+ networks are (mis)represented in the menu bar as 4G.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Update a GSM device to iOS 5.1 in a relatively populated area.\r\n\r\nRegression: HSPA+ used to be shown as 3G so this is a regression. Changing the label to 4G for an existing technology that is already accepted as 3G is misleading and confusing to users."
