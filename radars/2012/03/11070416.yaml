    description: "rdar://11070416\r\n\r\nUPDATE March 27, 2012: Apple marked this bug as a duplicate of rdar://9728076\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, the only way to update the matchData property of a GKTurnBasedMatch mid-turn is [_currentMatch endTurnWithNextParticipant:_currentParticipant matchData:matchData completionHandler:nil].\r\n\r\nThis works well if the Game Center player only has the game installed on one device because the in-game \"Your Turn\" notification can be hidden by the app while the user is currently playing his turn.  However, if the user has the game installed on multiple devices, the other devices will get a \"Your Turn\" push notification.  This is confusing to the user, especially I update the matchData multiple times.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I understand that I may not be using the endTurnWithNextParticipant:matchData:completionHandler: function as it was intended (because I am not, in fact, ending the match... but merely updating the matchData).  However, there seems to be no alternative to update the match's state.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a game that users endTurnWithNextParticipant:matchData:completionHandler: to update the matchData mid-turn, without passing the turn to another player.\r\n2. Install a game using GKTurnBasedMatches on multiple devices\r\n3. Receive notifications of \"Your Turn\" on all the devices each time the matchData is updated mid-turn.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect that if the currentParticipant property didn't change in the GKTurnBasedMatch, the the \"Your Turn\" push notification shouldn't be sent out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Your Turn\" push notification is sent out each time endTurnWithNextParticipant:matchData:completionHandler: is called, regardless of if the GKTurnBasedMatch's currentParticipant has changed or not.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n18-Mar-2012 12:25 PM Jonathan Sibley:\r\nIs there a way to block the \"Your Turn\" notification?  I've tried setting the message property of the GKTurnBasedMatch to nil and an empty string, but the push notification is still sent, with the default message \"Your Turn\""
