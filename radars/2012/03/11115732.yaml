    description: "25-Mar-2012 12:47 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen using undo to revert changes to my source files, Xcode ocassionally corrupts the displayed text, or stops updating the source editor entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nMake changes to your source file: in my case, I was editing code inside a method — I had deleted a block of code within the method, then typed out a new block of code further down. I realised I wanted to quickly check one of the things I had deleted, so I hit undo a few times (I know, I know!), expecting to view the code in question then redo the changes again.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAs above — the code is reverted in much the same manner as undoing changes in any text/source editor, then is able to be \"redone\" once I have finished looking at the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIn one case, syntax highlighting went crazy — random strings of text were highlighted in different colours mid-word and the text view stopped updating entirely. Typing text had no effect at all, nor did selecting anything. In another case, the code itself was mangled. Methods were spread out across many lines (character by character), and other random corruption appeared to occur. The changes do not appear to be persisted to disk when this happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nHard to say — I've seen it a number of times since Xcode 4's release. Often enough to complain about it on twitter, anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nOne item of interest — I often format my code using an external tool (uncrustify) while I'm working. Xcode usually responds to this without complaint, but it's possible that it's related."
