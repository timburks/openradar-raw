    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUpgrading an iOS 5.1 app to a newer version breaks apps that use localStorage and WebSQL, there is an error in the console:\r\n\r\ndeny file-write-create /private/var/mobile/Applications/[GUID]\r\n\r\nSteps to to reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn a UIWebView, create a new DB or use localStorage\r\nOverwrite / update your app and open the same database or write to localStorage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWe should see the data from the database and localStorage.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCall to window.openDatabase fails with \"SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18\"\r\nCall to localStorage.setItem fails silently\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIt appears that on an app upgrade in iOS 5.1, the app's GUID folder has been moved/renamed, BUT the Webkit keys in the plist in the apps' Library/Preferences/[CFBundleIdentifier].plist refer to the OLD GUID location\r\n\r\nTo fix, on an app upgrade when you change the GUID of the app folder, you should update the Webkit keys as well from the plist mentioned above.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDiscussion at these links below as well.\r\n \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-347\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-347?focusedCommentId=13233261&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13233261"
