    description: "Summary: if an HTML5 date field is placed in a form in Mobile Safari, and marked as readonly, e.g. \r\n\r\n<input name=\"SaleDate\" id=\"form-SaleDate\" type=\"date\" readonly />\r\n\r\nThe element is not editable, but is selectable. When selecting it on iPad, the control becomes depressed state, and does not become undepressed until another form element is selected."
