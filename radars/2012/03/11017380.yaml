    description: "At present only paid subscription Magazines have the benefits of the Newsstand APIs:\r\n\r\n- automatic background delivery\r\n- subscription\r\n- setting a cover on the Newsstand shelf\r\n\r\nModern catalogs are for the most part designed just like Magazines, but they are typically free. So they are excluded from Newsstand.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is for the Newsstand shelf to have a second tab \"Catalogs\" that shows the subscribed catalogs. New editions of catalogs would then also get delivered to the Newsstand shelf just like Magazines."
