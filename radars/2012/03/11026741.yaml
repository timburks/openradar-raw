    description: "Summary:\r\nThe top of NSAppleScript's docs says:\r\n\r\n\"Important  You should access NSAppleScript only from the main thread.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/AppleScript/RN-AppleScript/RN-10_6/RN-10_6.html says:\r\n\r\n\"OSA and AppleScript are now thread-safe: they may be safely called on a non-main thread â€¦ This also applies to NSAppleScript.\"\r\n\r\nSo I think the NSAppleScript docs need to be updated."
