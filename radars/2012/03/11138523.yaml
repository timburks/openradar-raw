    description: "If you use a sandboxed application to extract an archive that contains an application, that application will then fail to launch on the first try, just jumping in the dock. It seems to work on the second try.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download The Unarchiver from the Mac App Store.\r\n2. Extract a downloaded .zip file containing an application using it.\r\n3. Double-click the app.\r\n4. Get a \"This app was downloaded\" dialog, and click through it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app should launch.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe app bounces in the dock until clicked, when it disappears.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
