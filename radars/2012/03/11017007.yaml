    description: "08-Mar-2012 08:28 PM Steve Streza:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXcode 4.3.1's iOS Simulator removed the stupid bezel from the iOS Simulator. The engineer who implemented this enhancement has probably not been showered in praise, money or beer. This is inadequate, and he must be praised appropriately.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the iOS Simulator in iPad mode on a display small enough to require the window to be scaled or scrollable\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSee a stupid bezel around the content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSee no bezel around the content.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI am never downgrading from Xcode 4.3.1. Ever.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis was a great improvement. <3"
