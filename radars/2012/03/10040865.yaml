    description: "29-Aug-2011 03:28 PM Mark Rada:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe default Help menu that is generated for applications uses a search field has an AXChildren attribute that always returns nil, even when there are visible children.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be broken system wide, it is broken in every app that I have checked (Safari, Terminal, Finder, etc...) and it is also the behaviour for new Xcode projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open the accessibility inspector\r\n2. Open any other app (e.g. Safari, Finder, Terminal)\r\n3. Click on the Help menu from the menu bar\r\n4. Move the mouse to the search field\r\n5. Examine the AXChildren attribute in the accessibility inspector\r\n6. Enter something into the search field\r\n7. Move the mouse around to refresh the examination of the search field\r\n8. Move the mouse over to the search field's cancel button\r\n9. Examine the cancel button's parent (should be the search field)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe search field should report it's children properly. An empty array when there are no visible children and an array with one child, the cancel button, when the cancel button is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGetting the value of the AXChildren attribute returns nil for that search field in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes, it breaks accessibility navigation of the UI hierarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
