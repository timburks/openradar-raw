    description: "Summary:\r\nIf one forwards an item via message from the Photos app on iOS, the Send button is always blue, regardless of whether the intended recipient can receive iMessages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen the Photos app. Select a photo. Tap the forward button and tap Message. Insert a recipient incapable of receiving iMessages (e.g., and email address or a phone number associated with a mobile not running iOS 5).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Send button is green.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe Send button is blue.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSince the introduction of iMessage in iOS5, a blue Send button has come to be associated with messages that do not have a per-message transmission fee. The color of the Send button is therefore an important indicator of the cost of sending a message. Users who see the blue Send button will assume that the message will be free to send. Because of this bug, users may send expensive MMS messages or even more costly international MMS messages, under the false impression that the messages are free to send."
