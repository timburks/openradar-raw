    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn a workspace with several projects, clicking on a project in the Project Navigator (in order to edit Build Settings for a particular target) will cause Xcode to begin a series of hangs where the spinning pinwheel is shown for 4-5 seconds, then disappears, then returns. This continues until a force-quit is applied to the program.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nOpen workspace with several non-trivial projects. Select a sub-project in the Project Navigator in order to edit build settings for a particular target. Note app becomes unresponsive as you start making changes to project settings.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nApp should not become unresponsive when attempting to change build settings for a target.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nApp becomes unresponsive.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis occurred sometimes in 4.2.1, but not nearly as frequently."
