    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe App Store download of OS X 10.7.3 contains two packages with expired certificates: RemoteDesktop.pkg and SIUResources.pkg. Due to the installer failing to install either of these, attempts to build a 10.7.3 NetRestore image using System Image Utility results in failure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Add the InstallESD.dmg from a MAS download of 10.7.3 as an image source for a new NetRestore workflow in System Image Utility.\r\n2. Run the workflow.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWorkflow should result in a newly-created image.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn error dialog shows:\r\n\r\nImage creation failed.\r\nAn unknown error has occurred.\r\n\r\nLooking at install.log shows:\r\n\r\n12-03-28 2:24:52.895 PM installer: Failed install preflight: Error Domain=PKInstallErrorDomain Code=102 \"The package “RemoteDesktop.pkg” is untrusted.\" UserInfo=0x7f94f2b87400 {NSLocalizedDescription=The package “RemoteDesktop.pkg” is untrusted., NSURL=RemoteDesktop.pkg -- file://localhost/Volumes/Mac%20OS%20X%20Install%20ESD/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg, PKInstallPackageIdentifier=com.apple.pkg.RemoteDesktop, NSUnderlyingError=0x7f94f2d12880 \"The operation couldn’t be completed. CSSMERR_TP_CERT_EXPIRED\"}\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nMarch 23, 2012.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, no systems administrator who uses automated imaging creation tools can use Apple's installer to create Lion images for deployment without expanding and re-packing the flat package installers for these two components with expired certificates."
