    description: "25-Mar-2012 07:15 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nXcode always shows \"By Thread\" mode when in the debug navigator. Selecting \"By Queue\" does nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start an iOS app in the Simulator\r\n2. Wait for the app to start, then pause the app from within Xcode\r\n3. Switch to the Debug Navigator\r\n4. Select \"By Queue\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCurrent state of app, organised by queue is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCurrent state of app, organised by thread is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes, this worked in previous versions â€” I didn't check this under 4.3.1, 4.3.0 or 4.2.x, so I don't know when the regression occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
