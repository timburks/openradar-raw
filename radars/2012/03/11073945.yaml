    description: "In portrait view, iPad, iOS 5.1, calling UIActionSheet showInView in the split view popover controller causes the following assert, followed by a crash:\r\n\r\n*** Assertion failure in -[UIActionSheet presentSheetInPopoverView:], /SourceCache/UIKit/UIKit-1914.84/UIActionSheet.m:1816\r\n\r\nThis worked in iOS 5.0.1; it showed the action sheet like on the iPhone. Before 5.1, could not call showFromRect:inView:animated: in this situation, as it would result in two popovers. In 5.1, calling showFromRect:inView:animated also results in a crash, so don't have a workaround yet. Have started a Developer Technical Support incident.\r\n\r\nExpected this to continue to work in iOS 5.1. This is used in my app SmartGo Kifu: tap on My Games, then tap on the + icon in the lower left.\r\n\r\nThis was also reported in https://devforums.apple.com/message/629649, and may have been filed as #11028075."
