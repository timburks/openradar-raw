    description: As new entitlements or new APIs are added in Future OS releases to work around technical problems in previous releases, it will become increasingly difficult for developers to use these new entitlements or APIs, be sandboxed, and still support users who are still running on older OS versions. For this reason it would useful to have a mechanism to specify that an app should only be sandboxed by the OS when running on OS version x.y.z or higher.  If the user is running on a version lower than x.y.z the app should either not be sandboxed at all, or necessary temporary entitlements should continue to be respected.
