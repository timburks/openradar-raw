    description: "Summary: When doing a kinetic scrolling behind a displayed content on a tab you'll see that content is bouncing in an ugly way.  It is inconsistent with overall kinetic scrolling behavior. Also you can see beautiful and smooth kinetic scrolling in competing products (e.g. Google Chrome).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open any site and scroll to top or to bottom several times.  You can see this bug reproduced on the attached video.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Smooth scrolling is expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Bouncing and stuttering scrolling is seen.\r\n\r\nRegression: This is definitely a regression from Safari 5.1 as I can't reproduce it there."
