    description: "08-Mar-2012 10:59 AM Heath Borders:\r\nSummary:\r\nRecording gestures with the UIAutomation instrument fails eventually with \"Target application is not frontmost\".  While this happens, \"Starting Capture...\" is permanently visible in the script editor.  Restarting my box, cleaning, rebuilding, and resetting the simulator doesn't help.  I've unstuck myself from this, but I have no idea how. I also have no idea what triggered it to start.  I basically don't use recording for a few days and try it again and it works.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Profile your application with the UIAutomation Instrument in the Instruments GUI\r\n2. Scripts->Add->Create...\r\n3. Click 'Record'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"Starting Capture...\" eventually fades away\r\nSimulator interactions are translated to UIAutomation javascript in the script editor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Starting Capture...\" permanently stays to the right of the script editor.\r\nA \"Target application is not frontmost\" error appears in the timeline.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
