    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf you create a Core Data entity with an ordered relationship and then generate the NSManagedObject subclass, using some of the methods leads to a crash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Shorter version: download, build, and run the included project file.)\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Master-Detail Application and check the use Core Data checkbox. (I also chose \"Use Automatic Reference Counting\".)\r\n2. Create a new entity and establish a to-many relationship from Event to your new entity. Check the Ordered checkbox for the relationship.\r\n3. Have Xcode create the NSManagedObject subclasses for your entities.\r\n4. Add some code to call the add*Object method on an instance of the event MO subclass.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe relationship is created between the objects.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSSet intersectsSet:]: set argument is not an NSSet'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis was done using Xcode 4.3.2."
