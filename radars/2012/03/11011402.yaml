    description: "08-Mar-2012 10:22 AM Mike Mayer:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen the `LED Flash for Alerts` in Settings->General->Accessibility is toggled ON the expected result is that the LED will flash for alerts. Neither iPhone 4 nor 4S performed this reliably.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nToggle `LED Flash for Alerts` to On in the Settings->General->Accessibility menu on a device equipped with an LED flash/torch. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe LED flash should flash whenever an alert is received. (e.g. iMessage, push notification...)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe LED flash may not occur at all, it may occur for a few hours, or the LED flash will successfully happen for a few days before failing to work. It will eventually fail to flash on notifications.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot a regression. It never worked reliably on any device where this feature was available as of 3/8/2012."
