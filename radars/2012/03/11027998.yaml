    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are a lot of situations where you need to add a large list of similar in-app purchases, for example, for purchasing sets of 10, 20, 50, 100 in-game coins. These purchases share the same type, screenshot, and their id, name and localized names are much the same.\r\n\r\nThere should be an easy way to add lots of them by duplicating an existing one and changing its attributes. The new Application Loader provides a new way to add purchases being offline, so adding the ability to duplicate existing ones should be not so hard to implement.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nStart adding purchases for 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 coins with purchase ids of com.example.coinset1...8.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou add com.example.coinset1, duplicate it and change only relevant parts of names, ids and price.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to add all the purchases manually. Each one. Manually. That's not computers are for."
