    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen inside preprocessor macro, no code completion suggestions are given.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nType any preprocessor macro with arguments (a good example is NSLocalizedString()) and attempt to use a variable from the local scope or an ivar inside the macro. Neither work, nor do any other completions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll code completions that would be given inside the arguments of a function should also be present when typing the arguments for a preprocessor macro.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo suggestions are given.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nCompletion suggestions were given in Xcode 3. This bug has, however, been present since the upgrade to Xcode 4."
