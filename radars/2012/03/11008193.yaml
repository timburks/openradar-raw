    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI have a couple of settings that I don't use the recommended values for, e.g., the debugger. I've told Xcode not to make the changes (both by saying don't make the changes and unselecting the changes I don't want and telling it to make the balance.) Xcode has upped LastUpgradeCheck to 0430 but it still gives the warning. It never goes away."
