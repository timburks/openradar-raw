    description: "Summary: When a valid .p12 bundle is dragged from the Finder into a keychain for import, a dialog is displayed for keychain authentication and unlock. Though the focus ring is valid for the selected fields, no text entry occurs when typing, and thus a user cannot continue.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Drag a .p12 file into a locked or unlocked keychain. Attempt to authenticate the keychain or .p12 file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Text entry occurs. User can continue.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No text entry. User stuck.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\n\r\nNotes: Workaround is to do keychain import via command line."
