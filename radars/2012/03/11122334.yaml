    description: "Summary:\r\nSpaces typed at the end of the lines of UITextViews when there is no more room for more characters are ignored after typing another letter.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I tested the behaviour both in my own application and Notes.app. For this STR you can use Notes.app.\r\n2. Type the following text: “Wthhojxeyvcyisechidciudxboxfghvdu”. If I copied it correctly, this should leave you at the end of the line in portrait mode for an iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1 in Notes.app. Many other strings works, you just have to type on that leaves no room for a new whitespace.\r\n3. Type a whitespace with the space bar. The caret should stay in the first line, and no visual space should be added. No problem there.\r\n4. Type any character, like for example “a”.\r\n5. Rotate the iPhone to portrait mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a space between the first line text and the typed character.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no space between the first line text and the typed character, is one big line.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have been able to reproduce this behaviour with an iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1, and iPhone 4 with 5.0.1 and an iPhone 3G with 4.2.1. Also reproducible in the iOS Simulator 4.3.2, 5.0 and 5.1 (using my application and the Contacts.app notes field).\r\n\r\nThe number of spaces seems not to matter, if one disables the shortcut for “. ” preference, one can type more than one space, that they will not appear when the phone is rotated.\r\n\r\nTested both in Spanish localization and English (US) localization."
