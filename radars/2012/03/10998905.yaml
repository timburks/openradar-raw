    description: "Hi bug screener,\r\n\r\nI'm filing a few bugs on Radar today. Please take a moment to dupe these out properly. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics, so please do me this small favor.) (These all belong to an umbrella bug \"Make Radar better!\" bug that I'll save last and comment withÂ the number for, if you'd like to add these to it as Related.)\r\n\r\nTitle: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nAlways send me an email when a bug is closed or duped.\r\n\r\nMany bugs I've filed (and many more I've screened) are duped out or closed (usually for lack of updates or info) without a notification email to the originating developer. For bugs filed internally, the originator tends to stay CCed on the bug and take umbrage at this approach, so please don't do this to us just because we're a third party."
