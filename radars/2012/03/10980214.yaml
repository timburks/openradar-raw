    description: "Summary: in Mobile Safari on iPad, a <select> field's values shows as a popup, rather than the picker wheel like on iPhone. \r\nAs it's using a standard table view, the optgroup labels would be better visualized as table view section headers.\r\n\r\nCurrently they are visualized as greyed out text on rows, which can also be tapped briefly giving a highlight color but not selecting it. This is potentially confusing, less intuitive, and less visually appealing."
