    description: "02-Mar-2012 01:11 PM Doug Russell:\r\nSummary: When performing a build in Xcode, it will sometimes become stuck on touch product and never finish building. Explicitly stopping the build or trying to start another build or a clean prompts to stop build, pressing stop causes the button to disable, but nothing happens. Xcode has to be force quit to resume work. Cleaning after restarting seems to resolve the issue most of the time.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Build a project\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Project builds or fails\r\n\r\nActual Results: Stuck at touch product\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nUpdate 1:\r\n08-Mar-2012 11:39 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue:\r\n\r\nPlease attach a sample of Xcode from when it gets into this state.\r\n\r\nUse the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. While the application is running, launch Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities/)\r\n2. Click on the application name to highlight\r\n3. From the View Menu, select Sample Process\r\n4. Click Save\r\n5. Attach file(s) to this bug report.\r\n\r\nHere is an alternative command line approach to using sample:\r\n\r\n1. Do the following from Terminal (if the system is hung, try using ssh to connect and follow the steps)\r\n2. Run \"top\" \r\n3. Identify the process taking a lot of CPU% \r\n4. \"sample <process ID> 5 \r\n5. \"cp /tmp/* ~/Desktop/\" \r\n6. If necessary, restart the machine and log in (if ssh was used, log in as the user you sshed into).  The sample file should now appear on your desktop.\r\n7. Attach file(s) to this bug report.\r\n\r\nMore information about using \"Sample\" may be found on its man page, which can be retrieved by entering \"man sample\" in the Terminal."
