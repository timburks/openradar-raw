    description: "Summary:\r\nIf an iCloud MPMediaItem is being played/downloaded, it is not returned in an MPMediaQuery. Once it has completed downloading, it is returned in the query.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPerform an MPMediaQuery for all songs.\r\nSelect one of the iCloud results that has not been downloaded yet.\r\nPlay it using the iPod MPMediaPlayerController (which seems to trigger the download from iCloud)\r\nImmediately run the MPMediaQuery again.\r\nNote that the song is not returned.\r\nOnce the song completes downloading, it is returned by the query.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe MPMediaQuery returns the song while it is being downloaded, just as it did before it was downloaded.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe song \"disappears\" for a little while while being downloaded."
