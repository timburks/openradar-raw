    description: "Xcode should provide an easy-to-use way to get notes for user-defined methods (and other identifiers) in Quick Help. Currently, option-clicking a method name shows a panel with the selector and defining fileâ€¦ and that's it. (Option-clicking a class seems to show the Quick Help for the closest framework class, often NSObject. Seems wrong?)\r\n\r\nThe Quick Help panes would be infinitely more useful if they could show custom information. The most obvious approach to this is using a special comment format (see Doxygen, HeaderDoc, et al.) to provide a small blurb for custom methods, classes, etc. Even if it starts out just limited to methods, it would be actually useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, the Quick Help panes seem to show exactly what I already know and hide exactly what I WANT to know. For example, the quick help for -appendString: shows:\r\n\r\nName: appendString:\r\nDeclaration: - (void)appendString:(NSString *)aString\r\nAvailability: iOS (2.0 and later)\r\nAbstract: Adds to the end of the receiver the characters of a given string.\r\nParameters:\r\naString: The string to append to the receiver.\r\n\r\nDeclared In: NSString.h\r\nReference: NSMutableString Class Reference\r\nRelated Documents: String Programming Guide\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, that's evident by the name of the method. Cocoa uses long names as they make the above self-explanatory. I must open the full documentation browser to get the five words that are actually interesting:\r\n\r\n\"aString must not be nil\"\r\n\r\nIf the logic used to generate Quick Help blurbs was COMPLETELY INVERTED, it would be far better."
