    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an element enters full screen mode (element.webkitRequestFullScreen or video.webkitEnterFullscreen), it blinks and occasionally turns white.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Trigger an element to go into full screen mode, or trigger a video tag into full screen mode\r\n (for example, click the full screen button on any video on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/18020585)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe transition should be smooth, and no flashing or blinking should occur.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe entire element blinks when entering, and sometimes turns entirely white.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nEntering full screen with video.webkitEnterFullscreen worked flawlessly on Safari < 5.1.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI've been able to replicate this on a few different Macs, but I can't find a pattern on when it turns white and when it doesn't. Sometimes it's the first time you press full screen, other times it seems random (but it does happen on every one at some point)."
