    description: "12-Mar-2012 08:54 PM Rich Wardwell:\r\nSummary:\r\nUILabel & UIButton do not appear to expose any properties via UIAppearance.  After double checking the headers (UIButton.h & UILable.h), it appears that UILabel and UIButton have no properties which are tagged with UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR and therefore capable of being configured through UIAppearance.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempted to set a number of standard properties (textAttributes, color, backgroundImage) on UILabel & UIButton. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTo have my UI components styled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nReceived exceptions. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
