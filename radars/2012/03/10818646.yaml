    description: "Summary: OS X 10.7.3 only supports TRIM on factory-installed Solid State Drives.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open System Information. Select Serial-ATA section. Observe \"No\" indicator in TRIM support section on any third party SSD.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: OS X properly supports TRIM on third party drives. \r\n\r\nActual Results: OS X refuses to enable TRIM support unless it is installed on an Apple-installed SSD.\r\n\r\nRegression: Has been present since TRIM command was initially released several years ago, so this is not specific to 10.7.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
