    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIWebView gives no access to any keyboard customization beyond the HTML attributes for inputs. When embedding a web view in an app I would like to be given the control offered by components such as UITextField. Specifically the ability to remove or change the keyboard's accessory view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSearch the developer documentation for some way to override keyboard properties within SDK restrictions.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nHave some way to take control of said properties.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFind lots of unofficially ways that violate the SDK to do it, but none that I can actually ship. Cry a little.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nEspecially since using UIWebView was promoted as a good way to write a Rich Text editor with the WWDC 2011 video \"Rich Text Editing in Safari on iOS\", I think this is a really good feature to add. Otherwise I need to roll my own editor just to get bold and italic styles, which would be crazy overkill. And since I suspect you're using features such as execCommand and a UIWebView for Mail's editor, I would really appreciate having the same functionality available to me."
