    description: "12-Mar-2012 12:46 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The Xcode text editor has a \"Move Text Down\" command, accessed through the Editor -> Structure menu. When the user moves text down past the bottom of the editor window, the editor does not automatically scroll, so the text can be moved out of sight. In contrast, the Move Text Up command does automatically scroll up when the user hits the top of the window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Select some lines of code and repeatedly choose the Move Text Down command (or use the Option-Command-} shortcut) until the selected text reaches the bottom of the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The editor window should automatically scroll so that the selected text remains in view.\r\n\r\nActual Results:The selected text disappears. The user must manually scroll to see it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
