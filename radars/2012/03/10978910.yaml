    description: "Here's what I submitted to Radar:\r\n\r\nSummary: The 'non-printable area' fields (Top, Left, Bottom, Right) in the custom paper sizes dialog are ignored when printing from a Cocoa app. They are correctly used by Carbon apps.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n[Note: the steps below include specific values, just to be formalist; ANY values will fail, just as these do.]\r\n\r\n1: In any Cocoa app (e.g. Safari) choose \"Print\" (Be sure the full dialog is shown.)\r\n2: Notice that the page preview accurately shows the page size and margins.\r\n3: In the \"Paper Size\" popup, choose \"Manage Custom Sizes...\"\r\n4: Create a new Custom Paper Size. Name it \"Notepad\"\r\n5: Set the Paper Size fields to Width: \"5.5 in\" Height: \"8.5 in\"\r\n6: Set the Non-Printable Area popup to \"User Defined\" \r\n7: Set the Non-Printable Area fields to Top: \"1.0 in\", Left: \"1.5 in\", Right: \"1.0 in\", Bottom: \"1.0 in\"\r\n8: Click OK to return to the Print dialog.\r\n9: Confirm that the \"Notepad\" Paper Size is selected.\r\n10: Note that the page preview accurately shows the Notepad page size, but not the margins.\r\n11: Print the page (as a pdf if you wish to save paper).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: A printed page 5.5\" x 8.5\" with large margins all around and an extra wide margin on the left.\r\n\r\nActual Results: A printed page 5.5\" x 8.5\" with default margins all around.\r\n\r\nRegression: This works fine in all Carbon-based apps.\r\n\r\nNotes: I tested this in multiple Carbon and Cocoa applications in both OS X 10.6 & 10.7. The success of Carbon and the failure of Cocoa is consistent across the board."
