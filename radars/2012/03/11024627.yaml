    description: "10-Mar-2012 12:29 PM Will Hains:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe search feature in Reminders on iPhone searches in real-time as the user types, but there is still a blue \"Search\" key on the keyboard. That key does nothing. And the keyboard obscures the view of the search results and can't be hidden.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Reminders.\r\n2. Tap the button on the top-left that has 3 horizontal lines.\r\n3. Tap in the \"Search Reminders\" field at the top.\r\n4. Type a search term.\r\n5. Tap the blue \"Search\" key on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFollowing the convention in other apps, including Spotlight on the left of the home screen, the blue \"Search\" key should hide the keyboard, allowing a larger viewing area for the search results.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"Search\" key does nothing at all. The search results are already visible without tapping the \"Search\" key, so it has no effect on the searching function itself. The keyboard does not hide. The user is forced to try to scroll the tiny area above the keyboard and below the search field.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem happens always, regardless of any settings."
