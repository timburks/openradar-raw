    description: "In Xcode 3 and earlier, the multi-file search/replace functionality in Xcode included an option to search in \"Selected Items\" (or similar wording).\r\n\r\nStarting in Xcode 4 there is no longer a way of e.g. selecting a group from the project navigator and searching only within the scope of files contained in that group.\r\n\r\nThe closest thing to a workaround is to declare a custom search scope and choose a file or folder to search in. But even this is not a suitable replacement for the old functionality, because a group can contain files and folders from distant locations on the disk.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a search scope option for \"Within Selected Items\". I realize when you switch from the Project Navigator to the Search pane, the selected items are no longer visible, but it does retain the selection in that section and it would be obvious to most users that the selection in the project navigator pane is what is being referred to.\r\n\r\n02-Mar-2012 01:34 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nI should add that another way the \"In File or Folder\" search scopes don't replace the old behavior, is they are fixed and have to be defined and left in the scope list. The great thing about the old behavior is it was ephemeral and allowed you to focus in on a specific set of files for the moment."
