    description: "19-Mar-2012 11:27 AM Jedda Wignall:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAPNS cert request from Server.app fails silently when 10 or more certificates for same FQDN already exist.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Set up Mac OS X server with a FQDN, then request an APNS certificate through Server.app checkbox or Profile Manager setup.\r\n2. Nuke machine, and then do step 1 again with the same Apple ID, and FQDN 9 times.\r\n3. Attempt to request certificate again - get stuck at \"Aquiring...\" or \"Getting push certificate status\".\r\n4. Fix by logging into identity.apple.com/pushcerts, and revoking at least 1 certificate for FQDN.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTo encourage good housekeeping, throw a verbose error. I'm not sure you should be able to create unlimited certs and mess up the system, but  a silent failure is confusing."
