    description: "Summary:\r\nI turned off my (non-connected) phone and immediately, Xcode crashed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTurned off my phone within Wifi range of my local network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNothing.  Everything to keep running.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode quit unexpectedly:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI presume there is correlation between the phone and Xcode.  Otherwise, Xcode just randomly crashed, which is equally noteworthy I guess."
