    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen sending Turn Based game updates for a game it should come across as a message from that Game with the grouping and icon of the Application in use. Right now it just shows as a Game Center icon instead of the application that sent the game notification, and is grouped seperately from other applications\r\n\r\nWe can currently customize the sound, by having a GKInvite.wav file in the bundle but not the look and behavior of the notifications.\r\n\r\nThis also causes a problem with the users being unable to customize the behavior of our Application's settings in Notification Center will not apply to game play requests. They'll often also have Game Center itself muted and wonder why they don't get game play requests. \r\n\r\nGrouping these requests in with the app's other notifications will be a better experience for both users and developers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nGet a Turn notifcation and another Notification from the application (like a chat message in this case).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBoth notifications are grouped together and behave based on the Notification Center settings for the application giving the users one clear place to manage the settings for the application.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGame turn notifications come as Game Center notifications (but somehow can use a different sound file?). If Game Center is restricted in Notification Center they wont get turn notifciations and wont know why. Many people turn these Notifications off because they don't need a sound of notification of someone wanting to tbe their friend. \r\n\r\nGame notifications come over as expected as a application Notification and are handled based upon the rules for that Application in Notification Center. \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing is that turn indicators show up as a badge on the Application icon, not the Game Center icon despite the notification coming over as a Game Center notification. \r\n\r\nAttached is a photo showing the breakdown between the two types of notifications.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1o3G3B0s421A3z2D112j\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS 5.0 introduced Turn Based Notifications\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
