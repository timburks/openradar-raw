    description: After upgrading from an iPhone 3Gs to an iPhone 4S, I can no longer force my phone into 2G mode.  There used to be a slider that would let me do so.  I live in Raleigh, NC, and we have an arena which gets very poor 3G/4G reception, but the 2G band is wide open.  My 3Gs was completely unusable in PNC arena with the defaults, but when I switched it to 2G mode, it worked fine.  Now that I have a 4S, I have no way to "downgrade" the data speed, and I can't even get SMS messages out, much less data.
