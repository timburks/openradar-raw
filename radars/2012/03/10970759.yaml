    description: "Summary:\r\nI want to submit an update to my Mac app on the Mac App Store. The application includes one framework (BGHUDAppKit). The application is archived alright. When trying to submit or even validate it to Mac App Store in Xcode 4.3, after selecting the code signing identity, it fails with:\r\n\"Codesign operation failed\" - \"Check that the identity you selected is valid.\" alert.\r\n\r\nIn Console I see the following:\r\n\r\n02/03/2012 13:16:59.874 [0x0-0x2b22b2].com.apple.dt.Xcode: /Users/jacob/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2012-03-02/ImageFramer3 (MAS) 02-03-2012 13.15.xcarchive/Products/Applications/ImageFramer.app/Contents/Frameworks/BGHUDAppKit.framework: Is a directory\r\n\r\nSounds like a serious bug in signing process. Couldn't find any workaround.\r\nAlso saw a thread on dev forums: https://devforums.apple.com/message/621193 \r\nNo solution there either, except integrating the framework into the app as source, which is quite a lot of work and not always feasible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to validate a Mac application with frameworks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPass validation and submission to Mac App Store\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFails with:\r\n\"Codesign operation failed\" - \"Check that the identity you selected is valid.\" alert\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
