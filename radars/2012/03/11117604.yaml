    description: "Summary:\r\nsince the update to 5.1 the foto.app does not include the \"fit-to-page=true\" option in the ipp print request.\r\nThis is necessary for some printers to correctly print pictures borderless on photo paper.\r\nThis option was included in 5.0 and is missing in 5.1.\r\n\r\nPlease reinclude this ipp job option in the next ios update.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n01. Start foto app\r\n02. print picture via airprint in 5.0\r\n03. print picture via airprint in 5.1\r\n04. have a look at the control files on the ipp target (in my case a cups server)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn 5.0 the foto is printed borderless on the paper. The control file contains the ipp job option \"fit-to-page\" (see file c00197)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn 5.1 the foto is printed with the wrong orientation (for landscape pictures) and with a huge white border.\r\nThe control file does not contains the ipp job option \"fit-to-page\" (see file c00213)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was working in 5.0 and earlier."
