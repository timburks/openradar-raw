    description: "16-Mar-2012 11:22 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen I am running an Archive build, which has a number of dependencies (like openssl, sqlcipher), and I stop the build in the middle of one of these dependent builds, with the Stop button, an error is listed, and the build appears to still be going or hung, and stays that way for a while, preventing me from getting started on the next one, etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nBegin an Archive build of a project with a dependency that takes a long time to build (like openssl). Press stop while Xcode is still building one of your dependencies.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBuild should stop within the next few seconds or sooner, used to all the time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAn error shows in the heads-up-display and the build appears to hang, doesn't stop. Attaching screen clip. It's been in this state for the five minutes I've been typing this up!\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't think so, this seems to have been happening since we started using Xcode 4 and the new Archive feature.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nJust a general performance issue, having to try to stop the build multiple times in order to get on with, say, adjusting the version number in the plist and launching it again. Should be quick to do. Frustrating.\r\n\r\n16-Mar-2012 11:22 AM William Gray:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-03-16 at 11.18.55 AM.png' was successfully uploaded"
