    description: "Summary:\r\niPhone/iPad does not seem to be able to handle a MIME message with a content-type of message/rfc822 correctly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Receive message from Microsoft Outlook 12.0 (as shown in headers)\r\n2. Forward the received message via a Nokia N900 (or similar) device.\r\n3. Read the forwarded message on iPhone/iPad\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould be able to display the email inline\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShows only a truncated message-id, nothing else.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProbably never worked, noticed in 5.0 and 5.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe received email is composed of two parts\r\n\r\n- the new email as text/plain\r\n- the forwarded email as as message/rfc822\r\n   - containing one part as text/plain\r\n   - containing another part as text/html \r\n\r\nAttached is an example email where the original email was obfuscated (confidential). I couldn't figure out how to anonymize the html part so I had to delete it in its entirety.\r\n\r\nMail.app does show the email in its entirety and correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm able to reproduce this reliably (always) and will gladly assist you further should you require it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks."
