    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nGame Center really is missing some form of inter-user communication. This could be something built into the Game Center UIs and also accessible via any app that uses Game Center to send messages between users. Doing this will allow users to discuss the current game or even just casual chatter. We solved this by rolling our own chat service using Push Messaging but making this a part of the platform would help the platform overall.\r\n\r\nA simple leveraging of iMessage into Game Center without exposing the user's contact information would be an ideal way to handle this. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nLook for a way to send a message to a user over Game Center\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFind a way to send them a message\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to communicate with my Game Center friends\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS introduced Game Center\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
