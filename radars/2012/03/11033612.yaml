    description: "Summary:\r\nI've been using the brand-new Xcode to begin working on the alpha version of my company's latest app. Now we've gotten to the point where I need to distribute a build to stakeholders. But I can't, because every time I attempt to build an IPA from my compiled archive, Xcode crashes.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open the Organizer to the Archives tab.\r\n- Choose an archive\r\n- Press the Distribute... button\r\n- Select the Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment radio button\r\n- Press Next\r\n- A screen appears with a progress indicator, telling me that Xcode is \"building a list of identities\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Workflow continues to a screen allowing me to choose a signing identity? (Have never gotten that far.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Crash.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Mar-2012 08:22 AM Sixten Otto:\r\nConfirmed that this crash remains in version 4.3.2."
