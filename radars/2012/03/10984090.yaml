    description: "Summary: With Messages on OS X sometimes the unread count in the dock icon can get stuck, even if a user has read all of the messages they've received, whether it be on the computer itself or various iOS devices.\r\n\r\nMessages is still in beta, so quirks are to be expected, but a fallback for this sort of synchronization issue could exist in the form of a \"Mark all as read\" action item either in the app itself or in the dock icon's action menu. This way, if the state of some conversations gets out of sync, you can at least mark the conversation as read on your local machine to prevent having the count in the dock icon rendered completely useless by having it filled with old notifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Unread count not going away from Messages dock icon, even though all messages have been seen/read by the user.\r\n2. Right-click on dock icon to bring up context menu.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Action menu item is available for marking all messages as read.\r\n\r\nActual Results: No action menu item shown for marking all messages as read."
