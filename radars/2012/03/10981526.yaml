    description: "04-Mar-2012 04:38 PM Zach Drayer:\r\nFast enumeration, in the form of `for (x in y) {}` is a great way to enumerate over a collection of objects. However, there are times when it is not the most efficient way to enumerate over a collection.\r\n\r\nSome of the time, the operation being performed in the loop can be done concurrently, in which case -enumerateObjectsWithOptions:usingBlock: is a better way to go. This is because it allows for the `NSEnumerationConcurrent` to be passed in when running the method. \r\n\r\nIt would be absolutely fantastic if fast enumeration was expanded to add `for (x in y with z) {}`, where `z` is a set of NSEnumerationOptions that can be passed in. \r\n\r\nThis is also very helpful because devices are shipping with more and more CPUs (Macs typically have 4 CPUs by now, and iPhone's/iPad's shipping at the moment can have 2 CPUs), and despite GCD being awesome, there are still times when it is hard for developers to fully take advantage of all of the CPUs available to them."
