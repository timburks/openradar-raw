    description: "Summary:\r\nOn iOS provisioning portal web site, viewing history and sorting by date appears to use an alphabetical sort of the long-form date text, instead of a chronological date sort.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Log into the iOS provisioning portal, on an account or team that's had some activity\r\n- Navigate to the \"Certificates\", \"Devices\", or \"Provisioning\" section\r\n- Click the \"History\" tab\r\n- Attempt to sort the history by date\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The actions will be sorted chronologically\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The actions are sorted alphabetically, by the long-form date string.  This means that actions are sorted first by month (in the order Apr, Aug, Dec, etc.), then by day, then by year.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nN/A"
