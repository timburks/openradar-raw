    description: "11-Mar-2012 12:32 AM Zoe Summers:\r\nPOSSIBLE DUPLICATE OF BUG #10902221\r\nPOSSIBLE DUPLICATE OF BUG #10970582\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSince upgrading to 4.3 on SEVERAL iMac's of different models and ages, we've been seeing that the code editor window jumps around and flickers all the text when typing - worst with space bar presses - and also when using the context menu popups for code completion with the arrow keys the entire screen jumps up and down causing you to come 'out' of the menu and you are unable to select code completion suggestion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThis happens regardless of theme or size of font or coloring used in the code window.\r\n\r\nIt APPEARS to happen 100% when you have scrolled to the bottom of a long class so that the @end is visible.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an Xcode 'feature' that is you have multiple line breaks AFTER the @end that with each keypress or space it will slowly scroll the code editor window up until the @end is sitting at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nHowever this \"clever\" feature seems to be the cause of the bug. \r\n\r\nIt seems that it thinks that it needs to scroll the text content, then realizes its mistake and puts it back into its original position.\r\n\r\nThis happens with every press of the space bar and arrow keys when inside a code completion window.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nCode text doesn't jump!!!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt's actually unusable and it has caused the loss of about 7 hours of work through trying to solve this on several Mac's. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
