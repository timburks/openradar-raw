    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUsing the example code ImageClient, I am unable to authenticate through a Squid proxy that only offers NTLM authentication when in CFNetwork mode. It does work in Foundation mode, and Safari is able to authenticate through this proxy. ImageClient successfully authenticates in CFNetwork mode when I reconfigure the proxy to use Basic Authentication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Deploy NTLM-only HTTP proxy\r\n* Configure proxy in System Preferences\r\n* Call CFHTTPMessageApplyCredentialDictionary()\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n* The CFHTTPMessage should have a proxy-authorization header (as it does in Basic)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n* The CFHTTPMessage has no headers. It only has the GET.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've tested this with a small program of my own (attached as main.c) and reproduced the same issue. CFHTTPMessageApplyCredentialDictionary() returns True, as does CFHTTPMessageApplyCredentials(). CFHTTPMessageAddAuthentication returns False, but this call does not provide any details on the error.\r\n\r\nWhile Safari connects correctly through this NTLM proxy, some programs such as Entourage do not.\r\n\r\nI have only tested this against a Squid proxy; we are in the process of deploying an ISA proxy to determine if it's reproducible. Here are the headers returned by the Squid proxy:\r\n\r\nGET http://google.com HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required\r\nServer: squid/3.1.9\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\nDate: Thu, 16 Dec 2010 16:43:52 GMT\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Length: 3157\r\nX-Squid-Error: ERR_CACHE_ACCESS_DENIED 0\r\nVary: Accept-Language\r\nContent-Language: en\r\nProxy-Authenticate: NTLM\r\nX-Cache: MISS from ****\r\nVia: 1.0 **** (squid/3.1.9)\r\nConnection: close"
