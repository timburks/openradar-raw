    description: "Summary: Most of the time Screen Sharing does not successfully connect to the remote machine and silently fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Initiate connection to remote machine. I use the machine in the sidebar of the Finder -> Share Screen or âŒ˜ + K -> vnc://<ip>.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Progress bar appears, \"Connecting to Server\", followed by \"Recieving first screen\", followed by successful connection, *or* a message if one of these steps fails.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Progress bar appears, \"Connecting to Server\", followed by nothing. Or progress bar appears, \"Connecting to Server\", followed by \"Recieving first screen\", followed by nothing.\r\n\r\nRegression: I recall it working more reliably in Snow Leopard, but it's possible that I'm romanticizing the past.\r\n\r\nNotes: Usually works on/around the dozenth try. Mac Mini running Lion Server (just Lion with Screen Sharing enabled reproduces fine) connected via Ethernet to an AirPort Extreme. Client is MacBook connected to the APX via wireless-n."
