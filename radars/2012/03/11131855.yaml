    description: "It would be very useful for the project-wide find-in-files to dig into the text of XIB files. For example, if I have a contextual menu item named \"Check Document\", and wish to change its modifier key, I might not remember if I created that item in code or in IB. Right now, doing a project-wide search would only yield results if that item was created in code. I then have to dig through several XIBs before I find the one with the proper menu.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an Xcode ER, but I can see it being a welcome addition by most of the developer community."
