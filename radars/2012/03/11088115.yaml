    description: "Summary:\r\niOS devices cannot be restored to iOS versions prior to the latest releases. However, this is necessary for iOS app testing. Therefore, registered developer devices should be allowed to do this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n - Register a device in the iOS Provisioning Portal.\r\n - Use Xcode or iTunes to attempt to restore this device to a release of iOS before the latest.\r\n - Note that an error is received, and this is not possible.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDeveloper iOS devices should be able to be restored to iOS versions prior to the latest release.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThey are not able to be restored to prior iOS releases.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was added to all devices available after the iPhone 3GS. In addition, the same restriction was added to devices releases prior to the iPhone 3GS when iOS 4 was released."
