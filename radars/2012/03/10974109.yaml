    description: "Summary: When moving on to play the next song, iTunes will play silence instead of the song. Time elapsed/remaining, and metadata works as usual, but no sound. Every song after this is similarly silent until iTunes is paused/stopped and tole to play again.\r\n\r\nThis happened very often when my AirPort Express was connected via WiFi, so I first suspected it was due to bad handling of the occasional lost packet, but with the APE (and my Mac) directly wired to an AirPort Extreme, this still happens occasionally. Now my suspicion is timing, either network or disk (my music is on an external FW800 disk array), but iTunes/AirTunes is a black box so I'm not easily able to investigate this more on my own.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Tell iTunes to play some music.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: iTunes plays all the music in the current playlist.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iTunes plays the music, but one of the songs (and all the songs after it) are entirely silent on all speakers (using Multiple or Single speakers doesn't seem to matter).\r\n\r\nRegression: No.\r\n\r\nNotes: Reproducible Often. Left playing overnight this will almost always have happened by morning."
