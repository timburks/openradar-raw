    description: "When setting up a new device from an old, encrypted backup (therefore containing network settings), the new device will be unable to connect to some WiFi networks.\r\n\r\n0. Find an old iPad 2 that has connected to multiple networks which you will be able to reconnect to (say, both the Apple campus WiFi and one for the nearby Starbucks).\r\n1. Backup this old device with iTunes. Ensure this backup is encrypted by checking the box in the iTunes sync screen and setting a password. \r\n2. Connect a brand new device, out of the box. Use one of the new iPads.\r\n3. Progress through the setup instructions on the device. When it asks you to connect to the Apple WiFi network, do so. \r\n4. At the time that it asks if you'd like to restore from a backup (or set up as new device), choose to restore from iTunes backup. It will tell you to connect the iPad to iTunes. Do so.\r\n5. Run through the restore options in iTunes, restoring from the encrypted backup you created on the iPad 2.\r\n6. When the new device has finished restoring from the backup of the iPad 2, disconnect it and walk to the local Starbucks. \r\n\r\nExpected: the new device should automatically connect and establish network settings on all WiFi networks previously connected to from the iPad 2.\r\n\r\nActual: the new device will be unable to connect to the WiFi network. It will be able to connect to the Apple campus WiFi because this was set up with the new device, but it can't connect to networks previously connected via the old device.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: resetting network settings from General, Reset is a successful workaround. Choosing \"Forget this Network\" on the WiFi network settings panel is *not* successful.\r\n\r\nNote: this bug should be reproducible, but it doesn't leave a console message or anything to report it with. In essence, I am reporting based on experience, and I can't duplicate it."
