    description: "19-Mar-2012 10:52 AM Felipe Kellermann:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe Organizer / Archives now has the feature to report the \"Estimated App Store Size\". The size reported, though, appears to be wrong. The size is always *much* larger than the actual size that appers in the App Store or the Ad Hoc build (IPA).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a project, Build & Archive it;\r\n- See the \"Estimated App Store Size\" in Organizer;\r\n- Use \"Distribute...\" to save an Ad Hoc (IPA) or even send it to the App Store;\r\n- You'll notice that the size (IPA or App Store) is way smaller than the size estimated by Organizer/Xcode.\r\n\r\nExample: an app estimated to be 16,3 MB has 8,4 MB in the App Store.\r\nAn Ad Hoc app reported to be ~ 11,5 MB has actually 5,8 MB when distributed (IPA).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActual sizing at least approximated to the estimated size.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nExample: an app estimated to be 16,3 MB has 8,4 MB in the App Store.\r\nAn Ad Hoc app reported to be ~ 11,5 MB has actually 5,8 MB when distributed (IPA).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXcode/Organizer has the \"Estimated App Store Size\" feature but it doesn't seem to be working.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAs developers are more aware of app sizing (because of many resources they have to support), it's interesting to have the 'estimated app store size' working fine to measure improvements regarding app size."
