    description: "As seen in the AdvancedURLConnections sample code file\r\nRead Me About AdvancedURLConnections.txt (V1.2):\r\n\r\nIt seems that it's not currently possible to respond to both a NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust challenge and a NSURLAuthenticationMethodClientCertificate challenge.  That is, if an HTTPS server has a non-trusted server identity and requires that you provide a client identity, things don't work as expected (you get the NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust challenge but the connection fails before you get the NSURLAuthenticationMethodClientCertificate challenge).  We're still investigating this issue <rdar://problem/7492560>.  In the meantime, the workaround is to install the server's root certificate globally (but beware of the simulator problems described earlier)."
