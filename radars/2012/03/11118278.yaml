    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAllow access to the UIPopoverController used inside UIPrintInteractionController and UIDocumentInteractionController - basically all those controllers that can be shown via a UIPopoverController but don't expose that.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that I use passthroughViews to allow touches in the navigationBar. This works for my custom popovers, but the popovers for printing / document interaction can't be customized that way (at least as long I don't use private API). This is an inconsistency and ultimately a bad experience for my users, who do not care how the system is designed internally. They just see that on \"some\" popovers they can tap-through, while on others they need to basically double-tap to get to the next popover.\r\n\r\nIt also makes my internal code way more complicated, as I don't only need to test for my custom popover but also if there maybe is the print or the i interaction controller displayed. It only gets worse with more such custom controllers.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nShow a UIPrintInteractionController / UIDocumentInteractionController on the iPad. Try to access the UIPopoverController. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAllow accessing the UIPopoverController without cruel, ugly hacks such as my workaround here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/2203908\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that they internally use a UIPopoverView and I don't see the reasoning in encapsulating that. While one could also replicate passthroughViews, but there might be more properties one is interested in customizing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nA property called popoverController that allows easy access to the UIPopoverView.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI talked to an Apple engineer and he agreed on this :)"
