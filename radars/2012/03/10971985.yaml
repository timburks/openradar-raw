    description: "02-Mar-2012 11:37 AM Greg Pierce:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn-app web browsers are a popular and convenient way to allow users to access the Internet from inside apps without the context switching required when opening links in Safari.  UIWebView makes it easy to create fully functional in-app web browsers that enhance app experience and add special features for users.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, UIWebView when used outside Mobile Safari, is not able to respect any current or future system-wide parental controls that might apply to access to the Internet on the iOS device.\r\n\r\nBecause of this problem, the App Review team is faced with a difficult problem that prevents them from being consistent in reviewing apps that allow unfiltered access to the Internet through UIWebView. In some cases they force a 17+ rating, in other not, and it would nearly impossible from them to apply these requirements in a consistent way.\r\n\r\nThere are many uses of UIWebView that do not involve allowing unfiltered access to the web, but the ability to set a \"filtered\" mode on a UIWebView that enabled it to respect any system wide filtering or access limitations would allow it to be used in \"in-app\" browsers without generating this Ratings problem for the App Review team.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSuggested implementation:\r\n\r\n[webView setRespectParentalControls:YES];"
