    description: "17-Mar-2012 12:09 AM Gregor Longariva:\r\nSummary:\r\nOne of my Macs, an iMac, running 10.7.3, ultimately had very frequent kernel panics. At least once a day the computer paniced, sometimes even two or three times a day.\r\nTo find a fix I uninstalled all software with kernel extensions but it gave no relief. The crashes continued.\r\nAfter completely disabling IPv6 for all interfaces the panics vanished and the Mac returned to work as expected. Re-enabling IPv6 caused again a panic.\r\nThe thing I do not understand is, I had enabled IPv6 since the first installation of the iMac with Snow Leopard and afterwards last summer I did an update to Lion. The crashes appeared only about two weeks ago. It COULD be correlated with the installation of 10.7.3 but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nsee above\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nworking smoothly without crashes\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nsee above\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will attach some of the Kernel panic logs\r\n\r\n17-Mar-2012 12:09 AM Gregor Longariva:\r\n'Kernel_panics.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Mar-2012 12:11 AM Gregor Longariva:\r\nInterestingly the first Return Address in every Kernel Panic is the same in all logs: 0xffffff8000220702\r\n\r\n17-Mar-2012 12:17 AM Gregor Longariva:\r\nA note: I did a hardware test run with the Apple Hardware Test Utility on the DVD as I thought it could be a hardware problem. There were no errors."
