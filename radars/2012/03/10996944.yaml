    description: "06-Mar-2012 11:23 PM Andreas Fink:\r\nSummary:\r\nAfter flying around in europe and landing, switching the iPad back on results in no signal being picked up and there is no way to get it to find any networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. use a Swisscom Mobile SIM Card.\r\n2. Fly from Zürich to Stockholm\r\n3. It will prefer \"Telia\" network which is only EDGE.\r\n4. Switch to manual select and pick up \"3 Sweden\" which is 3G network.\r\n5. Enjoy your stay in a beautiful city\r\n6. Take the plane back to Zürich\r\n7. Be a nice passenger and put your iPad into flight mode. Leave it on manual select.\r\n8. Arrive in Zürich\r\n9. Switch your iPad 2 back on\r\n10. Wonder why you have no signal\r\n11. Say \"Aha! I'm in manual mode and there's no \"3 Sweden\" network here.\r\n12. Select \"automatic\"\r\n13. Let it search\r\n14. Let it search\r\n15. Be patient its still searching\r\n16. Even if its not finding anything, its still searching\r\n17. Enjoy the dialogbox \"The current network is not available...\" (or similar).\r\n18. The switch is now in position \"automatic\". Power off the iPad\r\n19. Power iPad on\r\n20. Still no signal, setting is back to manual mode!\r\n21. go to step 12.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe magical \"It just works\"  (after step 12).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo way you can get it back online\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nFind a stiff punctuating piece of metal, you know the ones you are usually not allowed to carry on flights (in my case about 6 broken off tooth sticks did the trick) insert it next to the simcard slot and remove and reinsert the simcard.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nApple wanted to have baseband logs. Unfortunately their hint on how to enable them doesn't work on iPads (or do you know how to DIAL on a iPad?) but I'm trying to reproduce it on iPhone in the meantime."
