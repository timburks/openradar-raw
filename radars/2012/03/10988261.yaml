    description: "06-Mar-2012 10:12 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMessages.app always opens the \"Messages\" window when clicking on the Dock icon. Previous versions (when it was iChat) opened the buddy window to begin conversations with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open Messages;\r\n2. Ensure that you have a couple of accounts setup;\r\n3. Click on the Dock icon;\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Buddies\" window opens.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe \"Messages\" window opens, and I then have to manually open the \"Buddies\"  window.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYep â€” this worked nicely when the app was called iChat.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA user preference to control this function would suffice if the UX guys want to continue ramming the \"Messages\" window down our throats by default."
