    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew keyboard used by iOS used to display the Shekel symbol in place of the dollar symbol on the numeric keyboard. As of iOS 5, it does not. There is now no way to type this symbol on iOS.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Enable the Hebrew keyboard in Settings: General > Keyboard > International Keyboards > Add New Keyboardâ€¦\r\n2. Use a text input to bring up the keyboard.\r\n3. If the keyboard is not already using Hebrew, tap the Globe icon to switch languages to Hebrew.\r\n4. Tap the \"123\" button to switch to the numeric keyboard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe numeric keyboard contains a button for typing the Shekel symbol.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe numeric keyboard does not contain the Shekel symbol. Tapping and holding the dollar sign does not yield the Shekel symbol as an option to type, either.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew keyboard was introduced in iOS 3, and it contained a Shekel key.\r\niOS 4 retained the Shekel key introduced in 3.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSwitching the device language to Hebrew (from English) on iOS 5 did not yield any difference.\r\n\r\nAttached are screenshots of the Hebrew keyboard on iOS 4 and iOS 5."
