    description: "Title: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nUmbrella ER: Bug Reporter enhancements for third-party developers\r\n\r\nHi bug screener,\r\n\r\nYou've probably seen this bug a lot today. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics; I know what it's like.)\r\n\r\nThis is an umbrella enhancement request for a better Radar web frontend for third-party developers. I've filed individual bugs for you to dupe to each of the appropriate ERs. These are:\r\n\r\nrdar://10998905 Always send me an email when a bug is closed or duped.\r\n\r\nrdar://10999416 Completely read my bug before requesting more info.\r\n\r\nrdar://10999436 Let us file Radars from Xcode.\r\n\r\nrdar://10999445 Open up the bug reports of external developers.\r\n\r\nrdar://10999448 Add the ability to comment on other bugs and to upvote them as an issue that we'd like to see fixed (or a feature to be added)\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n-Christopher Bowns."
