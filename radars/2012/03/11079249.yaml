    description: "19-Mar-2012 11:53 PM Nicklas Peelman:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nTypically when I minimize a Safari window, it represents a logical group of tabs I want to keep grouped, but deal with later.  Currently, if a new request comes in (say I ask NetNewsWire to open a news story in Safari, or i click on a link in Twitterrific or Adium), Safari will extract that window from the Dock, and open a new tab there.\r\n\r\nBasically I want Safari to treat minimized windows like it does windows that are in an out-of-focus Space -- leave them alone.  Spawn a new window.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open Safari, visit http://apple.com\r\n2) Minimize Safari Window.\r\n3) Open a link from any other source (Mail, Calendar, Messages, Adium, Twitter, Finder, iTunes, etc)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSafari launches a fresh window, and opens the desired page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSafari extricates the minimized window, spawns a new tab if necessary, and open the desired page\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis has been a thorn in my side for a while, I finally got around to reporting it."
