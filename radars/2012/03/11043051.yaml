    description: "13-Mar-2012 07:59 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The iOS Provisioning Portal contains step-by-step instructions to assist developers in performing provisioning and deployment tasks. However, those instructions are accompanied by screenshots for Xcode 3.x, and are thus difficult to use as references when using the current version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Log into iOS Provisioning Portal, click Distribution, and click the \"Building Your App with Xcode for Distribution\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The instructions and screenshots should explain how to build an app for distribution with the current version of Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The instructions and screenshots explain how to build an app for distribution with Xcode 3.x. The workflow is substantially different from how one does this with the current Xcode 4.x, so they are not very helpful.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n07-May-2013 12:08 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe that this issue has been resolved through changes on our side.  \r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether the issue is resolved for you by updating your bug report."
