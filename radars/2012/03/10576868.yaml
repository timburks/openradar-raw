    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm not sure of the exact cause of this particular crash but it currently accounts for 63% of the crash logs we're receiving for Growl 1.3.2.  There appears to be an error state that is expecting an error value but instead is failing to nil check it prior to calling CFErrorGetDomain() on it in the URLConnectionClient::_clientDidFailWithError() member function.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nunknown at this time, we've been able to get it to happen sporadically but no rhyme or reason to the trigger."
