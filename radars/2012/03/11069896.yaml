    description: "I often find myself using the following construct:\r\n\r\n-(void)someAction;\r\n{\r\n    if (![obj trySomething])\r\n        return NSLog(@\"something failed\"); // (NSLog returns void)\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhen I try to Do the same in a block:\r\n\r\nvoid (^blk)(void) = ^{\r\n    return NSLog(@\"hi\");\r\n};\r\n\r\nit fails with \"error: void block should not return a value\". The same error is generated with the simple case of \"return (void)0;\".\r\n\r\nDoing \"return (void)0;\" works for void functions and void ObjC methods, but not for void blocks. I'd like it to work for blocks too.\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Apr-2012 07:55 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in Xcode 4.4 Developer Preview 3.  Please verify with this release, and update your bug report with the results.  \r\n\r\nXcode 4.4\r\nBuild: 4F155i (for OS X 10.8)\r\nPosted Date:  April 18, 2012\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\r\n\r\n18-May-2012 12:08 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in Xcode 4.4 Developer Preview 5.  Please verify with this release, and update your bug report with the results.  \r\n\r\nXcode 4.4  Build 4F183f\r\nPosted Date:  May 16, 2012\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\r\nAfter login, click on the \"OS X Mountain Lion\" tab."
