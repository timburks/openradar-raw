    description: "Summary: When dismissing a trailer while it's playing, the modal view moves the opposite direction of how it should.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open iTunes Movie Trailers app on iPad running iOS 5.0\r\n2. start playing a movie trailer. It slides up from the bottom of the screen.\r\n3. tap the Done button or wait for the trailer to finish playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe movie slides back down to whence it came.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe UI slides up over the movie. If you keep doing this, it feels like you're stacking more and more cards on top of the UI. Each modal slide-up should be paired with a modal slide-back-down.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
