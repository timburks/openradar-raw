    description: "28-Mar-2012 09:44 AM Mark Struzinski:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen nearing the end of a code file and using autocomplete, the screen's viewport jumps around when you press the tab button to complete a token.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nScroll toward the end of a code file. This seems to happen more when the @end declaration is actually in sight, but it also sometimes happens if it is not. Begin typing a statement and allow the autocomplete list to pop up. Any time you use the up or down arrow keys to select an entry, the item loses focus and the entire viewport of the code file begins jumping up and down. This causes you to lose your place where you were typing and in general completely breaks your focus.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAutocomplete finishes without issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAny time you use the up or down arrow keys to select an entry, the item loses focus and the entire viewport of the code file begins jumping up and down. This causes you to lose your place where you were typing and in general completely breaks your focus. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis seems to happen on all objective-c files that I am attempting to edit"
