    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen an objective-c class does not implement all of the required methods of the interface or protocol, you receive a warning that states the class has an \"incomplete implementation\".  Unfortunately, the warning message does not provide any evidence of what methods are missing, requiring one to likely change navigators, navigate to the appropriate warning, and drill down before finding the necessary information.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a class with in incomplete implementation.  Build.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn inline warning that provides sufficient information to correct issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA warning that requires significant secondary effort to locate the underlying issue.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
