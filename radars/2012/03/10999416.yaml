    description: "Hi bug screener,\r\n\r\nI'm filing a few bugs on Radar today. Please take a moment to dupe these out properly. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics, so please do me this small favor.) (These all belong to an umbrella bug \"Make Radar better!\" bug that I'll save last and comment withÂ the number for, if you'd like to add these to it as Related.)\r\n\r\nTitle: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nCompletely read my bug before requesting more info.\r\n\r\nI do my best to write clear and unambiguous steps to reproduce and include every applicable crash log, device or host log, sysdiagnose info, anything I can get my hands on. I've received a *lot* of bugs back with \"questions from engineering\" that make no sense given what's already in the bug. This makes me much, much less inclined to file a bug in the first place."
