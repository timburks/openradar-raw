    description: "Summary:\r\nI am trying to dynamically generate audio data in javascript and then play it.  The method is build a wav file and encode it into a data URI. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme)  Then playing it by putting the data URI into a HTML5 audio element or by calling open() on it.\r\n\r\nThis works on the desktop, and used to work in older versions of Mobile Safari.  Now it just displays a dialog saying \"The operation could not be completed\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In Safari on iPod/iPad/iPhone with iOS 5.1\r\n2. Goto http://tadpol.github.com/Avrian-Jump/avrianjump.html\r\n3. Tap on the right arrow button on the lower right hand side of the page. (âžœ)\r\n4. Get the dialog saying: \"The operation could not be completed\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpected that it will play the sound data.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGet the dialog saying: \"The operation could not be completed\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPrior iOS version 5.0 would play the sound.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA web page doing a very similar thing: http://www.sk89q.com/playground/jswav/"
