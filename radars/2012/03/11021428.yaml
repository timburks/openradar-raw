    description: "Summary: When installing Xcode 4.3.1 on a clean system (I'm on 10.7.3), xcode-select is never given a workable default value, even after the command-line tools are installed, and Xcode itself is successfully performing builds.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Install Xcode 4.3.1 on a clean system. Install the command-line tools just for good measure. Build something with xcodebuild.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The thing should build, or fail, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nActual Results: \"xcode-select: Error: No Xcode folder is set. Run xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path> to set the path to the Xcode folder.\"\r\n\r\nRegression: This hasn't been a factor for us in the past, though all of our systems had Xcode 4.2 and earlier installed, and many had made changes to xcode-select's value in the past, which 4.3 inherited. \r\n\r\nNotes: The error message is puzzling â€” my understanding is that the expected value is \"Applications/Xcode.app\", which fills out to \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\", but \"Xcode folder path\" suggests that the expected value is \"/Applications\"."
