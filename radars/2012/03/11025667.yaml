    description: "10-Mar-2012 03:11 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The UIPageControl looks good against some backgrounds, but not others. Unfortunately, there is no way for a developer to customize the colors used by the page control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Place a UIPageControl into a customized bar button item on a toolbar.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Page control should be easily visible.\r\n\r\nActual Results: On iPhone, with a dark blue toolbar, it looks fine, but on iPad, the page control dots are barely visible against the light toolbar color."
