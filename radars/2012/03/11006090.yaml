    description: "Summary: The Messages for Mac beta closes the current conversation when Command-W is pressed. Replacing the system shortcut with Command-Shift-W which is all wrong. Close Window should be command-w and close conversation should be command-shift-w. I have closed many conversations when I didn’t mean to and this greatly annoys me. \r\n\r\nMessages should conform to the system defaults.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Hit command w.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The window closes.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The conversation closes.\r\n\r\nRegression: I think this worked right in iChat.\r\n\r\nNotes: Please don’t mess with my head by changing these system keyboard shortcuts in system apps. Please."
