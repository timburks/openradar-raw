    description: "Some regions consist of multiple linguistic groups (ex. Belgium consists of the Dutch-speaking Flemish region and the French-speaking Walloon region). In such regions, to cover the entire audience, movies and tv-shows are available in multiple languages. The iTunes Store solves this problem by offering all possible versions separately as seemingly unrelated releases. This causes a lot of duplicates in listings across the store. Many users might be confused and/or might purchase an item in a language they don't understand (since the language of the content isn't clear in many cases).\r\n\r\nPossible solutions to this problem could be (but aren't limited to):\r\n• List content only once and supply multiple audio and subtitle tracks.\r\n• Group related releases and allow users to set a default language.\r\n• Offer separate stores for different linguistic groups."
