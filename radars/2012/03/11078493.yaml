    description: "19-Mar-2012 08:56 PM Mike Beasley:\r\nSummary:\r\nSeriously you guys, the icon looks fine on the iPhone, but using it for OS X notifications just looks dumb. OS X doesn't use those rounded-square icons for anything.  Mac apps have icons of all shapes and sizes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Twitter for Mac icon looks equally stupid and shouldn't be used for the notifications, either.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to look at the various icons available on the page listed below, talk to your friends and partners at Twitter, and agree on one that looks better (probably one of the standalone birds).\r\n\r\nhttp://twitter.com/about/resources/logos"
