    description: "Hi bug screener,\r\n\r\nI'm filing a few bugs on Radar today. Please take a moment to dupe these out properly. (I used to screen bugs for CoreGraphics, so please do me this small favor.) (These all belong to an umbrella bug \"Make Radar better!\" bug that I'll save last and comment withÂ the number for, if you'd like to add these to it as Related.)\r\n\r\nTitle: (pasted here because bugreport.apple.com truncates long titles (rdar://10465967))\r\nAdd the ability to comment on other bugs and to upvote them as an issue that we'd like to see fixed (or a feature to be added)\r\n\r\nWhen external bugs are opened up, external developers can help save screeners and engineers a lot of time by searching and pressing a button to +1 an issue and say \"this is important to me as well\". This is much less time-intensive than filing an entire bug that asks \"please dupe me to bug xxx\". Being able to comment on each other's radars lets us expand upon what is already there rather than duplicating work. We can provide workarounds that enable us to keep writing our apps while you work on a fix."
