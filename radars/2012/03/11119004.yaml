    description: "26-Mar-2012 10:59 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOpen Quickly dialog is not finding any files in my project, even when exactly named. No idea why this just started happening, or how to fix it. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI open my project, type Shift+Command+O, enter the name of a file (e.g. Info.plist) and the file is not found.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe named files should show up!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe files are not found.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI used to have a problem like this back in Xcode 4.0 where having paths like \"./external/sqlcipher\" in my header search paths seemed to keep code sense / indexing from working properly, but this isn't so bad. Just an odd thing that happens from time to time, and tends to consternate.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe attached screen clip shows the problem occurring. The problem can be fixed by going into Organizer window -> Projects, and deleting derived data for the project.\r\n\r\n26-Mar-2012 10:59 AM William Gray:\r\n'xcode-open-quickly.png' was successfully uploaded"
