    description: "05-Mar-2012 06:53 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: When MacBook Pro is awakened from sleep, sometimes it does not show the login screen. Instead, the screen is completely blank except for the mouse pointer. The pointer can be moved around the screen, but nothing else ever appears.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: In System Preferences, check the \"Require password after sleep or screen saver begins\" box. Then close the MacBook lid to let it go to sleep (or wait until it automatically goes to sleep). Then open the lid and/or press keyboard keys to awaken it. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:Login screen should appear, and entering username and password will restore operation.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Mouse pointer appears, but the login screen never appears. Can do nothing except hold down Power button to turn the MacBook off, then reboot it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've seen this behavior with an early-2008 MacBook Pro and a late-2011 MacBook Pro, in both Snow Leopard and Lion."
