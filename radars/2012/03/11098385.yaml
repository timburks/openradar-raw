    description: "Enabling \"Setting Time Zone\" drains battery at 1-2% pr. 10 minutes.\r\nThe purple location icon is always on, and from the battery drain i suspect the GPS is always on as well.\r\n\r\nEven with Flight Mode enabled, the drain still continues.\r\n\r\nDisabling location services for this specific service has brought me back to an average drain of 5-7% over 5 hours. (wifi, bluetooth and push enabled)\r\n\r\nRestoring the phone from a backup resolves the problem temporarily, but it comes back after 2-3 days."
