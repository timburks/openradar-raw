    description: "I have two WiFi access points (with different SSIDs) in different levels of the house. When changing levels in the house, all my iOS devices (all iPad generations, all iPhone models) stick to the current WiFi network even if the signal level is very poor and even though the other WiFi network has a far better signal level. I constantly have to choose the strongest WiFi network manually.\r\n\r\nWhen at the edge of all WiFi coverage, my iPhone 4S still keeps the WiFi connection and refuses to fall back to 3G even though all data connections via WiFi fail. In this case I have to manually disable WiFi to force it to 3G.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNot a new issue in 5.0.1 and also happens in all newer (beta) versions of iOS."
