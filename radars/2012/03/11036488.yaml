    description: "Summary:\r\nTerminal.app window becomes partially transparent when glyphs from the U+1F300 page are rendered.  It also may cause the Inspector window's scroll frame-rate to droop or become unresponsive due to rendering lag.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a window in Terminal.app.  Position it on top of some other window which is not filled with a solid color.\r\nPick window settings with a black background (e.g. the Homebrew preset).\r\nRun this print statement to fill the terminal with, for instance, U+1F310:\r\npython -c 'print u\"\\U0001F310\"*8000'\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDark window with alpha-blended Emoji glyphs rendered on top.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTerminal.app window is transparent in the regions where the Emoji glyphs' backgrounds were painted.  Observed behavior is consistent with a Source Copy raster operation being used instead of Source Over.\r\n\r\nIf you bump the print statement up from 8000 to 80000 copies of the character, then pressing command-I to bring up the inspector and scrolling up and down results in lag.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nObserved in Terminal.app Version 2.2.2 (303)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDon't ask why I tried this."
