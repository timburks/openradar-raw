    description: "Many users want to watch their movies and TV shows on the big screen, but without the big-screen sound. Some are trying not to wake up the neighbors or the  baby in the other room, others really like the sound of their awesome new headphones. There are wireless headphones on the market, and they're a clumsy solution.\r\n\r\nApple could provide a simple, sofiware-based solution for Apple TV users by optionally streaming the TV audio to an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. The user would plug in their headphones into the device (which they're likely to have handy anyway) and enjoy the sound privately. \r\n\r\nThis could even happen automatically whenever headphones are detected in the Remote app. Call it a rich man's wireless-headphone solution.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
