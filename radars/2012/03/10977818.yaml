    description: "This is intended to be a message in support of Radar #10977795. Please read Tim's bug for a more eloquent description of what I'm about to say.\r\n\r\nI can't count the times in my career as an indie Mac & iOS software developer, I've heard from folks eager to get going on their own projects, but afraid of what it means to go \"indie\" when it comes to health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe United States is unique in the world for failing to offer our citizens a reasonable safety net for health. Other countries are probably seeing indie-minded developers leaping at the opportunity to develop new apps and companies centered around the iOS and Mac App Stores. In the US, the hesitation to \"go indie\" may be seriously hurting Apple's developer/AppStore ecosystem.\r\n\r\nApple could change things dramatically by opening up their existing health insurance network to all or some dedicated iOS and Mac developers. Developers would pay comparable premiums to what Apple employees pay, and probably tend to fit a similar health profile to Apple's own employees.\r\n\r\nPlease consider passing this … \"crazy\" … suggestion along to your developer evangelists, to your lawyers, to Tim Cook, to see what they think about revolutionizing the app industry in yet another important way.\r\n\r\nDaniel"
