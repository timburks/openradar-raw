    description: "26-Mar-2012 10:45 AM Jamie Pinkham:\r\nMany users, who were MobileMe users, may have many different Apple IDs, which can be confusing.  The ability to merge Apple IDs into a single unified Apple ID would simplify the process of setting up a new iCloud based device.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have a former MobileMe account that was moved to iCloud, so I have email, calendaring, messaging, etc under one Apple ID, but all of my store purchases are under a different Apple ID created long before MobileMe.  As such, I have to use a different Apple ID for the iTunes store, so I don't lose my purchase history.\r\n\r\nThe setup process on iOS automatically populates the various accounts with your iCloud Apple ID, and you must manually revert the various accounts to the proper Apple ID, to get everything correct.  This is confusing even for an advanced user, and often done incorrectly."
