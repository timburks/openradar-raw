    description: "Summary: iPhones connected to HSPA+ Networks incorrectly display \"4G\" network indicator\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1) Connect to HSPA+ Network 2) Observe network indicator change to 4G\r\n\r\nExpected Results: 1) iPhone displays \"3G\" indicator as the network type, as it has since the iPhone 3G in 2008.\r\n\r\nActual Results: iPhone switches network indicator to 4G, even though it is not connected to an LTE network.\r\n\r\nRegression: Does not occur in iOS 2.0 though 5.0.1. Issue only occurs beginning in iOS 5.1, build 9B179. has been observed on iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 (GSM). \r\n\r\nNotes: This is a step backwards from iOS 5.0.1 and is deceptive to users. HSPA+ is a small software update to existing 3G networks, and does not offer the large jump in speeds associated with a generational improvement in cellular networking (e.g.- Moving from EDGE to 3G). \r\n\r\nPlease see the following websites for numerous screenshots: http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/7/2852560/ios-5-1-iphone-4s-att-4g-indicator\r\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/07/ios-5-1-adds-4g-indicator-to-iphone-4s-status-bar-for-att-hspa-coverage/\r\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/5657/apple-posts-ios-51-final-build-9b179"
