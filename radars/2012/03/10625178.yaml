    description: "25-Dec-2011 01:39 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen closing individual files within an Xcode workspace, the same files keep re-appearing (in the reverse order that they were last opened).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a series of files within an Xcode workspace -- be sure to re-open the same files a few times;\r\n2. Using \"File → Close $DOCUMENT\", or the Command-Control-W shortcut, close the opened files one-by-one;\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOnce a file within a workspace is closed, it should stay closed until I access it next.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe files seem to re-open in the reverse order that they were accessed -- almost like a history of the opened files. It now takes much, much longer to close all of the opened files in a workspace.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nYes -- this did not occur under previous versions of Xcode, including the last minor release (4.2.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n10-Mar-2012 09:00 AM Tony Arnold:\r\nI've checked, and Xcode 4.3.1 does not exhibit the behaviour described in my original bug report. Thank the engineers for the fix, and thank you to you and your team for following up directly! :)\r\n\r\nThis issue has been verified as resolved and can be closed.\r\n\r\n10-Mar-2012 05:16 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering believes this issue has been addressed in the latest Xcode 4.3 release.  Please verify with this release, and update your bug report with the results.  \r\n\r\nXcode 4.3Build: 4E109 (for Lion)\r\nDate posted:  February 16, 2012\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/"
