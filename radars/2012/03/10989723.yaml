    description: "05-Mar-2012 08:34 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: Xcode provides an \"Automatic Device Provisioning\" feature that makes it easy to set up a development certificate and provisioning profile for simple development situations. This same idea should be carried forward to generate distribution certificates and profiles.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Sign up for iOS Developer program. Download Xcode, develop application, then try to submit app to App Store or install app on device via Ad-hoc Distribution.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: In project settings, developer would specify any app-specific code-signing requirements (entitlements, app IDs, etc.) When building project for distribution, Xcode prompts for iOS Developer program account name and password, then automatically generate any necessary certificates and provisioning profiles. The user is prompted if keychain access is required.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Developer must manually perform a complicated series of operations, which are explained in documents such as TN2250 (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2250/_index.html). Few developers understand what they are doing. Mistakes are easy to make, and difficult to diagnose. If developer has multiple distribution certificates in keychain, then results are unpredictable even if all steps have been followed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
