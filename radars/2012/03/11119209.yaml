    description: "26-Mar-2012 11:50 AM William Gray:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen testing a build of our app STRIP for the Mac App Store, we need to sign into the Sandbox environment when launching the app. So, we have test users in the Sandbox environment. Today, we find that when logging in to four test user accounts, each causes a popup saying \"Your account is disabled,\" and we can't test the freaking build. I cannot describe in strong enough terms without being extremely rude how frustrating this is, we're just trying to get some work done, it's already a frustrating process, we shouldn't have to deal with this. I shouldn't have to ask my boss to go create us yet another one so I can get on with it. Why disable test user accounts that we are clearly using? Please stop.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Mar-2012 11:50 AM William Gray:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-03-26 at 11.34.21 AM.png' was successfully uploaded"
