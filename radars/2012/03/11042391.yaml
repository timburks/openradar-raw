I have also inserted my app's Bundle ID and version number (corresponding to that of iTunes Connect) in the sample app's info.plist.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\n13-Mar-2012 07:03 PM Jonathan Sibley:\r\nAn error occurred during file upload.Please try uploading the file(s) again.If the problem persists, please email your file(s) and Bug ID # to <devbugs@apple.com> and we will append the bug report with the file(s) provided."
