Error: unknown error code. \r\nThis generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.Signal received: SIGABRT (Aborted)\r\nProcess finished with exit code 0\r\n\r\n3) Only solution is to reboot the device. If you're foolishly using the simulator, reboot the computer and reload your project and lose several minutes of your life and all context of where you were.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
