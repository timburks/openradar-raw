    description: "Summary:\r\nSelecting text in a file merge window, hitting command-e and then switching to an Xcode code window and doing command-g doesn't work. Xcode still has the old item on the find pasteboard.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open FileMerge and pick two files to diff.\r\n2. have one of these files open in Xcode.\r\n3. select some text in the differences window in FileMerge.\r\n4. press command-e\r\n5. goto Xcode\r\n6. press command-g to find the text in Xcode's window\r\n7. It will not find the text you just selected in File Merge. If anything it'll find the last item on the find pasteboard.\r\n \r\nExpected Results:\r\n(from above)\r\n7. Xcode should find the text that I just put on the find pasteboard.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked fine in Xcode 4.2. I used it often.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
