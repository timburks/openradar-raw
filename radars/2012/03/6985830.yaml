    description: "Considering this scenario:\r\n- I'm using a shared right with a timeout (such as the rights based on the default, authenticate-admin or authenticate-admin-30 rules).\r\n- A non-administrator user reaches that part of the code, an authentication dialog appears\r\n- The user asks an administrator who agrees to authenticate for this operation\r\n- The administrator goes away\r\n- Now the problem: non-administrator user is now able to access system preferences which are normally locked such as the 'Sharing' pane\r\n- After the timeout hits, if the user reaches again that part of the code, an authentication dialog appears again. However the system preferences remain unlocked and the non-admin user can change the settings.\r\n\r\nDue to this behavior, I really don't see when using a shared right is relevant (unless the application provides a lock/unlock button, like System Preferences does). I don't want the non-administrator users to have access to protected system preferences panes (and I'm using the system preferences as an example but basically it also concerns every other secure location protected by a shared right).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also seeing that many system (and third-party) rights are based on the 'default', 'authenticate-admin-30' or other shared rules. Which means that using these rights in a non-administrator session will offer access to the system preferences as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I know I can call AuthorizationFree with the kAuthorizationFlagDestroyRights flag but this is not good since it locks the system preferences when running as an administrator which is not to be expected. Obviously this is better than the access escalation mentioned above but not very satisfying.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all versions of Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple example:\r\n\r\n- Log into an non-administrator session.\r\n- Open System Preferences > Sharing and make sure the lock is closed.\r\n- Select \"Software Update..\" from the Apple menu. On Mountain Lion you may need to refresh the \"Updates\" page (command-R).\r\n- Authenticate using you administrator login/password.\r\n- Open System Preferences > Sharing and notice the lock is opened.\r\n- The non-administrator user can change privileged settings."
