    description: "16-Mar-2012 02:37 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: When developer creates a new UIView subclass using the \"Objective-C Class\" template, the generated code includes an implementation of -initWithFrame: with a place for view-initialization code to be written. This will work fine if the class is instantiated programmatically. However, if the developer places an instance of the new UIView subclass into a NIB, the developer may be surprised that the initialization code does not execute. This is due to the fact that when loaded from a NIB, a view's -init method is not called; instead its -awakeFromNib method is called.\r\n\r\nAny UIView subclass with initialization code in its -init method will probably need identical or similar code in its -awakeFromNib. However, new iOS developers may not know this, and experienced iOS developers can easily overlook the need for -awakeFromNib. To prevent these problems, the UIView subclass template should include -awakeFromNib.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to prevent the need to write the initialization code twice, so template code like this would be useful:\r\n\r\n\r\n@implementation MyView\r\n\r\n- (void)setup_MyView {\r\n    // initialization code to be executed by either -initWithFrame or -awakeFromNib\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame\r\n{\r\n    self = [super initWithFrame:frame];\r\n    if (self) {\r\n        [self setup_MyView];\r\n\r\n        // other initialization code for programmatic instantiation\r\n    }\r\n    return self;\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)awakeFromNib {\r\n    [super awakeFromNib];\r\n\r\n    [self setup_MyView];\r\n\r\n    // other initialization code for loading from NIB\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:In Xcode with a project open, choose the File > New > File.. menu item, select iOS > Cocoa Touch > Objective-C Class and click Next, enter a new class name and choose UIView from the \"Subclass of\" list and click Next, and click Create.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Generated code implements both -initWithFrame: and -awakeFromNib, and the view works fine whether generated programmatically or loaded from a NIB\r\n\r\nActual Results: Generated code only implements -initWithFrame, and if developer puts any non-trivial code within it, the view does not work when loaded from a NIB.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
