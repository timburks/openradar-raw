    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWe've occassionally had issues with games behaving weirdly and sending odd data across in the turn data. Since Apple runs these servers we have no way to inspect a game's turn history to figure out what is actually causing the problem.\r\n\r\nIf we were given a tool in iTunes Connect to look up and inspect turn data history based on Game Center IDs we'd be able to better debug this issue. \r\n\r\nWithout this we have to make sure to log all turn data on the user's device and then ask the user to send us the turn data if and only if they contact us about the issue. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nNeed to debug a turn based data problem\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nUse an Apple provided tool, maybe on iTunes Connect, to look at an examine the data being sent between two users of a certain Game Center ID.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo way to get any of this data from the Game Center servers, leaving debugging issues to be VERY dificult. We instead have to make sure to log all turn data on the user's device and then ask the user to send us the turn data if and only if they contact us about the issue. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nBeen this way since iOS 5.0 introduced Turn Based Notifications\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
