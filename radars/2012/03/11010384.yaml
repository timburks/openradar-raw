    description: "Summary:\r\niPhoto hides the system status bar when app is open.\r\nIf you're sharing something that requires uploading or beaming, I would like to see the connection status to see if it has a good connection and will happen quickly or a poor one and happen slowly.\r\nIf I'm on a schedule, I want to see the time without closing the app or pulling down Notification Center.\r\nIf I'm running low on battery before a meeting or flight, I'd like to know inside the app.\r\n\r\nIt's 20 points of vertical space. It is not impeding on photo editing, no matter how important a photo is to me, the connection status, time, and battery is a necessary part of using iPad.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch iPhoto for iOS (iPad).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPhoto for iPad shows a status bar at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niPhoto for iPad does not show a status bar at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
