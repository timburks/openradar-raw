    description: "Summary:\r\nThe 100 devices per year limit is there for a good reason, and most developers have no problem with Apple limiting the use of provisioning profiles. There is, however, a growing problem that the 100 devices per year is no longer enough. There are currently a total of 11 Apple devices you have to consider when developing iOS applications. With the rate devices are added, including the upcoming Apple TV, that number is growing fast. As a developer, and especially a contractor creating several applications per year for several different clients, sending Beta test versions via Ad Hoc Provisioning becomes harder and harder as the 100 limit remains static. The limit seems to be ignoring the increasing number of devices that applications needs to be tested on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n–\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n–\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n–\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n–\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm aware of the alternative of using the Enterprise Developer program, but as a contractor you are not allowed, and shouldn't even try, to distribute provisioning profile to third parties (in this case, the client). Of course, one could argue that the clients should use their own developer accounts, since the App Store submits should be done trough those anyway. There is however a problem with that too, being the time it takes to create a developer account. Companies hiring contractors to do their applications very seldom have developer accounts ready for immediate use, causing the development and testing process to be very long and problematic for developers."
