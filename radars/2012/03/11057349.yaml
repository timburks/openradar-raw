    description: "15-Mar-2012 04:38 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The iOS Simulator allows the user to simulate pinch/zoom gestures by holding down the Option key and using the mouse to move two virtual \"fingertips\". This is a suitable workaround for a developer workstation equipped with a mouse, but many (most?) iOS developers have trackpads on their development machines, and so it would be helpful if actual two-finger pinch/zoom gestures on the trackpad would be translated into simulated pinch/zoom gestures on the iOS Simulator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: On a MacBook, or on any Mac that has a Magic Trackpad, start iOS Simulator. In Simulator, open Mobile Safari and go to a web page like http://www.apple.com. Then perform a two-finger zoom gesture on the trackpad.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Mobile Safari should zoom in.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Nothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
