    description: "Summary: Can't run an App in the iOS simulator. Xcode acts like the app is actually running, but nothing happens. The Stop button is enabled, but doesn't respond.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: happens sometimes (once every 20 ?) when I hit the build and run button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The app is launched in the simulator and runs normally. I can close the task with the Stop button in Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The build and run process seems to be frozen, but I still can edit code and navigate. I can't stop a running task in Xcode, or build and run again. The app in the iOS simulator is not launched, but I can use the simulator. When I quit Xcode then (cmd Q), it prompts me that it needs to close the task, which it does and quit without any issue.\r\n\r\nRegression: In Xcode 4.2.1, sometimes the simulator wasn't launching the app after a build and run, but I was able to stop and launch again. \r\n\r\nNotes: Since the only solution to solve this for me is to quit Xcode, it's kind of annoying. Thanks of your help!"
