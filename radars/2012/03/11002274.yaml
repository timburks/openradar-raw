    description: "Summary:\r\nA coordinated file access using an NSFileCoordinator on behalf of an NSFilePresenter instance should not result in calls to the NSFilePresenter. Under normal circumstances this works. If the coordinated file access occurs on entering the background, the NSFilePresenter is called - sometimes immediately but usually on return to the foreground.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create an NSFilePresenter for a local directory containing one file\r\n2. In response to a UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification, perform a coordinated write to the file inside the NSFilePresenter's directory, on behalf of the NSFilePresenter (i.e. pass the NSFilePresenter to the NSFileCoordinator's initWithFilePresenter:). Use a UIApplication background task to ensure this has time to complete,\r\n3. Observe call to [NSFilePresenter presentedSubItemDidChangeAtURL:] on returning to the foreground.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn NSFilePresenter should never be invoked as a result of its own actions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe NSFilePresenter can be invoked if it performs an action while the app is transitioning to the background.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNO\r\n\r\nNotes:"
