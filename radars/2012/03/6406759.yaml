    description: "28-Nov-2008 10:27 PM Rob Napier:\r\nXCode 3 moved the User Scripts into a unified plist in the user's directory that includes both user created scripts and system provided scripts. This makes it very difficult to share scripts with team members. Scripts should be read, together with configuration information, from files similar to how XCode 2.5 handled user scripts."
