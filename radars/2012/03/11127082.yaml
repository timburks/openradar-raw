    description: "27-Mar-2012 09:40 AM Gabriel Visser:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using iMessage with multiple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac) if one (e.g. iPad) is offline while messaging on the (e.g. iPhone) the iPad redownloads every message you send in that time frame on by one when taking it back online.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: \r\n1. Turn off iPad. \r\n2. Send and receive a few messages using your iPhone through iMessage. \r\n3. Turn the iPad back on and send a message through iMessage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iPad pulls in the entire conversation you had at once and you'll be able to continue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe iPad pulls in the individual send and received messages one by one. With long conversations this can take up HOURS of time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nHappens on my new iPad en iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1. As well as MacBook Air and iMac running the Messages beta.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOther's have experienced this problem. Sometimes the Mac app DOES do the expected result. These moments don't happen often, though."
