    description: "When using blocks, it's difficult to quickly determine which scope a \"return\" statement corresponds to (whether it returns from, say, an enumeration block, or the method itself). It would be great if the Xcode editor could indicate which scope it corresponds to. Perhaps it could be shown in the leading indentation.\r\n\r\nWhile you're at it, it would be similarly great for \"continue\" and \"break\" statements."
