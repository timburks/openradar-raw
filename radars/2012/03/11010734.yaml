    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Apple Store will accept any U.S. zip code to be entered into its Shipping form. If a Puerto Rico zip code is entered, the form recognizes the state as being \"PR\", however when one attempts to complete the order, \"PR\" is rejected as a valid value for the State form field.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nNavigate to http://store.apple.com/us\r\nAdd an item to your cart, proceed to check out\r\nEnter a valid U.S. address, such as \r\n[REDACTED] 00926\r\n\r\nWait for form field to detect 00926 as San Juan, PR.\r\n\r\nClick on Continue\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOrder is finalized, processed and shipped to Puerto Rico, US.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nForm fails validation on the PR field.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nPR hasn't been accepted as a valid value as far as we know.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPuerto Rico is a U.S. territory, considered by the US Postal Services as a domestic shipping destination. There is no online Apple Store for Puerto Rico. There is no way for us to order Apple products online directly from Apple at the moment. We do have Apple resellers at Best Buy, Modernica, iShop and Walmart, but no official Apple Store, so we are kind of left out when it comes to new products."
