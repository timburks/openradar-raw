    description: "Retina displays have gotten huge. No Retina display has ever fit on the MacBook Pro 13\" or MacBook Air 11\", and with the iPad3, only a now-deprecated 30\" Cinema display can contain the entire display in any orientation.\r\n\r\nThe simulator should scale, like Screen Sharing (the UIs are doing the same job) and optionally provide a loupe for pixel peeping, like Aperture (editing large photos is a similar problem)."
