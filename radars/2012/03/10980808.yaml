    description: "Summary:\r\nAttempting to display a CFUserNotification from a sandboxed process triggers a violation. The API performs a mach-lookup of \"com.apple.UNCUserNotification\", and when that is denied, it simply prints the notification instead of displaying a window. Adding a temporary mach-lookup exception for \"com.apple.UNCUserNotification\" fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttempt to display a CFUserNotification in a sandboxed process. The scenario in which I encountered this was a sandboxed app using a helper tool that inherited the app's sandbox. The helper tool has no UI, and uses CFUserNotification to interact with the user.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo sandbox violation and no required temporary exceptions.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA sandbox violation like this:\r\nsandboxd: ([42347]) CFUserNotificationTest(42347) deny mach-lookup com.apple.UNCUserNotification\r\nA temporary exception is required for CFUserNotification to work.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nProcesses that are not sandboxed do not have this problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOpenRadar note:\r\nYou can download my sample project here: http://c.zcr.me/kRcv+"
