    description: "19-Mar-2012 03:46 PM David Barry:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFor customers using icloud, appointment offerings / meeting requests that arrive as .ics attatchments in the IOS application can only be added to the calendar EXACTLY as recieved.   Further, they can not be modified or deleted once added to the calendar.  \r\n\r\nThis means that if an appointment is accepted in error, or needs to be modified in any manner there is no possibility to correct the error.\r\n\r\nThe only means to correct this is IF the user has access to a non-IOS device, logs into icloud.com and deletes the entry.   It is important to note that IOS devices CANNOT access icloud.com directly -- they ar deliberatly blocked in favor of the IOS natice application, which cannot resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Note:  I cannot validate if this is an issue for non-icloud devices as well, as my only IOS device is icloud linked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue was also known to exist in IOS 5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have attatched two different ICS files that illustrate the problem.   To use they may require modification of the date data (adding a year to the date should be sufficient.)  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use a program such as outlook, lotus notes, the or other calendaring tool that can generate an emailed Appointment or other calendar request as a standard .ics file attachement.\r\n\r\n(Note: This can be simulated by using each of my attachments).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Revieve the emailed appointment with the standard IOS mail application.   Tap the attachement to process the attachement.  \r\n\r\n3.  Note that no edit option is available\r\n\r\n4.  Select \"Add to Calendar\".  \r\n\r\n5. Exit to the Home Screen.   Launch the the calendar application.\r\n\r\n6.  Confirm that the entry is listed on the appropriate calendar page.  Tap the entry to view its' details.\r\n\r\n7. Observe that on event panel the \"Edit\" buttion DOES NOT appear in the upper right corner.  This event cannot be modified or deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAny event added to the calendar by the user should be editable and/or deletable within IOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\r\nAn event added to the calendar is immutable without resprting to a non-IOS device to resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Mar-2012 03:46 PM David Barry:\r\n'C__temp_invite.ics' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n19-Mar-2012 03:46 PM David Barry:\r\n'C__temp_invite-alt.ics' was successfully uploaded"
