    description: "By naming convention, the returned CFDataRef from SecKeychainItemExport() should not be owned by the caller, failing the Create rule. However, the CFDataRef is created using an unreleased CFDataCreateMutable() and so is owned by the caller.\r\n\r\nSecKeychainItemExport() should likely be renamed SecKeychainItemExportCopy() to resolve this."
