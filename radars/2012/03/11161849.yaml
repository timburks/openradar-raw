    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way of determining what SSL cipher was negotiated between Safari and the web server. Typically a browser (Firefox, IE, Chrome, etc.) will display the negotiated Cipher as follows when clicking on the lock icon.\r\n\r\n\"Your connection to demo.basen.com is encrypted with 128-bit encryption.\r\nThe connection uses TLS 1.0.\r\nThe connection is encrypted using AES_128_CBC, with SHA1 for message authentication and RSA as the key exchange mechanism.\" (example from Chrome)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. https://www.google.com/\r\n2. click lock icon in the right upper corner of Safari\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay cipher in use\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot shown anywhere\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCopy of this filed on OpenRadar for everyone else :-)"
