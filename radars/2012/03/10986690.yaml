    description: "Xcode Debugger: Enable \"Framework-specific\" edit and enabling for Exception breakpoints\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe Exception Breakpoint mechanism is very useful, but gets really noisy when using a library which uses exceptions internally. The ability to edit this breakpoint to either a) add frameworks/libraries inside which to ignore exceptions, and/or b) add multiple exception breakpoints which are attached to specific libraries would be even more useful.\r\n\r\nSpecifying the applicable (or not) libraries would give us the ability to ignore exceptions that we know are handled internally and which we cannot do anything about.\r\n\r\nMultiple exception breakpoints give us the ability to enable and disable specific exception scenarios while debugging."
