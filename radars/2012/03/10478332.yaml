    description: "21-Nov-2011 02:53 PM Rob Napier:\r\nStartupItem run synchronously with the boot process. This allows StartupItems to block the boot (prior to loginwindow) in order to handle at-boot events. launchd has no similar mechanism, making it impossible to synchronously execute scripts at boot in a non-deprecated way. This makes it difficult to run install scripts, system configuration scripts, or other scripts that the administrator would like to run prior to any user logging in.\r\n\r\nHooking into the (discouraged) login hook or building an authentication forces the logging-in user to wait for the script to run, even if the script could have run earlier without inconveniencing the user.\r\n\r\nWe would like a supported mechanism for synchronously interrupting the boot process prior to loginwindow to run scripts in a normal root context."
