    description: "I have a UITableViewCell with the following subview hierarchy.\r\n\r\nUITableViewCell\r\n\tCustomView1\r\n\t\t* UILabel1\r\n\t\t* CustomView2\r\n\t\t* UILabel2\r\n\t\t* UITextView\r\n\r\nI wanna prevent the cell from being accessible per se but want to specify accessibility attributes for the * marked views. No matter how I try, the cell itself is automatically made accessible with an accessibility label that consists of the values of UILabel1 and 2 concatenated with \", \" in between. When hovering over the UILabels, they aren't accessible specifically.\r\n\r\nAccessibility of CustomView2 and UITextView works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UITableViewCell is created in code (default style). CustomView1 is loaded from a NIB and added as a subview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19-Apr-2012 01:39 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following feedback regarding this issue: \r\n\r\nPlease explicitly set isAccessibilityElement on UILabels, which will inform us they are to be distinct elements."
