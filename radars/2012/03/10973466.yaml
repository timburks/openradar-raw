    description: "02-Mar-2012 11:52 AM Claire Connelly:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIf you drag-and-drop URLs from the location bar of a web browser (using the favicon) into the Messages beta, the link appears with the URL hidden and the title of the page as an underlined link. However, on an iOS device, the link completely disappears. If it's in the middle of a message, the message is split into two parts, the bit before the link and the bit after the link. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nStart Messages beta and start sending messages to someone over iMessage. Drag a link using the favicon from a web browser. You'll see an underlined link with the title of the page.  Send the message. Look at the receiving iOS device (or another using the iMessage syncing); you'll see a gap where the link was.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nLinks should show up as expected, and look the same as they do in the Messages beta.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nGaps in text corresponding to linked text.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nCopying and pasting the URL works fine, but gives you a URL in the message rather than readable text."
