    description: "Summary: the TextEdit Save sheet is slow and sometimes unnecessary. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a new document. Write some text. Cut or otherwise delete all the content. Close the window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Window closes.\r\n\r\nActual Results: TextEdit offers to save an empty document. After a substantial delay where the window I closed is still there, taunting me.\r\nThis also happens when I open a document, make a change, undo the change, and close the document.\r\n\r\nRegression: Wasn't a problem in Snow Leopard and before.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIn addition, Don't Save used to be highlights so the spacebar would quickly close the document without saving. I miss it.\r\n\r\nMaybe using a Sticky in Dashboard for my scratchpad needs will work better."
