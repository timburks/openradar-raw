    description: "Summary: UINavigationBar and UIToolbar display very differently on the new iPad's Retina Display when a tintColor is set. UINavigationBar is lighter in appearance—the gradient becomes darker much further down. UIToolbar is drastically lighter in appearance, and the top edge is blurry. On a 1x iPad, you can see a well-defined darker line above the top edge, and a sharp highlight along the top edge. On a 2x iPad this is all blurred together, so the top edge of the toolbar is poorly defined.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a project, perhaps using a split view\r\n2. Set the tintColor of the navigation bar\r\n3. Add a toolbar and set the tintColor\r\n\r\nExpected Results: These elements should look very similar on any iPad with iOS 5.1. If anything they should look a bit sharper on the new iPad.\r\n\r\nActual Results: These elements look very different on the new iPad than they do on any other iPad, even with the same iOS version 5.1.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: Screenshots are attached showing the differences. The color differences are apparent even when screenshots are compared on a single device, so it's not just due to the new iPad displaying colors a bit differently—they're being rendered differently.\r\n\r\n1x: http://junecloud.com/journal/bugs/02/1x.png\r\n2x: http://junecloud.com/journal/bugs/02/2x.png"
