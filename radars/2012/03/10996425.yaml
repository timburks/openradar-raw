    description: "06-Mar-2012 04:28 PM Matthew Crenshaw:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAutocomplete stops working, syntax highlighting stops working, xcode turns into a dumb editor (a la TextEdit)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse Xcode for any amount of time, it seems to prop up randomly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAutocomplete to continue working, syntax highlighting as well.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAutocomplete stops working properly. It suggests methods and properties that do not exist for the object behind the cursor.\r\n\r\nSyntax highlighting fails at the same time.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis worked great in 4.2.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI can get syntax highlighting and autocomplete to work again if I restart Xcode, but this failure happens very frequently."
