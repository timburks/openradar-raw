    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen working with MPMediaItems, it is helpful to know the item's iCloud download status (in iCloud, not in iCloud, downloaded, currently downloading, not downloaded, etc).\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to be able to trigger a download of an iCloud song, in order to be able to use it with AVPlayer and background audio."
