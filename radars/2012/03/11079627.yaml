    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is a similar topic as in Problem ID: 11068891 \r\n\r\nIf you define your storyboard in xcode  there is no way to automantic sync this segue names with the source code. This is not quite lean and a source for bugs.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest the following improvement for XCode to support this problem. ->See Notes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nManual changing of the source code if the storyboard is change, specially the segue names.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nImprovement: It would be very helpfull if xcode generate for the storyboard a class which define all const values (e.g. segue names). \r\n\r\n This has the following advantages:\r\n- you can refere to a element which just once in the source code model.\r\n- the compiler can realize the structual changes and provide an error if the code is not update correct.\r\n- eventully you save resources because you have to define this string just once.\r\n\r\nI expect you find a similar or a more apple style solution for that \r\n\r\nMaybe there is already something similar and i could not find it, in this case please add it in all your default project templates that everybode see it."
