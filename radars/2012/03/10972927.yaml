    description: "Summary: Red-green colourblind people have trouble distinguishing between red/dark red (#f00 and darker) text and black text.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: File a bad bug, get asked to repro or something.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Bug is obviously different than the others, perhaps by lightening the shade of red or by changing the shade of the row's background.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Other than getting an email it's not possible to tell at a colourblind glance what issue needs followup without using the web inspector or a colour loupe.\r\n\r\nRegression: No, and a lot of software is guilty of this too. Don't feel bad."
