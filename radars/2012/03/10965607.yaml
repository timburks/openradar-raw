    description: "01-Mar-2012 05:02 PM Josh Johnson:\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nWhen attempting to unit test a static library in Xcode 4.3 using the build in unit testing capabilities, Xcode freezes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x0). Xcode is left in the state seen in the attached image: [ http://cl.ly/Efpo ]. Upon further investigation, this only occurs when using LLDB as a debugger. This does not occur when using GDB\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create new project in Xcode 4.3, choose the Cocoa Touch Static Library\r\n2) When prompted, check yes to \"Include Unit Tests\".\r\n3) Run the default sample test in Xcode (CMD+U) \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nShould run the sample test, and notify the developer that Test Failed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLeaves the developer in a stopped state with EXC_BAD_ACCESS - http://cl.ly/Efpo or the attached image\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAgain, switching to GDB does not cause this problem.\r\n\r\n01-Mar-2012 05:02 PM Josh Johnson:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-03-01 at 4.48.59 PM.png' was successfully uploaded"
