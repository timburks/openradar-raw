    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSince we switch to Xcode installation using an app bundle, that was a good improvement. \r\n\r\nBut, it's expected that the update process should only update what's needed. iOS Simulator 5.0, command line tools, and device debugging support should remain in where they're belong (wherever that is).\r\n\r\nThis would minimize the amount of data that need to be downloaded, and it will speed up the updating process.\r\n\r\nA nice optional feature would be to provide a UI to install these tools outside the app bundle. So we could keep on maintaining it, regardless of the app bundle changes or Xcode updates."
