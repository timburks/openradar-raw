    description: "27-Feb-2012 02:59 PM Bernd LÃ¶rwald:\r\nSummary: Applications should be using the full space they can get, if the user wants them to do so, not waste place by arbitrary limitations. Full screen mode should be full screen.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start Messages.\r\n2. Begin conversation.\r\n3. Enter full screen mode with that window.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Full screen space used for more messages!\r\n\r\nActual Results: Borders appear on left and right sides, taking away place that could be used for actual text.\r\n\r\nRegression: Remove the limitation and use the full space, just as when maximizing the window.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n02-Mar-2012 11:52 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
