    description: "The behaviors system in Xcode 4 is very promising, but it is missing a crucial type of \"trigger\": switching the editor from one file type to another. Custom behaviors should be able to be added, and those behaviors should be able to be triggered by file type transitions, based on the destination file type. Examples:\r\n\r\nWhen file type is \"Interface Builder Document\"\r\nShow utilities\r\nHide debugger\r\n\r\nWhen file type is \"Disassembly\"\r\nShow debugger\r\n\r\nWhen file type is \"Source code\"\r\nHide utilities\r\nHide debugger if there is no recent output\r\n\r\nEt cetera."
