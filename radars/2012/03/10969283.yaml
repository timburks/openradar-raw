    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf Xcode is quit with a project window open, and the project has multiple tabs, when Xcode is launched again, the window size is too short by the height of the tab bar.  If there aren't any tabs open when Xcode is quit, the window size is correct.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Have multiple tabs in a project.\r\n2. Quit Xcode (leaving project open).\r\n3. Re-launch Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWindow size is the same as it was when quit.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWindow size is too short by the height of the tab bar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nIssue introduced in Xcode 4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDoesn't occur if the project is closed before quit."
