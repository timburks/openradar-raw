    description: "Summary: When exporting versions as PNG files, Aperture 3 exhibits extremely poor performance, rarely exceeding 100% utilization of one core. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Select a large batch of photos (minimum of 100). Select \"Export Versions\" (Cmd+Shift+E). Choose \"PNG - Original Size\" preset. Export. Observe poor CPU usage.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Performance similar to JPEG exporting, where CPU usage regularly goes above 400%.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Sluggish exporting of photos, low CPU utilization.\r\n\r\nRegression: Appears to focused on PNG exporting, other presets appear unaffected."
