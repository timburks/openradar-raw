    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you have time machine backups going to a network volume (like a Time Capsule or third party TM-compatible device (Netgear ReadyNAS) ), if you have the volume manually mounted, and are using it - e.g opening files, clearing out old backups and emptying the network volume trash, when a scheduled Time Machine backup kicks in and completes, it will forcefully eject the volume even if you had files open/were emptying the trash.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nHave dedicated TM backup volume on network disk. Set up TM to backup there.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNormally this volume is mounted/unmounted as necessary. However if you are actively using the volume, it should not be forcefully ejected\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVolume is forcefully ejected, open files/active processes be damned!"
