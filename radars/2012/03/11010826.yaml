    description: "Summary:\r\nI am unable to use the iOS Simulator to properly test the existence of an Apple TV. The MPVolumeView changes to include a Routes button in addition to the volume slider when an Apple TV is nearby. It would be very helpful if the Simulator had the ability to toggle ON/OFF the presence of an Apple TV.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThanks"
