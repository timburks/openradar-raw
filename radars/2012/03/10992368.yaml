    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using storyboards, segues are set up by setting an identifier in the UI editor then string matching this identifier in the view controller's prepareForSegue: method. This is na√Øve design at best and positively encourages buggy, sloppy programming at worst.\r\n\r\nA much better solution would be to allow segues to connect to an optional prepare: selector, specified as an IBAction in the view controller. Then the correct piece of code could be attached to the segue in the UI editor, avoiding all that dangerous mucking about with identifier string matching.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse storyboards. Create a segue that requires custom setup. Experience pain.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDevelopment tools that make life easier.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBugs, messy code, sadness.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
