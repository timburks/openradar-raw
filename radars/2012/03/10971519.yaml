    description: "02-Mar-2012 09:19 AM Stuart Carnie:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAllow \"Australian\" Siri to work in US with US location services.  Being an Australian expat, Australian mode appears to recognize my voice significantly better, however despite living in the US, Siri in this mode is unable to interact with any location-based services.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n• Enable Australian Siri whilst in USA.  \r\n• Ask to find nearest Subway\r\n• Unable to use location services\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n• Should be able to use location services"
