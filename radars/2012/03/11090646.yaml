    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI suggest that a pronunciation facility similar to that of the Mac be added to VoiceOver on iOS. It seems to be much more doable than what Apple have fabulously done with the labeling of icons in iOS 5. Also, given the accessibility of iBooks and the presence of apps such as Read2Go, a pronunciation facility is even more beneficial and urgently needed for VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse voiceover on an iOS device.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAbility to correct mispronunciations by VoiceOver\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo ability to correct mispronunciations by VoiceOver\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.applevis.com/blog/voiceover-features-ios-6-pronunciation-editor"
