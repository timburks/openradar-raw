    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIn order to manage translations of Interface Builder nib files, we keep one version in the original language (usually english) and generate the other languages through strings files via the command line tool \"ibtool\".\r\nTo keep the nibs in sync, the build script is executed on every run.\r\n\r\nIf the nib contains a UILabel, ibtool omits the \"autoshrink\" flag, which was introduced in XCode 4.3. As a result, nibs in derived languages have a wrong layout and are truncated (instead of shrunk).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In XCode 4.3, create a project from the iOS \"a single window\" template.\r\n\r\n2. Go into the project's default language folder (usually \"en.jproj\") and open the default ViewController.nib\r\n\r\n3. Add a UILabel into the mentioned nib file and enable the autoshrink flag in the \"Label\" section within the \"Attributes Inspector\".\r\n\r\n4. Save.\r\n\r\n5. Extract the strings with the ibtool:\r\nibtool --generate-strings-file vc.strings ViewController.xib\r\n\r\n6. Regenerate a new nib file from the strings file and the original nib:\r\nibtool --strings-file vc.strings --write newNib.xib ViewController.xib\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNew generated file should have a label, where autoshrink is enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nGenerated nib contains the label, but the autoshrink flag is disabled. Therefore the presentation is wrong (truncated on longer text, instead of shrunk).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
