    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nOverview of email tracking (web beacons)\r\n\r\nMany sources of email, including spammers and Facebook, embed remote content (web beacons) in their emails to track when users open the messages. The sender knows when the recipient has opened the message because email clients load the remote content hosted by the sender's server, such as an image, CSS, or audio file. Apple has always been an industry leader in privacy. As tracking becomes more prevalent, this issue becomes more important to protecting the privacy of Apple's users.\r\n\r\nEmail tracking and iOS Mail\r\n\r\nMail on iOS (all versions) automatically loads remote content, without any option to disable this as there is on Apple Mail for Macs. Thus, iOS Mail undermines user privacy by leaking data like Titanic after the iceberg--something that is undesirable for consumers and unacceptable for corporate users. We can watch this happen in realtime by sending specially crafted test emails to our iOS devices.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n\r\n1. Set up any email account on any iOS device running any version of iOS.\r\n\r\n2. Send a specially crafted test email to that email account. I used the Email Privacy Tester to automate this: <https://grepular.com/email_privacy_tester/>. (It redirects to a results page once the test email has been sent.)\r\n\r\n3. Open the test email on the device while it is connected to the Internet.\r\n\r\n4. Wait a few moments for the remote content to load. Watch the results page on Email Privacy Tester.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe device does not automatically load remote content, or provides an option to disable remote content.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\n\r\nThe device loads about 18 types of remote content of the 32 types tested by the Email Privacy Tester, indicating to the sender that the user has opened the email. \r\n\r\nBecause the results of email tests are deleted after 24 hours, I cannot provide links to the results of specific tests I ran. If this is an issue, let me know. \r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\n\r\nNone--the issue is present in every iOS device I've tested, spanning all major iOS releases (1.x to 5.x) and all iOS devices (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad). \r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to download all new email and turn on Airplane Mode while reading and/or responding to the email. However, this is very cumbersome and not practical for day-to-day use."
