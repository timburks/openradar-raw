    description: "09-Mar-2012 05:28 PM Daniel Weeks:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere exists for astronomical calculations a date format called the Julian Day Number (JDN, the integer count of the number of days since January 1, 4713 BCE). For example today's (2012-03-09) JDN is 2455996. The JDN is calculated from noon GMT.\r\n\r\nThe NSDateFormatter on iOS SDK and Mac OS X SDK provides a format of \"g\" to convert an NSDate to a Julian Day Number.\r\n\r\nWhen using the NSDateFormatter to convert an NSDate to a JDN or a JDN to an NSDate the incorrect hour in GMT is used. The hour that should be used is 12:00:00 (in a 24-hour clock) and the hour of 08:00:00 is used instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCompile the JulianDayNumber.m file with the command:\r\n\r\nclang JulianDayNumber.m -o JulianDayNumber -std=c99 -framework Foundation -fobjc-arc\r\n\r\nRun JulianDayNumber in a terminal. Witness the NSLog output.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWhen converting from a string of numbers representing a JDN the resulting NSDate would be set to the day with 12:00:00 (noon) in GMT. A time of 08:00:00 would be the previous JDN.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe NSDate returned is at 08:00:00 GMT when it should be at noon GMT. Any time of noon or after, until the next noon, should return a JDN of X. Any time prior to noon should return a JDN of X-1, but that only happens with times prior to 08:00:00 GMT.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n09-Mar-2012 05:28 PM Daniel Weeks:\r\n'JulianDayNumber.m' was successfully uploaded"
