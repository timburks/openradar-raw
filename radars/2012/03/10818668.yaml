    description: "Summary: When running Windows on a Boot Camp partition, Apple's drivers do not enable AHCI mode on the SATA interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Launch Windows Device Manager. Select \"IDE/ATA/ATAPI-controllers\" section. Observe default storage driver operating in IDE mode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Boot Camp drivers enable AHCI mode, increasing performance and enabling other features of drives.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Boot Camp drivers keep drive in IDE mode, severely limiting performance and features of internal drives.\r\n\r\nRegression: Occurs on all Mac's, regardless of model or type of internal drive.\r\n\r\nNotes: There is a massive thread online about enabling AHCI on early-2011 and late-2011 MacBook Pro's.
