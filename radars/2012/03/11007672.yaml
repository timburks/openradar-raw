    description: "07-Mar-2012 09:16 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nSince I changed my Apple ID name a few months ago to accommodate the need for an \"email address\" Apple ID, I have had a struggle with the App Store app. It won't let me update any of my existing apps to newer versions, because it complains that they were purchased with another Apple ID.\r\n\r\nI assumed that it was because the apps had embedded in them the old Apple ID, but it is more sinister than that. Even apps that I have purchased/installed for the first time since I changed my Apple ID face the same problem. It's as though my App Store app and configuration are somehow doomed to always fail to update existing apps.\r\n\r\nTo work around the problem, I have to go delete the app entirely from my Mac, then \"Install\" the app again from the App Store instead of updating.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a movie that shows the clearly flawed experience of me logging in to my account, having the purchased items show up, but then refusing to update any of them.\r\n\r\nSide note: nothing shows up in my \"Updates\" tab, even though the apps do show in Purchased as having updates.\r\n\r\nHow do I get my Apple ID and/or Mac configuration back to normal? I tried zapping App Store prefs and no luck. Is there any chance the Apple ID is somehow screwed up on the server in such a way that I'm doomed to this problem? I'd like to help fix my own situation but also to help Apple figure out if there's a wider spread issue at play here.\r\n\r\n07-Mar-2012 09:16 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\n'Screen Recording 35.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n07-Mar-2012 10:54 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nI noticed every time I attempt to update an app, when that confusing panel from the video appears, this appears in the console:\r\n\r\n3/7/12 10:53:46.919 PM App Store: FRPurchaseManager: No purchases to purchase\r\n\r\n07-Mar-2012 11:14 PM Daniel Jalkut:\r\nI discovered this is being caused by Spotlight indexing being disabled on the affected volume.\r\n\r\nhttps://discussions.apple.com//terms-and-conditions!input.jspa?url=https%253A%252F%252Fdiscussions.apple.com%252Fthread%252F2725899%253FthreadID%253D2725899%2526tstart%253D60%2526messageID%253D12970085\r\n\r\nSo I changed the title of this bug to \"App Store can't update apps when Spotlight is disabled\". This is really not something that App Store should rely upon to be able to perform an update. Especially when it's detected that an update is available, and presumably it knows there is an updatable app on the system."
