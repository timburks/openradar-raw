    description: "09-Mar-2012 06:43 PM Dylan Lukes:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nEven simple binaries compiled with (as far as I've seen) any of Clang 3.0 (from LLVM), Clang 4.0 (from Apple XCode 4.4) and LLVM-gcc (from Apple XCode 4.4), all crash with a segmentation fault or bad instruction on 10.7, 10.6, etc..\r\n\r\nI've attached a simple hello-world-type program as well as three binaries compiled with the three aforementioned compilers (w/ -g -O0) as well as the dSYM's for each respectively, and the assembly code my clang 3.0 outputs for the file. Hopefully that's helpful.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nCompile a binary on 10.8. Try to run the same binary on 10.7 or prior.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIt runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIt crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe mentioned tests are mirrored at: http://cl.ly/Euv8"
