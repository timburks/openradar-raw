    description: "The \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" preference pane should be renamed. It currently serves as the place where we manage various accounts, from email to CalDAV to Twitter and Flickr. Putting all these under the \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" umbrella doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, novice users may get confused and expect that this is where they manage their Contacts and Calendars app, which is not the case.\r\n\r\nAnd, \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" is a really long and inelegant string. This should be renamed to \"Accounts\"."
