    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWith 2 Dell 2407 monitors connected to a 2011 iMac 27\" via Thunderbolt to DVI adapters ( genuine Apple parts ), OS X Lion has SEVERAL usability issues. These are detailed below in the 'actual results' section.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect two DVI monitors via DVI to Thunderbolt Adapters to a 2011 iMac\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Turning them on / off shouldn't affect the main iMac dislplay or any of the other connected and turned on displays.\r\n\r\n2. Windows should stay put on displays regardless of sleep / awake or power on/off.\r\n\r\n3. Arrangements should stay fixed unless changed by user.\r\n\r\n4. If you have external monitors connected but powered off, and you previously had windows laid out on them, then using mission control you should be able to 'see' these other parts of your desktop and drag / move those windows to the main iMac screen that is powered on and visiable, without having to resort to plugging them in and powering them on!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n\r\n1. When you have the 2 external monitors connected but not powered on and then either one or both on, the main display blanks to a solid blue color for a few seconds before coming back to the desktop - this happens FOR EACH external monitor turned on.\r\n\r\n2. When you put the main display to sleep with key combo CTRL SHIFT EJECT, and then wake it up - windows and applications that were open and laid out on the other monitors are now 'mostly' collected onto the main display..\r\n\r\n3. Randomly after not turning an external monitor on for a few days, when you do turn it on it's arrangement in relation to the other screens has changed. VERY annoying.\r\n\r\n4. If you (as I do) have 3 monitors, the main iMac in the center and the two externals one on each side of the iMac, and you have them turned off, but previously you had windows open and laid out on them, unlike in Leopard and Snow Leopard, when you switch to Mission Control you can no longer see those 'desktops' and pull windows back onto the main display - it seems mission control is making each MONITOR have it's own settings and you can't 'get' to them from the main iMac display. This is SEVERELY critical and annoying bug...\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
