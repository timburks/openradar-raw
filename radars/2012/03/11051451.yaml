    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nDownloading sandbox data from a device to your Mac should show progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect an iOS device with a development app on it;\r\n2. Go to the Xcode Organizer (Window → Organizer);\r\n3. Click on the \"Devices\" toobar item;\r\n4. Select the application in the top pane of the window;\r\n5. Click the \"Download\" button at the bottom of the window;\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSome indication is given of progress once the files begin downloading to your Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe file appears where you asked to save it, but in Xcode it looks like the file is completely downloaded. If it's a big app package, it could only be a small amount of the way through the download.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNot really — I seem to recall this Download function caused Xcode to completely hang until the process was complete in previous versions, so it's an improvement, but still…\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
