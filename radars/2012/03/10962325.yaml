    description: "Our open source framework iMediaBrowser needs to be able to locate media files (of various types, images, audio, video, links, etc) on the user's files system. There are two different ways that are supported by our framework. One is to scan certain folders for media files of a given type. While novice users may keep all their images in the pictures folder, this is certainly not the case for pro users, like professional photographers who have so many images files that they are scattered across multiple disks. \r\n\r\nFor this reason the entitlements to the Pictures, Music, and Movies folder do not suffice. In the short term we can use temporary entitlements with broad file system reading, but it would be nice to have an entitlement in the future, that would grant us read access to any file of a given UTI, e.g. \"public.image\". That way we could discover all image files below a given folder."
