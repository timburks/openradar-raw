    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nChecking \"Bounce Horizontally\" and \"Bounce Vertically\" on a scroll view in Interface Builder has no effect when the application is actually run. While the values for alwaysBounceHorizontally and alwaysBounceVertically are set to YES at runtime, the bouncing behavior doesn't actually occur. It can be made to occur by setting these values to YES in code. \r\n\r\nA sample project is attached that demonstrates this. It prints the value of the two properties to the console. As provided, the manual setting of the properties is commented out. Run in this state, the blue view that is the content of the scroll view will not bounce. Uncomment out the lines and re-run and the blue view will bounce revealing the red background scroll view. During both runs, all print outs of the values of the properties will report YES.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create new Project (I chose Single View for iPad, ARC enabled)\r\n\r\n2. Add scroll view\r\n\r\n3. In the attributes inspector check Bounce Horizontally and Bounce Vertically\r\n\r\n4. Add a content view\r\n\r\n5. Run app and try to move the content view around\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNormal scroll view bouncing behavior\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo scroll view bouncing behavior\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
