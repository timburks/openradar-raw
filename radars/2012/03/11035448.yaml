    description: "12-Mar-2012 10:07 PM Jared Sinclair:\r\nSummary: \r\n--------\r\nApp binaries for Universal Apps submitted to the App Store with Xcode 4.3.1 will be rejected if \"Compress PNG Files\" is set to \"YES\", with the following rejection: \"Corrupt PNG File - The PNG icon file Icon-72@2x.png appears to be corrupt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n-----------------\r\n1. Create a Universal Binary App, with all the required app icon sizes and filenames, named according to the specified naming conventions: (Icon.png, Icon@2x.png, Icon-72.png, Icon-72@2x.png, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. Add all required icon filenames to the <app>-Info.plist CFBundleIconFiles array, named correctly.\r\n\r\n3. Set \"Compress PNG Files\" to \"YES\" in the Build Settings for the Target.\r\n\r\n4. Submit the app via Xcode 4.3.1 to iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\n5. App will be rejected because of: \"Corrupt PNG File - The PNG icon file Icon-72@2x.png appears to be corrupt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n---------------\r\nThe app should be accepted. The file is clearly not corrupted. Fresh copies of icon files can be created and added to the project, included in a new binary, and will still be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n-------------\r\nThe app is rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n----------\r\nTurning off \"Compress PNG Files\" in the Build Settings prior to binary submission will result in an accepted binary, however without compression, the submitted binary is significantly larger. This leads to poor customer experiences with larger downloads.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n------\r\nThe file rejected for corruption has been attached. It is not corrupted and will open in any image viewer/editor without issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12-Mar-2012 10:07 PM Jared Sinclair:\r\n'Icon-72@2x.png' was successfully uploaded"
