    description: "Summary: The new UISplitViewController in iOS 5.1 seems to conflict with swipe to delete gestures. Specifically if the iPad is held in landscape view, swiping from left-to-right does nothing. Swiping right-to-left does work, and the problem is not present in portrait view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a new Xcode project\r\n2. Use the \"Master-Detail Application\" template\r\n3. Save the project and run it\r\n4. Switch to landscape view\r\n5. Tap the + button to add some rows\r\n6. Swipe from left to right on one of the rows\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The red Delete button should appear.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Nothing happens.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem was not present in iOS versions prior to 5.1.\r\n\r\nNotes: It's worth noting that Mail does not seem to have this problem, but as you can see it's present in even the simplest of third-party apps."
