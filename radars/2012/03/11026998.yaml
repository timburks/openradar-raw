    description: "Summary: The name of the current carrier should be hidden from the status bar if the device is on its (or the SIM's) home network.\r\n\r\nHonestly, the name of the carrier is useful only when roaming, and I'd guess that the majority of iPhone users never leave their home network. So why constantly remind them that the device is currently on AT&T's, Sprint's or Verizon's network if it's quite unlikely that it will ever change? It's almost the same as putting the carrier's logo on the device itself … ok, maybe not *that* bad.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the carrier name would reduce visual clutter by removing unnecessary information and basically cleaning up the status bar, which should be clear and comprehensible, and should only contain needed information. Also bear in mind that in other countries carrier names can be quite long, always filling the entire left half of the status bar for no good reason.\r\n\r\nRegression: The name of the current carrier is vital information when outside home network as different policies and prices apply for each network. Exactly the opposite is the case on the home network. If ever needed, the name of the current carrier (regardless if on home network or roaming) can be discovered in Settings app.\r\n\r\nNotes: I've tried manually removing the carrier name for my personal device, and it looks fantastic. I know the carrier I'm currently on, and don't need to be constantly reminded about it. Also this report does not concern the signal strength bars in any way — those should stay as they are.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if this is ever done, the Bluetooth icon could be moved to the left side of status bar, together with signal bars and WiFi status. This would make the left side represent the status of signals (cell, wifi, bluetooth), while leaving the right side to device features (battery, rotation lock, GPS)"
