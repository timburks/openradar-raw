    description: "08-Mar-2012 02:49 PM me:\r\nSUMMARY:\r\nIn iOS 5.1 (build 9B179) on an iPhone 4S, the 4G indicator is displayed in the status bar when the device is in an area with 3G (HSPA+) coverage. The iPhone 4S is not a 4G LTE device and cannot even connect to a 4G network. This indicator is very misleading to users, because 3G networks do not qualify as 4G networks.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE:\r\n1. Update an iPhone 4S on AT&T in the United States to iOS 5.1. \r\n2. With cellular data turned on, move to an area with AT&T 3G (HSPA+) coverage. \r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\nThe status bar displays \"3G\" next to the carrier name because it is using a 3G network.\r\n\r\nACTUAL RESULTS:\r\nThe status bar displays \"4G,\" even though this isn't a real 4G LTE network. \r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nOnly tested on iPhone 4S. I don't own any other iOS devices.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nnone\r\n\r\n\r\n09-Mar-2012 01:55 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has requested the following information in order to further investigate this issue: \r\n\r\n--- Console Log Instructions ---\r\n\r\nCould you please attach your console log to the bug report?\r\n\r\nConsole logs can be saved from the Organizer in Xcode, or from the iPhone/iPad Configuration Utility.\r\n\r\niPhone/iPad Configuration Utility Console Instructions:\r\n\r\n1.

Choose Tools > Folder Options in the file browser window, then click the View tab and change the \"Hidden files and folders\" option to \"Show hidden files and folders\".\r\n\r\nPlease compress all of the files in the Baseband folder on your desktop into an archive and attach that file to the bug report.\r\n\r\n--- Disabling Baseband Logging ---\r\n\r\nTo disable logging, replace the leading asterisk (*) with a pound character (#), like the example below, for each item you enabled:\r\n\r\n- If you have an iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 (GSM/AT&T), to disable the logging, follow steps 1 and 2 below:\r\n\r\n1) #5005*274# (#KOOL*CSI#)\r\n2) #5005*62#  (#KOOL*MA#)\r\n\r\n- If you have an iPhone 4 (Verizon) or an iPhone 4S (Verizon, AT&T or Sprint), to disable logging, follow steps 1 and 2 below:\r\n\r\n1) #5005*274#  (#KOOL*CSI#)\r\n2) #5005*3424# (#KOOL*DIAG)\r\n\r\n\r\n13-Apr-2012 05:12 PM me:\r\n'console.log' was successfully uploaded"
