    description: "10-Aug-2011 01:29 PM Rob Napier:\r\n'Archive.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Aug-2011 01:29 PM Rob Napier:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThe documentation for CCCryptorUpdate says \"Encryption and decryption can be performed \"in-place\", with the same buffer used for input and output.\" This does not work if CCCryptorUpdate is called multiple times and kCCOptionPKCS7Padding is enabled. In this case, the first block is successful, but all additional blocks are garbled.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSee attached test file.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTest file should succeed with USE_SAME_BUFFER and USE_PADDING enabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nTest file fails because encryption is corrupted in this case after the first block\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nplaintext.txt should be a multiple of 16-bytes and larger than kMaxReadSize. (multiple of 16-bytes to demonstrate non-padding).\r\n\r\nThis does not fail if kMaxReadSize is larger than plaintext.txt (so that CCCryptorUpdate is only called one time).\r\nThis fails with or without IV."
