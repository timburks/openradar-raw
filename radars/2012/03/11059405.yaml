    description: "16-Mar-2012 10:31 AM Tony Arnold:\r\n========================\r\nDuplicate of : rdar://7794463\r\n========================\r\n \r\nInstead of tracking devices used for Development and Ad Hoc deployment in the iPhone Developer portal, allow 100 Apple IDs. Those IDs are then associated with applications that user can install. Then allow the apps associated with those ids to be installed on *any* of that user's devices. \r\n\r\nThis eliminates several issues around UDIDs particularly when all my testers switch to the latest device or have a device replaced via Apple Care. Not to mention that I have 3 test devices of my own (and I know many developers who have more). With the impending release of the iPad this will only become worse.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure for identifying devices by Apple ID is in place for the main App Store and is built into iTunes. Extending the functionality for beta builds would reduce a lot of the anxiety around running out of UDIDs before your renewal window to delete UDIDs and reclaim spots. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nFor additional commentary, see Craig Hockenberry's blog post here: http://furbo.org/2010/03/22/udid-not/"
