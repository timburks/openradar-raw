    description: "03-Jun-2011 05:04 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nIf I recall correctly, this bug has been present since Xcode first got \"edit all in scope\", and is still present in current builds. I've seen several occurrences where undo/redo will get the document into a never-before-seen state. Here's one:\r\n\r\nIn an objc file, have the following lines:\r\n\r\nNSString *str = @\"hi there\";\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", str);\r\n\r\nNow put the insertion point in \"str\" in the first line, and edit all in scope. Arrow right so the point is at \"*str| =\", and do a forward-delete. This will delete both the space and the closing paren on the next line. Now undo; only the first line is reverted. (I made a video of this, but RadarWeb's file uploading is currently broken.)\r\n\r\nHopefully this is related to the other undo bugs. I \"feel\" I've seen more with edit-all-in-scope without using forward delete; if so, I'll append them here (until this is closed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Jun-2011 05:38 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\n'Xcode undo corruption.mov' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Jul-2012 11:30 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in Xcode 4.5 Developer Preview 3.  Please verify with this release, and update your bug report with the results.  \r\n\r\nXcode 4.5  Build 4G125j\r\nPosted Date:  July 16, 2012\r\n\r\nFor Mac Developers:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\r\nAfter login, click on the \"OS X Mountain Lion\" tab.\r\n\r\nFor iOS Developers:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action\r\nAfter login, click on the \"iOS 6 SDK beta\" tab."
