    description: "05-Mar-2012 07:02 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: The Caps Lock key does not immediately activate when pressed and released quickly. You must press and hold down the key slightly longer to activate the Caps-Lock function.\r\n\r\nAccording to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1192, this behavior is by design, but by reducing likelihood of accidental activation, intentional activation is less likely to work as expected when skilled typists are typing quickly. It would be nice if there was a way to disable this feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Press and release Caps Lock key very quickly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The Caps Lock key should light up, and subsequent keys will be in ALL UPPERCASE until the Caps Lock key is pressed again.\r\n\r\nActual Results: When typing quickly, the Caps Lock key is ignored, requiring user to stop and correct \"mistakes\" that were actually caused by the system ignoring a sensed keypress.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n05-Mar-2012 08:02 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nAnother related Apple Support article, describing presence of this feature in certain keyboards: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1578"
