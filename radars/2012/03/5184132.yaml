    description: "Summary\r\nThe system unexpectedly changes settings in \"System Preferences/International/Input Menu/Input source options\" after restart or log out/log in. Or doesn't care this setting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nThis issue is not reproducible (or I don't know how), but very often.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\nThe system would not change this setting and the applications would remember the keyboard layout I've selected for each one.\r\n\r\nActual results\r\nWhen I selected \"Allow a different input...\", after log out/ log in, there is \"Use one input...\" back again. Also applications very often don't care this setting and don't \"remember\" the keyboard layout, I've selected for each one. It is quite a big problem when I tried to log in from locked screen saver (or after waking up the computer) because my password includes non alphanumerical signs that has different positions on each keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nNote\r\nIt could also help when user would be able select one keyboard layout as default, so especially windows with logging informations would always use this default layout."
