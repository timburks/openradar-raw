    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using the \"Comment Selection\" editor command on selected lines of a Ruby file, the lines are commented as if they were a C file (ie. using '//' instead of '#')\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Open a Ruby file (test.rb will do)\r\n- Type some code\r\n- Select 1 or more lines\r\n- Activate the Comment Selection command (both the keyboard shortcut and the menu item produce the same result)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSelected lines should be prefixed with the '#' character\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSelected lines are actually prefixed with the '//' character sequence\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this applies to other languages as well, but haven't verified it."
