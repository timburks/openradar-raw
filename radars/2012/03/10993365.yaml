    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are lots of things I can undo/redo on the system. The current selection isn't one of them. How many times have you shift-clicked on a whole bunch of items in the Finder or Address Book and then accidentally clicked somewhere and lost all the selected files? \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. I was trying to restore a bunch of address book contacts that I had lost. I was in Address Book in Time Machine.\r\n2. I held down command and was clicking on the names I wanted to restore. \r\n3. I had gotten to 30 or so names and then accidentally clicked on the table view.\r\n4. Selection changed to the one item I accidentally clicked on without holding down command.\r\n5. Scroll back to the top and try again - always paranoid that you could wipe out the selection again accidentally.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nsame as above until 5\r\n5. Control click on the table view in Finder or Address Book (or any list based objects). Choose 'Restore last Selection' from the menu.\r\n6. Selection restored! No need to worry if I'm going to accidentally wipe my entire selection out.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis has existed as long as Mac OS X has been around.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
