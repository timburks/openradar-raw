    description: "When porting iOS code to Mac OS X, it often becomes necessary to create a bitmap CGContextRef with a flipped y coordinate.  While CGContextConcatCTM() and CGContextScaleCTM() allow drawing operations to be flipped, all shadows will draw unflipped.    This is correct, as the headers state that shadows use the base-space.\r\n\r\nHowever, there isn't a public way to transform the base space, as the CGContextSetBaseCTM() and CGContextGetBaseCTM() functions are private.   Even though these are used externally by open source projects such as WebKit, they can still result in App Store rejection.\r\n\r\nPlease consider making an exception to these API calls - allowing them to be officially used in Mac App Store applications in 10.6 and 10.7.  In addition, please consider moving them to a public header in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
