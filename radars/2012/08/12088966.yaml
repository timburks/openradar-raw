    description: "On iPad 3, apps using a fullsize MKMapView exhibit a much worse scrolling performance than in the stock Maps app. Even Apple apps such as \"Find my Friends\" or \"Find my iPhone\" (that seem to use MapKit) have a much worse scrolling performance than the Maps app.\r\n\r\nSee this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q0DWivlfoE\r\n\r\nThis is really bad; users expect the same performance in 3rd party apps as in Apple apps."
