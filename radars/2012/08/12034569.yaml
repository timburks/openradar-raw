    description: "Summary: After a UIActivityViewController presents a UIActivityTypePostToFacebook and the user presses cancel on the Facebook sharing sheet, an invisible popover remains, and doesn't \"dismiss\" until the user taps anywhere.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Show a UIActivityViewController. Tap \"Facebook\". Now tap \"Cancel\" on the sheet that will appear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The popover that contained the UIActivityViewController is dismissed along with the sharing sheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The popover that contained the UIActivityViewController, while invisible, is not dismissed.\r\n\r\nRegression: Naturally, this only happens on the iPad, as the iPhone doesn't have popovers.\r\n\r\nNotes: The developer can programmatically dismiss the UIPopoverController, but it is kind of hacky, and since only the UIActivityTypePostToFacebook exhibits this behavior, it makes it more complicated.\r\n\r\nAttached is a sample app that demonstrates this issue. Simply tap the action button at the bottom of the screen, and tap the Facebook icon. Then press \"Cancel\", and the UIPopoverController will remain invisible until you either tap on the screen or on the action button it was presented from."
