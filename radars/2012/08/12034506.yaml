    description: "Summary: When subclassing UIActivity, it is necessary to return a UIImage for the activityImage. However, no matter what icon you return, the icon for the activity in the UIActivityViewController remains white.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a custom UIActivity subclass. Return any image for -[UIActivity activityImage]\r\n\r\nExpected Results: When presenting a UIActivityViewController with the custom UIActivity, the custom UIActivity's icon will match the icon you returned.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The icon remains white.\r\n\r\nRegression: Happens on both iPad and iPhone.\r\n\r\nNotes: The sample app included is also included with other bug reports, so to test this bug simply tap the action button at the bottom of the screen and a UIActivityViewController will appear that has a white icon when it should be a custom icon."
