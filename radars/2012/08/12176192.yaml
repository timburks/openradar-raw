    description: "Summary:\r\nI'm trying to play an ADTS AAC file with AVAudioPlayer on iOS6, after setting the currentTime to an initial value.\r\nThis worked perfectly in my app when running on iOS <= 5, but in the latest iOS6 beta, the file would stop playing after a few seconds and the delegate will be informed the file was played successfully.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to play an AAC ADTS audio file with AVAudioPlayer, after setting currentTime to any value (I used 2).\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n    self.player = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfMappedFile:[[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] pathForResource:@\"file.aac\" ofType:nil]] error:&error];\r\n    self.player.delegate = self;\r\n    [self.player prepareToPlay];\r\n    self.player.currentTime = 2;\r\n    [self.player play];\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file would play from the point set until the end of the music without stopping.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe sound stops playing after a few seconds, the player calls the delegate method:\r\n- (void)audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:(AVAudioPlayer *)player successfully:(BOOL)flag\r\nwith a successful flag\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn iOS <= 5 this code works (the file is played until the end)"
