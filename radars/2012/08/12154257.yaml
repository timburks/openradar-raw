    description: "22-Aug-2012 02:44 PM Nate Griswold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the latest Xcode (currently 4.4.1), there is a crash when using arc-enabled code in a nonarc project. Specifically, the arc-enabled code must instantiate an arc object in a +load method. The crash only occurs for 4-series simulators. Note that the project itself does pass -fobjc-arc to ld via the Xcode 'other link flags' option. The crash does not occur when using Xcode 4.3.3 or 5-series simulators.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun attached project in Xcode 4.4.1\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nStartup, white screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrash at startup with dyld: Symbol not found: _objc_release\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis is a regression, as running the project in Xcode 4.3.3 does not elicit a crash\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a problem for iOS 4 only.\r\n\r\n\r\n22-Aug-2012 02:44 PM Nate Griswold:\r\n'ArcCrashTest.zip' was successfully uploaded"
