    description: "Summary:\r\nA slow attempt to turn the screen of a mac off with the ctrl+shift+eject keyboard shortcut may be thwarted by the OS' inclination to wake on activity.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Hold down ctrl and shift\r\n- Press and release eject (the screen should turn off)\r\n- Wait for maybe a second or two\r\n- Release ctrl and shift\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Nothing; the screen should remain off\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The screen turns on again\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOf course, this isn't too common a thing, and it's only caught me out once or twice in the three years since I learnt the shortcut, and even then only when I'm extremely tired or a little inebriated. But these situations are, unfortunately, the times when one is most likely to be confused or irritated by unexpected computer behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis particular problem is so distressing because it is so unnecessary. The OS knows that I pressed these buttons to turn the display off and it knows that they must, after having been pressed, return to a neutral, disengaged position. That it can read such a return — however delayed — as 'activity' is frustrating."
