    description: "03-Aug-2012 03:56 PM Oisin Prendiville:\r\nSummary: When a filterPredicate based on the value of MPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem is added to a MPMediaQuery, the query returns no items.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a basic MPMediaQuery songsQuery. Add a filterPredicate based on the value of MPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem. Check the number of items returned by the query.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The query will return either the number of songs that have been downloaded to the device, or the number of songs stored in iTunes in the cloud depending on the value of MPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem that is specified.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The query always returns no items.\r\n\r\nRegression: Run on a device running iOS 6.0 (10A5355d) whose music library has iTunes Match enabled and has some songs downloaded to the device.\r\n\r\nNotes: Sample project attached.\r\n\r\n03-Aug-2012 03:56 PM Oisin Prendiville:\r\n'MPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n06-Aug-2012 11:15 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
