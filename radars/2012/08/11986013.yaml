    description: "Summary:\r\nWhatever multisampling is used in the process of scaling wallpapers down to fill a screen has been somehow compromised in Mountain Lion. Everything is super jaggedy and/or pixely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet an image as your wallpaper. Ideally one with hard edges, for comparison's sake, but anything will do.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPretty! See http://d.bldm.us/hakase-lion.png\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEugh. See http://d.bldm.us/hakase-ml.png"
