    description: "11-Aug-2012 11:41 AM Ian Andolina:\r\nSummary: When using ⌃← and ⌃→ to switch spaces, the animation follows a classic velocity S-curve easing into and out of the animation. The easing to stop at the end of the animation is really far too long, and I've seen many comments online that people hate the slow switching of spaces using ⌃← and ⌃→ so resort to other methods. If you use ⌃← and ⌃→ in Mission control or ⌃number, the animation is much faster.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Use ⌃← and ⌃→ to switch spaces.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Elegant AND fast space switch.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Easing out to stop taking too long.\r\n\r\nRegression: Not from Lion, but spaces switching was much smoother in Snow Leopard.\r\n\r\nNotes: Along with stuttering in the animation this just feels very clunky.\r\n\r\nduplicate of\t 11035799\tOpen"
