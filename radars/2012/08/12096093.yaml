    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 5.0 running on Lion, when running in full screen mode, it was possible to make the viewport narrower by clicking and dragging from one of the edges of the screen. This is no longer possible in Safari 6.0/Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari and click the full screen button to put it into full screen mode.\r\n2. Move your mouse cursor to the left side of the screen, then click and drag to the right\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe cursor should change to the standard \"resize arrow\" cursor, and dragging should make the viewport narrower, so that it no longer spans the entire screen\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe click is treated as a normal click + drag.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI'm not certain if the change is specific to Safari 6.0 or Mountain Lion, e.g. if Safari 6.0 running on Lion acts the same.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis feature is critical for viewing websites that don't have a fixed width layout. On a 27\" Cinema Display, having the window span the full width of the screen makes it very difficult to read text that's laid out all the way from the left edge to the right edge of the screen."
