    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen editing a xib/storyboard in Xcode, I would like to be able to lay a translucent image over the view that does not intercept clicks so that I can make sure that my subviews line up exactly with the mockups my client has supplied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nEdit a storyboard containing a UIViewController with a mockup of the view in Preview.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBe able to lay translucent \"onion skin\" of image in preview over Xcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nLose mind while switching between both windows and dragging Preview window around next to various subviews to try to eyeball if they line up correctly.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nTo infantile state.  Cry for mommy.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone."
