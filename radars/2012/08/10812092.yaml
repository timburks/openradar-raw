    description: "Summary:\r\nIn OS X's own bootloader (and in pre-driver Windows installs), the trackpad shipped in the 15\" early 2011 MacBook Pro is incapable of causing the on-screen mouse cursor to descend a single pixel. It can move it left, right and up, but not down. This, amongst other things, makes the power buttons at the bottom of the FileVault II login screen utterly useless unless you have a USB mouse handy, as there is seemingly no non-mouse way to select them. Tab does nothing.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Get yourself to a bootloader environment with a mouse cursor — Lion Internet Recovery, boot volume selection, the FileVault II login screen — on a MacBookPro8,2.\r\n2. Perform whatever action you feel would be appropriate to move the mouse cursor down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA descending mouse cursor.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSome kind of weird cursor diode.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMaybe this is a specific batch issue. If you're unable to reproduce this, it may help to note that mine is MacBook Pro C02FF02RDMGG."
