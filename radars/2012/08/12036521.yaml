    description: "06-Aug-2012 02:29 AM Heath Borders:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen running a new version of my iOS App in the iPad 5.1 Simulator while a previous version is running, Xcode does not kill the previous version's process, which causes Xcode not to run the new version of my iOS App. Manually clicking the 'Stop' button does nothing. Quitting Xcode fails because it first attempts to stop the previously running process, which it can't do. My only option is to force-quit Xcode.\r\n\r\nThis also happens if I simply quit the iOS simulator with a process attached to Xcode. Xcode never detaches the process and everything requiring the iOS simulator is blocked.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Build and Run Application\r\n2. Modify Application.\r\n3. Build and Run Application.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Build and Run Application.\r\n2. Quit iPad 5.1 Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nXcode detaches from process.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nXcode keeps process alive, blocking any new runs in the iPad simulator until Xcode is force-quit.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPreviously, Xcode would detach from any running processes when the iPad simulator was quit, reset, or a new version of a build is run.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
