    description: "Summary:\r\nThis is an issue carried over from MobileMe. When reading an email sent to an iCloud account, it does not get marked as read on iOS without opening the mail app on the iOS device.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Setup a Mac and an iOS device to receive push email from your iCloud account\r\n- Send an email to that account\r\n- Notice the badge count on Mail.app on the Mac and MobileMail on the iOS device to signal the new email\r\n- Read the email on your Mac\r\n- The badge will not update on your iOS device and in fact a banner showing this email will appear once you unlock your iOS device\r\n- Open MobileMail on your iOS device and see the new email still marked as unread\r\n- See how MobileMail automatically syncs to the server and marks the mail as read\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMark-as-read status should be pushed across devices\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt is not synced in the background\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is probably implemented this way to conserve battery live, however it makes the iCloud service appear immature when compared to competing services such as Gmail (over Exchange) which in fact do update mark-as-read status in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\n05-Mar-2013 05:06 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has determined that this issue behaves as intended based on the following information:\r\n\r\nSee:   http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4083?login=signin\r\n\r\nIf this is still an issue, or you have questions regarding the resolution of this issue, please update your bug report with that information.\r\n\r\nWe are now closing this bug report.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\r\n\r\n04-Jul-2013 08:19 PM by me:\r\nWhoever decided that this \"behaves as intended\" should look at other email services like Gmail and Exchange. Decisions like this are the reasons iCloud is a second class email service and can't compete with others.\r\n\r\n12-Jul-2013 12:19 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThank you for the feedback.\r\n\r\nEngineering has reviewed it."
