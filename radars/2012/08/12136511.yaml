    description: "Summary:\r\nSafari automatically applies a number to the filename of a downloaded file when there's an existing file with that name in your Downloads folder. The resulting filename is unpredictable when dots are used in the filename.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Download a file with dots in the filename (like \"Mr. Appleseed.pdf\").\r\n2) The file is saved as \"Mr. Appleseed.pdf\" in your Downloads folder.\r\n3) Download a file with the same filename (the same file or another file).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n4) The file is saved as \"Mr. Appleseed-1.pdf\" in your Downloads folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n4) The file is saved as \"Mr-1. Appleseed.pdf\" in your Downloads folder.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe problem occurs when the filename of the downloaded file includes dots (besides the dot before the file extension).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI understand that you can't simply place the number before the last dot (because that would break file extensions like \".tar.gz\"). However, I expect you guys are smart enough to work around this. Other browsers (I testes Google Chrome and Firefox on Mac) do this the right way as well."
