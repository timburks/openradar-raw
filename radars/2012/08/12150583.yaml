    description: "Summary: if I type \"drawing shapes\" (no quote marks) on its own line in most Cocoa apps, it gets a red spellcheck underline.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. open a Cocoa app such as TextEdit, Safari, or OmniGraffle, which checks your spelling as you type using OS X's built-in spelling service.\r\n2. type \"drawing shapes\" without quotation marks on its own line and then go to the next line.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\"drawing shapes\" is spelled correctly and should not get a red underline\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"drawing shapes\" gets a red underline.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis wasn't happening in 10.7.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nif you reverse the words (\"shapes drawing\"), it still gets a red underline. If you capitalize the first letter it gets a red underline, but not if you do random iNtErCAPs or ALL CAPS. If you use different parts of speech (\"drawing shaped\"), you don't get the underline. Here's where it gets weird: \"drawing shaves\" gets the underline; \"drawing shames\" does not; \"drawing shawes\" gets an underline under \"drawing,\" even though \"shawes\" is the misspelled word. This bug still exists in the latest 10.8.1 beta."
