    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe description of WebView's replaceSelectionWithMarkupString: method (see here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/WebKit/Classes/WebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001903-BABGAHDG) is not conclusive on the format of the string argument that the method expects. The linked MSDN documentation further adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe documentation should not link to outdated, confusing, external resources. Instead it should clearly state that the HTML fragment the user wishes to insert must be enclosed between\r\n\r\n    <html><body><!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    <!--EndFragment --></body></html>\r\n\r\nand must be self-contained and context-free (i.e. all opening and closing tags must be well balanced within the fragment).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nReading the MSDN document, one might think that the whole \"Version:0.9...\" blah needs to be included. If one does include it, it gets inserted into the document, BTW.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhy is the wrapping in <html>, <body>, and magic comments needed at all? Why not specify the markup string must be a self-contained, context-free HTML fragment. That's what I would have expected at least.\r\n\r\nRemoving the requirements for the wrapping, while maintaining the ability to remove it, would allow for a backwards compatible update of the method. And would make the semantics a lot clearer, IMHO."
