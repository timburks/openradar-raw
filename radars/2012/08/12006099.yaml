    description: "01-Aug-2012 11:12 AM Ryan Grier:\r\nSummary:\r\nI have noticed that sometimes Xcode will perform poorly when opening a Storyboard or moving a number of elements from a ViewController (inside of a storyboard) from one view to another. This slowdown can also appear when zooming in and out in the storyboard. The beach ball will appear for a few minutes. Sometimes, this will cause XCode to crash, sometimes Xcode will just be unresponsive for a few minutes. \r\n\r\nMy Storyboard is currently referencing 12 ViewControllers, which doesn't seem like a lot to me. The general flow is a UITabBarController which has a few modal views and 5 UINavigationControllers (one for each tab) spawning from the UITabBarController.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should be able to handle working with Storyboards. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSometimes can be very slow. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI am using Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard (because my company won't allow me to upgrade)."
