    description: "In multiple xcode projects xcode 4.5 DP4 lldb often breaks in objc_sendMessage_fixup and then 'hangs'\r\nWith 'hangs' I mean it ignores all REAL breakpoints, doesn't show variables anymore and cannot be used\r\n\r\nwhile this seems to be specific to some projects I couldn't force it and it remains random.\r\nStill, as this is highly confusing and kinda annoying, I consider it a grave bug.\r\n\r\n'solution?' => switch to GBD which always works  for me :)"
