    description: "ummary:\r\nThere is a regression in the functionality of the window collection behavior during spaces switching. Under 10.7, the options   NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces | NSWindowCollectionBehaviorStationary would produce a window that was unaffected by space switching. Under 10.8, the window is animated and appears on both spaces concurrently, which is incorrect.\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a window\r\n- Set collectionBehavior =  NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces | NSWindowCollectionBehaviorStationary;\r\n- Set window level to NSScreenSaverWindowLevel + 1\r\n- Switch spaces\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Window stays stationary while other windows and desktop slide beneath\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Window is animated along with contents of both spaces.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Worked right on 10.7.4\r\n\r\nNotes:"
