    description: "On Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8, Safari integrates with the Dock (a progress bar below the download folder) and with the Finder (progress bars and cancellation buttons overlaid on file icons). There is no public API to do so, which puts third-party developers who develop software that downloads files at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Safari achieves this integration isn't secret (the NSProgress class), but it's undocumented, and no one likes to use undocumented API to achieve feature parity with Apple apps.\r\n\r\nPlease release NSProgress as public API or provide the equivalent functionality as public API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nClosed as dup of rdar://3826523"
