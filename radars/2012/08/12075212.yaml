    description: "Summary: Adding a reminder that contains a sequence of form \".* [:digit:]+\\.[:digit:][:digit:].*\" sets the latest occurence of that sequence as alarm time for the current day. (Not all matching sequences are causing the issue.)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add to any list: \"foo 13.37\". \r\n\r\nExpected Results: An entry with that name is created. \r\nAlternatively expected: Additionally, a reminder is added for that _date_.\r\n\r\nActual Results: An entry is added where an alarm for today, 13:37 is set. The name is getting stripped and is only \"foo\".\r\n\r\nRegression: Remove the feature, fix the feature (to add a date, not a time) and most important: Don't remove the matched string. Also, provide a toggle for turning this off.\r\n\r\nNotes: It is majorly annoying that the matched string is removed when adding lines like \"Call parents (on 13.07. at 13:37)\" which should result in an alarm on 13. July at the given time, rather than for today at the given time. \r\nAlso, \"Call parents (on 13.07.)\" will become \"Call parents (on.)\" which is majorly annoying.\r\n\r\nThis bug does not happen, when manually editing the name in the extended info. It does happen again if editing within the list though.\r\n\r\nThe bug does not happen in the mobile version.\r\n\r\nOther actual valid values like 11:1 do not trigger adding an alarm."
