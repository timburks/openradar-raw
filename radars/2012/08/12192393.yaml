    description: "Summary:\r\nI just accidentally typed\r\n\r\n// numberOfSegments is an NSUInteger property on UISegmentedControl\r\nfor (NSUInteger segmentIndex in self.segmentedControl.numberOfSegments) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nand suddenly realized how awesome it would be if that wasn't an error. Between fast enumeration and enumerateWithBlock: I've literally almost forgotten how to write for loops. So in that light maybe this isn't an awesome idea.\r\n\r\nNo, it's totally awesome. Guaranteed applause at WWDC 2013."
