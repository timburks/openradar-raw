    description: "06-May-2011 10:03 AM David Haberthür:\r\n'Bildschirmaufnahme.m4v' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n06-May-2011 10:03 AM David Haberthür:\r\nSummary:\r\nIf I click on \"Remove Photos\" (\"Verwendete Fotos löschen\" in German), obviously all photos are removed from the current Photobook. Sadly this can happen late at night, if one mis-interptets the \"Verwendet\" in german, which means \"used\" in English.\r\nNot a problem I thought, let's just undo it, but iPhoto doesn't offer an undo-function for this step. So there I lost about 6 hours of work with one wrong click.\r\nHere's a little screencast showing the problem: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPZ2C6GbYhM\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Generate Photobook\r\n- Work on it for several hours, late at night\r\n- Click \"Verwendete Fotos löschen\", since you wanted to see which Photos you didn't use in the Book. Remove \"verwendete\" (or  \"used\") Photos seems the correct thing to do.\r\n- See what you just did. Need to press undo\r\n- THERE IS NO UNDO!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUndo!\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThere is no undo!\r\n\r\n06-May-2011 11:54 AM David Haberthür:\r\n'Bildschirmaufnahme.m4v' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n06-May-2011 11:54 AM David Haberthür:\r\nUpdated with Screencapture, since the youtube-Movie shows only grey at the beginning."
