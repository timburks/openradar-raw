    description: "14-Aug-2012 06:21 PM Sam Deane:\r\nWorkspaces are great, but if I have a project A that defines an xcconfig file that I want to use in project B, I have to either:\r\n\r\n- drag the xcconfig file into project B\r\n- add an xcconfig file to project B, and add an #include in it to the relative location of the file from project A\r\n\r\nBoth of these solutions impose the need to have a fixed relative location between project B and project A, which defeats one of the main advantages of workspaces.\r\n\r\nThis problem could be solved if the workspace implicitly collected together all of the xcconfig files from all projects in the workspace, and placed them in a known intermediate location, which was then implicitly in the search path for #include statements in xcconfig files.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the build products location was implicitly in the #include search path for xcconfig files, it would be possible to include xcconfig files that had been built into that location by other projects."
