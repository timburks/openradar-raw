    description: "After playing for about 5 minutes with my MapKit based app, the system kills it.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached LowMemory logs and the Instruments session. The latter clearly shows that VectorKit is responsible for the huge majority of leaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Google based MapKit in iOS 5.x doesn't have this massive leaks."
