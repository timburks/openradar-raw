    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen trying to subscribe to an iCalendar over HTTP, error -1 occurs.  However, the same .ics can be imported just fine from local disk.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCalendar 6.0 (1639) on Mountain Lion\r\nFile -> New Calendar Subscription...\r\nCalendar URL: http://www.derekandkaren.com/vangarbage.ics?color=blue&schedule=s\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould create a calendar subscription.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError dialog says...\r\n  There was an error subscribing to the calendar.\r\n  There was an unexpected error with the request on subscribed calendars (error -1).\r\n\r\nThe calendar subscription fails; no new calendar appears in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis was working in recent releases of Snow Leopard.  Don't know about Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf you download that URL first, then import the .ics from local disk, it works."
