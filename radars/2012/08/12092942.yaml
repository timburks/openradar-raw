    description: "13-Aug-2012 11:52 PM Steven Fisher:\r\nSummary:\r\nSearch attached to tableview causes crash with storyboard after memory warning.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start a new project, using Master-Detail Application. Use Storyboards, exclude Core Data. ARC can be on or off.\r\n2. Open the storyboard.\r\n3. Drag a search bar & controller into the table view header.\r\n4. Run.\r\n5. Add a new row.\r\n6. Tap the new row.\r\n7. Choose Hardware->Simulate Memory Warning.\r\n8. Tap the pop button in the navigation bar (\"Master\").\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nApp should function.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCrash, log attached.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm attaching the project I built using steps 1-3.\r\nThese steps are specific to the simulator, but the same crash will occur if a memory warning occurs on the device. (There's no way to invoke a low memory warning on the device, so I haven't included details for that.)\r\n\r\n13-Aug-2012 11:52 PM Steven Fisher:\r\n'SearchCrash.zip' and 'SearchCrash_2012-08-13-235127_Steves-Home-iMac.crash' were successfully uploaded"
