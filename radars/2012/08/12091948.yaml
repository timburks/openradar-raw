    description: "Summary:\r\nPrevious versions of Xcode (without advanced search options), a single workspace search would return many occurrences throughout the workspace, including the strings files' content. Current version (4.4.1, AF1003) just skips strings files when the Search Options Style is set to Textual (default). When using Regular Expression the strings files are searched, though.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a project.\r\nAdd standard strings files and add some content.\r\nFind in Workspaceâ€¦\r\nKeep standard settings (Style = Textual)\r\nSearch for a term supposed to be found in the strings files.\r\nNo matches.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nActual matches, similar to Regular Expressions search.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo matches with standard settings, while previous searches worked fine and Regular Expressions look fine.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n4.4.1 (or even 4.4).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis might actually result in software bugs because developers are used to search (with standard options) for strings that are both in source files and strings (translation) files."
