    description: "Summary: If you boot into the Recovery HD and try to restore Macintosh HD (on the computer you're using) from another Mac connected via FireWire Target Disk Mode, the restore will go fine but at the end Disk Utility will show the following bogus error: \"Restore Failure   Could not unmount volume \"/Volumes/Image Volume\" (Resource busy)\" .\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Start up one Mac (which I will refer to as \"Mac A\") into Recovery HD\r\n2. Start up another Mac (which I will refer to as \"Mac B\") in Target Disk Mode (by holding down \"t\" at startup)\r\n3. Select \"English\" for the language on Mac A\r\n4. Launch Disk Utility on Mac A (while still booted off of Recovery HD)\r\n5. Select the internal drive and click \"Repair Disk\"\r\n6. Select the \"Macintosh HD\" volume on the internal drive and click \"Repair Disk\"\r\n7. Plug in a FireWire cable to connect Mac A to Mac B\r\nOnce Mac B shows up in Disk Utility on Mac B...\r\n8. Select the \"Macintosh HD\" volume on Mac B and click the \"Restore\" tab to the right in Disk Utility.\r\n9. Select the \"Macintosh HD\" volume on Mac A and drag it to the \"Destination\" field, also in Disk Utility.\r\n10. Click \"Restore\"\r\n11. Wait for the restore to finish.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Restore would finish and not show error sheet.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Restore finishes but shows erroneous error sheet claiming it has failed.\r\n\r\nRegression: unsure\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if steps 5 and 6 matter, but I'm just listing all the steps that I've been following."
