    description: "Summary: When using a dual monitor setup with two windows on maximum size on each monitor, Mission Control is scaling down the window on the secondary monitor way too much, completely wasting space.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Connect secondary monitor.\r\n2. Open windows on both monitors.\r\n3. Open Mission Control.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: As there is one window per monitor / space, it should be pretty much taking up all space available.\r\n\r\nActual Results: On the secondary monitor, the only window is scaled down to use only about a third of the available space while the same window on the primary monitor is using way more.\r\n\r\nNotes: An example can be found in screenshots attached."
