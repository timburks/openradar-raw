    description: "Summary:\r\nThe vim shipped with 10.7.4 does not have support for ruby or python scripting.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen vim.\r\nType \":ruby puts 'hello!'\" and enter.\r\nType \":python print 'hello!'\" and enter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n'hello!' appears after each command.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nE319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\"/usr/bin/vim --version\" shows \"-ruby\" and \"-python\"\r\n\r\nRuby scripting is required for the CommandT plugin.\r\nPython scripting is required for the clang_complete plugin.\r\n\r\nMac OS X ships with both of these languages installed.\r\n\r\nUsing vim for iOS/Mac OS X development without these plugins is difficult.  Installing a vim with these capabilities is a difficult process.  I offered a workshop and had many different problems for each system - different versions of Xcode, different versions of homebrew, Command-Line tools not installed, permissions issues, Xcode not installed, etc.\r\n\r\nSupporting these languages would enable these plugins to work \"out of the box\".\r\n\r\nAlso note that installing a homebrew version of MacVim with --override-system-vim _must_ use the system python and ruby anyway - otherwise there are problems with loading plugins.\r\n\r\nSee also, rdar://5739596 (Vim does not support alternative script interpreters).\r\nSee also, rdar://12126684 (Built-in vim does not have clipboard support).\r\n\r\nThanks!"
