    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Animation used when moving left a space or right a space in Mission Control is too slow when using the <ctrl><left> or <ctrl><right> keyboard shortcuts. It is also a different animation than is used when switching directly to a specific desktop using the <ctrl><desktop number> shortcut.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSetup your Mac with multiple Desktops (spaces) in mission control. For example, I have four desktops plus the Dashboard. Once you've got it setup, switch left and right between spaces using the <ctrl><left> and <ctrl><right> keyboard shortcuts to move left and right between spaces.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the desktop to move over swiftly and become \"active\" and ready for input almost immediately.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nWhen moving left and right between spaces, a slowdown animation is applied as the desktop reaches the side of the monitor. This introduces a slight delay of almost a second (or thereabouts) where the window is still in animation mode moving very slightly. Nothing in the Desktop will respond to user input for this brief time while the animation completes which is extremely irritating when switching back and forth between two desktops.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis same animation delay is not present when switching directly to another desktop/space using <ctrl><# of desktop>. For example, using <cntrl><1> or <cntrl><2> will transition to that Desktop without the animation or with a significantly faster one.\r\n\r\nI do not recall this animation being so delayed on OS X Lion. This appears to be a new introduction in Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
