    description: "07-Aug-2012 11:48 AM David Haberth√ºr:\r\nSummary:\r\nSometimes, when my MacBook Pro looses connectivity while Aperture is uploading photos to flickr.com I get a modal window informing me about a \"OSSStatus error -1\" which cannot be acknowledged with the \"OK\" button, it just comes back. The only way I found to get rid of this problem is to force quit Aperture, which seems a rather bad way of dealing with it.\r\nA short screencast of the problematic window is shown here: http://youtu.be/hvd3AodiT4c\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nErratic\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nClick \"OK\", the window closes and Aperture resumes what it was doing before. Maybe inform me another time in a minute or so.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe modal window doesn't go away, force quitting Aperture is the only way (I found) to resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
