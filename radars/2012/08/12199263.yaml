    description: "Given how much FS API has been deprecated in 10.8, core foundation really needs a file manager API.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/File_Manager/Reference/reference.html\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of functionality in FS that has no cocoa equivalent, for example performing file moves or copies asynchronously or with progress callbacks.\r\n\r\nEven if all the CF file manager did was wrap the FS API so that it no longer needs to be public, that would be sufficient for the near term.\r\n\r\n(The current recommended posix APIs like copyfile don't seem complete and are annotated as such in their headers)"
