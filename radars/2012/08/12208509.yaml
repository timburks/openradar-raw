    description: "Summary:\r\nAll of sudden, Xcode has stopped rendering more than 3 tabs in a row in the text editor. If you have the file, it actually saves all of the tab presses you made but it won't display them. If you open a file containing lines with more than 3 tabs at the beginning, they will all be rendered as if there were 3 tabs.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nRepro 1:\r\n1) Open a new source file (C is fine)\r\n2) Press the tab key more than 3 times in a row on a single line\r\n3) Notice that the cursor stops moving after the 3rd tab press\r\n\r\nRepro 2:\r\n1) Open a file containing containing lines starting with more than 3 tabs\r\n2) Notice that the line is rendered as if there were only 3 tabs\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll of the tabs in the file would be rendered\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nOnly the first 3 tabs are rendered\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI never saw this in any previous version of Xcode\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* I tried disabling automatically trim trailing whitespace and it didn't make a difference\r\n* Attached are 2 screenshots of a file with a lot of indenting. One screenshot shows how Xcode is rendering the file, the other shows how TextEdit renders the file. I also included the source file that I used when taking those screenshots.\r\n\r\n04-Sep-2012 09:54 AM Dustin Norman:\r\nI've been able to track this down to using the Inconsolata-dz font (http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/). If I modify a theme to use Inconsolata-dz and then restart Xcode, I start seeing this tab issue. If I use Menlo or another font, Xcode renders tab correctly."
