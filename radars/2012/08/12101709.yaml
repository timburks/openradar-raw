    description: "Summary: The XPC framework (OS X Lion) is a good way to isolate app components. Not just for security but also  to prevent a crash in one component from crashing another one. It would also help tremendously with code portability between the Mac and iOS targets.\r\n\r\nNotes: The architecture of XPC would be a great addition to iOS, keeping app data secure, app performance better, and more stable, and increase code portability."
