    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Connect is often slow, sometimes unavailable. Apple should provide an area for service status information listing current, past, and planned future issues/outages regarding the iTunes Connect service. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog in to iTunes Connect. (or attempt to log in)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nTimely service of web pages and data from iTunes Connect.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSluggish service sometimes.  Errors other times. An error received today:\r\n    Gateway Timeout\r\n    The proxy server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.\r\n    Reference #1.9c15eb3f.1340896946.1da69e15\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nJudging from Twitter search, this is a worldwide problem. (\"iTunes Connectが重たい。\", \"Bien, a la hora de subir la App no funciona correctamente iTunes Connect :S\", \"Nog mensen last van iTunes Connect?\", \"Is iTunes Connect having problems at the moment? Requests keep timing out.\", \"If only Apple would upgrade the single Performa that runs the entire iTunes Connect website...\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nRandom outages, unannounced outages, outages perhaps coinciding with keynotes, etc., should all be at least posted somewhere. (ADC pages are fine at the moment). Any planned outages or maintenance, even such that would only slow or reduce capacity, should be announced as well.\r\n\r\nAs a provider of a service, Apple should require its operators to provide customers (developers) with current service status, advanced notice of planned downtimes, planned and actual restoration of service, etc."
