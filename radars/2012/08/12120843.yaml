    description: "17-Aug-2012 07:47 PM Sasmito Adibowo:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nOn Mountain Lion, when a 2011 Macbook Air sleeps for a long time until it hibernates (with the lid closed and the power supply taken off), it won't wake up/resume and needs a full power-cycle restart. This is regardless whether Power Nap is active or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Take a Macbook Air (late 2011), plug it in, and use it for a while.\r\n2. Close the lid so that it'll sleep\r\n3. Disconnect the power brick from the unit.\r\n4. Wait at least two hours so that the unit automatically goes into hibernate mode.\r\n5. Open the lid and press the space bar or any other key in the keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe unit wakes up within less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe unit doesn't wake up. I needed to hold the power button and do a full restart of the unit.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen in OS X Lion 10.7.4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis occurs regardless of Power Nap is enabled or not. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n18-Aug-2012 10:39 AM Sasmito Adibowo:\r\nAlternative (and faster) steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Charge the Macbook Air until the battery is full.\r\n2. In the Terminal, type:\r\n    sudo pmset hibernatemode 25\r\n3. Close the laptop's lid.\r\n4. Wait for about a minute.\r\n5. Disconnect the power brick from the unit.\r\n6. Lift the laptop's lid.\r\n7. Try pressing the keyboard or clicking the trackpad â€“ the laptop won't wake up."
