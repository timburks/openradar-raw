    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nMacbook Retinas that have had Mountain Lion installed via NetInstall will not boot into Recovery Partitions via the boot shortcut, command-r.  Instead, they boot into Internet Recovery.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a Netinstall image on Mac OS X Mountain Lion Server for a Mountain Lion Client.  Enable the option to create a Recovery Partition.\r\n\r\n2. Boot a Retina Macbook Pro off the NetInstall Server and install Mountain Lion.\r\n\r\n3. When finished installing, reboot the Retina Macbook and press command-r to boot into the recovery partition.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nRetina Macbook boots into Recovery Partition.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRetina Macbook boots into Internet Recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis appears to only be a problem with Retina MacBooks.  The issue does not occur on Mac Pros with the same NetInstall image.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* I can reliably boot into the Recovery Partition on the Retina Macbook by booting into the Startup Manager (option key on startup) and selecting the Recovery Partition.\r\n\r\n* When Mac OS X Mountain Lion is installed via Internet Recovery the Retina Macbook's Recovery Partition is fixed.\r\n\r\n* NetInstall appears to not create a copy of \"/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.chunklist\" on Recovery Partitions it creates.  While this does not affect Mac Pros, it does break the ability of Macbook Retinas to boot directly into their Recovery Partition.  If I copy this file to a Retina Macbook's Recovery Partition the problem is solved."
