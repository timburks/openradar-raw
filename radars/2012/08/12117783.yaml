    description: "Summary:\r\nThe documentation on how to create help books needs an overhaul.\r\n\r\nIn some parts it seems to refer to the old scheme (help folder in each .lproj), and in other parts it seems to refer to the new scheme where a bundle structure is mimicked. I'm just never quite sure which scheme each sentence refers to.\r\n\r\nAlso it says in a note that .help bundles are for use by Apple only, but all the SurfWriter examples use the .help extension.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn.a.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA target template for adding help books to projects would be really useful. It could set up at least the title page, the .plist stuff, the folder structure, and add folder references to the project."
