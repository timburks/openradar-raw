    description: "Summary: When adding a reminder containing a time between 01:00 and 07:59, an alarm for 13:00 to 19:59 is added, even on non-US-time-style locales. (like German, not having AM/PM).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add a note containing 01:00.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: An alarm is added for 01:00.\r\n\r\nActual Results: An alarm is added for 13:00. (01:00 PM).\r\n\r\nRegression: Change the behavior depending on the locale.\r\n\r\nNotes: This might be nice on US, where you can omit the PM for times during working hours, but is not expected on 24-hour time systems.\r\n\r\nAn additional radar has been filed for invalid handling of sequences with a dot instead of a colon. That ticket also notes that a valid entry of 01:1 does not trigger the detection while 1:10 does."
