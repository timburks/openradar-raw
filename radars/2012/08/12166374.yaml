    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen putting multiple elements into full screen, subsequent elements do not get rendered properly into full screen. Safari does report that the element is in full screen, and webkitExitFullscreen is required for each element in the stack in order to exit.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to http://brad.is/reportingbugs/multiplefullscreen/\r\n2. Click the header to put the whole document in full screen\r\n3. Click the image to put it in full screen\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe image will expand to fill the screen as if requested that it go directly into fullscreen, and document.webkitFullscreenElement references the image element.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\ndocument.webkitFullscreenElement does reference the image element, but the display does not change. Also, webkitExitFullscreen does work properly for each element in the stack (the image and document here).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
