    description: "I have submitted a DTS request (followup ID 129462329) and Daniel Yu, a DTS Engineer, recommended that I submit a feature request:\r\n\r\nIn order to save a UIWebView to a PDF I have attempted to use UIViewPrintFormatter to create a print view and then tried to feed the data into UIGraphicsBeginPDFContextToData and then saving the contents of the data to a PDF. I've also tried printing a string containing HTML using a similar method into a PDF, however this fails to work as well. In both cases, the PDF is blank. I cannot simply save the UIWebView as a bitmap because I need the full page, I need text and images to remain selectable, and it needs to scale nicely.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(Notes: detailWebView is a UIWebView, I would prefer that the PDF file contains pages with standard 8 1/2 by 11\" dimensions)\r\n\r\nNSMutableData *pdfData = [NSMutableData data];\r\nUIViewPrintFormatter *fmt = [detailWebView viewPrintFormatter];\r\n\r\nNSArray *arrayPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);\r\nNSString *documentsDirectory = [arrayPaths objectAtIndex:0];\r\nNSString *fullPath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"saved.pdf\"]];\r\nNSFileManager *manager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];\r\n\r\nUIGraphicsBeginPDFContextToData( pdfData, CGRectZero, nil );\r\n\r\n   for (NSInteger i=0; i < [fmt pageCount]; i++)\r\n   {\r\n       UIGraphicsBeginPDFPage();\r\n       CGRect bounds = UIGraphicsGetPDFContextBounds();\r\n       [fmt drawInRect:bounds forPageAtIndex:i];\r\n   }\r\n\r\nUIGraphicsEndPDFContext();\r\n[manager createFileAtPath:fullPath contents:pdfData attributes:nil];\r\nNSLog(@\"%@\", fmt); //<UIWebViewPrintFormatter: 0x4b5f0e0>\r\nNSLog(@\"%i\", [fmt pageCount]); //0\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nsaved.pdf is created with the UIWebView as its contents.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nsaved.pdf is blank\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone, this code is applicable for all iOS devices and SDKs with printing capability.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nPlease see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4356436/generating-a-pdf-using-the-new-printing-stuff-in-ios-4-2/4383612#4383612 where someone posted the same problem as I am having, as well as my response to the problem."
