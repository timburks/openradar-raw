    description: "Not being able to see a password in a secure text field makes it basically impossible to reliably enter any decent sized password.\r\n\r\nTyping in u\"-mRtOml'jqA.8Or>%gscp823!7R is not at all practical when you can't check your typing along the way.\r\n\r\nAlternatively accepting pasted text would work too as you could copy your password out of a password manager and into the text field without worrying about errors."
