    description: "Summary: When having an position-fixed background and double-tapping some text to zoom in, then scrolling down, the background moves down as well, but faster than the viewport, therefore showing whitespace after some time, instead of the fixed position background.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Go to / make a site having a background set with background-attachment: fixed;. (like http://lancearmstrong.com, there is a background set like that for <html>).\r\n2. double tap some element to zoom in on it.\r\n3. scroll down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The background keeps being fixed at the position it was earlier, but zoomed in.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The background moves when double tapping and even more when scrolling."
