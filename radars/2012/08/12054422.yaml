    description: "08-Aug-2012 10:00 AM Ian Andolina:\r\nSummary: I get very variable slow performance to my wifi router when I have bluetooth turned on. When I turn bluetooth OFF the download/upload speed of my rMBP improves considerably. I also have a mid-2010 MBP which keeps the same performance\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Enable wifi diagnostics, go to a site like speedtest.net. With bluetooth disabled run up/download test. Turn bluetooth on and retest. I get:\r\n\r\nbluetooth off: ~30Mbps\r\nbluetooth on: ~3Mbps\r\n\r\nThis is easily reproducible. The router is a Virgin Media branded Netgear router, using 2.4GHz 802.11n at 300Mbps OBSS on greenfield ON 20MHz bandwidth. Screenshot shows that although it appears signal:noise delta improves, the network traffic packets/second drops significantly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Bluetooth should not interfere with wifi\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Bluetooth interferes with wifi\r\n\r\nRegression: This seems worse on Mountain Lion than Lion\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n08-Aug-2012 10:00 AM Ian Andolina:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-08-08 at 09.15.05.png' and 'MacBook Pro.spx' were successfully uploaded"
