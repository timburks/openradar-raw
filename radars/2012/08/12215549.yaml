    description: "Summary:\r\nPlaying video in Chrome causes the system to hang.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  1. Install 10.8.1 on a MacBook Pro Retina\r\n  2. Download Chrome Canary from: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs/\r\n  3. Navigate to: http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/badminton/all-eight-women-disqualified-for-throwing-badminton-matches.html\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n  Video on page plays.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n  System hangs.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n  This works fine on 10.7. It hangs on 10.8 and 10.8.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n  Our guess is that some drawing code by Chrome causes the driver to hang. After that any calls that go to the window server just lock up. I've attached stack traces from Chrome and the system log.\r\n  The video card on my system is: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB"
