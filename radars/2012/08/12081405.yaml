    description: "Summary: I'm developer from Belarus. And I love to localize my application to Belarussian language.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: There is no Belarussian localization for iOS, there is no even Belarussian keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Belarussian language in iOS, or separate preferred language selector in system settings. Similar to browser preferred language settings. Where users could arrange languages by priority. \r\n\r\nActual Results: Currently there is no way to switch to Belarussian, and no Belarussian keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nRegression: Even if my application contain localization to Belarussian it cannot be used.\r\n\r\nNotes: Please allow us to use applications in Belarussian, and write without mistakes on our native language."
