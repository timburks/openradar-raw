    description: "Summary: \r\n\r\nawacsd crashes during connections through BTMM resulting in slow transfer and frequent disconnection.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nAny connection to a remote Mac results in the behavior.\r\n- Connect to remote Mac in Finder\r\n- Activate Screen Sharing\r\n- ssh to hostname.id.members.btmm.icloud.com closed\r\n\r\nIt happens when the Macs are either on different networks or on the same network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nFast and reliable connections.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nFrequent disconnections and very slow data transfer rate (see below).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI have started experiencing Back To My Mac problems in the past week or two. I tracked my problem to the process called awacsd crashing all the time on both sides of the connection. The man page for it says:\r\n \r\nawacsd is an executable invoked by launchd to facilitate connections between devices using Back to My Mac.\r\n \r\nI am seeing in the logs that every few seconds awacsd would crash and then get restarted. While it is running, a few kilobytes of data will make through. Then it would crash again: \r\n\r\n:\r\n \r\n8/14/12 11:40:27.769 AM          ReportCrash          DebugSymbols was unable to start a spotlight query: spotlight is not responding or disabled.\r\n8/14/12 11:40:33.518 AM          com.apple.launchd          (com.apple.awacsd[23426]) Job appears to have crashed: Segmentation fault: 11\r\n8/14/12 11:40:35.618 AM          awacsd          Starting awacsd connectivity-47.1 (Nov  8 2011 18:46:33)\r\n8/14/12 11:40:35.948 AM          awacsd          Connecting AWACS client: **********.p01.members.btmm.icloud.com.\r\n8/14/12 11:40:37.000 AM          kernel          utun_ctl_connect: creating interface utun0\r\n8/14/12 11:40:37.000 AM          kernel          utun0: attached with 0 suspended link-layer multicast membership(s)\r\n8/14/12 11:40:37.705 AM          ReportCrash          Saved crash report for awacsd[23426] version ???

I am wondering if Apple changed anything on their servers after the release of Mountain Lion. I am running Mac OS X 10.7.4 on both Macs.
