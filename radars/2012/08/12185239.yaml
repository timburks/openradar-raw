    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Podcast.app application fails to pause or skip tracks when controlled from the running applications shelf or lockscreen if a modal window from inside the application is currently displayed, or the application was backgrounded while a modal window was displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Play a podcast inside the podcast app.\r\n2. Tap the default view artwork to dismiss the artwork and show the reel-to-reel background animation.\r\n3. Tap the share button on the left of the screen.\r\n4. Tap any of the three [\"email\", \"tweet\", \"message\"] options in attempt to share the podcast with your friends.\r\n5. Get interrupted or distracted by something or someone, and:\r\n5a. Dismiss the application or\r\n5b. Lock the phone with the top physical button.\r\n6. Realize you can't hear whoever interrupted you over the playing podcast and attempt to pause the track by:\r\n6a. Double tapping the home button when unlocked and pull up the Application Tray, and swipe right to bring up the player controls on the far left or\r\n6b. Double tapping the home button when locked and pull up the player controls on the lock screen.\r\n7. Press the pause button.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe track should pause.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe animation of pressing the button completes, but the track continues to play while the icon still shows the pause icon indicating the track is still playing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nTested on following iOS devices running build versions with the same results. It appears that both pause/resume and track skipping next/prev are all unusable while the modal window is popped.\r\niPhone4,1 5.1.1 (9B206)\r\n\r\nNotes:"
