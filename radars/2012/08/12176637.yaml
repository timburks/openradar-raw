    description: "26-Aug-2012 08:57 PM Matthias Ringwald:\r\nSummary: ACL packets that are not marked as automatically flushable are not shown in the decoded packet log\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Record packet log e.g. from iOS Bluetooth Stack and open an L2CAP connection\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Opening an L2CAP connection consists of a few L2CAP Signaling packets exchanged in both directions\r\n\r\nActual Results: All L2CAP Signaling packets are visible in the Raw view but not in Decoded view. Manually changing the second byte of the ACL packet from 0x00 to 0x020 makes them show up in the decoded log.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes: The attached file only contains ACL packets (HCI packets have been removed). It's an incoming connection establishment of a Bluetooth mouse on iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n26-Aug-2012 08:57 PM Matthias Ringwald:\r\n'BTServer.pklg' was successfully uploaded"
