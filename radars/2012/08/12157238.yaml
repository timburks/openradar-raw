    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nXcode needs to have a way to group a set of breakpoints together so that they can be enabled and disabled as a group. \r\n\r\nThe idea here is that when you're debugging something that is in a common code path, it'd be nice to only enable the break points when you're going to execute a particular code path that is going to go through the common code path with a particular use that causes a problem. For instance, network serialization code that's used by an app at startup, but has a problem when you do a particular action once the app is up and running. It'd be nice to have all the breakpoints you need to debug the issue set, but disabled, during the startup of the app. Then with a single click, re-enable that particular group of break points and then cause the problematic action to occur."
