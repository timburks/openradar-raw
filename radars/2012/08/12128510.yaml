    description: "The new Xcode does not require manual property synthesization anymore, which is a nice improvement.\r\n\r\nHowever I'd much rather be able to manually control implicit synthesization on a per-class basis.\r\n\r\nMy proposal:\r\n\r\n@interface MYObject : NSObject\r\n\r\n@property (strong) NSString *foo;\r\n@property (strong) NSString *bar;\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\n@implementation MYObject\r\n\r\n// The next line enables implicit property synthesization for MYObject:\r\n@synthesize;\r\n\r\n// Optionally one could provide an ivar pattern:\r\n@synthesize (_@);  // would be equivalent to \"@synthesize foo = _foo; @synthesize bar = _bar;\"\r\n\r\n@end\r\n\r\nXcode would then add the \"@synthesize;\" line to each newly created class implementation by default (or even provide a project-wide setting via checkbox on project creation).\r\nIf one would rather not have any properties implicitly synthesized for a certain class, one would simply have to remove the \"@synthesize;\" from its implementation."
