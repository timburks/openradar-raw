    description: "Summary: According to the the UIActivity documentation, the UIViewController you return for the activityViewController \"is presented inside of a popover.\" However in practice, all custom UIActivity's activityViewControllers are presented modally.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a custom UIActivity, and return a UIViewController for -[UIActivity activityViewController].\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The view controller is presented in a popover.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The view controller is presented modally.\r\n\r\nRegression: Naturally, only is a problem on the iPad.\r\n\r\nNotes: Since some built in UIActivities use popovers (ex: assign UIImage to contact in the Address Book), some are presented modally (ex: the Tweet sheet). This bug may be related to rdar://12034500, where calling -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:] doesn't dismiss the activityViewController on an iPad."
