    description: "Summary:\r\nThe de-focus animation in Mission Control has some (extremely minor) layering issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a number of applications with at least one window each.\r\n2. Invoke Mission Control\r\n3. Two-finger upward swipe to focus on an application that does not currently have the focussed window.\r\n4. Verify that one of the focussed application's windows now overlaps the frontmost window...\r\n        if not, add/remove/resize and refocus windows until one does, then move on to step five\r\n5. Back out of the focussed view with a two finger downward swipe.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere should be a seamless animation, as there was when the focus mode was invoked, of the window(s) back to where they were.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAny windows that were layered above [the windows in the application focussed in Mission Control] before the invocation of Mission Control immediately flash back to being so as soon as the user cancels the focus.\r\n\r\nThe attached screenshot demonstrates this better than I can in words. MacVim, which is underneath Chrome in the non-Mission Control desktop, is currently 'focussed' (with a two-finger upward swipe). While the focus animation is flawless, the Chrome window immediately flashes to the layer above the MacVim window as soon as the de-focus animation is initiated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI appreciate that, in the example given, if I cancelled out of the MacVim focus by instead choosing to focus on Chrome such a flash would be completely necessary. In transitions to and from states with no overlaps, however, there is really no excuse for this."
