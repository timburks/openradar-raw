    description: "Summary:\r\nApplications in the iWork suite such as Pages '09 always have the save dialog box default to iCloud which is extremely irritating for people that do not save their Documents to iCloud, but rather the local filesystem. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen a new document in an iWork application such as Pages and then try to save it. The dialog box will _always_ default to iCloud.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the save dialog box to remember the last root location that a document was saved to and preload it. For example, if the last save location was on the local filesystem, then that should be loaded instead of always being iCloud.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niCloud is _always_ the default choice presented to a user if they have an iCloud account setup and configured.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
