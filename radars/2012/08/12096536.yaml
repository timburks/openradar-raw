    description: "Summary:\r\nIn Safari 6, any video that's playing will seemingly be paused when it's window is out of focus, such as when being on another Desktop or Space. Upton returning to that window, the video will be playing at a faster than normal rate despite the audio continuing to play at normal speed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Safari and a Web site with a video, such as YouTube. Begin playing the video and switch to some other application in another Desktop or Space. Wait a minute or two, and then switch back to the Safari window with the video playing.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the video to begin displaying from its proper location instead of trying to catch up.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe video apparently stops rendering when the window loses focus. When the window regains focus, the video starts playing in a fast-forward type manner trying to catch up to its current position. I expect the video to resume at its current play location immediately. While the video is trying to catch up, some controls become unresponsive, although the time slider typically can still be used to get around this problem.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI do not recall this being a problem in previous version of Safari in Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
