    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n1. I have purchased Numbers/Keynote/Pages originally on a MacBook Pro 15\" (first Thunderbolt version) running on 10.7 and then upgraded up to the latest 10.7.4. Numbers/Keynote/Pages where updated through AppStore during that time.\r\n\r\n2. I have bought a MacBook Pro 15\" Retina and copied all over using a time machine backup and a install/restore from time machine. Fantastic new hardware and all works.\r\n\r\n3. Mountain Lion release version came along and was installed. All looked good.\r\n\r\n4. This morning AppStore says I have 23 updates. I choose to install all but it fails on Pages/Numbers/Keynote with the notice:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could not complete your purchase. Pages is already installed on this computer. Choose Software Update from the Apple menu to check for available updates.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, \"Software Update\" has been replaced with AppStore under 10.8 so we are back to the point where AppStore can not update because AppStore can not update.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nWhen going into purchases menu to buy again it tells me \"You have 3 Apps to Accept\". When I accept them I get: These apps have already been accepted. These apps where already assigned to your Apple ID and are available in your Purchases list."
