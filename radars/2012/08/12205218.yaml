    description: "Summary:\r\nAnimation priority in Misson Control has led to a situation where people must sit and wait patiently for a gradually decelerating sideways shunt to end. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nPress ^←/→ (or whatever you have bound to switch between desktops in Mission Control)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe adjacent desktop. Quickly.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA quick initial animation followed by a frustrating second of looking at the desktop that I want to be on but being unable to actually do anything with it because it is still crawling very slowly towards focus.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI would be interested in any estimate for the number of times people have issued that keyboard shortcut since Lion came out. Given that Lion and Mountain Lion have had phenomenally successful penetration and that it's at least half a second of wasted time per switch, I wouldn't be surprised if a good decade or more of humanity's time has been wasted waiting for this animation to end.\r\n\r\nI regularly use a mouse and keyboard setup in front of a raised platform that my laptop sits on. Despite having easier access to the ^←/→ shortcuts than the trackpad, I still find myself raising my arm up to the laptop and swiping between desktops because it is less of a needlessly painful experience.\r\n\r\nThe animation of invoking Mission Control is also way too slow by default, but you can defaults write your way around it, which I really, truly appreciate."
