    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Core Data's Canvas Editor screws up regularly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen Core Data's Canvas Editor work with it for more than a minute.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nWorks as expected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSee attached videos. (clicks being ignored, info panel not reacting to selection-change, canvas not in sync with data model, etc)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked in v3 and early v4.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI marked it as always reproducable as it will bite you at least once in a working session. Always.\r\n\r\nThere is another drawing bug, which I could not reproduce on video, in which an entity node stops refuses to synchronize with its attributes/relationships. The only way to re-synchronize it is to add a new attribute/relationship (-> synced) and then remove it.\r\n\r\nStraight cornered edges make more complex entity relationships visually unclear. Curved edges would be an improvement.\r\n\r\nAlso, how about some _pretty_ node and edge drawing? The current drawing is damn ugly.\r\n\r\nFurther more: holding down [shift] with [arrow keys] should increasemovement distance by factor 10, not decresee it. Xcode does it backwards. [shift] > [no-shift] is a de facto system standard.\r\n\r\nBug report title, courtesy Joshua Nozzi: https://twitter.com/jnozzi/status/234793396001189888"
