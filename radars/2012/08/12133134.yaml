    description: "20-Aug-2012 02:44 PM torarnv:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nTouching the Xcode project file (project.pbxproj) will clear all issues from the Issues Navigator, and will give the following in the console:\r\n\r\n8/20/12 2:34:55.034 PM Xcode[64694]:  DVTAssertions: Warning in /SourceCache/IDEFoundation/IDEFoundation-1865/Framework/Classes/Model/Buildables/IssueProvider/IDEBuildIssueProvider.m:310\r\nDetails:  Error loading log for target \"Test7\": (null)\r\nObject:   <IDEBuildIssueProvider: 0x4029ac600>\r\nMethod:   -_blueprintsDidChange\r\nThread:   <NSThread: 0x410395600>{name = (null), num = 2089}\r\nPlease file a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com with this warning message and any useful information you can provide.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne scenario where this can happen is when using version control and checking out an updated version of the Xcode project. You'd expect to not lose build issues in the Issues Navigator.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new project (any project really)\r\n2. Change a source file to introduce a build error (remove a semi colon eg)\r\n3. Build\r\n4. Observe issue in Issue Navigator\r\n5. Touch file from the shell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nProject file is reloaded without loss of information (issues)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nProject file is reloaded, and in the process asserts in /SourceCache/IDEFoundation/IDEFoundation-1865/Framework/Classes/Model/Buildables/IssueProvider/IDEBuildIssueProvider.m:310, which seems to result in losing all issues (warnings and errors)."
