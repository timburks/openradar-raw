    description: "Summary: When being in list view, selecting an entry and going back, the position scrolled to is reset to the entry's day's top. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Have calendar entries that fill more than one page.\r\n- Scroll into the day.\r\n- Tap entry.\r\n- Go back.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The scroll view is at the same position as before.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The scroll view is on top of the day of the entry in detail view.\r\n\r\nRegression: Save scroll position when going into detail view or don't set it when going back.\r\n\r\nNotes: Setting the scroll position is a valid action, when changing the date of an entry.\r\n\r\nIt is majorly annoying when just looking at the entries in your calendar one by one and having to scroll down again and again.\r\n\r\nA \"previous, next\" button pair in detail view might be an alternative nice addition."
