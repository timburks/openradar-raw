    description: "The \"Core Audio\" folder -- containing C++ classes for developing Audio Units, codecs, working with the HAL, and various utilities -- is missing from the \"Audio Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012\" disk image.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* From Xcode 4.4, choose the menu item Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> More Developer Tools...\r\n* This opens the URL https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode%20- in the default browser\r\n* Use the search widget on this page to search for \"Audio Tools\". There are four results:\r\n   + Audio Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012\r\n   + Xcode 4.4\r\n   + Audio Tools for Xcode Developer Preview (OS X Mountain Lion)\r\n   + Audio Tools for Xcode - February 2012\r\nEach of these has a common description: \"This package includes additional audio tools formerly bundled in the Xcode installer. These tools include the AU Lab and HALLab applications, CoreAudio headers and example code\"\r\n* Download the newest of these, \"Audio Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012\". For reference, also grab any of the others.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe package should contain the AULab and HALLab applications (which it does). It should also contain the \"CoreAudio\" folder with the utility and base AudioUnit, Codec, etc. classes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe \"CoreAudio\" folder is missing from the \"Audio Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012\" disk image.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe \"CoreAudio\" folder is present in the older versions of the Audio Tools disk images. Prior to Xcode 4.3, this folder was installed at /Developer/Extras as part of the Xcode install process.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThese classes have long been a standard part of the Core Audio SDK, and it is not practical to do intermediate-to-advanced Core Audio development on OS X without the classes in CoreAudio/PublicUtility.\r\n\r\nI'm the author of the \"Learning Core Audio\" book -- http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321636848 -- and we explicitly direct readers to download the Audio Tools for Xcode so they can use the CARingBuffer class in one of the examples."
