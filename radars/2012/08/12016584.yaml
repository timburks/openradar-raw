    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using CGDisplayScreenSize() to query a display for it's dimensions, on an iMac9,1 the results returned are incorrect.  The width dimension is about half of what it should be.  This problem didn't exist on 10.7.  Other resolutions don't cause this problem, just the native resolution.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Make sure iMac display is set to native resolution\r\n2. Call CGDisplayScreenSize() on the main iMac display on 10.8\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nShould get something at least close to:\r\n{518.80850284657583, 320.84210044459292}\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n{262.19354444934476, 324.25531427910988}\r\n\r\nWhere width is way off. It ends up being about 10\" when the width of the iMac 24\" screen is around 20\".  I'm wanting to get the dpi of the screen and this bug ends up getting me 186dpi for width and 94 dpi for height when they should be about the same.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWorked on 10.7 returning {518.80850284657583, 320.84210044459292} which produces roughly 94dpi in both directions and is the expected dimensions of the screen."
