    description: "Summary:\r\nUINavigationBar has a private method called `pushNavigationItem:`, which is an alternative to `pushNavigationItem:animated:`. UINavigationController sends `pushNavigationItem:` when pushing navigation items onto the stack, bypassing any custom functionality in `pushNavigationItem:animated:`. This makes it impossible to intelligently change the behavior of a UINavigationBar without completely reimplementing `drawRect:`.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Define `pushNavigationItem:animated:` on a subclass of UINavigationBar with a logging statement or breakpoint.\r\n2. Set up the subclass as the class of a UINavigationController's navigation bar in Interface Builder. \r\n3. Create a button that pushes another view controller onto the stack.\r\n3. Run the program and press the button.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYour custom implementation of `pushNavigationItem:animated:` should be called.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYour custom implementation is not called. `pushNavigationItem:`, a private method, is called instead.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niOS 5.1 and iOS 6.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
