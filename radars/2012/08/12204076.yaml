    description: "Summary:\r\nIf I want to file a bug against iOS itself (say, for example, springboard is doing something iffy, or in my case, the settings app needed an addition), there's no iOS menu item under Product to file against. I've got iPhone/iPod Touch, which is kinda right, but those bugs would affect the iPad as well, no?\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog into radar, file a bug\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\niOS item under \"Product\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCurrent no iOS item under \"Product\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
