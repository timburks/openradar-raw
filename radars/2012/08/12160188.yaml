    description: "I frequently use Cmd-E to copy the selection in the Search Pasteboard, then Cmd-G to search with the current Search Pasteboard.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work in Safari 6's new unified address/search bar.\r\n\r\n18-Sep-2012 12:22 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nCan you clarify your use case? Cmd-E and Cmd-G work as expected when the selected text is in web content. Are you asking us to make Cmd-E work for text selected in the unified address field, so that Cmd-G would then search for that text in the current web page?\r\n\r\n18-Sep-2012 09:31 AM Ortwin Gentz:\r\nYes, exactly. Since the unified address field is used to paste a Google search keyword, I frequently want to highlight this keyword on the response pages."
