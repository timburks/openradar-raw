    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIf a table view has multiple cells (one of which is Custom and others are Basic or any other type) and is embedded within a Container View, the static cells are never displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n(All in Interface Builder)\r\n1. Create a UIViewController\r\n2. Add a Container View. Delete the default UIViewController that is created as an embed\r\n3. Add a new UITableViewController and embed that to the Container View\r\n4. Set the UITableView properties to: \"Static Cells\" and \"Grouped\"\r\n5. Add several cells to the TableView's section\r\n6. Set the first static cell to \"Custom\" and drag a UILabel into it\r\n7. Set the remaining static cells to Basic\r\n8. Build and run the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe table displays all of its cells and subviews of those cells as set in IB.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe table is displayed but the static cell doesn't show its UILabel.  The same is true for any other control added to the Custom cell.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample app that demonstrates the issue: both a working and non-working version.  The working version is identical except it's not embedded in a Container View."
