    description: "Summary: Even though an address book entry exists, a mail's sender sometimes is not matched to that entry. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Add contact to address book with mail foo@bar.baz. Receive mail from that address. Open mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The mail's sender is replaced with name of entry in address book. One can open the address book entry from the context menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The name is not matched, not replaced. The context menu offers to add that address to the address book.\r\n\r\nRegression: Fix matching the mail to an address book entry.\r\n\r\nNotes: This is not happening for all mails. \r\nWhen adding the contact from Mail to the address book, it is correctly linking to that entry. \r\nThen merging the entry with an existing entry for it, results in the mail no longer matching to an address book entry, even though the correct mail is still given in that entry."
