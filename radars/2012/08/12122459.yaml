    description: "Summary: Autosave error callouts stack on top of each other and cannot be dismissed\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Place a Quartz Composer file in a folder.\r\n2. Change folder permissions to be read only.\r\n3. Open the Quartz Composition in Quartz Composer (e.g. by double-clicking it).\r\n4. Make random changes to the file and then switch back to another app (e.g. the Finder)\r\n5. After a short wait, return to Quartz Composer. Note that there is a callout at the top of the window indicating that the file could not be saved.\r\n6. Make another random change to the file and then again switch back to another app. (Do not click the warning callout.)\r\n7. Once again return to Quartz Composer. Note that a second callout has appeared, either in a slightly different position or stacked on top of the previous one (you can tell by the darker-than-normal window shadow).\r\n8. Click the callouts to attempt to dismiss them. Note that not all the callouts can be dismissed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAll callouts can be dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot all callouts can be dismissed. They obstruct the user interface and eventually require the user to quit and relaunch the app to eliminate them.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
