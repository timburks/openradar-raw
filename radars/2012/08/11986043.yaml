    description: "Summary:\r\nWallpapers selected at random from a directory full of aliases sometimes fail to display, instead showing the default 'Galaxy' wallpaper.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create a directory full of aliases pointing to images. Mine is ~60 items.\r\n- Set the wallpaper of one or more desktops to pick randomly from within that folder every [unit time (ideally 5 seconds as this makes it less boring to wait for it to reproduce)]\r\n- Switch back and forth between desktops for a bit.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nConsistent reselection from within the folder full of aliases.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nTwo failures:\r\n- The wallpaper for desktops set up as described instead falls back to the new ML 'Galaxy' wallpaper.\r\n- The typical crossfade does not render at all, instead the wallpaper switch is a hard cut.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis setup was inherited from a Lion install, but the problem persists after setting static wallpapers and then setting up the random again."
