    description: "When LCD Font Smoothing (aka Sub-Pixel Antialiasing) is disabled via System Preferences, Safari 6 does not respect this setting in all locations. Safari 6 always renders text in the address bar with sub-pixel antialiasing.\r\n\r\nThe browser viewport, webpages, and all other menus respect this setting, It is just the address bar that is problematic.\r\n\r\nI disable LCD font smoothing as I can see the colour fringes around the text with it enabled and makes it very hard to read text.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Be on OS X Mountain Lion 10.8\r\n2) Quit Safari if it is running\r\n3) Navigate to System Preferences -> General, and disable the \"Use LCD Font Smoothing When Available\" checkbox\r\n4) Reopen Safari and navigate to any web page.\r\n5) Closely examine the differences between the text in the address bar and the text on the web page\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nText in the address bar should use greyscale antialiasing like the text in the browser viewport. This respecting the setting in System Preferences\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nText in the address bar uses sub pixel antialiasing and has noticeable colour fringes when you look closely\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n- Tested on MacBook Pro 15-inch, Early 2011, running OS X 10.8 (12A269). Untested on any other configuration.\r\n- This bug was not present on the same hardware in earlier versions of Safari, and was not present in the Safari 6 beta for OS X Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSee screenshot for an example. Note the colour fringes in the address bar and the lack of them on the text in the webpage. Any website with text will demonstrate the problem.\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/IvFA"
