    description: "We have an app that uses custom input fields, which are UIView subclasses, and a custom numeric keyboard to capture user input. It would be nice to allow a user to use the keys on an external keyboard to enter values, however this is impossible to achieve unless we use some workarounds involving hidden UITextFields or the like. An API would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of 7649186"
