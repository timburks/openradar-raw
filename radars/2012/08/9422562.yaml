    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAppending an audio element from one element to another in mobile Safari will cause it to lose its state and become uncontrollable (the controls disappear and methods like play() no longer work on it). The same is not true for desktop Safari.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new document with two DIV elements in the body, one empty and one containing an audio element.\r\n2. Click the play control on the audio element to begin playback.\r\n3. While the audio is playing, call appendChild on the empty DIV with the audio element as an argument\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe audio element is moved to the new DIV and retains its state. Playback can be resumed from the exact same position where it left off. This is the behaviour on desktop Safari.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe audio element can no longer be controlled after being moved. It loses its controls UI and calling play() on it has no effect."
