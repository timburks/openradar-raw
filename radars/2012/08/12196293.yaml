    description: "Summary:\r\nThere seems to be no way of creating conflicting NSFileVersions other than iCloud. This is the worst-case scenario for any testability of custom conflict-handling implementations.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Unfortunately none.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- ANY way to cause conflicts other than through iCloud\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- No such way\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSince this is for TESTING and during DEVELOPMENT only, ANY way would be acceptable:\r\n- Private API somewhere hidden in Foundation\r\n- Private command line tools\r\n- Direct access to the versions store"
