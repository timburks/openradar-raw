    description: "Summary: When switching spaces directly, using <ctrl-#>, desktop icons temporarily show up on top of everything.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Create two spaces.\r\n- open window on one of them. place window above some desktop icon(s).\r\n- switch to space with window on it.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: One space moves away, a different one appears.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The space disappears, the new one appears, desktop icons appear on top of everything (over window), which then disappear as soon as animation is completely over.\r\n\r\nRegression: Fix the animation.\r\n\r\nNotes: The animation for this type of switching is different from switching via <ctrl-arrows> by the way, for no apparent reason. (faster; linear, not eased)\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the error is at http://d.pr/i/nfm6+."
