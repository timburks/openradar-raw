    description: "Summary:\r\nEntering full-width romaji text into the Tweet sheet in Notification Centre and then hitting esc (or, I assume, cancel; untested) causes the Tweet sheet to disappear irrevocably.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Set your keyboard layout to Full-width Romaji\r\n- Open Notification Centre\r\n- Click to Tweet\r\n- Type something (doesn't appear to have to be much)\r\n- Hit esc\r\n- Click to Tweet again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe Tweet sheet again\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe 'Click to Tweet' button does nothing.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nKilling the Dock process does not resolve the situation; the only resolution I have found is a full reboot.\r\n\r\nThis situation is causing me to be both more hesitant and necessarily more committal about using Full-width Romaji as a semantic sarcasm indicator in Tweets.\r\n\r\n30-Aug-2012 04:20 PM\r\nAddendum: This behaviour may or may not only occur when the text in question overflows the Tweet sheet."
