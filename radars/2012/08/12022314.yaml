    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the app Xcode is debugging (iOS in this case) runs into infinite recursion, it hangs and you have to force-quit it.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an infinite recursion in your program.\r\nRun the app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe debugger should stop at some point, showing in the stack trace the method that is being called over and over.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode hangs and it's impossible to see what the method being called it."
