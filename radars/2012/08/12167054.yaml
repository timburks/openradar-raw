        There should be a way to mark fields (phone number, email address etc) as obsolete in Contacts. Such fields should display differently (possibly greyed out), and shouldn't appear in any of the autocomplete menus in Mail and Messages.

        Often there are times when someone sends you updated contact details and you want to switch to using those, but you want to save their old details just in case. For example, if one of your friends loses a phone and texts everyone "Here's my new number", it's possible someone else will find the phone and call you on it — if there was a way to keep the obsolete information, you'd be able to see who was calling, while if you had deleted it then it would show up as unknown number.
