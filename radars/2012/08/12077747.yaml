    description: "10-Aug-2012 03:15 PM Steve Yuroff:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen connecting to a Mac client (including, but not necessarily limited to, 10.6.8) on my LAN using either ARD 3.6 or Screen sharing from my 10.8 client, the \"Both Displays\" window may be shifted and truncated.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect to a client that has multiple displays, using ARD or Screen Sharing, attempt to view both displays.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet a local ARD window that shows the contents of both screens, shrunk as needed to fit the local display.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA window is opened up, with space for both displays.  The area on the left will be a blank \"window\" with no content. The right side will contain the content of the window on the left, and perhaps *some* of the content of the other window.\r\nThe position of these 2 windows is swapped in relationship to their definition in the client's Displays preference pane.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nVerified on clients running 10.6.8, ARD 3.5.3 from\r\n10.8.0 client using Apple Remote Desktop 3.6 and Screen Sharing app\r\n10.7.4 client using Screen sharing\r\nCan happen with ARD Client Version 3.5.3, but does not always happen if that version.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nConfiguration worked before ML/ARD 3.6 update.  2 screenshots enclosed.\r\n\r\n10-Aug-2012 03:15 PM Steve Yuroff:\r\n'bugreport_screenshots.zip' was successfully uploaded"
