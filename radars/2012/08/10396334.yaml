    description: "I've pasted the report sent to Apple, in which I supplied a demo app and project with source code, that demonstrates the issues with both NSOpenPanel and NSSavePanel.\r\n\r\nSummary: NSOpenPanel & NSSavePanel in a sandboxed Carbon app causes crashes & odd behaviour\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Enable sandboxing in a Carbon app and use NSOpenPanel & NSSavePanel. \r\n\r\nIssues to reproduce using supplied example app:\r\n\r\n1. Select \"New\" from File menu and the NSSavePanel is displayed in minimised state\r\n2. Click in the menubar and notice that the NSSavePanel becomes de-activated. Release the moue and the panel becomes activated again.\r\n3. Select 'Minimize' from the Window menu, then click in the minimised window in the Dock. Notice how the window and Save button flickers now and the window is unresponsive to user input (e.g. mouse)\r\n4. Click out of app into (e.g.) Finder and back again. Notice how app crashes. \r\n5. Re-run app and select \"New\" from File menu.\r\n6. Choose \"Close\" from File menu. Notice how NSSavePanel window closes, but does not exit runModal, leaving host app in unusable (and un-Quit-able) state\r\n\r\nSimilar problems can be seen when using the New Folder button from the expanded NSSavePanel window, and also from the NSOpenPanel - choose Open from the File menu to see these. Just play with it a while and it will be very obvious what is broken. Yet, un-checkinbg the sandbox checkbox makes all these issues disappear.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Correct operation\r\n\r\nActual Results:Very buggy behaviour, including (but not limited to) crashing, activation issues, unresponsive UI\r\n\r\nRegression:N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:The very same code is working perfectly if sandboxing is disabled."
