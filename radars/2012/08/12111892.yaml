    description: "Summary: Mails in list always show up with name from mail's header, independent of whether sender is in address book or not. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Receive mail from contact in address book, while mail has header with bogus sender's name field.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The list of mails shows mail with name replaced by the address book entry's name.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The bogus name shows up.\r\n\r\nRegression: Use lookup method used in mail view for list as well.\r\n\r\nNotes: Address book details show up correctly in mail / conversation view.\r\nThis behavior is present since a long time, and is present on both, iOS and OSX.\r\nWhile this might be intended, it seems to be better to use address book entries, as that might prevent spoofing (i.e. A sending B a mail with name C in header. B thinks mail is valid mail from C, but includes bad data from A.), therefore might also be a security issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, some clients do not include a correct name, a shortened name or different name than the user wants to show. (e.g, \"W.Butler\" instead of \"William Butler\", or \"bloerwald@googlem...\" instead of \"Bernd LÃ¶rwald\").\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot with a list to show how ugly it might look. All senders have an address book entry there, as indicated by the picture available."
