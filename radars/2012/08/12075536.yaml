    description: "Summary: Any pages viewed in Safari as a result of a user clicking a link from Twitter remain in Safari's history as the original, truncated version (e.g. http://t.co/asdfknls). This makes navigating through Safari's history very difficult for heavy Twitter users, as there is no title or preview for these items)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Follow several links from the Twitter website or a native Twitter Mac app, and later look through Safari's history (via either the History menubar item or the History Bookmarks section). \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Safari's history shows the more useful final URL of any visited pages.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Safari's history shows all Twitter links in their truncated form, with no page title or visual preview.\r\n\r\nRegression: This has always happened in all versions of Safari on all versions of OS X.\r\n\r\nNotes: This could be accomplished using Twitter's API to preview t.co links, or perhaps more simply, Safari could wait to record certain URL shorteners until they have been redirected for the last time (and perhaps for anyone who wants to see original links, there could be a preference for this?)\r\n\r\nGiven the recent Twitter functionality in Mountain Lion, I think this is a very natural enhancement that would make Safari a much more useful browser for heavy Twitter users."
