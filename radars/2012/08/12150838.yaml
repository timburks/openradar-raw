    description: "MacOS 10.8 now alerts the user when an app is trying to use their address book. However, many apps only do this to fill in the user's own email address in support forms etc. \r\n\r\nI would like to see a separate level of authorisation that would allow an app to access just this card. The user could be presented with a different dialog box, saying \"This app would like to access your personal details\" rather than \"This app would like to access your address book\", and if approval is given then just the Me card will be made available."
