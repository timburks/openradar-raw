    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter the iPod music player has finished its queue and a new song is started, the [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer].playbackState property is broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nI've created a very basic music player, it's located at https://github.com/kevinrenskers/MusicPlayerTest. After installing the app on an iPhone or iPod Touch (iOS 5), kill the app and do these steps:\r\n\r\n1. In the iPod app, play a song on an album that has multiple songs. \r\n2. Open the MusicTest app and see that the play/pause button works fine.\r\n3. Go back to the iPod app, and keep pressing the forward button until you hit the end of the queue. \r\n4. Play another song of this same album, then pause it. \r\n5. Go back to the MusicTest app, the play/pause button is now broken.\r\n\r\nIt seems that once you hit the end of the play queue, the playback state of the iPod app is no longer functioning correctly. When we request the [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer].playbackState property, it always says it is currently playing a song, even though it is not. Hitting the play/pause button is now broken because of this.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any workarounds, since we need the playbackState property to reflect the actual current state.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nEverything should be working fine, the playbackState property should reflect the actual state.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAfter hitting the end of the queue and starting another song, the playbackState property is \"stuck\", saying a song is playing even though it is paused.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIt happens in iOS 5.1.1 on an iPhone 4 and the latest generation iPod Touch.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease see the code at https://github.com/kevinrenskers/MusicPlayerTest. It's the most basic music player ever."
