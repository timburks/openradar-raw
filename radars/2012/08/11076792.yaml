    description: "Summary: When having two devices having enabled iMessage for the same account and writing a message on device A, reading the own message on device B may mark it as read, even though the receiver never read it or even turned reading notifications off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: 1. Write Message on device A (eg Mac).\r\n2. Open Messages on device B (eg iPhone)\r\n3. Read own message on device B.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Nothing changes.\r\n\r\nActual Results: On device A and B, the message now shows as read.\r\n\r\nNotes: This does not always happen. This may also happen for marking the message as received. Also state of a message may differ between devices. (A: none, B: received) (which just happened for me, knowing that the receiver has no device turned on, therefore never been able to receive it.)"
