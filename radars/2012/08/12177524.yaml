    description: "26-Aug-2012 10:32 PM:\r\nSummary: AirPort Utility has multiple issues with 5GHz networks that do not share the same name as the primary 2.4GHz network.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nFor the first issue, one can configure a newer Simultaneous Dual Band AP with a network name of \"g-funk\" for 2.4GHz and \"n-sane\" for 5GHz, as in my configuration.  Once that configuration is set, allow the AP to reboot.  Enter the APU 6.1, edit the configuration for your AP, and proceed to the 'Wireless' tab. Click 'Wireless Options'.  Note that the 5GHz network name should be \"n-sane\". Click cancel. Click 'Wireless Options' again. Note that the 5GHz network name has changed to \"g-funk 5GHz\". A unicorn cried when it saw this.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, which seems related to the first, involves using the ridiculous and now mandatory APU 6 'Auto setup' feature.  When telling my new flat AirPort Express to extend my wireless network, I chose \"n-sane\", the name of my 5GHz network.  After configuration succeeded by all accounts, I factory reset my old AirPort Express, and proceeded to set it up as well.  I also had it extend \"n-sane\", my 5GHz network.  Configuration succeeded, and I went to verify the settings.  In both cases, the Expresses were extending \"g-funk\", the 2.4GHz network and not the 5GHz network as they were both configured to do.  Luckily, for those who don't notice this issue, their LOLcat images will only take a second or two longer to upload to Facebook over the slower 2.4GHz network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  For the first issue, the APU should not change the desired 5GHz network name without informing the user.  For the second issue, the APU should configure the AP to extend the network the user chose, not the 2.4GHz network name as saved in the master router's configuration.\r\n\r\nActual Results:  Sadness as described above.\r\n\r\nRegression:  I believe the issue was present in APU 6.0, but I have not gone back to test this for confirmation.\r\n\r\nNotes:  Another fun thing I noticed is that when I was trying to add my new flat AirPort Express's wireless MAC address to the filter on the Extreme, I couldn't find the MAC address.  It was not printed on the box, nor was it printed on the device itself.  The very pretty, but generally lobotomized APU 6.1 doesn't seem to have the ability to show useful information such as MAC addresses.  Luckily, I had my G4 tower that I installed APU 5.6.1 onto so I could get the MAC on my brand new AirPort Express.  Yes, my G4 tower works better to configure my new AirPort Express than my MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion.  Thankfully, if the G4 tower dies, I have a 12\" PowerBook ready to configure my wireless devices!\r\n\r\n26-Aug-2012 10:55 PM:\r\nApparently, AirPort Utility for iOS shows hardware information (like the MAC address), so I'll have to figure out another excuse to tell my wife for wanting to keep the 12\" PowerBook. \r\n\r\nAlso, Pacifist worked great to install AirPort Utility 5.6.1 on my MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion, so there's that too.  Thanks to Pacifist, I don't have to shoo the woolly mammoths and sabretooth tigers away from the G4 tower except in the most dire of circumstances now."
