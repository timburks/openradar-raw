    description: "Summary: \r\nMail continues to sign messages with expired S/MIME certificates.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Install an S/MIME certificate on an iOS device. \r\n2. Engage the setting to sign outgoing mail.\r\n3. Wait for the certificate to expire.\r\n4. Send a message.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI would expect the message to be sent unsigned, as in Mail.app on the Mac. Perhaps a warning dialog.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe message is signed with an invalid signature, and no warning is generated. If you're lucky, you receive replies from technically inclined correspondents pointing out the mistake."
