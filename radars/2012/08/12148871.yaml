    description: "The Reachability class Apple provides (https://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/Reachability/index.html) is very useful. So useful in fact that it's used by many *many* libraries on iOS. Since Objective-C doesn't have namespaces, this means you frequently run into conflicts between libraries.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is so basic, and so core, I don't understand why it isn't provided by the OS directly. A simple NSReachability class would be a wonderful wonderful thing. It would also prevent newbie developers from using code like:\r\n\r\nNSString *reachable = [NSString stringWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@\"http://google.com\"] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&error];\r\nif ([reachable rangeOfString:@\"I'm feeling lucky!\"].location != NSNotFound) {\r\n    // has internet connection\r\n}"
