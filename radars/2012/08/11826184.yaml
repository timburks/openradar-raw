    description: "Summary: In Mountain Lion, widgets do not reliably receive mouseover events. This seems to affect both JavaScript and CSS. For the built-in widgets this mainly means that the \"i\" button does not appear reliably. The only widget that will respond reliably is the active widget, the one that was last clicked on.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open multiple widgets that have some mouseover effect, like an \"i\" button appearing. Weather and World Clock are some examples.\r\n2. Move the mouse pointer over a widget other than the one that was most recently interacted with (opened/clicked on).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The \"i\" button should appear for any widget that is moused over, if it has one. Or in the \"Movies\" widget, the \"View Trailer\" link should be underlined when the mouse moves over it.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Sometimes it works, or more often it does not.\r\n\r\nRegression: This problem is not present in Lion, as of 10.7.4.\r\n\r\nNotes: Of course this makes Dashboard significantly more difficult to use. For widgets that offer more interactivity it's especially problematic."
