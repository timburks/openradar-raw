    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\n    If you use an element in Interface Builder in Xcode 4.4 that is not linked to the application, the resulting error at runtime is not insightful at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n    1. Create a new view-based iOS project in Xcode 4.4, using Storyboard.\r\n    2. Insert an MKMapView into the main view\r\n    3. Build and run the application\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n    An exception to be thrown detailing that the class \"MKMapView\" was not found in the runtime and needs to be linked.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n    The following nondescript exception is thrown:\r\n\r\n    *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'The NIB data is invalid.'\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n    Not tested.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n    A compile time warning would be awesome, but probably very hard to generate. A relevant runtime exception is definitely acceptable, for a one time developer error."
