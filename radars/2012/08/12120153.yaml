    description: "17-Aug-2012 08:58 AM Amy Worrall:\r\nWith the news that Twitter is severely limiting third party developers, it's a lot scarier to consider putting Twitter features into an app these days.\r\n\r\nApp.net is a new service that is explicitly developer-friendly. It's for-pay, so users have to cough up an annual charge, but in return there's a guarantee that they'll never sell out like Twitter did and stop letting client apps do things the users want.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see an app.net sharing service, at the same level as the Facebook and Twitter services already in iOS. It should include linking with the system Accounts framework, and methods to do arbitrary API calls on the app.net API."
