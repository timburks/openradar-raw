    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting the “Location” of a group (or any other object) in the “Identity Inspector” to a symlink, Xcode does not store the symlink in the project file.\r\nInstead, it resolves the symlink and saves its destination path in the project file.\r\nThis is less than useful in several scenarios — the case where resources of one project are generated in a different context are the one where I got heavily bitten by that.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Create a symlink to any directory on your system from within your project space.\r\n1. Open the project and add a new Group.\r\n2. In the “Identity Inspector”, set the “Location” by clicking the little button below the popup-menu. (In my case, “Relative to Group” is selected in the popup, but that really doesn’t matter)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe relative path should end with the name of the symlink.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe relative path traverses the whole filesystem to the destination of the symlink.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis can be worked around be creating hard links, when working with files — hard links to directories, however, are…problematic.\r\nThe workaround for directories is\r\n1. to create a normal directory with the exact name and location your symlink will have\r\n2. select that folder as the location of your group in the project — Xcode now stores the correct location\r\n3. delete the folder and create your symlink in its place."
