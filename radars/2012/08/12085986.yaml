    description: "I'm developing an an app that combines tracks from the user's iPod library and plays them with fade in, fade out, overlapping etc. This works quiet well with the AVMutableComposition as long as all tracks the user selects are stored on the deivce. But when the user selects a track that is only stored in the iCloud (because the user uses iTunes Match) the composition does not play when the user is not in a WLAN. My app is designed to use outside where you normally do not have any WLAN. But like this, it's useless. I would love to see the following features:\r\n\r\n- A way to detect if a song is on the device or not\r\n- A way to tell the Media Player framework it should make a song available for offline usage.\r\n- Song download over Cellular network not just WLAN"
