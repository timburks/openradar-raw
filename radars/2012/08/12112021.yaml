    description: "Summary: When having Mail open with a mail that is matching to an address book entry, editing the entry in the address book application does not result in any changes in Mail unless restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: - Open Mail. Open mail that is linked to a contact.\r\n- Open contact in address book.\r\n- Change details of that contact.\r\n- Switch back to Mail.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Changes made in AB should now be visible in Mail.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Mail still has state from before. New details are not used. There is no re-matching to contacts. Links to contacts are not changed (i.e. contact deletion leads to invalid calling card displayed (only UUID of contact shown.) Nothing changes until Mail is restarted.\r\n\r\nRegression: I am unaware of the AB API, but there should be some detection of changes and a re-matching should happen. \r\n\r\nNotes: This also happens, when adding a second mail address to a contact: the mails are not matched again but a restart is required to correctly link mails and contact. Links also do not get updated on deletion of contact (which may also happen on merging two accounts and therefore the original contact no longer existing.)"
