    description: "Summary:\r\nThe kernel's IORegistryEntry class has a set of methods called copyProperty(). The source code for these reveals that the property value is in fact NOT copied.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Obtain a dictionary or array property value from a registry entry using copyProperty()\r\n- attempt to modify the property value\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- modifying the copied collection should work\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- kernel panic: \"Trying to change a collection in the registry\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suspect this is an optimisation for legacy code that uses copyProperty and does not in fact require a copy. However, this makes it essentially superfluous as IORegistryEntry::getProperty() is almost identical - IORegistryEntry::copyProperty() in fact calls getProperty() and retain()s the result.\r\nWorse, the name suggests copying, and the documentation for this method is vague and does not explicitly state that no copy is performed.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix:\r\n- Mark copyProperty() as deprecated\r\n- Update the documentation for copyProperty() to be clear about the non-copying behaviour.\r\n- Update getProperty() method documentation to say that returned values are immutable and should be copied before modification."
