    description: "Summary: When subclassing UIActivity, you have the option of returning an activityViewController. This view controller does not need to be presented, as it will be handled automatically by the system. Similarly, the documentation specifically says not to dismiss this view controller directly, and instead to call -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:] which will dismiss the view controller automatically. This works on the iPhone, but on an iPad the view controller is never dismissed, and the presentingViewController property is nil so there is no way to dismiss it programmatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a custom subclass of UIActivity, and return a UIViewController. Have a button on the view controller connected to a method that calls -[UIActivity activityDidFinish:].\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The view controller is dismissed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The view controller remains onscreen.\r\n\r\nRegression: Only happens on the iPad. Everything works as expected on the iPhone and iPod Touch.\r\n\r\nNotes: Attached is a sample application to demonstrate the problem. This sample app is also being used to demonstrate other bugs, so to test this particular bug, simply tap the action button at the bottom of the screen, tap the \"Test Activity\" icon, and then tap the \"Finish Activity\" button."
