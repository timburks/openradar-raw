        When choosing "Save As" in Mountain Lion (by holding option key when opening the File menu), the original document is saved as well as the copy being created.

        To conform to user expectations, when "Save As" is chosen, the system should revert the original document back to the last explicit save, and only the copy should contain the recent changes.
