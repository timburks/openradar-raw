    description: "16-Jul-2012 08:42 PM Vlad Alexa:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere are just too may issues to note them all, safe to say i installed a clean 10.8 on my drive with multiple volumes, just like on 10.7 i put some of my apps from /Volumes/Storage in dock, set my images from /Volumes/Media as wallpapers, then log out and log back in.\r\n\r\nNow the dock shows question marks for those apps and the wallpaper is the default one until i kill and restart the dock.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the log in the notes disk logger fails to open /Volumes/Media/.fseventsd, launchd fails to start jobs on different volumes etc, not sure if the rdar://problem/11489077 in the log is related\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUse any stuff anywhere from non-system volumes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nStuff to work.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nStuff breaks.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n7/16/12 8:11:32.021 PM fseventsd[47]: disk logger: failed to open output file /Volumes/Media/.fseventsd/636573aaeda0e3cb (No such file or directory). mount point /Volumes/Media/.fseventsd\r\n7/16/12 8:11:32.021 PM fseventsd[47]: disk logger: failed to open output file /Volumes/Media/.fseventsd/636573aaeda0e3cb (No such file or directory). mount point /Volumes/Media/.fseventsd\r\n7/16/12 8:29:35.788 PM xpcd[305]: (null): have symlinks: (\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2012 09:13 PM Vlad Alexa:\r\nI would like to note some regressions in the case of a reboot or maybe when i wait a minute at the login window before entering the password the icons in the dock do not show the question marks and the launchd messages change from \r\n\r\n7/16/12 8:29:35.376 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[217]: (com.vladalexa.MagicPrefs[6974]) Job failed to exec(3). Setting up event to tell us when to try again: 2: No such file or directory\r\n7/16/12 8:29:35.376 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[217]: (com.vladalexa.MagicPrefs[6974]) Job failed to exec(3) for weird reason: 2\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n7/16/12 9:04:22.130 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[215]: (com.vladalexa.MagicPrefs[266]) Exited with code: 2\r\n\r\n\r\ni would also like to note that this happens with a external usb drive which probably has greater latency than internal storage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16-Jul-2012 09:17 PM Vlad Alexa:\r\nI would also like to attest that if i move a application that fails to launch with launchd to the system volume e.g.: from /Volumes/Storage to /Applications launch is able to start it just fine.\r\n\r\n03-Aug-2012 02:02 PM Vlad Alexa:\r\nAdditionally about 1 out of 10 times the volumes are mounted read only so i have to manually unmount and remount them with Disk Utility."
