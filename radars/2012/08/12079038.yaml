    description: "Summary:\r\nThere is no way to force the address bar into search mode, bypassing url detection and going directly to web search.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Paste url (http://example.com/) in address bar\r\n2. Look for a shortcut or menu item to search for that url\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThere is a shortcut or menu item, and by activating it, safari opens google.com/search?q=http:%2F%2Fexample.com\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt always opens http://example.com/\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYou could force a search on previous versions of safari by using the search bar.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA feature like that is needed, for example, to use google search by image quickly. Or to see what other websites are linking to the page you want to search for. Right now the only way to do this is by going to google.com and typing your query on their search box.\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome solves this by having ? as a shortcut. By focusing on the address bar and typing ?, it'll interpret anything after it as a search query, even if it is an URL."
