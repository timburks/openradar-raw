    description: "Summary:\r\nRSS Feeds no longer function in Safari 6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nOpen an RSS bookmark bundled with Safari installation, or from the Web like at the bottom of this web page: http://www.apple.com/\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nDisplay of linked content.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari tries to find some other app to open the RSS \"feed:\" URI. In older OSes, Apple's Mail would handle it, though poorly. In the current OS, no Apple software handles it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSafari 5.x (the previous versions) handled this fine. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nCannot be intentional because Apple still ships Safari with RSS bookmarks and uses RSS on its own Web pages. No suitable alternative notification technology or RSS support exists."
