    description: "To my knowledge, applications that use the Spotlight API won't be accepted in the Mac App Store after March, 1st.\r\n\r\nPlease consider a new sandbox entitlement that allows applications to use the Spotlight API to retrieve specific items from user's filesystem. Without such an entitlement, a whole class of applications is barred from reaching its user base.\r\n\r\nAn example of such an application is GarageTunes, a music playing/streaming application that was designed around the Spotlight API  to locate music files on the user's hard drive, thus freeing the user from the task of managing a library of music files."
