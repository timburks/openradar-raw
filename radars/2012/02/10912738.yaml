    description: "Summary:\r\nIf you switch from the column view to icon view in finder, the icon slider doesn't actually cause icons to resize. On top of this if you have multiple finder windows open, all having switched from column view to icon view, the sliders in all those windows move as one\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open a finder window\r\n2. Switch column view to icon view\r\n3. Try resizing\r\n4. Open a few more finder windows\r\n5. Also switch them from column view to icon view\r\n6. Try resizing again\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe icons resize and each window's slider moves independently\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe icons don't resize and the sliders all move as one\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis doesn't happen if you switch from coverflow or list view, or if you open a window directly in icon view"
