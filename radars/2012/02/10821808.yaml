    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUIPageViewController freezes a page in place when a page-turn swipe gesture is transitioned into a four-finger swipe up gesture, and does not reset cleanly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a new Cocoa touch \"Page-Based Application\" in Xcode 4.2.1\r\n2) Without modifying anything, launch the template app on a device\r\n3) slowly begin to turn a page\r\n4) While holding the page in place, use additional fingers to perform a multi-finger swipe up to present the recently-used-apps tray/dock.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe page-turn is cancelled, and the page animates cleanly back to the neutral/flat state (as seen if you repeat the above steps in iBooks.app)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe page-turn freezes in place until it is manually reset after the app resumes the active state.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nUnknown."
