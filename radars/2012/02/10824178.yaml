    description: "08-Feb-2012 08:38 AM Mugunth Kumar Kumar:\r\nSummary:When a third party app accesses address book using the provided C API, iOS should show a prompt to user to get his/her consent.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate an iOS application and write these two lines of code in viewDidLoad of the FirstViewController or AppDelegate's applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:.\r\n\r\nABAddressBookRef addressBookRef = ABAddressBookCreate();\r\nCFArrayRef allContacts = ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople(addressBookRef);\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe iOS app should show a dialog requesting for user's consent to share the address book with the third party app.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such dialog appears. allContacts variable now has every contact information present on the device.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWhile this is not a bug, it's a serious security flaw. High profile applications like Path has misused this and user's private data might end up in the hands of advertisers.\r\n\r\nBelow is a post that shows how Path uploads address book to their servers without user's consent.\r\nhttp://mclov.in/2012/02/08/path-uploads-your-entire-address-book-to-their-servers.html\r\n\r\nAttached with this rdar is the source code snippet that would show you how to do this.\r\n\r\n08-Feb-2012 08:38 AM Mugunth Kumar Kumar:\r\n'AddressBookAccessor-1.zip' and 'AddressBookAccessor.zip' were successfully uploaded"
