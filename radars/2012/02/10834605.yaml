    description: "09-Feb-2012 10:10 AM Hamish Allan:\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nIn light of the recent Path.app debacle, Apple should ask the user by way of a system dialog, let them configure per-app in settings, and provide visual confirmation of recent access to, the address book, just as they do for location services.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry accessing the address book without the user's permission.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser be presented with option of refusing permission.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser presented with no such option.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nA cynic might think that Apple don't care at all about users' privacy, and that the only reason users are asked about accessing location is because this is required by law in certain jurisdictions. I'm not a cynic, of course, but presumably the longer you leave this, the more traction this cynical opinion will gain. Sort it out!"
