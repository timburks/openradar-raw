    description: "09-Feb-2012 12:47 PM Ken Aspeslagh:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nFaceTime 1.1.1 has an incorrect algorithm for picking a microphone to use based on the camera choice.  When a camera is picked, FaceTime is switching the microphone setting to an incorrect microphone.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nConnect a secondary camera.  Pick that camera in FaceTime. You'll see the microphone has now switched away from Built-In.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nConnect a Logitech camera that has a microphone (such as the C910).  \r\nPick it as your camera in FaceTime.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nExpected results would be picking the Logitech camera would select the Logitech's mic, and picking iSight would select the Mac's Internal Mic.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nInstead, the opposite happens.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if I attach 2 external cameras so that there are 3 cameras and 3 audio devices, it becomes apparent that FaceTime is simply selecting the microphone at the same index in the list as the camera! This is totally wrong. There is no connection between the order of the devices in the list. \r\n\r\nIt should be looking at the device's linked audio device and using that if it exist. Otherwise, it should not be switching the microphone at all.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think this is new in FaceTime 1.1.1. Not totally sure about that though.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nScreen shot attached showing how switching the camera switches the microphone to the corresponding index in the microphone list."
