    description: "Dupe of http://openradar.appspot.com/10834988\r\n\r\nWhen trying to run an application on the iOS Simulator, the application hangs on launch with the following error:\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't register com.my.app.name.here with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code. This generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.Program received signal: “SIGABRT”.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun an app in the iOS simulator, crash or close the app, and then build and run again.  Frequently, the defective state will be entered.  It appears that this issue may be more frequent when the app crashes or the simulator is closed without hitting the stop button in Xcode, although I haven't proven this systematically.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app launches and runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ngdb hangs with the following error: \"Couldn't register com.my.app.name.here with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code. This generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.Program received signal: “SIGABRT”.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nQuitting the Simulator, resetting the simulator, cleaning the build, quitting Xcode — none resolve the issue. The only way to allow the app to run in the simulator after entering this state is to restart the machine."
