    description: "Summary:\r\nMail shows the wrong view controller when using the go to inbox shortcut. Instead of showing the inbox contents the mail account detail view is shown.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the mailboxes view: tap on an inbox shortcut for a mail account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n1. The contents of the inbox of that tapped account should be shown.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n1. The mail account detail view is shown.\r\n2. However, the navigation controller shows the name of the inbox. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThe inbox shortcut should take you to directly to the contents of the inbox.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTo get to your inbox, these are the steps:\r\n1. Tap the shortcut.\r\n2. Your account details are shown, with the navigation controller drilled down into your inbox.\r\n3. Tap the back button on the navigation controller. It performs the back animation, though no view controller is being switched.\r\n4. Now tap your inbox.\r\n5. We're here!\r\n\r\nAt step 4 if you tap the back button here, you'll be pushed back to the mailboxes screen with the mail accounts detail cell returning from a selected state.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have another mail account on my system, which shortcut works fine. These are both gmail accounts.\r\n\r\nOther Notes:\r\nThis is my first bug report. I hope you understand what I'm trying to get at. I didn't really know how to upload screenshots since that shows too much personal data. Besides it's kinda hard to show anyway."
