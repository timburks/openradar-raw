    description: "iOS could benefit from a new application notification for network states for suspended apps. Currently, when a device goes out of network range when an app is suspended, the app is never notified of network availability. \r\n\r\nI propose a new app delegate notification, something similar to:\r\n\r\n- (void)applicationDidReceiveNetworkAvailability:(UIApplication *)application;\r\n\r\nWhich would be triggered by the OS when a device either reconnects to a mobile network or Wi-Fi from a previously not having any network availability.\r\n\r\nApplications which sync — Reeder for iOS, for example: could update read items back to Google Reader without the user having to reopen the app and then return to a suspended state — would greatly benefit from such a delegate notification."
