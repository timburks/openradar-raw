    description: "Sample code referenced in the Developer documentation can't be opened with Xcode 4. Any project that uses the old .xcode extension is affected (Xcode 4 only opens .xcodeproj bundles.)\r\n\r\nA good example is Core Recipes. Unless you have an old Mac (or virtual machine) with Xcode 3 installed, you can't open and run the (excellent) samples."
