    description: "The Utility pane in Xcode is very useful for some types of files, and very annoying for others.\r\n\r\nFor example, I ALWAYS want to see the Utility panel when the File Type is \"Interface Builder Cocoa XIB\". But I NEVER want to see it when the File Type is \"Objective-C Source\", \"Property List XML\" or \"HTML\".\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if Xcode automatically opened and closed the Utility pane based upon the last state for the File Type being edited. If I open while editing a XIB file, it will always open. If I never open it for HTML, it stays that way."
