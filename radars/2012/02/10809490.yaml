    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSandboxed helper application can only launch applications in the parent bundle if the parent bundle resides in /Applications. Allow applications in the parent bundle to be launched regardless of location.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a sandboxed application\r\n2. Create a sandboxed helper application that uses NSWorkspace to launch the parent application on command or after a delay\r\n3. Place the parent application under /Applications\r\n4. Launch the helper application through SMLoginItemSetEnabled\r\n5. Verify that the parent application is successfully launched through the helper\r\n6. Move the parent application to a directory outside of /Applications and repeat the test\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe parent application is launched just as before.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe helper is unable to launch the parent.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWhile it may unlikely for users to move apps outside of /Applications it is possible and this limitation of behavior is unexpected."
