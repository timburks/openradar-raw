    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter creating an AVAsset from a .mov file with multiple sound tracks, AVAsset reports that it is not playable when queried via isPlayable. Despite this, the file is playable.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an AVAsset from a .mov file with multiple sound tracks (such as one created by Ecamm's Call Recorder for Skype).\r\n2) Check the AVAsset's playable property. It will report that the asset is not playable.\r\n3) Create an AVPlayerItem and AVPlayer from the AVAsset.\r\n4) Play them. They will play just fine (including both sound tracks).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAVAsset isPlayable should tell the truth.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAVAsset lies.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI don't know if this is specific to .mov files or if it matters if there is a video track as well."
