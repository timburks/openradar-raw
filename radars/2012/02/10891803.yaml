    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen iChat was configured with tabs, contacts who were offline had their avatars desaturated in the tab bar. Messages.app (in both the beta version available in 10.7, and [redacted]) has no such indication.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new conversation with a contact who is online, and one who is offline.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe two conversations should appear differently in the sidebar, because one of the contacts is not available.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe two conversations look identical.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nAs mentioned above, iChat (5.x) in 10.7.3 and before (ever since tabs were introduced) desaturated the avatar of anyone who was offline."
