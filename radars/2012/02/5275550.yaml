    description: "18-Jun-2007 10:40 AM M. Uli Kusterer:\r\nRight now, every application can get information out of the address book or the iLife library. It would be great if this could be restricted through something like access control lists, and was by default. This would make it harder for viruses to send themselves to everyone in my address book, and they couldn't use my images to \"personalize\" a message.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.zathras.de/angelweb/blog-so-when-will-it-be-more-secure.htm for my suggestions on how to do this."
