    description: "29-Feb-2012 03:13 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\niPhone 3GS, which had not been turned on for several months, had dead battery. Plugged it in and waited for full-battery indication. Turned it on. The top of the screen said\r\n\r\n    iPhone is disabled.\r\n    Try again in 6,220,861 minutes.\r\n\r\nI was unable to enter unlock code. Unable to restore from backup in iTunes, because device was locked. \r\n\r\nI was able to work around this issue by putting the iPhone in DFU mode and restoring the flash image.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUnsure exactly what it takes to reproduce, but I suspect a previous user may have tried entering unlock code which left the device in a disabled state before battery power was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI expect that under no circumstances should a disabled iPhone require the user to wait more than a few minutes to re-attempt unlock.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n6,220,861 minutes was too long to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:"
