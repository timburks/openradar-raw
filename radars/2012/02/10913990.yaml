    description: "Summary:\r\nAfter installing Xcode 4.3 from the Mac App Store, one of the steps asks to remove /Developer since now\r\nXcode 4.3 is self-contained. It's also possible to install the Command Line Tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, xcode-select isn't updated to reflect the new location at  Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer,\r\nwhich breaks tools using xcode-select to find the correct path, like /usr/bin/opendiff.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Upgrade Xcode from a previous version to Xcode 4.3\r\n- Allow /Developer to be removed\r\n- Attempt to use opendiff to trigger FileMerge from the command line:\r\n$ opendiff fileA.m fileB.m\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- FileMerge opens, showing the differences between the files.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The command errors out with:\r\n\"Error: No developer directory found at /Developer. Run /usr/bin/xcode-select to update the developer directory path.\"\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSimple enough to fix.\r\n$ sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer"
