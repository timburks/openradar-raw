    description: "18-Feb-2012 02:01 PM Hans Pinckaers:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen using Apple headphones with mic or other headphones with mic and connecting it into the headphone jack it is impossible to use the built-in microphone from your iMac, Macbook etc.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGoto system settings ->Sounds -> Input\r\nConnect an TRRS connector to your Mac. (For example the Apple headphones for iPhone)\r\n\"Internal microphone\" changes to \"External microphone\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn extra item beneath \"Internal microphone\" called \"External microphone\" which appears when connecting an headphone with an TRRS connector and gets automatically selected.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\"Internal microphone\" changes to \"External microphone\" so it's impossible to use the built-in mic when using a headphone with mic.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI fixed this for myself by using an extension cable without an TRRS male, but an TRS male.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nSometimes I want to use the built-in mic. Because it's better to hear sounds from the environment around my Mac."
