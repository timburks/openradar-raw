    description: "To be able to support different OS X versions when mandatory sandboxing is in force apps have to be able to express the following behaviors:\r\n\r\n* Don’t sandbox me if I am running on OS X upto version X.Y.Z (because Apple has not provided enough entitlements/API upto X.Y.Z to support my app)\r\n\r\n* Give me a temporary entitlement X upto OS X version X.Y.Z and beginning with X.Y.Z+1 revoke X (since Apple has given me some API so I don’t need X anymore)\r\n\r\nYou can find a more detailed discussion on why this is important here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.joergjacobsen.de/blog/2012/02/24/sandboxing-and-coping-with-different-os-x-versions/"
