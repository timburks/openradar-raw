    description: "Summary:\r\nIncreasingly, as more and more apps are installed on users' devices, and more and more of them register as document handlers, more and more of our tech support requests are along the lines of \"Why isn't your app appearing in the Open In... menu?\". The short answer is that Apple have set an arbitrary limit of 10 apps for that menu, and don't even indicate when items have been dropped. The long answer is WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY YOU HAVE DONE THAT.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall more than 10 apps which can act as handlers for a given document type, e.g. PDF.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMore than 10 apps in the \"Open In...\" menu.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n10 apps in the \"Open In...\" menu, and no indication that any are missing.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI think so... it's been like this for a while, but I don't remember it from the early betas.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
