    description: "When an NSPopover pops up, it makes its content view the first responder of its parent window. Often this is desirable, so the user can tab to any controls in the popover.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have a use-case for NSPopover as a transient label (similar to a tool-tip or expansion frame), which is displayed on mouse-over (without animation). The user can be editing a text field in the primary window and trigger the popover with a mouse movement, in which case we don't want to change the first responder.\r\n\r\nThe only way I've found to suppress the first responder changing is to override -makeFirstResponder: on the primary window. The popover makes its content view the first responder despite my returning NO from -acceptsFirstResponder. I expected NSPopover to respect that flag."
