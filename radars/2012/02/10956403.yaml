    description: "Summary:\r\nTerm searches in Xcode 4.x are painfully slow, so much so that I routinely look for the symbol of interest and option-click on it for a direct lookup instead of using the search field in the Organizer's Documentation view.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLaunch Xcode\r\nGo to the Organizer\r\nClick on Documentation\r\nAttempt to enter a simple search term, such as NSString\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch results responsively appear in the search results area below the search field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode immediately beach balls for about 12 seconds and only shows \"NS\"\r\nEntire app is locked up during the search\r\nSearch results eventually appear"
