    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using a NSWindow that has the \"content border\" properties set to the IB-specified value \"Large Bottom Border\" as a sheet, there are small white squares drawn under the rounded corners of the sheet.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse NSApp's beginSheet: method to show a sheet attached to a window. The sheet needs to have its content border set to be a \"Large Bottom Border\" in Interface Builder. See the included demo project for an example.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA gray gradient border should be displayed, with rounded corners consistent with the rest of the system's windows.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe corners of the sheet window are rounded, but under them a white square is drawn.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn 10.6.6 this is not a problem, as the corners are not rounded at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOpenRadar note: you can download my sample project here: http://c.zcr.me/G5r7."
