    description: "The mobile web interface for Radar, while more helpful than nothing, is outdated and lacks Apple aesthetic. None of the image assets have been optimized for the retina display, and the overall experience is sluggish. \r\n\r\nA native app for iOS devices would improve all of these factors. A native wrapper around the web interface would be pointless, though if a native app isn't possible, an improved web app would be good. A native app would have the benefit of screenshot access, and if it was granted special permissions by the OS, it could even fetch configuration information and crash reports for use with reports. Push notifications could also be used for changes in report status."
