    description: "Summary: A sandboxed application cannot launch other applications that have not been launched manually by the user. The issue applies to both OS X 10.7.3 and 10.8DP1 when Gate Keeper is off (i.e. set to from Anywhere).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an application A and put it somewhere (in /Applications, in the user directory, does not seem to matter) so that the full path to application is some APPLICATIONAPATH. Do not launch it manually.\r\n\r\n2. Create a sandboxed application B that contains this code:\r\n\r\n\tNSError*\terror\t= nil;\r\n\tNSRunningApplication*\tapp = [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] launchApplicationAtURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPath: APPLICATIONAPATH]\r\n\t\toptions: NSWorkspaceLaunchDefault\r\n\t\tconfiguration: nil\r\n\t\terror: &error ];\r\n\r\n3. Run the sandboxed application B.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The method should launch the application returning a valid NSRunningApplication instance and no error.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The method does not launch the application returning nil and setting error to this:\r\n\r\nError Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3584 \"The application “APPANAME” could not be launched because it is corrupt.\" UserInfo=0x7fe06a218720 {NSURL=file://localhost/APPLICATIONAPATH, NSLocalizedDescription=The application “APPANAME” could not be launched because it is corrupt., NSUnderlyingError=0x7fe06a218af0 \"The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error -10827.)\"}\r\n\r\nOnce you launch (and quit) application A manually, launching it from the sandboxed application B starts to work too.\r\n\r\nNotes: There does not seem to be any reason for this. Imagine that the user installs a suite of applications that need to launch each other, or an application that uses a helper application. Additionally the error codes do not make sense (-10827==kLSNoExecutableErr)."
