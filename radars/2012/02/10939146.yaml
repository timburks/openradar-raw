    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI like to paste passwords, but this is not always possible anymore.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Try to paste a password in, for instance, the authentication view that pops-up when clicking the ‘unlock’ icon on in the accounts system preference pane.\r\n- Try to paste a password in, for instance, the sign-in form of https://discussions.apple.com.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nIn both cases I’d expect it to place the contents of the pasteboard in the password input field.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNo cigar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI _think_ that in OS X it changed (sometime) since the introduction of Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nYou can find a more elaborate version of this issue here: https://gist.github.com/1925585. It also mentions a related issue with regards to exporting a private key from Keychain.app (bottom part). For which I filed a separate ticket: #10939294."
