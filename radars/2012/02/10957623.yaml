    description: "29-Feb-2012 05:27 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: Xcode 4.3 crashes frequently if the \"Support Wirelessly Connected Devices\" checkbox in General Preferences is enabled. Xcode will crash while sitting idle. Example crash log is attached. The crash log indicates that the crashed thread is \"Dispatch queue: Device console socket queue\".\r\n\r\nUnchecking the \"Support Wirelessly Connected Devices\" box will (apparently) prevent these crashes from occurring.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: In Xcode 4.3, enable \"Support Wirelessly Connected Devices\". It is unknown exactly what event leads to the crash, but it probably has something to do with having iPhones/iPads on the same network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Xcode should not crash while sitting idle.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Xcode crashes frequently (more than once per hour).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n29-Feb-2012 05:27 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\n'Xcode_2012-02-24-144455_moonlab.crash' was successfully uploaded"
