    description: "Summary: \r\nThe RSSI value reported in Field Test mode on the N90AP and N92AP does not match the signal strength shown to the end user. Very poor tower RSSI is represented as full or almost full signal when in fact this is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUnderlying software issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAccurate signal reporting.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe end user is being lied to by the iPhone software. This affects all versions of the software after 4.0.2 (8A400) on the N90AP and all versions on the N92AP.\r\n\r\nRegression: \r\nThe issue has regressed after 4.0.2 (8A400).
