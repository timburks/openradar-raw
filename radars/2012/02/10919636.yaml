    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are essentially two ways to load video into AVFoundation in iOS: from the disk, or from a server.\r\nIf you wanted to load it from the disk, you get fluid playback, fast-forward/reverse, live random seeking, and thumbnail generation essentially for free. However, you cannot open an encrypted file, something that requires a server serving an HTTP Live Streaming video. If you went the server route though, you loose benefits - namely fast-forward/reverse, live random seeking, and thumbnail generation, however, you can also not serve it from the device. The only workaround would be to build a server from scratch running inside the application to serve the .ts files, and essentially recreate HTTP live streaming from scratch. However, this still leaves out the same features an on-device video stream would have.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to do the above. Cry, because the implementation breaks randomly.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAn easy way to prepare encrypted content for the device directly. This can either be directly through AVFoundation (say, export as encrypted), or with a tool for the Mac (just like HTTP Live Streaming has), that would Just Work(TM) with an AVURLAsset.\r\nAlternatively, a toolkit to serve data directly to AVAsset would also be beneficial, as requests wouldn't time out (as they do when you implement a server), and could wait for the developer to provide the necessary data based on the offset and size requested.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nCurrently not possible in practice.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
