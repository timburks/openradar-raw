    description: "Summary:\r\nWe need a way to trigger instant lock on iOS devices, bypassing the \"Require Passcode\" timer.\r\n\r\nInstant locking is annoying -- I often had to unlock my device immediately after sleeping the screen. So I use a short 1-minute timer, but when I sleep an iPad and leave it on a desk briefly, it is accessible and insecure for that minute (which could be much longer with a longer timeout).\r\n\r\nCurrently the only ay to immediately force passcode requirement (aside from removing the Passcode Lock delay entirely) is to turn the iPad off. But that takes time; booting up takes more time, and the iPad is offline and unable to receive messages in the interim.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet Passcode Lock to 1 minute.\r\nPress top power button to sleep the screen.\r\nPress home.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPad does not require passcode.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThis behavior is fine, but there should be a way to quickly (not through a submenu in Settings.app) trigger the lock.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis could be handled by holding power down until swipe-to-shutdown appears and then *not* choosing to shutdown, or choosing a different \"immediate lock\" option.\r\n\r\nImmediate lock could be another button on the swipe-to-unlock screen, alongside Picture Frame. Or it could be on the double-Home screen, along with camera & music playback.\r\n\r\nOr something else..."
