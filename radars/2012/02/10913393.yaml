    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nibtool will fail to compile any XIB that uses Auto Layout when IBC_PLUGIN_SEARCH_PATHS is specified for the target. The error message given does not accurately describe the conflict or a useful recovery suggestion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Cocoa application project.\r\n2. Set IBC_PLUGIN_SEARCH_PATHS to any path, with or without plugins in that path.\r\n3. Open any XIB in the project and set \"Use Auto Layout\".\r\n4. Build the application.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nBest case - ibtool will not fail to build XIBs that have Auto Layout enabled. The presence of IB plugins should not invalidate building of XIBs using Auto Layout. In the cases where a search path is specified and no plugins are found, Auto Layout XIBs should still build successfully.\r\n\r\nWorst case - Error message explains that IB plugins cannot be present and/or cannot have plugin search paths specified.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nBuilding fails and ibtool generates the following error:\r\n\r\n\"error: The document \"<document>.xib\" could not be opened. An instance of IBNSLayoutConstraint could not be decoded. Recovery Suggestion: Ensure all plug-ins used to create this document have been loaded.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA workaround is to specify no IBC_PLUGIN_SEARCH_PATHS."
