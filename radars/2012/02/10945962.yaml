    description: "Summary:\r\nI have many UIAutomation javascript tests for my iPad app.  After upgrading to Xcode 4.3 on Lion 10.7.3, I see a dialog with the following dialog the first time I run my tests in the Instruments GUI after restarting my box:\r\n\r\nDeveloper Tools Access is trying to take control of another process. Type your password to allow this.\r\n\r\nEven if I enter my correct credentials, the test often fails with the following error:\r\n\r\nFail: Could not start script, target application is not frontmost.\r\n\r\nWhen I run my instruments test from the command line, I get the same dialog, and often the same result.  \r\n\r\nI also have a script that runs many instruments tests successively.  When I run instruments from this script, I get the following prompt in my terminal:\r\n\r\ninstruments: Instruments wants permission to analyze other processes. Type your password to allow this.\r\nName ([my-username]): \r\nPassword: \r\n\r\nFailed to authorize rights (0x20) with status: -60007.\r\n2012-02-28 10:04:19.607 instruments[60398:1203] Failed to connect to local pid watcher service: (os/kern) failure\r\n2012-02-28 16:04:20 +0000 Fail: An error occurred while trying to run the script.\r\n2012-02-28 16:04:20 +0000 Fail: The target application appears to have died\r\n\r\nI always get the above output, even when I correctly enter my password.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, instruments successfully runs my test, but I can't reproduce that reliably.  Much more often, I get one of the above dialogs or prompts, and then my tests fail.\r\n\r\nMy user is a member of the developer group, and has administrator privileges.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFrom UI:\r\nRestart system\r\nProfile iPad Application\r\nChoose UIAutomation Instrument\r\n(Authorization Dialog Sometimes appears here)\r\nAdd a test script\r\n(Authorization Dialog Sometimes appears here)\r\n\r\nFrom command line:\r\nRun the following command\r\ninstruments -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Instruments/PlugIns/AutomationInstrument.bundle/Contents/Resources/Automation.tracetemplate /Users/MyUser/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyiPadProject-btrlvecdbhutdsafmouplbiwlrra/Build/Products/MyiPadTarget-iphonesimulator/MyiPadProject.app -e UIASCRIPT MyTest.js\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo authorization dialog appears, test runs\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAuthorization dialog sometimes appears, test fails with:\r\n\"Fail: Could not start script, target application is not frontmost.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
