    description: "06-Feb-2012 02:45 AM John Hawkinson:\r\nSummary:\r\n  Applescript cannot resolve aliases when there are two volumes mounted with the same name. Unfortunately we have several machines that have some of their secondary internal disks named \"Storage,\" and when one machine mounts both volumes (e.g. via AFP), Applescripts that refer to files that are on one of those volumes break, with error -1728.\r\n  It is difficult to replace the use of file aliases with POSIX paths in scripts, so it is hard to work around this problem.\r\n  See attached zip file with two screenshots. The first, from 2:30:40 shows the failure to retrieve a list of folders from an alias with both volumes mounted. The second, from 02:21:19 shows the same script running after the first volume is unmounted -- it works fine.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Mount two volumes of the same name. This occurs if they are both AFP volumes, as well as if one is AFP and one is local.\r\n2. Select a non-empty folder in one volume in the Finder.\r\n3. Run this script (2vols.scpt):\r\ntell application \"Finder\"\r\n\tset f1 to selection\r\n\tset f2 to f1 as alias\r\n\tget POSIX path of f2\r\n\tget f2 as text\r\n\tset f3 to (every folder of f2)\r\nend tell\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIt should set f3 to a list of all folders in the selected folder.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nError -1728.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo. This exists (and was found in) 10.6.8.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Feb-2012 02:45 AM John Hawkinson:\r\n'2vols.zip' was successfully uploaded"
