    description: "Radar not being searchable makes it hard for users to assess if the issue they're filing a bug on is known. If a user could search for a bug and file their bug as a dupe of an existing bugs, getting a lot of dupes on common issues would be much much easier. A lot of time producing sample code would also be saved.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThis is a follow up to Bug ID# 10956083.
