    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen opening a XIB file which contains a text view with automatic spelling correction disabled, the flag is turned on without notice. This also happens when opening  project file containing such a XIB.\r\n\r\nIf the deployment target is set to Mac OS X 10.5 or earlier, this then generates a warning since automatic spelling correction is not available prior to Mac OS X 10.6.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a new Cocoa Application project (without ARC).\r\n* Set the Deployment Target to 10.5.\r\n* Open MainMenu.xib.\r\n* In the File inspector, set the deployment version to 10.5. (Secondary bug: this defaults to the project’s SDK instead of its deployment target.)\r\n* Add a text view to the window provided in the xib.\r\n* Turn of the Automatic Spelling Correction check box under Linguistics in the Attributes inspector.\r\n* Save the xib and build. There should be no diagnostics.\r\n* Select main.m so that the xib file is no longer open in Xcode.\r\n* Close the project.\r\n* Reopen the project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n* Nothing of interest.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n* One or two warnings appear. The one that always appears complains is “Automatic Spelling Correction on Mac OS X versions prior to 10.6 (This property is ignored)”. The other one, which comes and goes, is “Text Replacement on Mac OS X versions prior to 10.6 (This property is ignored)”.\r\n* Upon inspecting the xib in Xcode, the Automatic Spelling Correction flag is now set for the text view. The file is not altered, but upon saving the NSFlags field is modified. (Secondary bug 2: this can be detected with diff, but not FileMerge, because FileMerge by default uses a filter which discards this flag.)\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nUnknown."
