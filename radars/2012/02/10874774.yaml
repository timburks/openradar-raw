    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen I have a Westinghouse 1080p DVI monitor plugged in to my Mac Pro (secondary to my mini-displayport 27\" display) but switched off the system experiences slowness for ~200ms every 3 seconds. During this time the mouse stops moving smoothly and the computer is generally unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Connect Apple Cinema Display to mini-Display Port.\r\n2. Connect other display to the DVI port.\r\n3. Turn off the secondary (DVI) display with its built in power button.\r\n4. Observe SystemUIServer CPU usage spike and mouse stutter.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nTurning off a display should not cause a performance issue.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMouse jumps and UI lag is common on a constant basis when a display is connected but disabled.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis has been present since Snow Leopard. I believe it also happens from the login screen."
