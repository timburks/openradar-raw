    description: "Summary:\r\nWith iPhone Configuration Utility, we can install or uninstall an application on an iPhone / iPad or iPod touch.\r\nBut we can't update an application (with the same version, or an updated version).\r\nIf we uninstall and install it again, we lose application data!\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nGet an in house application.\r\nInstall version 1.0. with iPhone Configuration Utility.\r\nOpen it and set something to save in preferences.\r\nClose it.\r\nUninstall the app with iPhone Configuration Utility.\r\nInstall version 1.0.1 with iPhone Configuration Utility.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf we had an update option in iPhone Configuration Utility, we'll see updated preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt looks as a fresh new install. All preferences are lost.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNA\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt's can compare the application version, but in fact, it should update any application version with the new one in iPhone Configuration Utility (if the app ID is the same). iTunes and Xcode can do this, why iPhone Configuration Utility can't?"
