    description: "28-Feb-2012 10:44 PM Nathaniel Irons:\r\nSummary: Prior to Xcode 4.3, when exporting an archived iOS build for ad-hoc distribution, there was an option not to re-sign the resulting .ipa file. This allowed us to reliably keep the signing identity used for a particular build under version control.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 4.3, one is forced to select a signing identity and re-sign the app after it has already been signed once at build time. This morning, Xcode defaulted to a development profile instead of the intended distribution profile, I missed it, and I wasted well over an hour figuring out why I was suddenly getting \"signed with invalid entitlements\" installation failures.\r\n\r\nRemoving the option not to re-sign introduces an additional point of failure into a process that is complicated enough already.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, Xcode should default to re-signing with the same signing identity used to create the original build, and not to the first profile whose bundle ID matches."
