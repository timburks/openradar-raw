    description: "29-Feb-2012 12:10 PM Doug Russell:\r\nSummary: Several times a day, without any connecting events, my code stops highlighting and my code sense stops offering completions. If I delete derived data it usually starts working again, but sometimes I have to restart xcode.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n24-Apr-2012 03:45 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nEngineering has provided the following information:\r\n\r\nWe believe this issue has been addressed in the latest Xcode 4.3.2 release.  Please verify with this release, and update your bug report with the results.  \r\n\r\nXcode 4.3.2\r\nBuild: 4E2002 (for Lion)\r\nPosted Date:  March 22, 2012\r\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12\r\n\r\n24-Apr-2012 03:51 PM Doug Russell:\r\nThis is absolutely still happening in xcode 4.3.2. \r\n\r\nI've been running xcode with clang logging on and it's constantly barfing out errors that aren't causing any warnings in the project, don't prevent me from building but do cause indexing to fail.\r\n\r\nThe mismatch between what causes a warning or error in the compiler and what causes indexing to fail makes figuring out what is wrong incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\n(logging: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2138047/xcode-code-loses-syntax-coloring)"
