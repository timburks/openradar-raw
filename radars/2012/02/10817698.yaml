    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAdd reset/reboot option to the AppleTV on-screen menus.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Look through all the settings menus on the AppleTV looking for Reboot option\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n1. Find menu for rebooting the device\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n1. Not found\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nI'm aware of the Menu and Down button hold for resetting the device. Although I almost always have to look that up. Additionally, I've stored the aluminum remote in favor of the iOS remote app, so I don't have quick access to the remote to reboot the device. I would expect to find this option on the on-screen menus for quick access while sitting on my couch."
