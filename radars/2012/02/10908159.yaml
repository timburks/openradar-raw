    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThere are entitlements for accessing the Music, Pictures, and Movies folders; however, for users who store their media libraries from iTunes and iPhoto outside of those designated folders (on external volumes or network shares), these entitlements are useless. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nMedia library entitlement(s) that would allow read-only (or optionally read-write access) to all files in the iLife media libraries. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nWe need to use temporary entitlements to gain access to root ( / ) which will potentially be rejected by App Store reviewers, or create app-scoped bookmarks for every single media file. Creating app-scoped bookmarks is a viable solution when all of the files are neatly grouped into a single parent folder, but this is not always the case (specifically with iTunes media). In the situation that the files are spread out across more than one common parent folder, NSOpenPanel must be presented every time, which is a UX nightmare (especially for users with large libraries).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
