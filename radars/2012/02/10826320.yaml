    description: "08-Feb-2012 10:47 AM Ullrich Schäfer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAVAudioRecorder leaves a corrupted file when being interrupted while the app is in background.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nI've got an AVAudioRecorder I create like this:\r\nint numberOfChannels = [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] currentHardwareInputNumberOfChannels];\r\nrecorder = [[AVAudioRecorder alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:self.recordingFilePath]\r\n                                       settings:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:\r\n                                                 [NSNumber numberWithFloat:44100.0], AVSampleRateKey,\r\n                                                 [NSNumber numberWithInt:kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC], AVFormatIDKey,\r\n                                                 [NSNumber numberWithInt:numberOfChannels], AVNumberOfChannelsKey,\r\n                                                 [NSNumber numberWithInt:AVAudioQualityHigh], AVEncoderAudioQualityKey,\r\n                                                 nil]\r\n                                          error:&error];\r\nrecorder.delegate = self;\r\n\r\n \r\nI also implemented the interrupt delegate callbacks from AVAudioRecorderDelegate which get called correctly.\r\n \r\nWhen I now start recording, put the app in background and (for example) open the camera app in video mode the recording is interrupted. In the delegate I see that the recoder -isRecording property is NO.\r\nUnfortunetly the resulting file is corrupted and can't be played. Neither with AVAudioPlayer, nor in Quicktime or VLC on the Mac. I also tried calling an additional [recorder stop] to close the file, but this didn't have any effect (the recorder appears to be already stoped anyhow).\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe recorder stops but the file is still playable.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nA file that seems to not have the header written correctly (see enclosures).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI don't remember having that problem in iOS pre 5.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDiscussion about the issue: https://devforums.apple.com/message/583855\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n08-Feb-2012 10:47 AM Ullrich Schäfer:\r\n'broken recording.m4a' and 'iMac.spx' were successfully uploaded"
