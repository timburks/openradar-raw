    description: "29-Feb-2012 03:55 PM Daniel Pasco:\r\nSummary:\r\nUITableview provides built-in support for animated insertion, removal, and reordering of its sections and rows. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell externally when an animation has completed or if it has been interrupted. In a lot of applications, particularly in ones in which the table presents data effected by network traffic, it can be extraordinarily difficult to tell when one event is complete and another may begin. This is particularly important when events are being stored in a serial queue for orderly operation.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new action will kill any animation that is currently running, so pacing the events carefully is an important part of providing a smooth, consistent user experience.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet up a table animation.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNSNotification, delegate call back, or something provides notification to interested listeners that the animation has completed or been interrupted.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such telemetry available.\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
