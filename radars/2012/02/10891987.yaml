    description: "Summary:\r\nThere's an annoying disconnect between navigating in Finder, and navigating in a Open or Save dialog. Quite often, I have already navigated in Finder to the place that I currently want to save to from an open application. Prior to 10.8, there's a rather hidden but tremendously shortcut where you can drag a folder proxy icon (or any Finder item, really) to the Save or Open dialog, and it will navigate to that file or folder.\r\n\r\nIn 10.8, that behavior is changed to the Windows behavior, where doing this will actually *move the file you dragged to it to the location that the Open or Save dialog is currently navigated to*.\r\n\r\nPlease either restore the previous behavior (I have never felt the need to do reorganizations in my file system from an Open or Save dialog), or find another way to navigate an Open or Save dialog to the same location as a file or folder reference or window I already have, or I will be a very, very, very sad panda :( I use this feature tens of times every day.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a folder in Finder where you want to save a document\r\n1. Open TextEdit\r\n2. Create document\r\n3. Save\r\n4. Drag the folder proxy icon from the window in Finder to the save dialog\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n5. TextEdit's save dialog navigates to the folder of the proxy icon I just dragged to it\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n5. I move whatever folder I just dragged to the Documents folder\r\n6. Sad panda :(\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis behavior has changed from 10.7.3 (and since all time X before then)"
