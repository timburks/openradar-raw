    description: "Summary:\r\nHolding down shift while moving model nodes using the arrow keys on your keyboard should move them by a 10x (or at least n-times with n > 1) bigger distance delta then without shift.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSelect model node in Xcode's model editor (in node mode, not table mode, obviously) and move it by hitting arrow key once with and once without shift key pressed.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\narrow key: move 1 step\r\nshift + arrow key: move 1 x n steps\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\narrow key: move 1 x n steps\r\nshift + arrow key: move 1 step\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nXcode is the only app I've ever used that gets this backwards. Annoying."
