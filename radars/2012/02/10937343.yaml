    description: "27-Feb-2012 07:55 AM Doug Russell:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nAccessibility scroll walks the view hierarchy looking for a view that responds that it can handle a scrolling event in much the same way that hit testing walks the responder chain looking a view that can handle a touch, but unlike responder chain events, UIViewControllers are not included.\r\n\r\nIf views, that are attached to view controllers, could be included in the hierarchy, then a lot of subclassing of builtin controls, like UITableView and UITableViewController could be avoided when all that is needed is slightly modified scrolling behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nA sample project with a contrived example of how accessibilityScroll: could be included in UIViewController and how it could be made useful.\r\n\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1z2t1h370D2D1h1R2a2O"
