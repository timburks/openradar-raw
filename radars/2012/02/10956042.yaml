    description: Most of the bugs filed by third party developers are marked as duplicates of existing bugs (as this report likely will), and after they have been categorized as such, we receive no further feedback. For bugs that are time-consuming to test, it becomes difficult to know when or if a bug has been fixed, because we are not notified when the original bug is closed. I understand that giving us access to the original bug would e problematic due to non-disclosure agreements, but I fail to see why notifying us when the original bug report has been closed would cause problems.
