    description: "Summary:\r\nMessages’ unified chat window resizes itself vertically after sending a message that was long enough to cause the text entry view to grow vertically.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Type a long message to someone in the text entry field, spanning multiple lines, and thus causing the text entry field to grow vertically. Alternatively, drag a picture into the text entry field that is small enough to be sent inline but taller than the text entry field.\r\n2. Send it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expected the window to stay the same size, and the text entry field to resume its old size.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nInstead, the text entry field resumed its old size while simultaneously causing the window to shrink vertically by the difference in sizing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\niChat did not have this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI really like Messages :)\r\n\r\nI’ve attached a zip archive containing two screenshots, one with me typing a really long message, and one just after sending it. They are of approximately the same region of the screen. In particular, in the first one, the chat window’s bottom is flush against the lower edge of my screen (modulo the 4px gap for the Dock), and in the second one it’s been resized upwards by a line or two."
