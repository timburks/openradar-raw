    description: "Summary:\r\nExternal developers should have the ability to search tickets opened by other external developers. We have, by definition, all agreed to our various NDAs and the radar infrastructure has the built-in permissions capability to separate out reports filed by people inside and outside of Apple. There is no risk of exposing proprietary information to the external development community.\r\n\r\nThis would be very helpful in assisting developers in getting a sense of how widespread the issue is, plus the ability to hunt for workarounds posted by DTS to individual tickets, as well as the ability to see if there is sample code available addressing the issue (this would be invaluable in helping steer DTS towards reports with enough information to help them resolve the issue).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nLog onto bug report.apple.com with a valid developer account.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSearch field\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo search field"
