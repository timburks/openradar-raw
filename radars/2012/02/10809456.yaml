    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen the user drags an application bundle to the trash that contains running login items registered with SMLoginItemSetEnabled, terminate those login items.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start an application that registers a background login item through SMLoginItemSetEnabled\r\n2. Enable the login item\r\n3. Quit the parent application\r\n4. Drag the parent application to the trash\r\n5. Attempt to empty the trash\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe application is successfully removed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe application is only partially removed because the background login item is still running.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to prevent dragging the parent application to the trash if it has active login items, displaying a message to the user much like when an attempt is made to drag the parent application the trash while running."
