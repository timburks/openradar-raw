    description: "20-Feb-2012 07:25 PM Bernd Lörwald:\r\nSummary: dataaccessd crashes after ten seconds, then invokes the crash reporter and gets restarted, causing high CPU load and therefore battery drain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: While the actual step causing the problem is unknown to me, it basically is\r\n1. Take freshly resetted iPhone.\r\n2. Add iCloud / some other account.\r\n3. Enable push mode and 15 minute checks.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: All data gets synced, contacts, calendar, reading list etc is available and pushed.\r\n\r\nActual Results: dataaccessd crashes after a short interval, causing heavy CPU load (about 80%) during that time, then crashes. launchd restarts the daemon after the crash has been logged. Repeat.\r\n\r\nRegression: Disabling mail / calendar accounts or setting it to manual refresh stops dataaccessd from continuously crashing.\r\n\r\nNotes: This also causes some parts of data not getting synced, like reading list in Safari.\r\n\r\nThe zip contains a log of 30 minutes after a restart of the iPhone showing several crashes with slightly different output before crashing, caused by playing around with account settings in order to find the reason for crashing. Also, calaccessd crashes some times.\r\n\r\nThis crashing loop results in heavy battery drain with down to 5 hours to empty while lying around after being fully charged and not used at all.\r\n\r\nThis might already be fixed in 5.1, as this has not been tested with beta versions in order to be possible to reproduce and give additional information upon request.\r\n\r\n20-Feb-2012 07:25 PM Bernd Lörwald:\r\n'dataaccessdcrashes.zip' was successfully uploaded"
