    description: "Summary:\r\nI attempted to download the new version of Xcode (4.3) from the Mac App Store. After clicking Install and entering my Apple ID password, an activity indicator briefly appeared... then nothing happened.\r\n\r\nI attempted downloading many more times, all with the same result. I relaunched the MAS app. I rebooted my computer. I repaired disk permissions. I deleted the existing Xcode 4.3 beta 3. I checked my console log and found this:\r\n\r\n\"2/17/12 1:41:22.462 AM com.apple.SecurityServer: Failed to authorize right 'system.install.apple-software' by client '/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/installd' [321] for authorization created by '/Applications/App Store.app' [162]\r\n2/17/12 1:41:22.483 AM com.apple.SecurityServer: Failed to authorize right 'system.install.software' by client '/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/installd' [321] for authorization created by '/Applications/App Store.app' [162]\"\r\n\r\nThe mystery deepened. Online searches failed to produce anything useful. I began to contemplate a future without Xcode.\r\n\r\nFinally, an online search suggested that perhaps it was paused in Launchpad. Nonsense, I thought. I haven't used the thing since I first upgraded to Lion. It's not in my Dock, and the keyboard shortcut is disabled.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, there it was, a gray Xcode icon in Launchpad with the text \"Paused\" underneath. I clicked it and the download whirred to life.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to download an application while paused.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nMac App Store automatically unpauses the download.\r\nOr at least shows an alert stating \"The download is paused, do something about it\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSilent failure\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDid not occur in a pre-Lion, pre-Xcode 4, pre-Mac App Store universe.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI love you guys."
