    description: "Summary: Attempting to run an iOS app in the simulator simply fails. Xcode acts as if it's working, but nothing happens.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Hit Command-R to run an iOS app in the simulator. Usually works. Sometimes (approx every 15 runs) nothing happens.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Simulator will come to the front. App will run in the simulator.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Xcode behaves as if the app is running in the simulator, but it never comes to the front and the app never launches. Stop button in Xcode does nothing. If I quit the simulator Xcode still thinks the app is running. Stop button still does nothing. I try to quit Xcode, and it asks if it can stop tasks. I click OK, but nothing happens. Xcode doesn't quit. Force quit is required.\r\n\r\nRegression: Similar to the Boot Strap problem (reported in the console) I was having with 4.2.1, but there is no message in the console anymore.\r\n\r\nNotes: This seriously affects my ability to write iOS apps that surprise and delight."
