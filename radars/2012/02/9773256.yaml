    description: "A new dragging style is being introduced in 10.7 for tables. When you select a few rows and drag, the drag image comes from the cells in the dragged column. The drag image is also different depending where along the row you drag (which column you happen to be on).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't make sense to me. The typical use for an NSTableView is a list of files, with some kind of identity column (icon + name), and other columns displaying supplemental information (size, dates, etc.). With the new behavior, dragging the size column would drag the item's size text, and dragging from the date would drag the date text. But in all these cases the real intention is to drag the row's identity; that is, the file itself.\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior (10.6) of having the drag image be the entire row is more useful, in my opinion."
