    description: "26-Feb-2012 09:32 AM Christopher Schmidt:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nSafari appears to be unable to use GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication for URLs that contain a CNAME instead of an A-record. (A post was made about this in ~2010 at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2414517.) \r\n\r\nThis behavior is not new: so far as I can tell, this has always been the case (I have never been able to authenticate via Safari to CNAME-based Kerberos authenticated services using Kerberos), so this is not a regression of any particular kind.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttp://statusmeldungen.uni-paderborn.de contains the hostname statusmeldungen.uni-paderborn.de which is just a CNAME to haldus.uni-paderborn.de.\r\n\r\nSo the browser must request the service ticket HTTP/haldus.uni-paderborn.de\r\n\r\nFirefox does this, but Safari tries to fetch HTTP/statusmeldungen.uni-paderborn.de which does not exist, so it fails.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConfigure kerberos authentication on a webserver which is served under a CNAME. Once this is done, visit the CNAME host in Safari. Observe that authentication fails (or falls back to non-Negotiate auth).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nSafari requests a ticket for the underlying target of the CNAME, and authentication succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nSafari requests a ticket for the CNAME, which does not have a service ticket, and authentication fails.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis behavior differs from IE, Firefox, and Chrome. (Chrome does have a command line option to duplicate the Safari behavior -- -â€“disable-auth-negotiate-cname-lookup -- but it's clearly only a debugging flag, not something that is enabled by default.)"
