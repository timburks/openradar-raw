    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode fails with fairly unclear error message while checking for ability to perform code signing: \"Code Sign error: The identity 'iPhone Distribution: XXX' doesn't match any identity in any profile\". However code signing certificate exists in the default keychain along with private key associated with the certificate.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Configure build machine with valid code signing certificate and private key. But you should not add any provisioning profiles to the machine.\r\n2. Perform project build (e.g. xcodebuild build)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nXcode should fail with clear error message: Code signing identity 'iPhone Distribution: XXX' exists but no provisioning profile found.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode fails with obscure error message: \"Code Sign error: The identity 'iPhone Distribution: XXX' doesn't match any identity in any profile\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis issue appears while I configure new build machine manually. It's pretty easy to forget some of the required steps in the configuration process and it will be very helpful if Xcode tells me exactly what is wrong with code signing. I've spent a lot of time until I find the root of this issue."
