    description: "Summary:\r\nThe sticky keys functionality offered by universal access implements a \"key lock\" - that is, if I press a meta key twice, that key will remain activated until the meta key is pressed again (analogous to the caps lock key). While this feature will be useful for some, it makes sticky keys very unpredictable for those who do not need the feature. There is however no ability to turn this \"key lock\" functionality off.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTurn on Sticky Keys in Preferences->Universal Access->Keyboard\r\nPress a meta key twice. Note how the key is \"locked on\" until you press the meta key again.\r\nNote there is no option in the Preferences, nor in the terminal default program, to turn off this \"key lock\" functionality.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIn the Preferences application there is a check box that allows the \"key lock\" feature to be disabled.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo such check box exists.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI'm trying to avoid RSI from emacs with sticky keys, but can't because of the inability to turn off the \"key lock\" feature."
