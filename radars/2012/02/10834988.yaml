    description: "When trying to run an application on the iOS Simulator, it hangs on opening with the following error:\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't register com.my.app.name.here with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code. This generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.Program received signal: “SIGABRT”.\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun an app in the iPhone 4.3 or 5.0 simulator, stop it at a breakpoint in gdb, then either a) build and run again or b) press the home button, quit the simulator and then build and run. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe app launches and runs.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\ngdb hangs with the following error: \"Couldn't register com.my.app.name.here with the bootstrap server. Error: unknown error code. This generally means that another instance of this process was already running or is hung in the debugger.Program received signal: “SIGABRT”.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nQuitting the Simulator, clearing Derived Data, quitting Xcode... none of this resolves the issue. The only way to get the simulator working again is to either a) restart the machine or b) login as another administrator and kill my developer user's launchd process. This is very disruptive and happens frequently on the latest build, especially when switching between simulators.\r\n\r\nIt is well-documented here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/788277/iphone-strange-error-when-testing-on-simulator"
