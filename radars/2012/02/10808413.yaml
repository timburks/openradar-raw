    description: "03-Feb-2012 07:05 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nCreate an alert panel with NSRunCriticalAlertPanel(), [[NSAlert alloc] init], etc., and provide it with long informative text (more than can fit on-screen). When the alert is shown, the text is clipped, but the buttons are positioned below the screen. On a single-display system, the buttons are completely inaccessible.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: The informative text should be clipped enough for the alert panel to be completely contained by the screen's visibleFrame.\r\n\r\nThe informative text can often come from NSErrors which bubble out of arbitrary methods, which don't / shouldn't need to know the details of the final error presentation."
