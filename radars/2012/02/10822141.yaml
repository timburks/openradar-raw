    description: "Summary:\r\nAs of Xcode 4.1, the Core Data model editor does not save the Min Length setting for attributes (Utilities panel). This setting is lost when the project is closed and reopened.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a new iOS project using Core Data. Add a new entity to the model, and a string field (the problem also affects NSNumber fields). Open the Utilities panel, click on the attribute, and in the Validation section enter a min length or value. Save your project. Open it again, and check the value you have set: It has not been saved. \r\n\r\nNote that this bug does not affect the max length / value setting.\r\n\r\nI created a sample project for this issue: Check out the workspace at git://github.com/defagos/radars.git, and open the xcdatamodel-xcode4 project. \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe minimum length / value validation constraint of a Core Data model object attribute is saved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe minimum length / value validation constraint of a Core Data model object attribute is lost when the project is closed\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nSince Xcode 4.1\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-"
