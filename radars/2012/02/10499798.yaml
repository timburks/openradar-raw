    description: "29-Nov-2011 02:58 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\n'PopoverWindowBug.zip' and 'Pop.png' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Nov-2011 02:58 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nSee attached Xcode project.\r\n\r\nWhen detaching a popover into its own window, if the new window uses autolayout, the origin of the window's contentView is set to (0, -8), clipping the content and leaving an empty area below the titlebar. This offset remains when resizing the window. Expected behavior: The content view is where it would be, had the window been sent -orderFront: or something.\r\n\r\nAfter it has been detached, when popping up again the popover displays with the pre-detach style instead of the toothed callout style. (With dragging, it's possible to return the popover to its initial state.) Expected behavior: The popover appears with its initial style, not dependant on whether it was detached in a previous incarnation."
