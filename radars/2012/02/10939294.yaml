    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nThe password generator that you can open while exporting a private key in Keychain.app does not allow you to copy the generated password. This is especially unpleasant because the password generator panel is hidden when Keychain.app de-activates because of opening an app like TextEdit (in which you wanted to type the password over).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Open Keychain.app.\r\n- Export a private key (Command-Shift-E).\r\n- When prompted for a password, open the password generator.\r\n- Try to copy the generated password.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe generated password to be on the pasteboard and both the password field and verification field to be filled in.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI _think_ that in it changed (sometime) since the introduction of Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is part of a user-experience which isn’t made any more pleasant by the fact that you also can’t paste the password and thus you have to type it in again in the verification input field. That’s discussed in another ticket: #10939146."
