    description: "Summary:\r\nThere are complaints that, when a bug is filed as a duplicate, it is closed and any discovered workarounds only make it to the original poster.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it is critical that DTS provide the workaround to each filed report so that developers struggling with the issue aren't left in the dark.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFile a bug.\r\nWatch bug get closed as a dupe.\r\n*crickets*\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nFile a bug.\r\nWatch bug get closed as a dupe.\r\nWorkaround gets posted to report once discovered, email with additional annotation from DTS shows up in Mail.app for the developer filing it.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n*crickets*\r\n\r\nNote: this is vital as, even the person who got the feedback is apparently forbidden by NDA to post it anywhere publicly."
