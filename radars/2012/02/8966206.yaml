    description: "07-Feb-2011 10:58 AM Branton Homer:\r\nSummary:\r\nDevelopers are encouraged to always used the latest Base SDK, and then use the Deployment Target setting to specify the earliest OS on which the built product should run. Developers are then responsible conditionally call APIs introduced after the Deployment Target OS only when available. However, it is difficult to ensure that all conditionally available APIs have been properly handled.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a compiler option that would flag all use of APIs later than the Deployment Target. This could enable the developer to check that each use of those APIs had been handled correctly. Static analysis tools that automatically flagged unchecked usages would be nice too, as would segregating the Code Sense completion list by availability, but a simple compiler option would be a start.\r\n\r\nNow that the Xcode 4 GM seed only includes the 10.6 SDK, this is more important for developers who need to support 10.5 users.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nTry to find a supported way to detect use of APIs defined after the deployment target.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou try, and succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou try, and fail.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNever available, as far as I'm aware.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI did find that adding \"#define MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_5\" to the very beginning of the prefix header will cause at least some of these APIs to be flagged with either warnings or errors. However, if I try to set it to 10.4, some of the headers in the 10.6 SDK simply fail to compile, so this is not a general workaround."
