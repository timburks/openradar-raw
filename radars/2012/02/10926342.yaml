Press the home button to put the app in background\r\n5. bring the app back by pressing the app icon.\r\n6. Press Cancel on the modal.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe first tab should show it self.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nBlank Screen.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is working fine in ios prior to 5.0\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease notice that I'm using an undocumented api to trigger the memory warning. You can reproduce this bug exactly the same if you delete the undocumented api call and trigger a memory warning using the simulator.\r\n\r\n24-Feb-2012 03:52 PM Yosi Taguri:\r\n'tabbed.zip' was successfully uploaded"
