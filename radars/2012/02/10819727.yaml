    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen testing different localizations in the simulator, sometimes I forget to first Stop the debug session in Xcode and change the language in the Simulator directly. Then in a lot of cases, the app continues to run as a zombie process (\"ps\" displays it in parantheses) and there's no way to start a new debug session. I have to reboot the machine to fix this.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- Start a debug session on the Simulator in Xcode.\r\n- Switch the system language in the Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- The app should be terminated/killed\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- The app continues to run as a zombie process that can't be killed, even with a SIGKILL."
