When that predicate is evaluated, the regex parser thingy throws chow. This is the worst of both worlds, since we can create a predicate and store it (say, in a smart folder), but that will crash when evaluated. But I've already saved by this point, so re-launching will bring back the killer predicate.\r\n\r\n[[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@\"self MATCHES '^[]*'\"] evaluateWithObject:@\"hi\"];\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason '*** Can't do regex matching,\r\nreason: Can't open pattern U_REGEX_MISSING_CLOSE_BRACKET (string hi,\r\npattern ^[]*, case 1, canon 2)'\r\n\r\n\r\n31-Aug-2011 02:54 PM Jonathon Mah:\r\nAlso MATCHES \"\\0\" causes untimely death."
