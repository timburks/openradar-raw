    description: "Summary:\r\nXcode no longer adds copied .m files to your target if they're accompanied by any other type of file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create a new Xcode project\r\n2) Drag a .m file into the Project navigator. Xcode should offer to copy it, and pre-check the project's only target for inclusion\r\n3) Cancel\r\n4) Drag a .h and .m file into the Project navigator. Xcode no longer has the target checked\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nExpect .m files to be added to my target as they always have, as is intuitive.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nRead a ton of linker errors\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nXcode 4.3 (4E109)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis used to work; I presume some cleverness was inserted to bail as soon as non-compilable files are found in the drag promise. It should really just ignore the n/a files and offer to add the rest to the target."
