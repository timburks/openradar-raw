This is no longer the behavior.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open three or more non-fullscreen applications.\r\n2. In a running application use Command-H to hide it.\r\n3. Press Command-Tab\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe hidden application should be listed after all the running \"visible\" applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe newly hidden application is the first in the Command-Tab list after the active application and is currently selected.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis change in behavior is annoying as the hidden application is now \"in the way.\" If I wanted it in the way, I would not have hidden it.\r\n\r\n30-Jan-2012 12:28 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThank you for filing this bug report.\r\n\r\nWe are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check the seed notes and release notes for any updates that might affect this issue.
