    description: "29-Feb-2012 06:02 PM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: When using Xcode's Organizer window's Documentation search box, the results will contain duplicate entries, and entries that are not relevant to the platform the developer is targeting. It would be nice if the user could disable searches for irrelevant documentation, or if the search used contextual information to filter the search results.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn Documentation search box, enter \"NSString\". The results returned will include the NSString page from iOS 5.0 Library and the NSString page from Mac OS X 10.7 Core Library. These two pages are practically identical.\r\n\r\nThen, in the search box, enter \"drawRect\". Results contain information relevant to iOS (UIView) and for OS X (NSView, NSRulerMarker, ScreenSaverView). User has to wade through these to figure out which ones are important.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:There should be a preference to disable searching through irrelevant documentation (e.g., an iOS-only developer should be able to hide the OS X docs), or Xcode should be able to pick the most relevant results (e.g., if user has an iOS project open, then IOS docs should appear exclusively, or at the top of the list).\r\n\r\nActual Results: User gets too much information.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
