    description: 'A delegate registered to receive callbacks from an NSNetSerivce instance will receive a -netService:didUpdateTXTRecordData: call, but asking the instance for its TXTRecordData inside that method returns old data. The name of the delegate method including "didUpdate..." implies that this is called after the net service''s data has changed (and so the passed data parameter should be redundant).'
