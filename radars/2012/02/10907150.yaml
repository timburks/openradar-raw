    description: "Summary:\r\nIf a Cocoa app is an agent (LSUIElement set to YES) and uses full screen window, the only way to exit the window from full screen is to press escape. The menu bar does not drop down when you move your cursor to the top of the screen. Also, the apps icon does not appear in mission control.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate a Cocoa app in Xcode, set LSUIElement to YES in Info.plist. Make the main window a Primary Window in the full screen drop down.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe menu bar appears when you move your cursor to the top of the screen when the window is full screen. And the apps icon should appear over in Mission Control\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNothing happens. The user must press escape to exit full screen. No icon appears over the app's space in Mission Control."
