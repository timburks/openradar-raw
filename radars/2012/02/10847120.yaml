    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nHaving difficulty getting \"psychonauts\", a 4.47 gig game.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Purchase Psychonauts\r\n2) wait 3 and a half hours for it to download\r\n3) MAS installs product\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI get a Psychonauts in /Applications to wile away a cold, snowy wintery Friday night with bizarro game delight.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nMy CPU revs for 20 minutes, then I get an error \"could not extract file from jsnfjnrun2fsdfm.pkg\r\n\r\nSad Panda.  Guess I'll be watching my Maude DVDs again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nTried again:  Started download again.  About an hour into it, I figured \"This whole thing feels like Windows.  I better reboot in case there's a stale lockfile or something lying around\".  Paused the download in MAS.  Rebooted.  Started up MAS.  The Button said \"install\" instead of \"unpause\".  So I clicked \"install\" in the vain hope it would try to install the previous download and succeed.  No such luck.  It jettisoned the amount it already downloaded and started over again.  If it works this time, it''ll be close to 10 gigs of downloading.  I'm glad I'm not on a metered or rate-limited connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'd Like To See:\r\n\r\n- Better error reporting, so I could have a chance of fixing something\r\n- Easier access to the downloaded pkg so I could try using other tools or techniques to install something\r\n- Not jettisoning half a download if you pause, then reboot during a download"
