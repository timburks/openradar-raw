    description: As a third party developer, I am often encouraged to file Radars about problems that I have. I try to do so, but there are many times that I don't due to the high expectations placed on our bug reports. We are told to have researched the problem, to provide sample code, and to document as much about the problem as possible. We are busy. We have jobs too. It shouldn't be my job to spend a significant amount of time researching and reproducing a bug in your software. I am happy to report bugs, but I would appreciate it if the standard set for us was lower so that we could file bugs and get back to work.
