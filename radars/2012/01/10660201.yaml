    description: "Summary:\r\nIt seems that Xcode's debugger console/terminal has an echo bug with programs that use libreadline/libedit. When enabled, every character I type gets immediately echoed by the console so it looks like I typed it twice (even though I didn't). If I paste a phrase in the console, the whole phrase gets echoed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAttached is an Xcode project I made for Lua which has a command line tool. I just enabled it to compile with readline support.\r\nBuild and run the 'lua' target (the command line tool, not the library).\r\nWhen the program is running through the debugger In the Xcode, in the debugger console, try two things:\r\nFirst type:\r\nprint(\"Hello World\");\r\n(you may hit enter after to submit it)\r\nYou will see each character echoed as you type it. Notice the command succeeds meaning the echo characters at least didn't get into the input stream.\r\n\r\nSecond copy and paste into the console:\r\nprint(\"Hello World\");\r\nYou will see it echoed like:\r\nprint(\"Hello World\");print(\"Hello World\");\r\n\r\nI do notice that if you omit the semicolon in the copy/paste case (but not the type in manually) and hit enter, it causes some kind of error in the interpreter. That shouldn't happen because semi-colons are optional in Lua, so I think the input stream is not quite right in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo echoed characters.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEchoed characters.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nDon't know, but probably an Xcode 4 introduction.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
