    description: "Summary:\r\nAs there exist no private/protected methods in Objective-C the common practice is to use class extensions. Not optimal, but good enough I guess. It then however would be great and just logical to include an empty class extension in the \".m\" file by default.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nCreate Objective-C class file from inside Xcode.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\n    //Foo.m\r\n    #import \"Foo.h\"\r\n    \r\n    @interface Foo ()\r\n    \r\n    @end\r\n    \r\n    @implementation Foo\r\n    \r\n    @end\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n    //Foo.m\r\n    #import \"Foo.h\"\r\n    \r\n    @implementation Foo\r\n    \r\n    @end"
