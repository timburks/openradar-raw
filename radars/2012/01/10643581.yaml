    description: "Summary:\r\nSalt Lake / Utah counties are a hotbed of engineering talent. If you take a look at many national \"Top 10\" lists for technology sectors, they constantly rank near the top. Adobe, Microsoft, the NSA, and others have or are opening large offices in Lehi, UT. This is a great location, because it is centrally located between these two counties at a place known as \"the point of the mountain\".\r\n\r\nApple could draw on a large pool of talent if they would open an office here.\r\n\r\nHowever, having interned for a summer with Apple and just knowing a lot about the company culture, it doesn't seem likely that this will happen. Alas, I am filing my radar to express my opinion.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
