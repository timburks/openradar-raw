    description: "I have a project created under Xcode 3.x, which was building a command line tool. The target type of this project was set incorrectly at some point, and was:\r\n\r\n    productType = \"com.apple.product-type.application\";\r\n\r\nThe product did not have a bundle, Info.plist, or any of the other attributes of a bundled app; it just produced a single Mach-O executable. Despite this, the project could be built and debugged under Xcode 3 using gdb.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Xcode 4.2.1, the project builds but can not be debugged with gdb. The error produced is:\r\n\r\n    No executable file specified.\r\n    Use the \"file\" or \"exec-file\" command.\r\n\r\nSwitching to lldb allows the project to be debugged, as does editing the productType to the correct value for a command line tool:\r\n\r\n    productType = \"com.apple.product-type.tool\";\r\n\r\nIdeally gdb would give a more informative error, and project validation would indicate that the target type didn't match the product type (e.g., bundled app was requested but no bundle or Info.plist was being generated)."
