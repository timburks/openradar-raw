    description: "Summary: When the Pubsub framework is used to retrieve a list of hyperlinks to rss feeds, e.g. by creating a PSFeed object for the landing page of a website, the title property of PSLink objects created by the framework often (i.e. for websites which don't use plain ASCII text) has a wrong encoding which cannot be corrected by any conversion. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Create a PSFeed object with a hyperlink to a web page that uses non-standard characters (e.g. non-latin characters). If the web page contains <alternate> tags, PSFeed will create PSLink objects (available in the links array of the PSFeed object) but the title property will have a strange and unreadable encoding, depending on the enconding of the webpage. As an example, throw the URL http://www.yandex.ru at a PSFeed object and look at the title property of the [feed links] array after loading. Using [feed xmlRepresentation] gives the same wrong encoding.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Have the PSLink title property in the correct encoding.\r\n\r\nActual Results: PSLink title property has wrong encoding."
