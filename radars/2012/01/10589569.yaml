    description: "Summary:\r\niTunes Ping produces push notifications, but does not allow the user to change how the notifications are displayed in the Notifications area of the Settings app. This behaviour is not expected, especially as the alert on first use of Ping and the Ping section of the iPhone/iPad/iPod touch User Guide state that notification settings can be changed using this mechanism.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Restore iPhone/iPad/iPod touch using iTunes.\r\n2. In the iTunes app on the device, tap Ping, and sign in with an Apple ID.\r\n3. When asked to allow Ping to use Push Notifications, tap OK.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPing appears in the Notifications area of the Settings app, and the presentation of the notifications can be changed (i.e. banner instead of modal alert, turn on/off sound, etc.)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPing is not present in the Notifications settings.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNew in iOS 5. Ping notification settings were present in iOS 4.3.5."
