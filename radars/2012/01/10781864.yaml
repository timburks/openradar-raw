    description: "31-Jan-2012 09:50 AM Jonathan Blocksom:\r\nSummary:\r\nOrientation metadata gets lost in Core Image and is a pain to get back. A new initializer would help.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nWrite a program that:\r\n* Takes a UIImage\r\n* Creates a CIImage from it\r\n* Creates a new CIImage by filtering the source CIImage\r\n* Puts the output CIImage back into UIImage\r\n\r\nTry it with an image whose default orientation is not standard (e.g. nonzero imageOrientation property in UIImage). The metadata is lost going through Core Data and the resulting image appears rotated.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou should be able to create a new UIImage with metadata from the original.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou have to create a CGImage, which is a pain.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nUIImage has a handy method for CGImage's,\r\n- (id)initWithCGImage:(CGImageRef)imageRef scale:(CGFloat)scale orientation:(UIImageOrientation)orientation\r\nIt should have one like this for CIImage as well."
