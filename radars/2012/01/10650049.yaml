    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting to a new WiFi network, MacOS X stores the password for it in my keychain if I selected to remember this network. It will always store it in the default keychain, which is the login keychain on my system. I can now connect to and disconnect from that network as often as I wish, I never get prompted for a password again. However, when I move the password to a different keychain, which is in my search list(!), it's not found anymore and next time I connect, I get prompted for the password again and after entering, a new entry is created in my default keychain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect to password protected WiFi network.\r\n2. Select to remember it.\r\n3. Open Keychain Access.\r\n4. Move the password entry to a different keychain.\r\n5. Disconnect from the WiFi network (e.g. turn off WiFi)\r\n6. Reconnect to the WiFi network.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nYou are not prompted for a password, the password is found in its current keychain.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nYou are prompted for a password, the password is not found because only the default (or login) keychain seems to be searched for it.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have not tested it with different kind of WiFi networks since I currently only have access to a single one and this network uses 802.1X authentication (so the password is of type \"802.1X Password\" in keychain). I don't know if that makes any difference or not.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I need the WiFi password in a different keychain is simple: I keep all highly sensitive passwords in an own keychain, with a different (more complicated and thus more secure) password than my login password (so even if an attacker gets aware of my login password, he cannot look into that keychain!) and with stricter security settings (e.g. auto-lock on inactivity or sleeping).\r\n\r\nAs I cannot think of any good reason why one would limit the search for WiFi passwords to the default keychain, I consider this definitely a bug."
