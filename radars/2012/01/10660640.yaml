    description: "Summary:\r\nThe Newsstand icon in iOS 5.0 and higher cannot be removed, hidden, or filed into a group. It remains on the home screen and is an eyesore and impedes usability (due to it being in the way)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Use any iOS 5.x or higher device.\r\n2. See step 1. You've already found the bug!\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI have control over what I keep on my device, and what I don't.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nApple exerts unnecessary control over my device in the vain attempt to get me to purchase _yet more_ content. User reviews even suggest that this content is somewhat slipshod and not up to the usual standard of quality one would expect from Apple. Also, the wood veneer looks kinda fake.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNo problem on any iOS version prior to 5.0.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nWe've found a solution, sort of, by putting the Newsstand into another folder _during_ the creation process. Works, crashes the phone should you be daft enough to try to run Newsstand, but hey. Until you sync, then Apple again thinks it knows better and goes ahead and rearranges my icons so that the Newsstand is again in my face. Not cool."
