    description: "Summary:\r\nIt should be possible to drag items between different Copy Files build phases in a target, thereby removing them from the source build phase and adding them to the target build phase.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a project.\r\n* Add a Copy Files build phase.\r\n* Add a resource file to the project.\r\n* Disclose the Copy Bundle Resources and Copy Files build phases.\r\n* Attempt to drag the newly-added file from the Copy Bundle Resources build phase to the new Copy Files build phase.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nItem should be moved.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nItem bounces back to source build phase.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis works in Xcode 3.2.6, although the feedback is somewhat buggy.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
