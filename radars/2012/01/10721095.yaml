    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen connecting an iPad to an external display or projector that does not correctly report its capabilities, there is no option to override the default of 1080p60 for display mirroring or video out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nConnect the iPad 2 to an external display or projector that has a misleading EDID record in the HDMI (using the AV Adapter)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niPad should have an option to manually set its video output mode, similar to Apple TV.\r\n\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo image is displayed on the display or projector.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI believe there used to be an option in Settings/Video for PAL or NTSC that at least caused the 50/60Hz rate to switch, but that seems to be gone in iOS5.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis especially applies to live capturing the output of an iPad to a live video switching device, such as the Blackmagic Design ATEM TV Studio, where all video sources need to agree on one output format, such as 720p50."
