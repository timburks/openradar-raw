    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen adding items to a Copy Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase, a sheet is shown with the entire project hierarchy in a fully-disclosed state. This is an extremely inconvenient way to navigate the project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n* Create a project.\r\n* Disclose the Copy Bundle Resources build phase.\r\n* Press the + button.\r\n* Use the disclosure triangles to hide some portions of the project hierarch.\r\n* Close the sheet.\r\n* Press the + button again.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe project hierarchy should be displayed with the same disclosure state as it was in when you dismissed the sheet. Ideally, this would be persisted separately for each Copy Files phase, but shared state would be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nEach time the sheet is open, the full hierarchy of the project is disclosed.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nNone known. Xcode 3.x does not have a corresponding sheet.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIf rdar://10668405 is implemented, it would be desirable for the default state to only disclose groups which are associated with the build phase being edited."
