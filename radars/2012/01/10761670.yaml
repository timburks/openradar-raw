    description: "26-Jan-2012 03:10 PM Monroe Williams:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to get from a particular row in the \"Call Trees\" view to the list of blocks that line represents.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Run an iOS application for which you have symbolic data under the \"Leaks\" template in Instruments (I'm running it on the device, not in the simulator, if that makes any difference)\r\n- In the \"Allocations\" instrument, switch to the \"Call Tree\" view\r\n- Turn off \"Hide Missing Symbols\" and turn on \"Invert Call Tree\" and \"Hide System Libraries\" in the data mining pane\r\n- Run the application and use the data mining tools until you find a specific call stack which is of interest and has a moderately large allocation count\r\n- Decide that you'd like to see the allocation histories of all the blocks that correspond to that line in the \"Call Trees\" view\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI should be able to select the call stack of interest and do something which shows me the list of blocks associated with it (i.e. the list of blocks whose size is being summed up to generate the data for the \"bytes used\" column).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI haven't yet found a way to get from the call stack to the corresponding block list.  The focus arrow in the call trees view doesn't do anything very useful (at least when viewing the call tree inverted), and none of the contextual menu items seem to do what I want.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nIt seems like the Instruments tool must have the necessary data to show this list of blocks, since it's already showing the block count and the sum of their sizes.  I'm assuming this is either just an oversight, or there's already some way to do it and I just haven't discovered it yet.\r\n\r\nIf I can manage to locate the blocks of interest in the \"Objects List\" view, I can get the allocation history from there, so I know it can display things in the way I want.  If the text search in that view could find blocks based on the entire contents of their allocation history call trees, I could approximate what I'm trying to do, but that search seems to only look at the \"Responsible Caller\" for each block and/or the object type, which doesn't quite get me there."
