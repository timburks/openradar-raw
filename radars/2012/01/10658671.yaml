    description: "Summary:\r\nOnce a computer has been associated with an iTunes Match account, it's not possible to associate this computer with another iTunes Match account, not even when logging in as a different user.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Associate a computer with an iTunes Match account.\r\n2. Log out.\r\n3. Log in as a different user, with different Apple ID & an iTunes Match account.\r\n4. Try to enable iTunes Match.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nOn a multi-user system, I would expect this action to succeed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIt fails, iTunes tells you that this computer has already been associated with a different iTunes Match account.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI use several Macs at home or at work and all of these are shared with other users, that means other users also have own accounts on these Macs, other users with own Apple IDs and own iTunes libraries. This is quite normal for a multi-user operating system.\r\n\r\nI completely fail to see the point behind all this. Do you really think, if I want to share my songs with someone else (which would be rather stupid, after all my Apple ID/e-mail address, as well as my real name are both stored in its meta data!), do you really think I would go to their house, log in to my iTunes Match account and download several GB of data over a \"slow\" DSL line (or even slower Internet connection)? Why would I do that if I can just take my 32 GB USB stick, copy the songs there and take it with me? Much faster, much simpler and still possible with this strange iTunes Match limitation."
