    description: "18-Jan-2012 11:08 PM Amy Worrall:\r\nSummary:\r\nPush email should push 'read status', not just pushing new messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Ensure iCloud email account configured on a Mac and an iPhone\r\n2. Have someone else send you an email. Note message is unread on both devices, and the iPhone has badged the Mail icon with a \"1\".\r\n3. Read the message on the Mac.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe \"1\" badge on the email app on the iPhone disappears instantly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe badge remains until the user manually goes into the Mail app on the iPhone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS4083\r\nThe above article shows us that this is a works-as-designed. The design is really annoying, please change it so that iCloud pushes the read/unread status!"
