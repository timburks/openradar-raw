    description: "24-Jan-2012 03:48 PM Caleb Daniels:\r\nSummary: After a fresh restore, bluetooth is said to be on, yet there is no bluetooth \"on\" icon in the status bar.  This could be confusing for some users, as well as a serious power drain.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:  Restore to a .ipsw, and then go to Settings>Bluetooth and the slider will be switched to the \"on\" position."
