    description: "Summary:\r\n  When checking the lastTurnDate on a participant in Game Kit Turn Based Match, the date reported is sometimes incorrect. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n  Play a bunch of game center matches, and keep an eye on lastTurnDate. I've not yet found a reliable way to reproduce this, but we're attempting to do it with some sample code.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n  lastTurnDate should be the date the player last made a move. It should DEFINITELY be later than the creation date of the game. \r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n   In the sample out put below (cut and pasted from the terminal while playing a game in the sandbox), the creation date is January 8th, but one of the players has a lastTurnDate of January 3rd. \r\n\r\n(gdb) po [match valueForKey: @\"creationDate\"]\r\n2012-01-08 20:08:38 +0000\r\n(gdb) po match\r\n<GKTurnBasedMatch 20ca30\tid:37f56178-1550-43e8-b228-db3ba8a80180 status:Open message:D: iPhone 4 for Ben Played SLID for 6 taken:2012-01-08 21:07:33 +0000 created:2012-01-08 20:08:38 +0000\r\ncurrent:<GKTurnBasedParticipant 207650 - id:G:1178460943 (local player) status:Active outcome:None lastTurn:2012-01-08 21:07:33 +0000>\r\nparticipants:\r\n\t\t<GKTurnBasedParticipant 210360 - id:G:616910683 status:Active outcome:None lastTurn:2012-01-03 21:10:32 +0000>\r\n\t\t<GKTurnBasedParticipant 207650 - id:G:1178460943 (local player) status:Active outcome:None lastTurn:2012-01-08 21:07:33 +0000>\r\n\t>\r\n(gdb) \r\n\r\n08-Jan-2012 03:39 PM Ben Gottlieb:\r\nit looks like Game Center is using the device's time to store this value, not server time. This means, that if the devices are not perfectly in-sync, this value is not usable."
