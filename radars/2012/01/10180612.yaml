    description: "24-Sep-2011 06:04 PM Tony Arnold:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nHorizontal scrolling in Xcode 4 is unreliable in it's behaviour, and is activated too easily when scrolling vertically. It should be able to be disabled, and cannot be.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open an Xcode project, and a source code file;\r\n2. Scroll down, and accidentally scroll sideways even a tiny amount;\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe code continues to scroll down and my context is not flipped or half flipped to another document.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nIf the scroll movement is large enough, I end up in another open Xcode document. If it's too small, the horizontal scroll animation gets stuck very early on, and nothing in the window updates (even though what I type changes the document, nothing is shown visually). The only way to fix this is to try horizontally scrolling again.\r\n\r\nI do not want this behaviour — it does not increase productivity, and browser-esque features like this make coding harder, not easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n31-Jan-2012 07:29 AM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThank you for filing this bug report.\r\n\r\nWe are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to regularly check the seed notes and release notes for any updates that might affect this issue.  Again, thank you for taking the time to submit bugs.
