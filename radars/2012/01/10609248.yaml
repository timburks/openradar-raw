    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen using AVCaptureSession to capture audio/video, if you try to use an input device that is of type AVMediaTypeMuxed (such as a DV camera) as well as a AVCaptureAudioDataOutput output, the app will crash when you call startRunning on the capture session.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Create an AVCaptureSession\r\n2) Add an audio data output to that session\r\n3) Add an input connected to a muxed input device to that session\r\n4) Start the session\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe session starts running.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe app crashes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1) I'm using the audio data output to monitor audio levels and reflect that in the UI of my app. The sample code does not have this, as the crash happens long before that point.\r\n2) I've only tested this with a DV camcorder hooked up via Firewire. I don't know if the problem would be true for other mixed input devices or not."
