    description: "28-Jan-2012 01:39 AM John Hawkinson:\r\nSummary: Quicktime Player cannot display fullscreen video on an external monitor under Lion\r\n\r\nThis is a serious regression from 10.6 and it makes Quicktime Player useless for external presentations that have to be seemless. Of course this relates to Lion's Fullscreen model.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open MPEG in QT Player\r\n2. Position window on External Display\r\n3. Cmd-F\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nVideo should show on external video projector / large monitor\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nVideo shows on laptop's 15\" display.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis worked properly in 10.6.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe workaround of moving the menu bar to the external monitor is not acceptable. Then the people watching the video projector see a title bar and perhaps a desktop.\r\n\r\nInstead I have to use VLC.app instead of QuickTime Player.\r\n\r\nShould I file this as a Lion bug already? Surely many people have, but I'm not sure how to describe it in AppKit terms."
