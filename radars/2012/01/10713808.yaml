    description: "Under Xcode 3.x, the \"Place Build Products in: Customized location\" field could accept an environment variable such as '$(XCODE_BUILDS)'.\r\n\r\nThis allows the build location used by Xcode to be accessible from other tools, via an environment used by both.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode 4 the \"Derived Data: Custom\" path does not support environment variables, and requires an explicit path."
