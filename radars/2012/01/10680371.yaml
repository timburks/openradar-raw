    description: "Summary:\r\nWebKit data (localstorage or local SQLite) are now stored in Library/Caches folder (instead of Library/WebKit folder). This is a big problem for all apps using UIWebView and storing user data, because they will no longer be backup and may be deleted. There are a lot HTML5 apps (cf. phonegap) using localstorage or SQLite as a critical feature.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn a UIWebView, create a new DB or use localStorage with JavaScript. You can see that the WebKit data is now stored in Library/Caches :\r\nhttp://cl.ly/1p3L1U2W1J3y3I1T1r3y \r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nWe should at least specify the directory of WebKit data (and to set it to Documents/ for critical data)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe WebKit data are stored in Library/Caches folder, and can be deleted\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThe WebKit data was stored in Library/WebKit folder, and was correctly backup by iCloud"
