    description: "By using the New File wizard in Xcode 4.2.1, I created a mapping model to migrate from previous version of a Core Data data model. Both the previous and the new version contain several abstract entities such as Contact and Product. These have some child entities that inherit from them; for example, SupplierContact, ClientContact and EmployeeContact. These entities inherit properties such as firstName, lastName and company from the parent entity, Contact.\r\n\r\nMapping model created by the wizard does not create mapping for the abstract entities -- as expected. However, the inherited properties are ignored in child entities and mapping doesn't get autocreated for them in the file by the wizard.\r\n\r\nSo, when mapping from SupplierContact to SupplierContact, all attributes and relationships that were inherited from Contact are ignored and don't get mapped. This results in data loss and validation errors unless these attribute and relationship mapping is manually created.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Create a versioned data model with entities that inherit attributes from other entities.\r\n2. Run the program and let it create a persistent data store based on this first version of the mapping model.\r\n3. Create a new version of the data model.\r\n4. Try creating a mapping model between these two versions using the New File wizard.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNewly created mapping model contains mapping definitions for inherited attributes.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAll mapping definitions for inherited attributes are omitted."
