    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nFor people like me who prefer to code in a bright on dark environment/theme having a line (that already is in a light shade of colors by itself) overlayed with a bright yellow glossy block makes it very hard if not impossible under certain lighting conditions to read.\r\nXcode should thus either allow us to adjust the opacity of the warning/error line highlighters or (even better) choose adjust the opacity automatically based on the theme's colors.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSet background color to dark gray (15%)\r\nSet text color to bright gray (85%)\r\nWrite code that causes Xcode to mark it as either warning or error.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nLine remains readable.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nQuite the contrary.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
