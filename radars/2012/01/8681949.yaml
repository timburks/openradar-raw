    description: "I've discovered that NSTextView's default handling of keyboard-driven selection manipulation fails badly when the text being edited contains line ending composed of carriage return and linefeed characters. Text with just linefeed character endings doesn't cause the problem.\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached \"CRLFText.txt\" in TextEdit.\r\n2. Hold the shfit key and press the down arrow once to select the first line and its newline ending.\r\n3. Hold the shift key and press the left arrow once to shrink the selection by one character. The line feed is removed from the active selection, showing apparently just the single line of text being selected.\r\n4. Hold the shift key and press the left arrow once more to shrink the selection further.\r\n\r\nExpected: The selection should shrink to consume the visible period that seems to be the end of the selection OR the selection should not visible change but should invisibly be shrinking to consume the CR character that is causing trouble.\r\n\r\nActual: Instead of shrinking the selection, the cmd-left-arrow gesture causes the LF to be reinstated as part of the selection, causing an endless cycle whereby repeated cmd-left-arrow gestures simply toggles between it being part of an not part of the selection.\r\n\r\nTo witness correct behavior, add several lines to the document by navigating to the bottom and Typing out several lines with newlines as inserted by TextEdit, which will default to simple LF characters. Now repeated a similar test as above, selecting an entire line of the \"good\" text and shift-left-arrowing repeatedly will continuously shrink the selection.\r\n\r\nIN A NUTSHELL: shift-left-arrow should continuously shrink the selection with the direction of the selection is down/right. The presence of a CR/LF sequence presents a reproduceable case where this shrinkage doesn't work right and where a user-unfriendly cycle is introduced instead."
