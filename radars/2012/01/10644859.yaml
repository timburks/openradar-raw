    description: "Summary:\r\nThe writeToFile:withAttributes:error: method of QTMovie does not work when the app is sandboxed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nA)\r\n1) Create a sandboxed app that has a QTMovie movie object.\r\n2) Open a NSSavePanel to get the file to save to (so that Powerbox will grant access to the path)\r\n3) Call writeToFile:withAttributes:error: to write the file to the chosen path\r\n\r\nB)\r\n1) Create a sandboxed app that has a QTMovie movie object.\r\n2) Create a path within the sandbox to write the file to\r\n3) Call writeToFile:withAttributes:error: to write the file to the path within the sandbox\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe file is written successfully.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe file is not written. The method fails and returns the error:\r\nError Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-54 \"The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (OSStatus error -54.)\" (permissions error (on file open))\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis method works fine if not sandboxed.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis occurs regardless of whether the path being written to is allowed by Powerbox or within the sandbox itself. I presume that QTMovie is internally trying to write somewhere else while working and that is not allowed by the sandbox.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, no sandbox denial shows up in the system log. It's as if something fishy is happening at the low level filesystem code in QTKit. I suspect its use of the Carbon File Manager is the culprit, given problems I've had before with it."
