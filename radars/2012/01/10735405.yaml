    description: "Summary: The Backup Core API (CSBackupSetItemExcluded() and CSBackupIsItemExcluded()) do not provide access to Time Machine path-based exclusion done via the Time Machine System Preferences pane. The System Preferences do not show files excluded using Backup Core. Additionally, there is no API to retrieve a list of all fixed-path exclusions.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Exclude a file at path PATH_A via Time Machine options in System Preferences.\r\n\r\n2. Query the state of PATH_A via Backup Core's CSBackupIsItemExcluded().\r\n\r\n3. Exlude a file at path PATH_B via CSBackupSetItemExcluded() with excludeByPath == true.\r\n\r\n4. Exlude a file at path PATH_B via CSBackupSetItemExcluded() with excludeByPath == false.\r\n\r\n5. Look up if PATH_B is excluded in Time Machine options in System Preferences.\r\n\r\nExpected Results: In step 2 CSBackupIsItemExcluded() should return YES and set *excludeByPath = YES as the exclusions done via System Preferences seem to be fixed-path. In step 5, PATH_B should appear among excluded files in System Preferences.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Exclusions via Backup Core do not affect exclusions via System Preferences and vice versa. Using either interface one cannot say certainly which files are really excluded. \r\n\r\nRegression: None.\r\n\r\nNotes: What I have said about Backup Core applies to the tmutil command as well. Even if there is a reason to keep two separete databases of fixed-path exclusions, it would be more transparent to:\r\n\r\n1. provide at least read-only access via an extension to the Backup Core API to the preference pane exclusions.\r\n\r\n-- and perhaps also:\r\n\r\n2. provide read-only access to programmatic (Backup Core) exclusions via Time Machine preferences and Finder info windows.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to be able to retrieve a list of all fixed-path exclusions programmatically."
