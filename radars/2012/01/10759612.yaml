    description: "26-Jan-2012 12:57 PM Travis Fischer:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThumbnails created using an CGImageSource using a PDF as the source have a blue tint to all images.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a CGImageSource using a PDF that contains images.\r\n2. Create a thumbnail image using CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThumbnail of a PDF page should look like the PDF page.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nImages in thumbnails have a blue tint.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is similar behavior to problems I reported in rdar://8998927.  However, that was only happening to images without an embedded color profile.  How the PDF was created also affected the previous bug.    In this case it is happening in all images regardless of how the source PDF was created.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample project that displays the PDF in a web view so you can see the expected coloration.  The second tab in the sample project creates thumbnails from a CGImageSource and displays them in a table view.\r\n\r\n26-Jan-2012 12:57 PM Travis Fischer:\r\n'ImageSourceBug.zip' was successfully uploaded"
