    description: "SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nWith the proliferation of third-party controller input devices for iOS, for example the iCade (1), iControlPad (2), 60beat GamePad (3), etc, it's starting to become clear that iOS needs a dedicated controller HID API.\r\n\r\nRight now, for any developer to integrate support for any of these products, they have to request a specific SDK from each manufacturer, along with prototype hardware. This is a right pain, and you should make this better for us; with the SGX 543MP2 in every device, and AirPlay TV-output, it's a real waste not to have a controller API of some sort so that more advanced games are possible on iOS devices. There are just some things you can't do with a touch-only input for gaming, and I really believe this will hold iOS back in the long term.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, Android (gasp!) has support for Xbox controllers out of the box, and a controller API.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this seriously as you plan for iOS 6. :-)\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\r\n\r\nAny controller HID API should be open to developers and manufacturers to plug into, even if it requires MFI on the hardware side.\r\n\r\nIt should support, at the minimum:\r\n\r\n• 4-way navigation buttons (up, down, left, right)\r\n• two 2-axis joysticks (to allow for dual-stick shooters, like the AAA titles on the store)\r\n• four action buttons\r\n• a start button (to pause)\r\n• two triggers/shoulder buttons\r\n\r\nLINKS:\r\n\r\n1) http://www.macrumors.com/2012/01/08/ces-2012-icade-ios-game-controller-expands-to-icade-jr-icade-mobile-and-icade-core/\r\n2) http://www.icontrolpad.com/\r\n3) http://toucharcade.com/2012/01/05/a-look-at-60beats-gamepad/"
