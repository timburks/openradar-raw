    description: "Summary: \r\nWhen a PDF with the header \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" is downloaded from within Mobile Safari, the Safari Page loses its securityOrigin and all subsequent AJAX requests on that domain fail with the following error message:\r\n\"XMLHTTPRequest cannot load http://example.com/path/ajax.php. Cannot make any requests from null\".\r\nIt seems to be failing at line 105 of http://opensource.apple.com/source/WebCore/WebCore-1298/loader/CrossOriginAccessControl.cpp \r\nOpening the PDF in a New Page or closing the original page and making requests from a new one fixes the issue. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) On iOS 5.0 or 5.0.1, go to http://timtrinidad.com/ajaxtest. Click on file.pdf under \"Content-disposition: attachment\" to open PDF in the browser.\r\n2) Click Back\r\n3) Reload the original page\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nAfter the reload, the page loads the AJAX response.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNo AJAX response is loaded; the following error is thrown in the console:\r\nJavaScript: Error on Line 1\r\nXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://timtrinidad.com/ajaxtest/ajax.php. Cannot make any requests from null.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe test source code is in the attached zip files. All other files on the page work without issue."
