    description: "Summary:\r\nI am trying to insert an AVURLAsset of a AVPlayerItem that states AVPlayerItemStatusReadyToPlay into an AVMutableComposition.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSee enclosed Xcode Project.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nProper error-message describing my failure.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nNot that helpful error-message. No mention in the documentation that AVMutableCompositions do not accept remote assets.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt appears to be fact that AVMutableComposition does only accept local assets. This should be properly noted and described within the AVFoundation documentation. Also the error-message returned could be a lot more helpful."
