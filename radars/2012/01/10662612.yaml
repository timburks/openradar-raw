    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nAn iOS device could not use the microphone in a paired Bluetooth device as the audio source for voice or video recording.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Pair iPhone with a Bluetooth headset (I'm using Plantronics M20 for this).\r\n2. Start the Voice Memo application and start recording.\r\n3. Walk away from the iPhone (as far as you can without breaking the Bluetooth connection)\r\n4. Speak softly into the Bluetooth headset's microphone.\r\n5. Walk back to the iPhone.\r\n6. Stop recording voice memo.\r\n7. Listen to the recorded memo.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe recorded memo should be loud and clear since it supposed to receive audio from the Bluetooth headset's microphone that is close to your mouth.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe recorded audio is not clear since it is actually recording from the iPhone's internal microphone.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nHaving a bluetooth headset to be the audio source is very useful not only for voice memos but also for movie recording.  That is, recording of a \"news coverage\"-style video and getting a clear recording of the talent's voice from the bluetooth headset."
