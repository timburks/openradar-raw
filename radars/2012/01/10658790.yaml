    description: "Summary:\r\nOn a multi-user system, where not every user needs to be or even should be an \"admin user\", it should be possible for users to install apps into their own home directory without sharing those with all other users on this computer and without any need to know an admin password or grand admin authorization. Most apps on the Mac App Store are actually completely self contained and never access files outside their own app bundle or the user's home directory. There is no need why these apps must be installed with admin privileges and why they must be located in /Applications.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Log in as a non-admin user.\r\n2. Open Mac App Store.\r\n3. Try to install any app.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nUser is prompted if he wants to install the app for \"all users\" or \"only the current user\". Only when choosing all users, user is prompted for admin authorization and the app is installed to /Applications. Otherwise user is not prompted and the app is installed to ~/Applications.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nUser is always prompted for admin authorization. If he cancels it, the app is not installed at all. Otherwise it is always installed to /Applications.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDevelopers should have an \"flag\" to let the Mac App Store know, if their app really needs to be installed globally (for all users in /Applications) or not (which means they can be installed globally, but don't have to... the user should be asked). To stay backward compatible, one could simply say the default value of this \"flag\" if absent is \"global-only\". This \"flag\" could be an Info.plist entry for example."
