    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nBugs are being closed as \"We are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it\" which is a somewhat nonsensical sentence. Bug databases, such as Radar, are supposed to track issues that are known about. The problem is I don't know what that sentence means in terms of the bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Write up a Radar, such as rdar://problem/9749716, that breaks a shipping application. This takes some effort since Apple is very strict about what bug reports it will accept.\r\n2. Wait\r\n3. Get a response from the Developer Bug Reporting team.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nOne of the following:\r\n1. We could not reproduce the issue. Please provide more information.\r\n2. The stated behavior is the expected behavior, therefore it will not be fixed.\r\n3. A fix has been made in build XXXX, please verify.\r\n4. The bug is a duplicate of XXXX.\r\n5. While a valid bug, we do not think it is worth fixing at this point in time. The bug will not be fixed.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\n\"We are closing this bug since our engineers are aware of the issue and will continue to track it.\" Does that mean the bug won't be fixed? Or it will be fixed, just later? If they aren't tracking the bug in Radar, how is being tracked? I thought bug tracking was the point of Radar. The response just doesn't make any sense. If you don't want to fix the bug, just say \"Bug will not be fixed.\"\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nDidn't happen until this year (2012).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nJust tell me what you intended to do with the bug. There's no reason to be coy about it."
