    description: "Summary: The bookmark in bookmarks/bonjour/about does not really help with the question about how Safari can use Bonjour for bookmarks.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Bookmarks | Bonjour | About Bonjour\r\n\r\nExpected Results: Description on how you use Bonjour in Safari; How $device may advertise via Bonjour and how to use it.\r\n\r\nActual Results: A link to http://www.apple.com/(de/)support/bonjour/, which is information about what Bonjour is in general, but nothing related to Safari.\r\n\r\nRegression: Add a link to actual information on the topic there; translate that section into German etc.\r\n\r\nNotes: On a side note, that page is not even translated. Also, the links there redirect to not really helpful sites like developer.apple.com/opensource/ which does not provide any FAQ (the link is named FAQ) or the windows specific discussion forum which renders this completely useless for an end user."
