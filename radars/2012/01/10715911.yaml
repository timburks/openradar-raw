    description: 'Summary: The YouTube app does not allow sharing via the Messages app, this is inconvenient as the only options are to "Add to Favorites", "Mail LInk to this Video" or "Tweet". Sharing a video to one person who has an iPhone is more suited for the Messages app than email/Mail app. There should be a "Message Link to this Video" option which shares the video link through the Messages app in either iMessage or SMS.'
