    description: "When using NSPathControl within a sandboxed application, it fails to show the pretty view it normally shows and instead just shows folders for everything in the path.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1) Add an NSPathControl\r\n2) Pass it an NSURL obtained by an NSOpenPanel, e.g. one for a file in your home directory\r\n3) Observe what the NSPathControl shows\r\n4) Check the system log to see the sandbox denial\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA pretty view of the NSURL, including drive icons for drives or home icons for home folders.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA folder for every element in the path.\r\nAlso, a sandbox denial shows up in the log:\r\nDec 30 15:32:08 fruitbook sandboxd[472] ([459]): PathControlSandb(459) deny mach-lookup com.apple.KernelExtensionServer\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWithout sandboxing, this worked.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nYou may have to tweak the attached sample code to use a certificate you have to ensure you get the app to run in a sandbox.\r\n\r\nI presume this is the same bug as rdar://10323628"
