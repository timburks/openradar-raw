    description: "Summary: Smart Playlists that use the \"Limit to\" option are not synced properly onto iOS devices using iTunes Match.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Using an iTunes Match-enabled account and iOS device (iPhone 4S in my case), on iTunes create a Smart Playlist with a \"Limit to\" option. For example, Limit to 10 songs. The other criteria don't matter.\r\n2. Wait a while for playlist to show up on iPhone\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- There should only be 10 songs in the playlist on the phone\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- There are thousands of songs in the playlist\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis makes Smart Playlists almost unusable on an iPhone, including ones that come with iTunes like \"Top 25 Most Played\"."
