    description: "Summary:I've supplied sample code where if you run the code in the first #if block and make sure the issue exists, then quit and run the second block, the app crashes on an NKIssue overrelease. I've also attached an instrument trace showing the overrelease.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Launch app with the first #if block enabled. Check that the issue has been created (this is easier in simulator), then stop app and relaunch with the second block enabled and the app will crash on an exc_bad_access.\r\n\r\nExpected Result: No overrelease\r\n\r\nActual Results: Overrelease.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nTrace:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/3e3M0t0t1m2E043v283j\r\n\r\nCode:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/0F1y0T0o2G3305071r3X\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowup with recommended fix:\r\n\r\nif ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] isEqualToString:@\"5.0\"])\r\n   CFBridgingRetain([[NKLibrary sharedLibrary] currentlyReadingIssue]);\r\n\r\nWhich I adapted that into to cover 4.x support:\r\n\r\nif ([NKLibrary self] && [[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] isEqualToString:@\"5.0\"]) {\r\n#ifndef __clang_analyzer__ //Suppress leak warning\r\n     CFBridgingRetain([[NKLibrary sharedLibrary] currentlyReadingIssue]);\r\n#endif\r\n}"
