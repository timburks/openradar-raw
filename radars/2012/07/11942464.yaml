    description: "Summary: When Safari is set to \"open 'safe' files after downloading\", XIP files are not opened automatically. This doesn't make a lot of sense considering zip files are opened automatically, and XIP is basically a signed zip file. In addition, when the XIP file is manually opened, the XIP file itself is not automatically discarded like zip files are. Overall the experience is significantly less streamlined than just offering a zip file.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Open Safari\r\n2. Open Safari > Preferences > General\r\n3. Make sure \"Open 'safe' files after downloading\" is checked\r\n4. Download a XIP file\r\n\r\nExpected Results: The XIP file should be treated just like a zip fileâ€”it should be automatically unpacked, and the XIP file itself should be discarded, leaving only its contents.\r\n\r\nActual Results: Safari simply downloads the XIP file and nothing more.\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes: This behavior is unchanged in the Mountain Lion GM. XIP files have become the only good way to distribute Automator workflows when Gatekeeper is enabled: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/159778 I'm trying very hard to simplify the process of sharing my Automator actions, but this XIP file behavior makes the whole thing pretty clunky."
