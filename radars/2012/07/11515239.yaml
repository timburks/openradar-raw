    description: "This problem is duplicate of 11385190 - Open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm finding that geocodeAddressString: consistently returns places with some error when outside of the US. Searching for some US cities dropped the pin just fine but cities in Europe have some error margin and Apple's Maps.app does not show this problem.\r\nThe value of the error varies.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nBuild an app with a map and request locations like Faro, Sheffield, Porto, Alhambra and others using\r\n\r\n[geocoder geocodeAddressString:searchBar.text\r\n     completionHandler:^(NSArray* placemarks, NSError* error){\r\n        MKPointAnnotation * aPoint = nil;\r\n        for (CLPlacemark* aPlacemark in placemarks) {\r\n            MKPlacemark *pa = [[MKPlacemark alloc] initWithPlacemark:aPlacemark];\r\n            [map addAnnotation:pa];\r\n    }\r\n}];\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe pins should drop on the place typed, like they do on Apple's Map.app\r\nporto (Portugal): 41.14996, -8.61023\r\nfaro (Portugal): 37.015359, -7.935112\r\n…\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe pins drop far away from the named place. How far is variable.\r\nporto: 41.226979, -8.360622\r\nfaro: 37.235423, -8.143467\r\n…\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nI've reproduced it on a 3GS iOS 5.0.1, up to an iPhone 4 iOS 5.1.1 and on the Simulator.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've posted this also on https://devforums.apple.com/thread/151973?tstart=0\r\nOn the attached screenshot my app is the one with the red UI, the blue one is Apple's Maps.app\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project.\r\n\r\nThis code displays a red pin for the apple results and a green pin for google results with any location search.\r\n\r\nI've added a few buttons on the bottom for some examples of large discrepancy between google results (mostly correct) and CLGeocoder ones in Portugal.\r\n\r\nI've first found this on iOS5, where the location of \"Faro\" is way too far from its location but now I see that the problem has blown out of proportion with iOS6 (only tested on beta 3) with every location that I included being much farther away than before! Even Lisboa, the capital of the country, is about 30~40KM away.\r\nPlease run on the two OS's and check the differences.\r\n\r\nApps from the App Store and the Maps.app are also behaving like this.\r\nOn iOS5 my problem was mostly with the Maps.app displaying correct results and CLGeocoder being wrong but i guess the underlaying systems have been uniformed, making the problem more system wide."
