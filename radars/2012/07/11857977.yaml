    description: "Summary: Game Center in OS X 10.8 has Games tab which shows achievements numbers for each of the game located there.  The problem is that achievements amount is displayed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open Game Center, log in into it, select Games tab on the top. See games located there displayed with number of achievements, i.e. \"N of M achievements\". \r\n\r\nExpected Results: Correct number of achievements is displayed for each game.\r\n\r\nActual Results: For each game \"0 of N achievements\" label is displayed, where N is a number of total achievements available.\r\n\r\nRegression: This is definitely a regression, as Game Center was absent in Mac OS X 10.7 and this exact problem was also absent.\r\n\r\nNotes: This problem is fixed for each game after game details are displayed by clicking on the game label.  But this is definitely annoying and confusing and involves pretty big amount of time for clicking on each game if total number of games is big."
