    description: "Since starting to use the iOS 6 betas my cellular data usage has been significantly higher than in the past. In June, AT&T reported that I used 2.1 GB, over my data cap of 2GB and significantly higher than the 1.2GB/month that I averaged over the previous 3 months. So on July 10th (the final day of my AT&T billing month) I reset the cellular data usage tracker in Settings > General > Usage > Cellular Usage. \r\n\r\nAs of today, roughly 2 weeks later, my iPhone reports that I have Sent 99.1MB and received 348MB for a total of 447.1MB. AT&T, however, claims that I have used 1169.91MB in the same time period.\r\n\r\nI have also received anecdotal reports from other iOS 6 users claiming that AT&T is reporting usage of roughly double what the Settings app claims.\r\n\r\nClearly there are two very significant issues here:\r\n\r\n1. Unusually high data usage. My data usage habits haven't changed significantly since iOS 6 came out, and yet my data usage has nearly doubled from what it was before.\r\n\r\n2. Inaccurate reporting of data usage in Settings app. Unless this is a serious problem on AT&T's end (which I doubt based on the coincidental timing of switching to iOS 6 beta), there is some data being sent over the cellular connection which the Settings app is not reporting.\r\n\r\nI've created a thread in the Developer Forums to track this issue, although no one else has responded as of the filing of this bug report: https://devforums.apple.com/message/702585"
