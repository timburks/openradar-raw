    description: "Check the PhotosByLocation sample app for reference:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/PhotosByLocation/Introduction/Intro.html\r\n\r\nThis app uses a transparent navigation bar on top of the mapView. Now, when selecting pin annotations, it would be desirable to move the map if the callout would be covered by the navigation bar.\r\n\r\nIf the callout would be off the regular bounds of the mapView, the map correctly moves prior to showing the callout. \r\nBut partly covered areas such as for a transparent navigation bar or tool bar are not considered for map movement.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the  â€“ setVisibleMapRect:edgePadding:animated: method. However, this doesn't cut it. It only works for programmatically setting the map region once, not for scrollable maps where the user taps a pin anywhere on the map.\r\n\r\nCurrent map region after tapping the pin:\r\nhttp://d.pr/i/lP0L\r\n\r\nDesired map region:\r\nhttp://d.pr/i/tQpx\r\n\r\nI believe a writable property on MKMapView would be the appropriate API to cover such cases:\r\n\r\n@property (nonatomic, assign) UIEdgeInsets egdePadding;\r\n\r\nThe behavior would be as follows:\r\n- when tapping an annotationView, the screen region for the callout is calculated\r\n- if this screen region is outside the bounds of the mapView minus the edgePadding, the mapView is scrolled first\r\n- then the selection is done and the callout pops up"
