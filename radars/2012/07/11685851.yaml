    description: "17-Jun-2012 04:22 PM aaron Smith:\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nI've hit a strange issue with Xcode / Mountain Lion that is really a productivity killer. My application uses NSOpenPanel to select files and folders. Whenever I run the application from Xcode using GDB or LLDB, if I trigger the NSOpenPanel it crashes while loading quicklook plugins.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nIn my case all I do is run my application from Xcode, trigger the NSOpenPanel and it crashes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nNo crashing, should display open panel correctly\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nCrashing\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've attached a screenshot of the thread states in Xcode, there's a good stack trace there.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I could really use is a way to fix this locally so I can continue developing my application.\r\n\r\nPlease look into this and get back to me. Is there a way to clear some kind of quick look cache? What is causing this?\r\n\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2012 04:22 PM aaron Smith:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-06-17 at 4.18.09 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2012 07:41 PM aaron Smith:\r\nAttached is an Xcode project that causes the crash on 10.8, 10.7, in Xcode 4.4 and 4.3. I really have no idea what it could be, it seems there's something stale in the project that is causing the crashes. I've tried it on three computers and it crashes on all of them.\r\n\r\nI've fixed my problem by re-creating the project and copying all the files over. With no code changes the new project is working fine. So it leads me to believe there's something with the xcode project.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open QuickCaf.xcodeproj\r\n2. Build and run the application\r\n3. Press the \"Add Files...\" button in the toolbar\r\n\r\nYou should see a crash which starts with _QLLoadPluginAtURL, or possibly if you get a good stack trace you'd see the crash in __cxa_throw.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is for your eyes only to hopefully demonstrate the bug.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n17-Jun-2012 07:41 PM aaron Smith:\r\n'QuickCaf.zip' was successfully uploaded"
