    description: "09-Jul-2012 11:50 AM Stefan Munz:\r\nSummary: We are seeing a crash in our iOS app on iOS 6 beta 1 and 2 devices. We were able to reproduce it in a sample application that is attached to this bugreport. The crash occurs when we are calling -[NSMutableAttributedString addAttribute:value:range:]. With Zombies enabled we see that the crash is located at -[NSAttributeDictionary isEqualToDictionary:] or -[NSAttributeDictionary count]. As this is a private class we have the impression that this is a memory related bug in your implementation. In Release builds the location seems to be more random.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid the crash by replacing -[NSMutableAttributedString addAttribute:value:range:] with +[NSMutableAttributedString initWithString:attributes] and thus creating a new string every time instead of mutating it. This is also included in the sample project.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: Open the sample application, start it in simulator and scroll down. We added a #warning mark where the crash occurs and also added our workaround (as a comment).\r\n\r\nExpected Results: I would expect to be able to call -[NSMutableAttributedString addAttribute:value:range:] without crashing. This code works fine in iOS 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nActual Results: The app is crashing when -[NSMutableAttributedString addAttribute:value:range:] is called.\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2012 11:50 AM Stefan Munz:\r\n'NSAttributedStringSerializationBug.zip' and '29f293dd308145c71aa044a28fd26637.log' were successfully uploaded"
