    description: "23-Jul-2012 01:49 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nSummary:\r\nWhen first connecting a new iOS device, like an iPod touch, iPad or iPhone, to iTunes and choosing to register the device, after the license agreement screen iTunes displays an almost empty page (see attached screenshot #1).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Connect a new iOS device to a Mac with iTunes.\r\n2. When iTunes displays the screen inviting to register the device, choose \"Register\".\r\n3. Accept the displayed license agreement.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\niTunes should display the page to choose an Apple ID to register the device with (see attached screenshot #2).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\niTunes displays a page with only an Apple logo, an empty frame and a small boilerplate text at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nIn the past months I experienced this issue with various iOS devices, both on Mac OS X 10.6 and OS X Lion, last one being with a refurbished iPod touch (4th generation) 64 GB.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nIt seems that clicking on another iTunes section, such as Music, and clicking back on the connected iOS device on the left column is sufficient to force iTunes to correctly repaint the page.\r\n\r\n23-Jul-2012 01:49 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'Screenshots.zip' and 'Mac mini system information.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n24-Jul-2012 08:12 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nOur engineers have not been able to reproduce the reported behavior.\r\n\r\nPlease provide more information if still reproducible - Charles log, for example.\r\n\r\nHere are directions.\r\n\r\nOn your Desktop/Macbook:\r\n   1.  Install Charles from http://www.charlesproxy.com/\r\n   2.  Install the Charles cert on desktop/laptop:  http://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/using-charles/ssl-certificates/\r\n   3.  Launch Charles, in Proxy -> Proxy settings -> go to SSL tab\r\n        a.  Click the + to add an entry under locations\r\n        b.  Host:    \t*\r\n        c.  Port:  \t443\r\n        d.  Enable SSL proxying.\r\n   4.  Clear the Charles log (trash-can), reproduce and save session\r\n\r\nIf you need to gather traffic from iOS, now do this:\r\n   1.  Ensure steps 1-3 above are completed\r\n   2.  Connect to same Wifi/subnet as iOS device, get desktops/laptops IP address\r\n   3.  Install Charles Cert on iOS Device by visiting:\Lhttp://charlesproxy.com/charles.crt\r\n   4.  Setup proxy on iOS Device\r\n        a.  Go to Settings -> Wifi -> select blue arrow for connected wifi to view its settings, go to bottom to http proxy section.\r\n        b.  Select manual\r\n        c.  Server: enter IP from step 2\r\n        d.  Port: enter 8888\r\n   5.  Now clear the Charles log (trash-can), reproduce on iOS device and save session\r\n   6.  On device, go to settings, wifi, pick the network, and enter machine name where the above charles app is installed. Port = 8888.\r\n   7.  When done, to remove proxy setting, on device:\r\n        a.  Go to Settings -> Wifi -> select blue arrow for connected wifi to view its settings, go to bottom to http proxy section.\r\n        b.  Select None\r\nFor more information:\Lhttp://www.charlesproxy.com/assets/charles-proxy.mobileconfig\r\n\r\n\r\n31-Jul-2012 12:49 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI tried to reproduce the issue but I had no luck so far.\r\nStill, I've not been able to perform exactly the same steps and this might have influenced the results.\r\nWhen I first submitted this bug report I was connecting my new refurbished iPod touch (4th generations) to iTunes for the first time. I discovered later that it had iOS 5.0.1 installed. I stopped the registration process just after step 3 and never really completed it. However, at that point I had already accepted the license agreement and, as a result, I've not been able to make the license agreement screen appear anymore. Each time I tried the registration process jumped directly from the welcome screen inviting to register the device to the the page to choose an Apple ID to use. I even tried to restore the iPod from iTunes but I only managed to update the device to iOS 5.1.1 and to stop iTunes from displaying the screen to register the device.\r\nIn order to consistently try to reproduce the issue I need a way to restore my iPod touch to a state that will make iTunes ask me to register the device (and accept the license agreement) once again.\r\nHow can I accomplish this task?\r\n\r\n\r\n11-Oct-2012 09:31 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nHave you tried connecting the iPod touch while in another user account on the same computer? How about a different wireless network or location altogether? On another computer altogether?\r\n\r\nAlso, what is FoxTunes?  We noticed in the screenshots that the iTunes windows were named \"FoxTunes\"\r\n\r\nOur system shows that this iPod touch has already successfully been tethered. Has the issue been resolved now?\r\n\r\n\r\n06-Dec-2012 06:20 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\nOK, did you read what I posted on 30-Jul-2012?\r\nIn order to try to reproduce the issue I need a way to restore my iPod touch to a state that will make iTunes ask me to register the device and accept the license agreement once again. If it is feasible, of course.\r\nThat's because the issue is triggered only *sometimes* and *only* when accepting the license agreement.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean with \"has already successfully been tethered\"?\r\nI wrote that \"clicking on another iTunes section, such as Music, and clicking back on the connected iOS device on the left column is sufficient to force iTunes to correctly repaint the page\", so it's not a blocking issue and I've been able to successfully complete the registration procedure.\r\n\r\nFoxTunes is simply the parent folder of my iTunes Media folder (see screenshot \"iTunes Media folder path.png\").\r\nIt seems that iTunes 10 had the feature to name the main iTunes window as the parent folder of the iTunes Media folder. Now with iTunes 11 that feature has gone.\r\n\r\n06-Dec-2012 06:20 AM Andrea Govoni:\r\n'iTunes Media folder path.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n\r\n25-Sep-2013 10:40 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nWe have not been able to reproduce the reported behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to encounter this issue, please provide any information that would assist us in reproducing this reported behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n25-Sep-2013 10:53 PM Andrea Govoni:\r\nI've not encountered the issue in a long time, so I'm marking this bug as resolve.\r\nNext time I'll experience a similar issue I'll collect Charles log, as per your instructions.\r\nKind regards."
