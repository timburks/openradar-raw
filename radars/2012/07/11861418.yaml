    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nStrings do not always geocode properly. The placemarks returned can be off by as much as 20km.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nInitialize a CLGeocoder object, then call -geocodeAddressString:completionHandler: with \"Primm, NV\".\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, this appears to be sent to Apple's secure geocoding server (using a very basic app of my own, but all you really need is to make the alloc and geocode method calls):\r\n\r\nen_US com.thisexitllc.roger 10.7.4.11E53 + Z Primm, NVH\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nI would expect a result such as \"Primm, NV, United States\", this time with a coordinate and perhaps a region.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThis is the sole placemark returned by Apple's SSL server:\r\n\r\n(\r\n    \"Jean, Jean, NV, United States @ <+35.78121050,-115.43841783> +/- 100.00m, region (identifier <+35.78247050,-115.45806900> radius 30660.48) <+35.78247050,-115.45806900> radius 30660.48m\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nThis is Jean, NV, about 20km away from Primm.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nN/A"
