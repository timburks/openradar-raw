    description: "Steps to Reproduce:\r\n- In Xcode 4, configure a tab to your liking.\r\n- Accidentally hit Cmd-W.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- You are prompted as to whether you want to close the tab, or, if the tab is closed automatically, Cmd-Z brings it back.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- It's just gone, making it frustrating to use \"task-based tabs\" as recommended in WWDC 2012 session \"Working Efficiently with Xcode\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- Not a regression.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- See here for more details (and a  rather cranky blog post): http://wp.me/pRR7h-eB"
