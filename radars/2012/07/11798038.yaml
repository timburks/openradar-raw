    description: "My app uses different navigation bar backgrounds:\r\n\r\nScreen 1 has a navigationBar with style UIBarStyleBlack and translucent = YES\r\nScreen 2 has a navigationBar with style UIBarStyleBlack and translucent = NO\r\n\r\nBoth screens need different backgroundImages that adapt to the translucent property.\r\nI want to push Screen 2 on Screen 1 using UINavigationController.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge there's no API that lets me do this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I set a specific backgroundImage for Screen 1 and change it before or after -pushViewController:animated: the image is changed without any animation. Of course, the background images should be shifted in and out synchronously with the push animation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose a new API:\r\n\r\n- [setBackgroundImage:forBarMetrics:translucent:]\r\n\r\nor even:\r\n\r\n- [setBackgroundImage:forBarMetrics:translucent:barStyle:]\r\n\r\nto also include the barStyle as a parameter. Of course with a corresponding getter."
