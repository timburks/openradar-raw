    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to save \"preset breakpoint types\" in Xcode, and be able to set\r\nthose with one or two clicks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nWhen debugging with Xcode, I often set breakpoints to print out a certain\r\nvariable's value and continue.  This takes a number of steps currently.  I\r\nhave to:\r\n1. Click in the gutter to create the breakpoint.\r\n2. Right-click the new breakpoint and select \"Edit Breakpoint\".\r\n3. Click the \"Click to add an action\" button.\r\n4. Type in my command, such as \"po myString\".\r\n5. Click the \"Automatically continue\" checkbox.\r\n6. Click \"Done\".\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be nice if I could define a list of common breakpoint actions.\r\nThen I could do:\r\n1. Click in gutter to set the breakpoint.\r\n2. Right-click on it and select one of my preset types.\r\n3. Optionally, if the preset's definition included some \"placeholder\" values, I\r\n   could be prompted to fill those in (the 3rd party snippet tool TextExpander\r\n   has similar functionality).  That would allow me to specify the variable to\r\n   print out.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* I envision that these presets would be set globally in Xcode's Preferences.  I\r\n  don't think they need to be part of the projects.\r\n\r\n* A few ideas for other useful preset examples:\r\n    * Action:  Log Message:  %B %H  (this requires no placeholders).\r\n    * Action:  Debugger Action:  bt"
