    description: "29-Mar-2012 01:40 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nFrom time to time when repositioning a window with the mouse, the window will go above (behind) the top menu bar. Upon dragging the window down, the top boundary is reestablished and the window can no longer be dragged behind the menu.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThere are no specific user triggered actions that cause this behavior from what I have observed. The occurrences are somewhat random and usually occur just when you stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nWhen the problem occurs, these are the specific steps usually in play. The window has been \"grabbed\" by a left down click and hold on the mouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect that the window can only be moved up to the menu bar, as is typically the norm, and has been the standard on OS X for quite some time.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nIn the unexpected case, the window \"breaks through\" the lower boundary of the top menu bar and can be moved freely behind it. However, once the window has been moved below the top menu boundary, then behavior typically returns to expectations; that is, he window can only be moved up to the menu bar, but not behind the menu bar.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis problem existed in 10.7.2 and continues to persist in the latest official release 10.7.3. I do not know/remember if this was a problem in prior release of Lion.\r\n\r\nThe problem system in question is a 2010 iMac. This problem does not appear to exist on my mid-2007 MacBook Pro running the same version of OS X. Both systems were upgraded from Mac OS X Snow Leopard at the same time and following the same process.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI will attach some screenshots demonstrating the behavior. All of the examples are Safari windows, but I stress that this is not an application specific bug. I just happened to always be using Safari when I remembered to capture an image. The problem spans across all apps from what I can tell which points to a problem with the window server/manager.\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2012 01:40 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Screen Shot 2011-12-01 at 6.09.05 PM.png' and 'iMac.spx' were successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2012 01:41 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Screen Shot 2011-12-02 at 3.16.22 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2012 01:42 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-03-15 at 8.38.10 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n29-Mar-2012 08:47 PM Jon Stacey:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-03-29 at 9.27.23 PM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n10-Jul-2012 11:31 AM Jon Stacey:\r\nThis problem still occurs in 10.7.4.
