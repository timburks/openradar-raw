    description: "When loading a PDF into a PDFView immediately after the PDFView has been loaded from a NIB, then releasing that PDFView a few seconds later, the PDFView tries to access a previously freed object which causes the app to crash. It appears what is happening is:\r\n\r\n1) PDFView is loaded from NIB\r\n2) PDFDocument is loaded into PDFView\r\n3) PDFView calls -[PDFView(PDFViewInternal) handleInitialContentRenderSkip], which creates an NSTimer with the +[NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats:] method, but does not retain it\r\n4) A few seconds later, the user closes the window, thereby releasing the PDFView\r\n5) In the -[PDFView dealloc] method, -[NSTimer invalidate] is called on the previously freed NSTimer\r\n6) The app crashes\r\n\r\nThis does not happen every time. I believe it is most likely to happen when opening a larger PDF file for the first time (i.e. when it is not already in the filesystem cache and takes a bit longer to load)."
