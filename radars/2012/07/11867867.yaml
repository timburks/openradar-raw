    description: "13-Jul-2012 10:22 AM Kristopher Johnson:\r\nSummary: We recently submitted a custom B2B app to the App Store, via iTunes Connect and Xcode's binary uploader. After app approval, the app's status showed as \"Ready for Sale\" in iTunes Connect, but our B2B customers could not find the app in their VPP portal.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of exchanging emails with Apple Support personnel, we eventually figured out that we had not accepted the Paid Applications agreement or provided banking or tax information. As this was a free app, we didn't expect the need for those items. After supplying that information, the customer was finally able to see the app.\r\n\r\nIt would have been very helpful if, instead of showing \"Ready for Sale\", the app's status had indicated any reason that the app would not be available.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: N/A\r\n\r\nExpected Results: N/A\r\n\r\nActual Results: N/A\r\n\r\nRegression: N/A\r\n\r\nNotes:"
