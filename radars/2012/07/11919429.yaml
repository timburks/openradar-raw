    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWhen a user performs a long press gesture on an MKAnnotationView that has it's selected property set to NO, the annotation view switches to the selected state. However, if a user long presses on a selected annotation that has it's draggable property set to YES then they initiate a drag sequence. This is inconsistent and should be changed  as follows:\r\n\r\n1) A single tap gesture selects/deselects the annotation view\r\n2) A long press gesture on an annotation view always initiates a drag \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Open the stock Maps app on an iOS device\r\n2) Search for \"Cupertino, CA\"\r\n3) Tap away from the pin that appears to deselect it\r\n4) Perform a long press gesture on the pin\r\n\r\nThe annotation view is now selected, but the intent was to drag the annotation view. Works with MKAnnotationView and subclasses in MapKit this same way.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe annotation view would be in one of the active dragging states\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe annotation view was selected\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nNone"
