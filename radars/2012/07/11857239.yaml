    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nWithout any error or notice iOS Simulator stops launching apps, event the built-in ones. It looks similar to the situation on a real device when a provisioning profile expires — it just zooms in and aborts.\r\n\r\nXcode says “Running … on iPhone Simulator 5.1”. Then after 10-20 seconds relaunches the build process and hangs on “Attaching to …”. The stop button does not work, the only solution is to quit the simulator.\r\n\r\nThere is no output in the debugger.\r\n\r\nThe only solution to this problem is to create a new OS X user, move the code base to the new account and the simulator starts working again.\r\n\r\nI tried to “Reset Content and Settings…” and remove ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator. But no luck.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce: I don’t know how to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nNote: This has already happened once in a previous Xcode 4.3 build."
