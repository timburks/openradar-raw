    description: "Summary:\r\nCurrently there is no way to remove cheaters from high scores. In addition, there is nothing that deters cheaters.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that cheaters may be banned from highscore/achievements by a developer for their particular game.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we suggest that a player may be permanently flagged for cheating, and banned from all highscore lists.\r\n\r\nSuggested usage\r\n\r\n1. The developer discovers a cheater, for instance the player may have submitted a score that is impossible to reach.\r\n2. The developer logs in to itunesconnect and reviews the high score list and selects the particular player + score.\r\n3. The developer is given the choice to delete this score, or ban the player.\r\n\r\nA player who has received 3 bans in different games, will be permanently banned from participating in high scores and achievements. Their highscores will be invalidated for all games.\r\n\r\nVARIANT:\r\n\r\nUse so-called hell banning: The player sees their score at the correct position, but the score is hidden for all other players. A player who is permanently banned, has all their scores treated in this manner."
