    description: "06-Jul-2012 05:15 AM Hon Cheng Muh:\r\nSummary:\r\nUsing UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions, it is possible to grab a screenshot of MKMapView before iOS6. \r\nBut this method fails in iOS6 because MKMapView in iOS6 is done with OpenGL. Tried different methods to take screenshot for OpenGL instead but it was not working. Approach 2 Apple engineers at the MapKit lab at WWDC about the issue. One of the engineer told me that this is definitely a bug, and I should be able to just use UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions to take screenshots, and there is no need to use OpenGL methods. \r\nSpotted the issue in iOS6b1, continues in iOS6b2\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nUse UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions to grab a screenshot of a MKMapView\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nGet a image containing the map\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nA blank beige-colored image, with a small text label on the bottom left. \r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:"
