    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen the user tries to open multiple files with a single app, either by dragging them onto the app's Dock tile or by using the open(1) command, the application does not get told about all of the files and/or gets told about them in multiple batches.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. Drag dozens of files onto an application that can open files of those files' type(s).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe application opens all of the documents. Applications that specially handle batches, such as Preview, will do such handling upon the entire batch (Preview will open an entire batch of images in one window).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe application may not open all of the documents, having never been told about all of them, and/or may be told about some or all of the documents in multiple batches.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nYes, but I don't remember when it broke. It was either Snow Leopard or Lion.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nTest app attached. It can “open” any file, although all it does is log to the Console. Drag a few dozen files onto it in one batch and check the Console for its output.\r\n\r\nThe test app will log the path or array of paths that receives in each -application:openFile(s): message.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I dragged 31 files onto the application in a single drag, and got the following output:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n2012-07-11 02:19:37.730 OpeningFilesTest[14248:403] Told to open 9 files: (\r\n    [nine paths]\r\n)\r\n2012-07-11 02:19:38.216 OpeningFilesTest[14248:403] Told to open 1 files: (\r\n    [one path]\r\n)\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nThe application was never told about 21 of the dragged files."
