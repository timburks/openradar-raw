    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nTested on iOS 6 beta 1 and 2. After installing Mitt Romney's iPhone app, With Mitt, from the App Store and word-for-word asking Siri, \"Siri, give me a place within a mile that starts with an S.\" It opens the With Mitt app.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nDownload With Mitt from the App Store. Once it is finished downloading, hold the home button until Siri activates and beeps. Tell Siri word-for-word, \"\"Siri, give me a place within a mile that starts with an S.\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nSiri either finds a place within a mile that starts with an S and displays it to the user, or offers to search the web for one. The correct response can be seen by asking Siri a slightly different query, \"Siri, give me a place within a mile from here that starts with an S.\"\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nSiri is dismissed and Mitt Romney's iPhone app, called With Mitt, opens.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNew Siri features in iOS 6, specifically the ability to ask Siri to open apps. The feature works like this, if you activate Siri and say, \"Open Safari\", Siri will do so.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is quite strange. Can anyone explain this to me? My guess is that it is getting triggered by the \"within\" in the query matching the \"With\" in the name of the With Mitt app."
