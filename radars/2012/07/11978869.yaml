    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nA window's frame can only be set with full points. Setting a half-point value for the window's origin causes the next lowest integral value to be used. Setting a half-point value for the size causes the next highest integral value to be used.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create an NSWindow.\r\n2) Call -setFrame:display: using an NSRect with non-integral values.\r\n\r\n(See the attached sample application)\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nThe window's position should be set to non-integral values.\r\n\r\nIn the sample application running on a Retina display, the window's x origin should move one pixel and it's width should grow by one pixel.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nThe window's position is set to integral values.\r\n\r\nThe sample application's window origin does not change and it's size grows by two pixels.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nPrior to a Retina display, there was no need to align windows with non-integral values.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSetting the position to non-integral values is very useful if an application is using a secondary NSWindow as a callout/overlay for another NSWindow that contains high resolution imagery. The secondary window can't be aligned perfectly."
