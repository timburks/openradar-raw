    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nI created a simple app to display the artwork of the current playing song and it runs fine on the device when I Run in Xcode. When I try to profile the app with Xcode, the app launches but no artwork is displayed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a sample Single View app with Xcode 4.5 DP2.\r\n2. Add the following code to the view controller:\r\n\r\n    UIImageView *iv = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,768,768)];\r\n    \r\n    MPMusicPlayerController *player = [MPMusicPlayerController iPodMusicPlayer];\r\n    \r\n    MPMediaItem *item = [player nowPlayingItem];\r\n    \r\n    MPMediaItemArtwork *artwork = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork];\r\n    \r\n    iv.image = [artwork imageWithSize:CGSizeMake(500,500)];\r\n                      \r\n    [self.view addSubview:iv];\r\n\r\n3. Attempt to Profile using Xcode, and select Allocations when Instruments launches.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nArtwork of the current playing song should be displayed on the iPad. (iPad 3 64GB 4G, iOS 6 Beta 2)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nI just see the default white view filling the screen.\r\n\r\nI observed the same problem with iOS 6 beta 1 and Xcode 4.5 DP 1.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nArtwork *is* displayed on an iOS 5 iPad with Xcode 4.3.5.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2012 07:48 AM Ben Thomas:\r\n'ios6ProfileTest.zip' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n09-Jul-2012 07:49 AM Ben Thomas:\r\nNote that I have verified that music is playing at the time that I run the app."
