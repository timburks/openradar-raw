    description: "Xcode should check consistency of localized format strings\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nAdd some localizable strings to your project\r\nGet localized variants back\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nIf there are typos in localized strings that break the format strings so that they would be interpreted with a different number of format specifiers, Xcode should produce an error\r\nIf two different localization use different types for the same position (%1$s in one locale and %1$@ in another) Xcode should produce an error\r\nIf there are multiple format specifiers, the localized variants should all have positional specifiers (since some locales may reverse the order)\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nXcode blithely accepts localized strings pairs that may produce gibberish or may cause application crashes\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nOur basic implementation of this is at https://github.com/omnigroup/ValidateLocalizedFormatStrings, but a built-in Xcode version could be more complete and better integrated"
