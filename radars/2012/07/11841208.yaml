    description: "Summary:\r\nFinder will sometimes become unresponsive and need to be restarted after attempting to view certain Excel files using Quick Look.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nFind a complex excel file and attempt to preview its contents in finder by highlighting/selecting the file and clicking the quick look button, or tapping the space bar. The preview window will open, showing that work is progressing, but then hang. I have attached the excel file in question that is causing my system here to crash so that you can try to reproduce the problem. The file is called \"Excel Example for calculating estimated owners earnings.xlsx\"\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect the document to be rendered in Quick Look, and if it cannot because of corruption or incompatibility what have you, then Quick look should quickly revert to its default display for file types that aren't supported. In other words, simply show an icon of the file and its size. Perhaps an error message that the file could not be read or rendered for some reason. At least, don't hang and stop responding to the user.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nFinder gets stuck in some kind of loop and becomes unresponsive. It must eventually be killed by hitting <option><command><escape>, choosing Finder form the list, and relaunching. The Quick Look window becomes \"stuck\" on top of all other windows, so the computer essentially becomes useless until Finder is relaunched.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI have also attached a couple samples of the Finder process while it's stuck in the not responding state.\r\n\r\nI'm running OS X 10.7.4 according to the \"About This Mac\" page, and the Finder About page reports version \"10.7.3\" of that application."
