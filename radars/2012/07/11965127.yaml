    description: "It would be quite useful if Xcode's Behaviors feature was expanded such that opening a file of a certain type in an editor could trigger a custom Behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, opening a XIB file could trigger a behavior that shows the XIB editor in a new window, hides the debugger and shows the Utilities Navigator open to the Object Library.\r\n\r\nI could imagine the Behavior being limited to options such as \"Source File\", \"XIB File\", \"Core Data Model\", etc., but a general behavior for a user-specified file type would be ideal."
