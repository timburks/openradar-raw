    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen reordwering apps in folders to make more room for apps which cannot otherwise be accessed other than via spotlight search, the new space on the springboard is not used and filled up with apps which were not visible.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nInstall a lot of apps, i.e. so many that all springboard panels are filled up and than even some more apps.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nthe apps not fitting to the panels (only accessible via spotlight) should show up as soon as there is space on the panels(e.g. when some reorderiung took place which lead to some space.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nnothing happens. you need to RESTART the whole device to actually initiate the filling up of free spaces.\r\n\r\nthis sucks a lot!"
