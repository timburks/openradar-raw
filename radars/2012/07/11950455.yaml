    description: "24-Jul-2012 08:07 PM Stephen Heaps:\r\nSummary:\r\niMessage is a fantastic service, but a minor oversight causes many of us to leave it turned off. Many of us have small data plans of around 500MB, which is fine for sending text, and mild browsing. The problem with iMessage lies with those of us that pay for unlimited MMS, but not unlimited data. We wish to use iMessage, but we have to turn off iMessage each time we wish to send a picture, causing the service to be useless. A simple switch to send pictures/video as MMS with iMessage turned on solves this problem easily.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n0. Pay extra for unlimited MMS.\r\n1. Turn on iMessage.\r\n2. Send picture or video to another iMessage user.\r\n3. Repeat until excessive bill.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nA simple switch when iMessage is turned on to send pictures/videos as MMS.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPay extra for sending data (picture/video) through iMessage rather than through unlimited MMS plan.\r\nOften users are unaware that iMessage uses data rather than their unlimited MMS package.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\niPhone only (of course)."
