    description: "26-Jul-2012 08:57:\r\nSummary:\r\nBuilding any iOS project to Archive and then resigning with Organizer's \"Distribute...\" feature fails with Packaging Operation Failed.\r\n\r\nFurther background:\r\nI believe this is somehow related to radar://11973031\r\n\r\nI am a member of 4 developer teams (1 of which is an enterprise account).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open any iOS Xcode project\r\n2. Build + Run in simulator -> works fine. Build + Run on development device -> works fine. Build + Archive\r\n3. After build + archive, Organizer opens with Archives tab selected and newly archived build highlighted\r\n4. Click \"Distribute...\"\r\n5. Action sheet rolls down, select \"Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment\"\r\n6. Select a provosining profile that matches your code sign credentials and the app bundle identifier\r\n7. Click Next\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nAfter step 7...\r\n8. Save dialog box appears\r\n9. Happiness\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nAfter step 7...\r\n8. Receive error message `Packaging Operation Fails`\r\n9. Rage\r\n\r\nNothing is dumped into Console on failure\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nThis bug is avoidable if you select the provisioning profile in the target's build settings before build + archive. This workaround does not scale across a team of developers that are checking in / checking out xcodeproj files from SCM\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nScreen shots included of:\r\n- Code Sign drop-down selection box\r\n- Organizer's installed Provisioning Profiles\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2012 08:57 PM:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-07-27 at 8.38.01 AM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n26-Jul-2012 08:58 PM:\r\n'Screen Shot 2012-07-27 at 8.38.58 AM.png' was successfully uploaded\r\n\r\n03-Aug-2012 07:37 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
