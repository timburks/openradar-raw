    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen Karen speaks text, hyphen and dash pause lengths are opposite of what's expected. Hyphens should have a short pause and dashes should have a long pause.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSelect the following text, right-click, and select Speech -> Start Speaking.\r\n\r\nLast year, Wilco released The Whole Love, which meets at the sweet spot where impeccable craftsmanship meets rollicking showmanship. Its songs translate tremendously well in concert — listening to the seven-minute live-wire album-opener, \"Art of Almost,\" it's hard to imagine otherwise — which boded nicely for the career-spanning set Wilco performed at the 2012 Newport Folk Festival, recorded live on Friday, July 27 in Newport, R.I.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nLong pause for dashes (\"concert — listening\" and \"otherwise — which\"). Short pause for hyphen (\"career-spanning\").\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nShort pause for dashes (\"concert — listening\" and \"otherwise — which\"). Long pause for hyphen (\"career-spanning\").\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nWhen Alex speaks this text, the hyphen and dash pauses are the expected length.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe other hyphenated phrases (\"seven-minute\", \"live-wire\", \"album-opener\") are short with both voices."
