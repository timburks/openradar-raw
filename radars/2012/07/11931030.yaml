    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n- git clone https://github.com/apontious/reignOfError.git\r\n- Open iOS project \"Reign of Error\" in latest release Xcode, Xcode 4.3.3, on latest release version of OS, which is 10.7.4 Lion\r\n- Build and run in Simulator\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n- Application runs fine.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n- Application crashes because NSError returned from ErrorDocument subclass of UIDocument in loadFromContents:ofType:error: appears to be getting released in the frameworks, then used.\r\n\r\nHere's what I get from Instruments (I've added spaces to make the columns line up):\r\n\r\n#\tCategory\tEvent Type\tRefCt\tTimestamp\tSize\tResponsible Library\tResponsible Caller\r\n0\tNSError\tMalloc\t       1\t        00:01.592.995\t32\tFoundation\t        +[NSError errorWithDomain:code:userInfo:]\r\n1\tNSError\tAutorelease\t<null>\t00:01.593.005\t0\tFoundation\t        +[NSError errorWithDomain:code:userInfo:]\r\n2\tNSError\tRetain\t       2\t        00:01.593.009\t0\tReign of Error\t        -[ErrorDocument loadFromContents:ofType:error:]\r\n3\tNSError\tAutorelease\t<null>\t00:01.593.016\t0\tReign of Error\t        -[ErrorDocument loadFromContents:ofType:error:]\r\n4\tNSError\tRelease\t      1         \t00:01.593.023\t0\tGraphicsServices\tGSEventRunModal\r\n5\tNSError\tRelease\t      0\t                00:01.593.024\t0\tGraphicsServices\tGSEventRunModal\r\n6\tNSError\tZombie\t      -1\t        00:01.593.601\t0\tlibsystem_c.dylib\tstart_wqthread\r\n\r\nI may just be using the APIs wrong, but I thought you could just set an NSError** parameter to a newly-created NSError instance, and it would be retained/autoreleased to have a lifespan long enough for all its clients to use.\r\n\r\nThe only way to make it stick around long enough is if I keep my own strong reference around. There's a commented-out line in ErrorDocument which does just that, and it keeps it from crashing. But that seems like an unnecessary workaround.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n- I haven't tried this before, so I don't know if it's a regression from anything."
