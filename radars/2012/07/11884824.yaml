    description: "16-Jul-2012 04:18 PM Jon Stacey:\r\nSummary:\r\nThe gold master of Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), build 12A269) lacks the ability to show the time remaining on battery in the menu without explicitly clicking the menu.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSimply click on the battery icon in the menu. The menu will appear with an option to \"Show Percentage\", but there is no option to show the remaining time in hours/minutes.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nI expect an option that will allow me to show the remaining approximation of battery life in hours and minutes as was possible in previous version of OS X.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nThe menu will appear with an option to \"Show Percentage\", but there is no option to show the remaining time in hours/minutes.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nThis is a new issue as of 10.8. All previous version of OS X on this mid-2007 MacBook Pro have had this ability.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n17-Jul-2012 05:41 PM Apple Developer Bug Reporting Team :\r\nThis bug has been closed as Duplicate.
