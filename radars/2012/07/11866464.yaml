    description: "Summary:\r\nWhen setting up a proxy for a connection (testing for wired, wifi and vpn connections) the proxy port is formatted using the number formatting for the current locale. This results the port to be formated as 8,080 (for locale en-GB) and 8.080 (for locale nl-NL).\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nSet-up a proxy for a connection with a port number higher then or equal to 1000 (protocol doesn't matter).\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nPort doesn't get formatted and remains 8080 after saving and closing the preference pane.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nPort is formated using the current locale (8,080 when setting the locale to en-GB and 8.080 when setting the locale to nl-NL).\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nI can't remember this occurring in previous released ML builds.\r\n\r\nNotes:"
