    description: "Summary:\r\n\r\nUnlike the majority of source code difference viewers, Xcode displays new code on the left and the code in the repository on the right. This should be reversed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a project that's been in source control.\r\n2. Open a file.\r\n3. Switch to version editor.\r\n4. Try to make changes on the right.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\n\r\nYou should be able to.\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\n\r\nOops! It turns out in Xcode, the local file is on the left.\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI understand this is probably to make the view more like the assistant editors, where the primary editor is on the left. But I don't think this is a good reason.\r\n\r\nThe assistant editor vs. versions editor is a mode that I'm forced to select before editing the code.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure Apple thought people would get used to this and it would fly. I've been using Xcode 4 since it was first made available to people who didn't go to WWDC 2010, and this still confuses me. Please fix it."
