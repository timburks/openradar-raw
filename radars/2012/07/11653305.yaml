    description: "Summary:\r\nWhile trying to connect to some WiFi networks, an iPad(3rd Gen.) running iOS 5.1.1 or iOS 6.0 B1 is unable to connect. The activity indicator to the left of the SSID will keep on spinning until the screen is left or WiFi is turned off. The Wifi indicator on the status bar sometimes shows that it is connected, however Safari is unable to connect to a webpage and gives the error \"No Internet Connection\".\r\n\r\nRegression:\r\nOnly occurs on some WiFI networks away from the iPads \"home\" or \"usual\" network. The networks that the iPad was unable to connect to were password protected. The networks could be connected to on iOS 5.1 and 5.0 \r\n\r\n\r\nWIFI LOGS:\r\n\r\nAt 20:43 6/14/12 EDT, I turned WiFi off.\r\n\r\nAt 20:45, I turned wifi on and the device tried to connect to RICE FREE WIFI\r\n\r\nAt 20:46, I tapped \"Forget This Network\" and the attempt to connect was aborted.\r\n\r\nAt 20:47, I manually selected RICE FREE WIFI and entered the password.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a link on Dropbox to all the requested files: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/8nfqzbjb1ylmrqh/AhKAPxZol5\r\n\r\nClosed because duplicate of 11673536."
